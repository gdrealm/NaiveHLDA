Each part is essential to allow the building to be constructed. In addition the component parts need to be assembled in the correct order, and with the correct spatial arrangement, for the house to be strong and secure. Following this analogy, biofilms are communities of microbes (where the cells can be considered the bricks and roof tiles) that are surrounded by an extracellular matrix (the mortar) that provides structure. When living in the biofilm the microbes benefit and become resistant to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. This can result in the formation of chronic antibiotic resistant infections. We are interested in how a biofilm is built. The main component parts that are needed have been identified and in this proposal we aim to understand how they are assembled. Understanding how they are assembled will allow the development of novel strategies to block assembly in the natural environment and therefore guide future development of novel antimicrobial compounds for chronic debilitating biofilm infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019464/1","grantId":"BB/I019464/1","fundValue":"348071","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola  Stanley-Wall","coPersons":["Daan  Van Aalten"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Biofilms represent the predominant mode of microbial growth in the natural environment. Bacillus subtilis is a ubiquitous Gram-positive soil bacterium that functions as an effective plant growth-promoting agent when it forms biofilms on plant root surfaces. The biofilm matrix synthesized by B. subtilis is composed of an exopolysaccharide and an amyloid fiber-forming protein, TasA, and assembles with the aid of a small secreted protein called BslA. In this study we have shown that natively synthesized and secreted BslA forms surface layers around the biofilm. Biophysical analysis with collaborators demonstrates that BslA can self-assemble at interfaces, forming an elastic film. Molecular function is revealed from analysis of the crystal structure of BslA, which consists of an Ig-type fold with the addition of an unusual, extremely hydrophobic &quot;cap&quot; region. A combination of in vivo biofilm formation and in vitro biophysical analysis demonstrated that the central hydrophobic residues of the cap are essential to allow a hydrophobic, nonwetting biofilm to form as they control the surface activity of the BslA protein. In fact the hydrophobic cap of BslA exhibits physiochemical properties remarkably similar to the hydrophobic surface found in fungal hydrophobins; thus, BslA we have structurally defined the first bacterial hydrophobin. We suggest that biofilms formed by other species of bacteria may have evolved similar mechanisms to provide protection to the resident bacterial community.
