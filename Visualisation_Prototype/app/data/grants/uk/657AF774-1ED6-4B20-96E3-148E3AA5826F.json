{"id":"657AF774-1ED6-4B20-96E3-148E3AA5826F","title":"Mechanisms of Activin/Nodal signalling in pluripotency and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells","abstractText":"Stem cells are remarkable in having the capacity to undergo specialisation into distinct tissue types, such as blood or skin. In addition, many stem cells are capable of self-renewal during cell division, so that they not only generate a specialised cell but also generate another stem cell. Our bodies are thereby able to retain their tissue-specific stem cells (such as those responsible for generating blood or skin) for our entire lifetimes. Such adult stem cells are generally thought to generate only a few types of cells, related to the specific tissue that they are derived from and are responsible for maintaining. Another type of stem cell can be derived from early stages of human development, namely from surplus embryos that arise in the treatment of human infertility using in vitro fertilisation. Such spare embryos, donated under informed consent by patients who have completed their therapies, are capable of generating embryonic stem cells when grown in petri dish. These stem cells are particularly interesting because they appear to have the ability to specialise into all of the tissue types in the entire body. \n\nThe current proposal is to investigate the molecular details of how human embryonic stem cells maintain their pluripotency, and how the biochemical information that is responsible for starting their journey on the path to specialisation actually works.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600275","grantId":"G0600275","fundValue":"1225910","fundStart":"2007-02-12","fundEnd":"2012-02-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Arnold Pedersen","coPersons":["Stefano  Pluchino"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
