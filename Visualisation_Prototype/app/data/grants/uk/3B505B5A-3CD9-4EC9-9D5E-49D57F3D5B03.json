Significant progress has been made in defining metrics for more traditional KT activities and their delivery of Economic Development objectives, but measurement of Cultural Engagement activity and impact is lagging, due to the very different inputs, outputs and objectives. These proposed workshops would provide the forum to agree definitions of cultural engagement, explore alternative measures for cultural engagement activity, taking advantage of lessons learned and adapted from the original research and development process. Three deliveries of a Workshop will be held and a final report and advocacy document produced. The most important output will be recommended metrics common across a range of arts and humanities activities, with (potentially) some additional metrics peculiar to individual disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G001189/1","grantId":"AH/G001189/1","fundValue":"12383","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lesley  Richmond","coPersons":["Kevin Edward Cullen","Ewen  Smith","Susan  Ferguson"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
