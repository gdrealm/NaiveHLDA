The improved mobile-based supervision and training will link CHWs more closely to the local primary healthcare system so as they can be more effective in reducing poverty through improving the access of local communities to health care.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018619/1","grantId":"ES/J018619/1","fundValue":"417353","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Niall  Winters","coPersons":["Martin  Oliver","Peter  Ngatia"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
