Radiotherapy uses beams of X-rays to irradiate the tumour from many different directions. The effect is to kill the cancer by depositing as much radiation dose in the tumour as possible.\n\nProton therapy is a more precise form of radiotherapy that provides significant benefits over conventional X-ray radiotherapy. Protons lose energy - and therefore deposit their dose - in a much smaller region within the body, making the treatment much more precise: this leads to a more effective cancer treatment with a smaller chance of the cancer recurring. This is particularly important in the treatment of deep-lying tumours in the head, neck and central nervous system, particularly for children whose bodies are still developing and are particularly vulnerable to long-term radiation damage.\n\nIn 2011 the UK government announced funding for 2 full-sized proton therapy centres, to be based at University College Hospital in London and The Christie in Manchester. These will provide treatment for a much wider range of cancers, allowing more patients to be treated closer to home. Procurement for these centres began in 2013, with doors expected to open some time after 2018. Unlike the majority of proton therapy centres worldwide - particularly in the US - the 2 UK centres are publicly funded and will treat some of the most challenging cancers.\n\nIn order to treat such difficult cancers, extremely sophisticated imaging is needed to identify the cancer and spare the surrounding tissue. Traditional treatment planning with X-rays requires multiple CT scans to create a patient treatment plan and to monitor the size and position of the cancer during treatment. However, since protons are much more precise than X-rays, the quality of the imaging must also be that much better. In addition, X-ray CT images don't provide information on how protons lose energy, so a conversion factor has to be used to estimate how the dose will be delivered with protons rather than X-rays. Also, in existing proton therapy centres CT scans are not taken with the patient in position and ready for treatment, since it's very difficult to squeeze the imaging equipment around the proton delivery nozzle. When the patient moves the shape of their body changes, making the treatment plan less accurate.\n\nAn alternative is to use higher energy protons to image the patient while the patient is sitting in position ready for treatment. The energy of the protons is increased so that they penetrate right through the body: by tracking the protons before and after the patient and measuring their energy, it's possible to reconstruct an image of the tumour and the surrounding tissue with the patient in the right position, that also tells you how much dose the protons will deposit during treatment. This system is called proton CT.\n\nIn order to create a proton CT image, you need a very accurate measurement of the proton energy when it leaves the body. This project is looking at modifying a particular type of energy detector, called a calorimeter, to measure the energy of protons in a proton CT system. The calorimeter was developed for the SuperNEMO experiment to measure high energy electrons but it can also measure proton energies very accurately. In addition, it can also measure the energy of the proton beam that is used for treatment. This detector will also be used to check the energy of the proton beam at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre that uses lower energy protons to treat eye tumours. Clatterbridge is the only hospital of its kind in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000508/1","grantId":"ST/M000508/1","fundValue":"49531","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Jolly","coPersons":["Ruben  Saakyan","David Simon Waters"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
