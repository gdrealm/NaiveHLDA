The normal job of the immune system is to fight off infection, but in someone who has had a transplant it also tries to attack and destroy the transplant through the process known as rejection. To stop rejection, transplant recipients have to take a mixture of immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit the immune system. The doctors who take care of transplant recipients use their experience to perform a balancing act and get the amount of immunosuppression taken by each recipient just right, as taking too much can prevent the immune system from working altogether increasing the risk of infection; while taking too little increases the risk the transplant being lost to rejection. New and improved immunosuppressive drugs are required to enable transplants to survive for longer and to reduce the side effects experienced by transplant patients who have to take the drugs that are currently availability. This project will develop new models for use in transplantation research that will enable the discovery and development of novel therapies. If we are successful our research will speed up the introduction of new therapies into clinical transplantation and will have a major benefit for transplant recipients enabling them to have a functioning transplant for much longer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800842","grantId":"G0800842","fundValue":"377618","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathryn  Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
