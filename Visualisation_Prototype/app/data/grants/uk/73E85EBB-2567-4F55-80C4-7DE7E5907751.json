One related to human capital the other, absorptive capacity. The findings have significant implications for SME managers which this impact grant seeks to address.\n<br />The main focus of the dissemination is aimed at intermediaries, universities, further education colleges and private sector providers in the North of England specialising in enterprise. By becoming more aware of the findings of our research we aim to help them to embed in practice the various ways they can help managers create ‘strategic space’. This awareness raising will extend to pedagogical elements of education programmes that will enable providers to better connect with the smaller firm. To undertake the main elements of the grant, we aim to connect to key members of each of the communities identified above; produce a number of tools to be used by management developers and intermediaries and based on our research, to stimulate thought and discussion with the aim of raising performance. We will also produce a number of case studies of good practice more generally.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0056","grantId":"RES-172-25-0056","fundValue":"32227","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of the research have been used to give partner institutions within the Northern Leadership Academy Network materials based on the findings of the Evolution of Business Knowledge in SMEs project (RES-334-25-0015) Education Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Richard  Thorpe","coPersons":["Ossie  Jones","Allan  Macpherson"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" We have distributed 'principles' of good practice related to knowledge acquisition and the development of small and medium sized enterprises.
