With a simple change of membrane material, this simple sensor will also measure the concentration of inhalational anaesthetic agents, as well as the life-support oxygen concentration, in gas mixtures delivered to patients from conventional anaesthetic machines. This new sensor work builds on a sound foundation of research gained during a 3-year project grant funded by the EPSRC. The proof of concept sensor design will be show-cased and demonstrated to various UK commercial sensor manufacturers during the project 12month period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502938/1","grantId":"EP/E502938/1","fundValue":"88686","fundStart":"2006-11-11","fundEnd":"2007-11-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Clive  Edward Winston  Hahn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" This short one-year project was very successful and demonstrated, for the first time, that a gold microarray sensor could successfully measure oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations simultaneously. The device was going to be exploited by Abington Partners Ltd and by a CASE student award, but the commercial partner encountered cash-flow difficulties, caused by the recessioon, and any further development of the new sensor was ababdoned.
