Optical clocks are capable of better\nstability and lower uncertainty than the current standard of time; however, each clock requires a range of lasers with\ndemanding requirements specific to the atomic species at the heart of the clock. Neutral strontium is one of the most\nwidely used atoms. It has a key transition that must be addressed using a laser source with emission wavelength at 461nm,\npower &gt;1W and linewidth (spectral purity) &lt;32MHz. Currently researchers must use expensive or inadequate laser\nsources to meet these requirements. In this project we will meet all the above requirements of neutral strontium in a low\ncost, compact system based on semiconductor disk laser (SDL) technology. The advantageous properties of SDLs for\ntunable, narrow linewidth operation have previously been demonstrated in the laboratory; however, their potential to\naddress wavelengths of interest for optical clocks, and moreover to achieve this in a compact commercial format, have yet\nto be realised. We will engineer a stabilised, narrow linewidth 922nm SDL with frequency doubling to 461nm within the\ncost and volume parameters required for strontium optical clock-based systems to emerge from the research laboratory\nand address applications in the field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508287/1","grantId":"EP/M508287/1","fundValue":"15313","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Hastie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
