{"id":"A9EE88BA-F09D-4797-A5A3-32BAA26B5F9D","title":"Promoting participation and engagement in post-compulsory mathematics education for STEM","abstractText":"<p>This project will synthesise findings from three previous ESRC funded projects undertaken by researchers in mathematics education at the University of Manchester. These projects investigated students’ engagement with, and dispositions towards, mathematics in and across programmes from compulsory school, through college to Higher Education. This research recognised the crucial role that mathematics plays in underpinning careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and students’ potential trajectories in STEM were explored.<br /><br />This project team will work directly in partnership with the HE National STEM Centre, National STEM Centre (schools) and National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics (NCETM) to use the results of their research to make significant impact on both policy and practitioner audiences. This will be achieved using a range of dissemination channels with case studies, briefing documents, videos etc. developed from the outcomes of the previous research. Policy briefings will be developed with the intention of informing policy advisory groups (for example, ACME and SCORE). Practitioners in-the-field will be advised of practices that take account of the diversity of students’ needs, motivations and aspirations and which have been identified as having the potential of increasing participation in mathematics for STEM.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0235","grantId":"RES-189-25-0235","fundValue":"99517","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey David Wake","coPersons":["Julian  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
