They are composed of an inner lining of endothelial cells surrounded by one or two layers of muscle cells that are able to contract or relax to regulate resistance to flow in the tissues. We have identified the expression of genes encoding proteins called TRP channels in arterioles that may promote narrowing of these vessels in response to increased blood pressure, so that flow is little affected. This work will define the normal cellular distribution and function of specific TRP channels in arterioles and should provide a basis for future studies investigating the disruption of blood flow in disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I026359/1","grantId":"BB/I026359/1","fundValue":"661308","fundStart":"2012-05-28","fundEnd":"2017-05-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Curtis","coPersons":["James Graham McGeown","Alexander  Zholos"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" Autoregulation of blood flow refers to the ability of the vascular beds to maintain relatively uniform levels of blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. This protects capillaries from excessive pressure and ensures that oxygen delivery and waste product removal are kept constant. In many vascular beds, this is known to be a major function of arterioles – microscopic blood vessels, around 20-40 micrometres in diameter, consisting of an endothelial lining surrounded by a couple of layers of muscle cells that contract or relax to regulate blood flow.\n\nThe myogenic response is considered to be a primary mechanism underlying the autoregulation of blood flow. By definition, the myogenic response is the contraction of a blood vessel that occurs when blood pressure is elevated and, conversely, the dilation that follows a reduction in pressure. Previous studies have shown that the myogenic response depends primarily on the reaction of the muscle cells in the vessel wall and not on the endothelial cells or surrounding nerve fibres. Despite its importance in blood flow autoregulation, little is currently known about the precise mechanisms underlying the myogenic response. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms responsible for the myogenic response and thus blood flow autoregulation requires an appreciation of the mechanisms through which the muscle cells sense and respond to changes in blood pressure. One hypothesis suggests that the cells express stretch-activated ion channels, which cause membrane depolarisation and an increase in voltage dependent calcium influx, leading to contraction. While experimental evidence is consistent with this, the identity of the trigger channels is currently unknown – transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are potential candidates for this role. TRP channels form a family of nearly 30 members, most widely known for their role in the sensing of smell, vision, taste and touch. Importantly, they are thought to share general mechanosensory properties, and activate in response to cell membrane stretching. TRP channels TRPC6 and TRPM4 have been shown to be involved in the constriction of large cerebral arteries, but to date there have been no studies considering the role of TRP channels in mediating myogenic responses and blood flow autoregulation at the level of the microcirculation. As mentioned above, this is important because it is the small arterioles that are principally involved in controlling blood flow through the capillary beds of the body.\n\nOver the past two years, we have undertaken a range of laboratory-based ex vivo studies to analyse the contribution of candidate TRP channels to stretch-activated cation currents and myogenic vasoregulation in the rat retina. Thus far, this work has shown that the channel TRPV2 is strongly expressed on the muscle cells of retinal arterioles, is functionally activated by stretching of the muscle cell membrane, and contributes to myogenic responses in these vessels. Our ongoing studies are currently seeking to define the role of these channels in the control of blood flow autoregulation in the intact retina in vivo.\n\n\nTo date, the work from this project has been presented at a number of national and international scientific conferences and through several public engagement and communication activities, including a recent article in International Innovation (Healthcare Edition), one of the leading journals for public dissemination of medical and healthcare research globally. Basic research of the nature described in the present application is critical in fostering the vitality of the UK's knowledge-based economy and the growth of highly-skilled jobs. \n\nIn the long-term the work has the potential to improve public health and quality of life through the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The impairment of myogenic tone and blood flow autoregulation has been implicated in vascular dysfunction associated with several disease states, including systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and stroke. A better understanding of the molecular basis of the myogenic response could therefore be of considerable relevance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the future treatment of such conditions. \n\nResearchers in other disciplines will also benefit from knowledge gained through this project, most notably those interested in the functional role of TRP channels in regulating normal physiological processes. Because we plan to develop up to two different TRP channel knockout rat models we will be providing important new tools for researchers working within the TRP channel field. It is expected that major research findings will extend our existing knowledge of circulatory physiology and hence may be integrated into relevant taught courses in future years.\n\nThe wider public and third sector organisations will also directly benefit from this research through several ongoing and planned community engagement initiatives. Over the past 2 years, we have supported a variety of outreach and public engagement activities that continue to be an integral part of this BBSRC project. This includes the provision of work study placements, public talks, charity work and writing articles for public dissemination of our research findings. In addition, the postdoctoral fellow employed on this project, Dr Mary McGahon, currently participates within the STEMNET programme as a STEM ambassador. This scheme aims to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics to school children to encourage them to consider careers in these areas.
