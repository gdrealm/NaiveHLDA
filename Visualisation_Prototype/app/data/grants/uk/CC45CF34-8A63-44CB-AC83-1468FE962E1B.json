Prior to cardiac arrest alternating changes on the surface heart tracing (ECG) occur which are thought to arise from fluctuations in the electrical activity on the outside of the heart. These fluctuations are initially in synch with one another (concordant alternans) and then become out of synch (discordant alternans) before degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF). Although animal studies have demonstrated this, it has not been possible to study these events in man. We have developed a unique strategy to investigate these changes in patients undergoing open heart surgery. Using data from these measurements we will be able to better understand how and why dangerous rhythms develop. This will lead to improvements in identifying people at the greatest risk of sudden death and allow us to create computer models of electrical activity in the heart. This will aid the development of new treatments in these patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901819","grantId":"G0901819","fundValue":"803248","fundStart":"2010-05-24","fundEnd":"2014-02-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pier  Lambiase","coPersons":["Peter  Taggart","Ben Mark Hanson","Mark R.
