Their use of subordinates will also be tested through the elicitation of narratives. </li>\n\n <li>In phase 2 the children will be divided into two groups: the experimental group will be exposed to narratives containing a high proportion of subordinate clauses; the control group will listen to narratives with a high ratio of coordinate clauses.</li>\n\n <li>In the third and final phase the children will be tested again to evaluate whether the experimental group benefitted from the intensive exposure to subordinate clauses. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The hypothesis is that there should be a significant increase over time in the experimental group, but not in the control group. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H005021/1","grantId":"ES/H005021/1","fundValue":"78657","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ludovica  Serratrice","coPersons":["Anne  Hesketh"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
