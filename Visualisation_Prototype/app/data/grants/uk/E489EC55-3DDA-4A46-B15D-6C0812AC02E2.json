Metal-oxygen batteries have theoretical energy densities up to 10 times that of the state-of-the-art Li-ion battery technology. The goal of this proposal is to enable the uptake of this technology by fully understanding the reduction and oxidation pathways taking place in alkali metal-oxygen batteries.\n\nIn situ electrochemical Raman is a surface sensitive technique which is able to follow at the molecular level these pathways in various Li+ containing non-aqueous solvents and also ionic liquids. What sets this work apart is that oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction will be investigated with Raman on multiple substrates, not just on Au, but also transition metal oxide catalysts, such as manganese dioxide (MnO2), noble metal catalysts, such as Pt and on practical electrode materials, such as carbon. The work will go further in the characterisation of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution in the presence of other alkali metal cations (Na+ and K+) that also offer great gains in energy density as metal-O2 cells over Li-ion. These elements are much more abundant than lithium and therefore would offer a more sustainable energy storage solution for even beyond the long-term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J020265/1","grantId":"EP/J020265/1","fundValue":"100645","fundStart":"2012-06-14","fundEnd":"2014-06-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurence James  Hardwick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
