When we sleep, however, our perception is significantly diminished. But why? As this simple example, we can perceive exactly same sounds differently depending on our behavioural conditions (e.g., wakefulness vs sleep). But we really don't know exactly how this happens in our brain.\n\nThe key is an &quot;internal state&quot; of our brain. Intriguingly, even when we sleep, our brain is still active: our brain is never at rest. But the pattern of brain activity during sleep is different from it in paying attention to sounds. Thus, such &quot;brain states&quot; must be a key to solve the mystery. Our proposed research concerns how our brain processes sounds depending on different brain states.\n\nWe will study this at cellular resolution. The neocortex is the brain structure that is highly evolved in the mammals, in particular humans. While millions of neurons are communicating each other, there are many different types of neurons, like our social networks. In the neocortex, neurons form an organised layer structure and in every single layer there are different types of neurons. One of the biggest mysteries in contemporary brain sciences is why they are so diverse. Our proposed research also concerns such neuronal diversity.\n\nGiven these two contexts (brain states and neuronal diversity), we will ask how different brain states affect auditory processing in a part of the neocortex, called auditory cortex, and how diverse neurons process sound signals differently. We will address these questions, combining two advanced technologies (called massively parallel neural recording and optogenetics).\n \nOur proposed research will advance our understanding of how we (do not) hear sounds and how the brain works. These efforts will eventually create new opportunities to develop the treatment of hearing disorders and brain diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K016830/1","grantId":"BB/K016830/1","fundValue":"310058","fundStart":"2013-08-19","fundEnd":"2016-08-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Shuzo  Sakata","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
