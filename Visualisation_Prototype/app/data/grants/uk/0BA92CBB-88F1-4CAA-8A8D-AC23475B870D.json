{"id":"0BA92CBB-88F1-4CAA-8A8D-AC23475B870D","title":"Data4Sustain - integration of data to facilitate renewable energy technology use within urban environments","abstractText":"This project is a feasibility study for a web-map-service for assessing the suitability of various renewable energy technologies at a given geographical location. The project is a partnership between Land Quality Management Ltd, British Geological Survey, University of Nottingham, Nottingham Energy Partnership and Derby City Council. The project will produce an interactive web-based decision support tool that automatically integrates a range of above and below ground data sources (e.g. geology, soil and wind speed). The feasibility study will also refine the business model of the project in order move it forward to industrial research and development and commercialisation. The product will enable end users to decide which renewable energy technologies might be suitable for a particular site, including underused brownfields. Key benefits of the project will include a new web-map-service prototype ready for further research and development, improvements to the uptake of renewable energy technologies, potential reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and improved business competitiveness for the partners involved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N00731X/1","grantId":"NE/N00731X/1","fundValue":"28407","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Terry  Moore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
