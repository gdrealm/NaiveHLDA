One of the project outcomes was a refereed journal article (Brown et al 2012) that employed Canonical Typology (CT) to define periphrasis precisely. CT is a new method for comparing constructions and categories across languages and is a step forward in addressing the issue of data comparability (the Correspondence Problem). \n\nThe application of CT has allowed us to achieve impact in the description of endangered and less well documented languages to preserve information about linguistic culture for future generations. More specifically, our consultation with Professor Irina Nikolaeva, a specialist on Samoyedic languages, prompted the documentation of two severely endangered languages (Enets and Nganasan) and one less badly endangered: Nenets. The CT method allowed us to formulate questions, relying on the criteria established for canonical periphrasis. This resulted in our obtaining previously unknown data. \n\nThe CT method has prompted interest from those working in language learning technologies. Following a course given by Corbett at the Linguistic Institute at Boulder, there was interest in Canonical Typology from Rosetta Stone. A presentation on Canonical Typology was given at Rosetta Stone on 9 September 2011, by Danny Hieber (Associate Researcher). \n\nIn addition to impacts connected directly with the application of the CT method, community development work has also been carried out. Our work on the Nakh-Daghestanian language Archi, an important language for the project, made a significant contribution to the community development. In 2004-2007 the research team had played a major role in the development of a practical orthography for the Archi language, taking account of the relevant theoretical issues, and complying with the needs of the community, who wanted a Cyrillic-based system. In this project our consultants made use of the new practical orthography, and this is an important step towards wider propagation of this writing system within the community as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the direct benefits derived from applying methods from linguistic typology and theory, the Archi community also benefited from the use of modern technologies. In particular, our consultants learnt how to use word processing software and audio editing software (Sound Forge).

The project contributes to our understanding of its nature, in particular by investigating the ways periphrasis 'splits' lexemes and the intersecting factors (both morphomic and external) that influence the splits (see Corbett 2013).\n\no interaction between syntax and morphology\n\nPeriphrasis is simultaneously a morphological and a syntactic notion and this dichotomy is elucidated by the Canonical Typology approach. In Brown, Chumakina, Corbett, Popova and Spencer 2012) we establish morphological and syntactic criteria for defining periphrasis. These criteria were also used for the analysis of the 19 languages in our database (4 case studies plus 15 typological sample). In particular, they were employed in the analysis of Archi (Chumakina 2013), one of our case studies, which has a rich inventory of multiword constructions. Our criteria were employed to analyze these multiword constructions, showing that, of all of them, periphrastic constructions allow the highest degree of syntactic freedom. We also established a morphological distinction: only periphrastic constructions correlate with the formation of non-finite predicates. These aspects of behaviour of Archi predicates have not been documented before; they are the result of fieldwork done within the project. \n\nPeriphrasis interacts in non-trivial ways with the morphological and syntactic systems of the language it is found in. An exciting finding was the behaviour of the negative auxiliary in Nenets: it is sensitive to the conjugation type of the lexical verb. Nenets verbs fall into four inflectional types, only partly determined by the verb semantics, and the behaviour of the negative auxiliary represents an instance where non-functional distinctions play a role in syntax. \n\no the possible sizes and shapes of inflectional paradigms\n\nOf the defining criteria for periphrastic constructions one of the least controversial is feature intersection. This requires that a periphrastic expression must fill a cell in an otherwise synthetic paradigm established as the result of the intersection of two morphosyntactic features, such as person and number. The typological investigation of periphrasis showed, however, that the widely known instances of verbal periphrasis very rarely conform to this criterion: expressing a morphosemantic feature, verbal periphrasis creates its own subparadigm (for example, of a particular aspect). An interesting exception is Burushaski, a language isolate of Pakistan, where periphrasis is used to express person-number distinctions which are realised synthetically in other cells of the paradigm.\n\nInvestigating the typological variation of periphrasis (see research objectives), the most interesting finding concerns periphrasis in nominal systems: starting from Nenets, we confirmed periphrastic case there, then established it in other Samoyedic languages, Enets and Nganasan, also in Romanian, and less canonical instances of it in Armenian (Chumakina 2011). \n\nFinally the typological and the diachronic sides of the project converge in the interesting and rare situation in Dalabon, with object agreement on the verb, and its emergence accords with the tendency observed for other languages in the family to have this type of agreement. (Evans 2013). (1) Documentation\n\nOur consultation with Professor Irina Nikolaeva, a specialist on Samoyedic languages, prompted the documentation of two severely endangered languages (Enets and Nganasan) and one less badly endangered: Nenets. A set of questions was formulated according to the criteria established for canonical periphrasis, which resulted in our obtaining previously unknown data. \n\n(2) Community development\n\nDuring this project our Archi consultants used the new practical orthography developed for Archi by SMG and its collaborators in 2004-2007. Also, the work on periphrasis prompted the usage of modern technology in the Archi community: our consultants learnt how to use Microsoft Word and the Sound Forge software. \n\n(3) Language learning\n\nFollowing the course at the Linguistic Institute at Boulder, there was interest in Canonical Typology from Rosetta Stone. A presentation on Canonical Typology was given at Rosetta Stone on 9 September 2011, by Danny Hieber (Associate Researcher). Impacts were achieved in eight ways:\n\n1. Invited talks: we presented results by invitation, including University of Edinburgh (12/2010), University of Maryland (5/2010), International Conference on Lexis and Grammar, Belgrade (9/2010), University of Coimbra (10/2010), and Soci?t? de Linguistique de Paris (12/2010).\n\n2. Conference papers: we gave an additional ten conference presentations on material from the project, and a further 25 combining periphrasis with other morphological phenomena. \n\n3. Language tutorial for the Linguistics Association of GB: at the Essex meeting (9/2008) we gave two evening sessions on Archi. \n\n4. Course at LSA institute (University of Colorado, July 2011): this course of eight lectures was on Canonical Typology, a spin-off from the project; it included material on periphrasis from the project. \n\n5. Dissemination conference: held at Surrey in June 2010, with papers by the project members, the project consultants, and others on the basis of anonymous abstracts. It was a great success, and led to a volume of papers (see 7 below).\n\n6. Online database: this will remain as a permanent resource, available online from the SMG website, with systematic information on periphrasis in a range of genetically and geographically different languages. \n\n7. Volume on periphrasis: this contains the main papers from the project (analyses of periphrasis in the four key languages), together with a selection of papers from the dissemination conference. It has been accepted for publication by the British Academy/Oxford University Press. \n\n8. Other publications: we have thirteen publications relating to the project, either published or accepted for publication.
