Normally soluble proteins become sticky and begin to clump together forming aggregates called amyloid. This clumping process causes damage to the tissues within the body, for example the death of brain cells in Alzheimer s disease resulting in memory loss and ultimately dementia. We are proposing to produce molecules that in the long term could be used by doctors to screen for the presence of amyloid, allowing early detection and possibly even treatment of these devastating diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900958","grantId":"G0900958","fundValue":"965436","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter George Stockley","coPersons":["Dominic  Walsh","Sheena E Radford","David  Bunka"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
