{"id":"D9BD4373-B299-4188-BD89-ED5A998AD4E9","title":"UFORIC: Ultra-Fast Optical Routing including Impairment Constraints","abstractText":"The research to be undertaken within UFORIC proposes an ultra-fast control plane concept that relies on using a hardware-based protocol to route information across an all-optical switched network. Since a signal traversing through an all-optical network acquires optical impairments along the transmission links and the switching nodes, the concept will develop a concept that allows a path to be chosen that minimises particluar optical impairments and guarantees an acceptal level of degradation (= bit-error rate). Essentially, the UFORIC control plane will simultaneously find a path through the network that satifies both the bandwidth and optical performance requirements of a requesting service. Since the majority of the processing is done at very high speed within a field programmable gate array (FPGA), this will be many orders of magnitude faster than can be achieved using today's software-based solutions. This is essential for optical packet- and burst-switched networking concepts of the future. The trade-off, however, will be the accuracy in the choice of paths and this will be determined within the scope of the project. The UFORIC control plane will be integrated into an all-optical research network testbed to demonstrate its operation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D062500/1","grantId":"EP/D062500/1","fundValue":"210378","fundStart":"2006-11-20","fundEnd":"2009-11-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"K  Guild","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
