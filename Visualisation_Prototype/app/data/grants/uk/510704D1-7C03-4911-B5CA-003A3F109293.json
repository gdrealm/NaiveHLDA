The aim of this project is to identify what helps people to live well or makes it difficult to live well in the context of having dementia or caring for a person with dementia, and to understand what ‘living well’ means from the perspective of people with dementia and carers.</p>\n\n<p>Over a two-year period, 1500 people with early-stage dementia from all areas of the UK will be recruited to the study, together with a carer wherever possible. All the participants will be visited at home initially and again 12 months and 24 months later. This will provide information about the way in which social capitals, assets and resources, the challenges posed by dementia, and the ways in which people adjust and cope affect well-being, life satisfaction and quality of life. A smaller group will be interviewed in more depth.</p>\n\n<p>The findings will lead to recommendations about what can be done by individuals, communities, health and social care practitioners, care providers and policy-makers to improve the likelihood of living well with dementia.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001853/1","grantId":"ES/L001853/1","fundValue":"4148520","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda  Clare","coPersons":["Jeanette Margaret Thom","Catherine  Quinn","Sharon  Nelis","James  Pickett","Michael  Kopelman","Anthony  Martyr","Nada  Savitch","Jennifer Mary Rusted","Christina  Victor","Rhiannon  Whitaker","Martin Richard Knapp","Robin G.
