{"id":"EBB2931C-7E59-49B8-B789-59D9335F35DE","title":"Mathematics for Vast Digital Resources","abstractText":"British society, economy and government are becoming digital at staggering speeds. Individuals use the Internet to shop for books, houses and employment, search for information, share resources and group into social networks. Government wants to provide better and faster services to citizens and companies, cut costs and identify tax evaders. Much of business has moved online in the form of digital stores, service portals and targeted advertisements, breaking the physical barrier of distance between parties interested in a particular kind of interchange. Entering a future digital era provides many opportunities which, if seized properly, have a strong potential to boost economic growth and improve the quality of life. Researchers are facing the challenge of developing the tools necessary to make the best use of these opportunities. In this project we will develop new methodologies addressing the challenges and utilizing the opportunities arising from increasing vastness -in size and accessibility -of digital resources . We will analyze mathematical properties of these problems, design novel techniques to exploit their structure, implement them into efficient algorithms, and collaborate with industrial partners and digital economy hubs to ensure impact. Size: Technological breakthroughs in mankind's ability to produce and store huge amounts of data create an unprecedented challenge: a new science is needed for organizing, optimizing and interpreting data coming from new sources like the Internet, commercial databases, scientific experiments and government records. Hospitals, research labs, transportation companies, retailers and businesses produce more raw data than current technology is able to utilize effectively. Moreover, it seems that this trend will continue at an exponential rate. For the problems in this category we will develop new ground-breaking operational research techniques requiring us to reach the depths of several disciplines, merging insights from numerical optimization, machine learning and software development.Accessibility: Due to the vast accessibility of digital resources, portals connecting suppliers of a certain service with potential customers are becoming extremely popular. There are websites specializing in employment (Jobs.ac.uk), housing (Lettingweb.com), as well as contact points facilitating general exchange (Gumtree.com, Craigslist.org). The need to manage the customer portfolios of these portals for optimal user experience uncovers many fundamental mathematical challenges. Since the existing literature does not address these new problems appropriately, a careful study of these systems has the potential to improve user experience substantially. We will construct and analyze mathematical models of such systems using techniques at the interface of modern queueing theory and optimization.In summary, we will develop new operational research techniques which: (i) are capable of dealing with the unprecedented scale of modern digital resources, and (ii) will upgrade the access management to these new resources. Our goal is to gain new mathematical insights into the underlying problems in digital economy and provide the industry and the society with new tools to address these problems appropriately to meet public's expectations over the next decade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I017127/1","grantId":"EP/I017127/1","fundValue":"517011","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The key research results of the project are documented\nin several papers.

A specialized variant of the method\nfor compressed sensing problems [1] has been demonstrated to deliver\nthe reliability which cannot be matched by any state-of-the-art\nfirst order method. A more general framework to employ the second\norder information when solving large signal/image processing problems\nor machine learning problems [S2,S5] has been developed.\n\n?3.4 Accelerated Gradient Methods for Huge Scale Optimization\n\n?3.5 Sparsity Inducing Optimization\n\nPapers [C1,C2,6-7] and [S3,S4,S6-S14] are relevant to $3.4 + $3.5.\nWe have gone well beyond what we promised in 3.4 and 3.5.\nDeveloped the theory of coordinate descent as randomized decomposition\nfor dealing with big data. The theory and computational results are\nconsidered state of the art (e.g., [5] now has 100+ citations, [S8] has\n50+ citations).\n\n?4 PROGRAMME: DEALING WITH ACCESSIBILITY\n\nWe have introduced a new model called &quot;probabilistic matching systems&quot;\nwhich are useful in modelling accessibility problems in web-based\nportals such as employment systems, matrimonial and dating sites.\nAs promised, we first studied the stability of these systems and\npaper and developed policies to ensure user satisfaction.\nWe also proposed 2 different approximating models to analyze\ncomplex questions about these systems under heavy traffic.\nWe also worked on pricing of probabilistic systems to maximise\nthe revenue generated. We first employed optimal control methods\nto derive an asymptotically optimal pricing policies.\nThen, we derived pricing policies based on accepting or rejecting\nthe users using an exact analysis. We are currently preparing\ntwo papers for submission on these results.\n\nPapers Published\n\n[1] K. Fountoulakis, J. Gondzio, P.
