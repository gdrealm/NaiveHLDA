Accordingly our project has attracted much interest among teachers and teacher educators. This is evidenced by the many invitations we have had to present our findings to practitioners as well as the general public, and by the broad audience of professionals our project conference attracted. Additionally, the film we produced demonstrating good practice in teaching foreign languages to young children has been used in a wide range of settings. One of the directors (Mitchell) has also participated by invitation in consultations on UK primary languages policy with DFE and government ministers. UK policy on this issue is currently in flux and it is premature to evaluate the practical effect our intensive programme of dissemination activities will have in the future; all we can say at this stage is that practitioner communities have been extremely interested in hearing our findings, and in discussing their policy implications, given the relative dearth of empirical research investigating how children of different ages learn foreign languages in the UK context. Our findings have the potential to inform policy and practice in this area, and we are striving to disseminate them as widely as possible.

The same French teacher provided similar teaching to Year 1, Year 3 and year 7 groups in two state schools. All lessons were video-recorded and children were tested on various linguistic measures mid project, at the end of the project and two months after the end. Children's English literacy scores were recorded and their working memory measured. Additionally, focus groups and one-to-one interviews took place , to document children's motivation for learning French and their language learning strategies.\nThe data was analysed for the development of vocabulary and grammar, the role of gestures in facilitating language learning, and children's attitudes, motivation and learning strategies, as well as links between linguistic development, working memory and English literacy.\nIn summary, the findings show:\n- Receptive vocabulary: there is little difference between the groups, although how recently a word has been heard is more important for the younger children. Frequency in the input is the single most important factor for vocabulary learning.\n- Grammar: older children have a clear advantage\n- Good working memory and good English literacy support classroom language learning\n- The older children make use of a wider range of cognitive strategies to aid learning\n- The younger children are very enthusiastic and intrinsically motivated (learning French is fun)\nThe differences found in children's approach to learning at different ages have important implications for early foreign language learning curriculum development and policy. The audiences targeted by this project include teachers, teacher trainers, education specialists and policy makers. To date we can comment with confidence on the interest the work has generated and the enthusiastic feedback we have received. The current state of policy uncertainty regarding primary languages in UK schools has inevitably restricted immediate impact. However we are sustaining our links with teachers professional associations and teacher educators, and expect that as the policy situation becomes clearer our ongoing promotion of the research through teacher-friendly outputs (such as the film and future teacher-friendly versions of the FLLOC website) will build impact in the longer term.
