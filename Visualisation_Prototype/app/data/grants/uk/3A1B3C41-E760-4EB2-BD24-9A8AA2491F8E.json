Advanced materials are a key driver of technological innovation, with widespread benefits for both science and society. In this project, we aim to refresh four facilities with impact across Physics, Electronics, Chemistry and Biology in order to enhance our capability in this area, with maximum usage across the University of York and beyond. We will install new physical and chemical characterisation systems to support a range of challenging new applications, for example, state of the art thin film growth capabilities, and biologically-inspired sensor technologies. Using these new facilities, we will achieve four major milestones for next-generation materials development:\n\n1. Refresh thin film growth capabilities in order to develop next generation materials.\n\n2. Renew electron microscopy facilities to facilitate high spatial resolution mapping of next generation materials.\n\n3. Extend and refresh a capability in molecular characterisation to underpin multidisciplinary activities spanning the physical and life sciences.\n\n4. Refresh, complement and extend the capabilities of the York Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry (CoEMS) by addition of a high-performance Orbitrap Fusion instrument.\n\nThrough this proposal we will invest in state-of-the-art equipment that will enable us to create, analyse and understand new materials and use them to develop innovative interdisciplinary technologies within the university and with outside collaborators, including key industrial partners such as JEOL and Seagate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M028127/1","grantId":"EP/M028127/1","fundValue":"1409450","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Fulton","coPersons":["Atsufumi  Hirohata","Stuart Alan Cavill","Steven David Johnson","Jane  Thomas-Oates"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
