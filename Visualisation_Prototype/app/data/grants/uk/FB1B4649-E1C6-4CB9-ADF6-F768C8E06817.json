{"id":"FB1B4649-E1C6-4CB9-ADF6-F768C8E06817","title":"Steps Across the Border: Music and Narration in the Fiction Film","abstractText":"The project explore the relationship between diegetic and nondiegetic film music - between music that issues from a source within the story shown, and music that comes from outside that story and is a part of its showing. As simple as the distinction is, as playfully have directors and composers crossed or blurred the border between the modes. The project will show that this cross - border relationship is the key means by which music is woven into the narrative fabric of a film; and it will argue that because music can cross the border so easily, it can affect this narrative structure in unique ways.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113176/1","grantId":"113176/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Guido  Heldt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
