{"id":"814B88E3-FD6B-4330-A291-1B00FE7434A6","title":"Core Capability - University of York","abstractText":"The Chemistry Department in York is one of University's largest research-led departments, with approximately 50 academic staff, 57-research fellows, 136 PhD (30 funded by EPSRC, 12 by NERC), and 14 MSc/MRes research students. Our chemical analyses are critical for the publication of research articles and these are made at a number of leading research centres for example, the York Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry (CoEMS), York Centre for Magnetic Resonance (YCMR), York JEOL Nanocentre, and the Centre for Hyperpolarisation in Magnetic Resonance (CHyM). This bid is made for new/replacement equipment to support our leading research in the following activities: \n\nNMR Spectroscopy: We seek funding for a 400 MHz solid state NMR system as a vital extension to our research activities, given the huge importance of solid/soft matter in numerous research and technological areas such as heterogeneous catalysis, green chemistry, materials and nano-science. In addition, we will contribute to solid state NMR methodology research, which will allow our hyperpolarization research to include NMR studies of surface species/catalysis, and also to the expansion of unconventional computational research (based on spin dynamics) that will be extended to much more complicated, time-dependent phenomena than is currently possible.\n\nMass Spectrometry: In collaboration with Bruker Daltonics, the Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry (CoEMS) in York was supplied with a unique combination and breadth of instrumentation, the centre piece of which is our FT-ICR instrument, which was upgraded to the new solariX. FT-ICR is the method that provides the highest resolution and accuracy measurements in mass spectrometry. The specification of our current instrument (9.4T solariX) has a resolution of 1.5 x 10 sixth at m/z 400. With its MALDI and ESI sources, it is also capable of imaging MS. We now seek to upgrade the solariX to the even higher resolving power and accuracy required to capture the full range of information for increasingly complex natural mixtures like fossil- and bio-fuels and many other current analytical challenges such as the molecular-level characterization of atmospheric aerosols and probing intact proteins and protein assemblies.\n\nSmall Angle X-Ray Diffraction: &quot;Soft-matter&quot; comprises a family of differing materials from membrane lipids, detergents, polymers, and nanoparticles to liquid crystals; ie, systems integral to every-day-life. The properties and applications of such systems require detailed understanding of structure and local molecular organisation. Previously, structures were inferred from polarized light microscopy, however, as the complexities of the phases of functional materials increase modern X-ray diffraction has become the standard for structural characterisation. This request is directed at extending our cutting edge research on self-assembling systems, via the acquisition of a diffractometer with custom-made sample holders, to study phase structures in the bulk, in thin films, and in devices. \n\nFluorescence X-ray Spectroscopy: In 2009, UoY prioritised the purchase of a micro-X-ray fluorescence (Horiba XGT-7000 Micro XRF). The instrument provides non-destructive elemental analysis, beyond CHN (ppm levels), directly from the sample (solid or liquid) without digestion using hazardous strong acids (ie, mandatory for flame atomic absorption). The equipment is currently unusable and needs parts replacing and repair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039660/1","grantId":"EP/K039660/1","fundValue":"834522","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This award was to upgrade key departmental equipment.
