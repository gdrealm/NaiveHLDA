We created a video showing a theft, where the identity of the thief changed half way through. Participants watched the video, then attempted to identify people seen in it (which might include the victim) in a serial lineup. This lineup included photographs of both actors who played the thief and an average of their images. People who failed to notice the change of actor were significantly more likely to pick the average image than the originals, while those who did notice were more likely to pick the originals.\n\nOther work still in progress. The implication of the change blindness study is that a witness to a crime who fails to realise that there is more than one perpetrator might form a combined memory and therefore be even less reliable than usual at subsequent identification.
