In collaboration with Ripon Citizens Advice Bureau, the Principal Investigator (PI) will set up a specialist advice and advocacy service on EU welfare claims.</p>\n\n<p>While advising and representing clients, the PI will also conduct a parallel study of the obstacles the clients encounter during their claims and appeals. This 'advice led ethnography' is an innovative new approach, especially in the context of EU law. It combines socio-legal studies with theoretical, philosophical and historical work on EU social law.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000993/1","grantId":"ES/K000993/1","fundValue":"128541","fundStart":"2013-10-31","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  O'Brien","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
