Similar to Voltaire's Candide, Dasein will have adventures and experience different ways of seeing the world. He will meet Nietzsche's Ubermensch, Descarte's Cartesian circle and Hegel's Geist amongst others. \\n\\n\\nThis is a practice led research project that creatively combines philosophy, ontological systems and narrative form. The research will create relationships between these areas through utilising the visual possibilities provided by the film medium. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F012020/1","grantId":"AH/F012020/1","fundValue":"16269","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As an example of practice-based research into philosophical ideas Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Joanna  Callaghan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bedfordshire","findingsText":" That short narrative films are an excellent way to bring complex philosophical ideas to a general audience.
