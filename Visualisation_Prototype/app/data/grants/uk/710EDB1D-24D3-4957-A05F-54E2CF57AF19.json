They also play an important role in the water cycle, with evapotranspiration from forest canopies and interception of rainfall by leaves influencing water availability. However, changes in regional climate due to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, increased global spread of forest pests and disease and changes in human activity and land use, represent major threats to many forest ecosystems. Of particular concern is the increased frequency and severity of droughts predicted in many important forested regions, such as the Amazon basin. High rates of deforestation and degradation (for example, through selective logging or the effects of fires) are also a major concern, as reflected by recent international initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD+), agreed at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2011. The success of such initiatives relies on frequent monitoring of forest cover and condition over very large areas. Accurate and sensitive satellite or aerial-based methods of monitoring (remote sensing) are therefore urgently needed, if forest degradation, whether due to human activity, climatic changes or disease, is to be detected at an early stage, allowing mitigation activities by foresters or adaptation by local communities.\n \nExisting remote sensing technology is highly effective at mapping land cover change (for example, deforestation) over large areas. However, current methods are less sensitive to the early signs of forest canopy stress (such as reduced leaf water content) resulting from changes in environmental conditions or disease. This is because high levels of variability in background soil and understorey vegetation properties and changes in forest structure can mask the influence of leaf biochemical properties on the reflectance measured by a satellite. \n\nThis research tests, through experimental approaches and the use of models, the potential of a new approach to measuring the water content of forest canopies, as a measure of drought stress and an indicator of disease. Through the use of a recently developed and unique ground-based laser scanner, the Salford Advanced Laser Canopy Analyser, leaf water content can be measured directly, based on detecting the influence of water on reflectance of laser pulses at two different wavelengths. Such instruments have the potential to provide three-dimensional measurements of canopy water content, separating the response of the tree canopy from that of the ground and providing a measurement that is independent of background changes in solar illumination.\n\nThe project will allow improved assessment of the accuracy of estimations of forest canopy stress made from satellite sensors and will act as a demonstration of the ability of dual-wavelength laser scanner systems for forest health monitoring, facilitating further development of the technology for use as an airborne or satellite instrument. Such systems would represent a major advance in capability for national and international organisations responsible for monitoring and managing forests, such as the UK Forestry Commission or the United Nations REDD+ programme and would allow the UK and European space industry to take an international lead at the fore-front of this technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000071/1","grantId":"NE/K000071/1","fundValue":"78484","fundStart":"2013-01-02","fundEnd":"2014-04-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Due to the recent nature of the research and early technology readiness level of the instrument being used, substantial and demonstrable impact beyond the academic community is yet to arise from this grant. The research findings have been presented and/or discussed at a workshop and a seminar, both hosted by UK Forest Research, with a view to ensuring impact in the forestry sector and engagement with the agri-tech / agricultural engineering community is under way. Such engagement will continue, to ensure impacts from the research occur outside of the scientific community.  ","person":"Rachel  Gaulton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The grant has allowed further development of approaches to retrieve measurements of tree canopy health, in terms of canopy water content, from active reflectance measurements obtained from a dual-wavelength ground-based laser scanner.\n\nKey findings include demonstration, in field conditions and at a tree canopy scale, of the sensitivity of such measurements to changes in canopy water content under conditions of artificial drought stress. Spatial and temporal variability in in shortwave and near infrared reflectance can be detected within tree canopies, including in partially occluded trees. Significant variability in the spectral properties of both leaves and woody material within the near and shortwave infrared wavelengths of interest were also demonstrated using field spectrometry approaches both in experimental settings and natural forest canopies. This has raised significant further questions in understanding the influence of woody material and canopy heterogeneity on terrestrial laser scanner measurements in forests.\n\nA range of approaches to optimally retrieving the returned signal intensity from the laser pulse to derive reflectance were tested. Simple methods based on the sum of returned energy outperformed more complex methods to decompose the return signal. The research has also shown the importance of accurate calibration of laser scanner intensity, including the need to account for significant temporal variation in output laser power and non-linearity of detector response. The findings require further demonstration in natural forest canopies, which is on-going, but suggest strong potential to allow the measurement of leaf physiological traits, alongside structural parameters, at canopy scales using multispectral terrestrial laser scanning. Such measurements can allow improved validation of airborne and satellite data-derived measurements of canopy chemistry and the research provides insights into approaches to processing and calibrating dual-wavelength laser scanning which can help to inform development and data analysis from future airborne or vehicle mounted instruments. The results are therefore of relevance to the scientific earth observation community, as well as scientists in the ecology and fire modelling disciplines with an interest in monitoring plant water status. A joint blog site, with Salford University (http://salca-salford.blogspot.co.uk/), is used to disseminate recent research progress and is widely accessed (7949 views from 10 countries), promoting future impact of the work.\n\nThe demonstration of the capability of dual-wavelength laser systems at canopy scales also opens up opportunities for those in the forestry and agricultural sector (particularly precision agriculture). The findings of this study will be of relevance for the development of new approaches to remote monitoring of plant health which are independent of the influence of understorey or soil properties and canopy structure. Companies and organisations interested in development of new monitoring technologies, including in the agri-tech sector, therefore stand to benefit from the findings.
