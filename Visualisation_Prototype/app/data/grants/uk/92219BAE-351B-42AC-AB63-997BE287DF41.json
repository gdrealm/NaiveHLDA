{"id":"92219BAE-351B-42AC-AB63-997BE287DF41","title":"Small Items of Research Equipment at the University of Manchester","abstractText":"The University of Manchester has an explicit strategy to recruit and develop excellent young researchers and to steward research resources accordingly. Since 1st August 2008, we have recruited 96 new academic staff into EPS Faculty. EPS presently targets 11 major multi-disciplinary / multi-school research themes for particular investment focus, all of which are relevant to the EPSRC portfolio, and we promote and invest in 23 world-leading research areas that are largely centred on single Schools, the great majority of which are within the remit of EPSRC. \nIn EPS, we nurture the careers of ECRs staff in various ways, including allowing them access, with all other staff, to an investment of approximately &pound;1m per annum for small research projects/equipment. The present Call for Proposals, being focused on small items of equipment for ECR staff, is very welcome. \n\nOur internal call for applications resulted in 102 submissions, showing the high level of demand. These have been grouped into 14 research areas, all of which are well aligned with the research priorities of EPSRC. \n\nThe overwhelming majority of any funds awarded would be deployed to enhance the research of ECR staff or PhD students. In general, funding of this proposal would greatly facilitate our ECR staff in growing their independent research programmes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031465/1","grantId":"EP/K031465/1","fundValue":"499735","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh  McCann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
