{"id":"5A4824DC-87F0-499F-A55B-0753DF199A39","title":"Fat-PCP and branching morphogenesis","abstractText":"Organs such as the kidney, lungs, salivary, prostate and mammary glands consist of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. A large surface area of epithelial cells is required for organ function. For example, the kidney and lungs require a large surface area for the removal and concentration of excretory products from the blood stream and exchange of gases during breathing respectively. For many organs these large surface areas are generated during embryonic development by the continuous branching of epithelial tubules which allow an increase in the epithelial surface area within a compact space. This is clearly illustrated by the adult lungs which have a surface area of a tennis court. A defect in branching affects the function of the organ and can also have unexpected secondary consequences. For example, defects in kidney branching are the leading cause of hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults.\nDuring development, the branching organs arise from epithelium and mesenchyme. The epithelium branches and this branching is controlled by signals from the mesenchyme. The epithelium grows and branches by combinations of signals that control proliferation and cell death. Additionally, there is cell movement and a change in cell shape. We have shown that two genes, Fat4 and Dchs1, that control the shape and orientation of cells, are essential for branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney. The proposal aims to determine how Fat4 and Dchs1 control kidney branching morphogenesis and if these proteins control branching morphogenesis in other organs. We will determine if Dchs1 and Fat4 function in the epithelium or mesenchyme and how loss or gain of Dchs1/Fat4 affects cell behaviours that contribute to branching morphogenesis. \n The knowledge will contribute to our understanding of cell behaviours during the growth and morphogenesis of different organs. We will determine the role of two factors that we already know are important for this process but we currently do not understand why. The knowledge will give insight into how organs develop, how developmental birth defects arise, and has relevance in stem cell biology and tissue-engineering approaches in which damaged cells/organs are replaced by newly generated cells/organs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K001671/1","grantId":"BB/K001671/1","fundValue":"441847","fundStart":"2013-04-02","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The data are just about to be submitted for publication.
