{"id":"7E2C5515-C0AF-4705-934A-3B8AA7E184E8","title":"A Programme of Research in Astronomical Instrumentation and Cosmology","abstractText":"The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the earliest electromagnetic signal we can receive from the Universe, and investigation of its properties allows us to test theories of how the Universe began and how structure was formed that has eventually led to the galaxies and clusters that we see around us today. We propose to determine the polarization properties of the CMB in order to test theories of the very early period known as inflation by looking for the characteristic signal caused by gravitational waves created at that time, and also to conduct surveys of the galaxy to check on foregrounds and test theories of the structure of regions where stars form. In order to maintain a UK lead in this strategically high priority area of science we also propose a programme of underpinning research and development into specialised optical components at wavelengths from a few microns to a few millimetres using the principles of what are known as meta-materials, and also a programme to develop very large numbers of extremely sensitive superconducting detectors in order to improve measurements of the incredibly weak signals from the CMB and galaxies at these wavelengths. We also propose to investigate the method of interferometry to improve angular resolution at far infrared wavelengths for future space missions. We will engage in an active programme of outreach to educate the public and especially school children in the exciting science that we do and hopefully encourage more to take up careers in science as a result. We will also conduct a knowledge exchange programme looking to apply the technology developed for astronomy to other purposes with wider impact, such as medical imaging for example.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G002711/1","grantId":"ST/G002711/1","fundValue":"2212220","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Kieran  Gear","coPersons":["Enzo  Pascale","Philip  Mauskopf","Carole Elizabeth Tucker","Matt  Griffin","Derek  Ward-Thompson","Peter  Ade"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
