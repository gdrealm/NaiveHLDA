A new set of initiatives, called Graduation programmes, target these excluded households. These programmes provide asset transfers and income support for a fixed period. Their objective is to graduate these households out of poverty and make them resilient so they do not fall back into poverty. In addition, some programmes provide psychological support to clients, usually women, who are often marginalised socially and have very little confidence to engage even in petty business. However, not all programmes include this component. The question is should they?</p>\n\n<p>How important is psychological support such as life planning, confidence building and strengthening social awareness in helping poor women to graduate out of poverty in a resilient way? Surprisingly, no research has actually addressed this question. It is a development frontier and we do not know for sure what the answer is.</p>\n\n<p>This research will address this question through research on the first and biggest graduation programme, which is in Bangladesh. The research will refine an existing questionnaire based upon methods used in social psychology and canvass it with over 1000 households. The results will help us design better programmes for the very poorest households.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K012991/1","grantId":"ES/K012991/1","fundValue":"89272","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"WMH  JaimMushtaque  Chowdhury","coPersons":["Martin  Greeley","Asheek Mohammad  Shimul"],"organisation":"BRAC Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
