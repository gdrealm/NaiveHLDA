Please see more recent entry for all details.<br /><br />This project will investigate how to extend the scientific and social accomplishments of innovative catchment programmes in the USA and other European countries to the UK. A catchment management 'template' will be derived, which compiles and assimilates scientific understanding and governance procedures as tested in actual decision making and management practice, in case study catchments.This will provide a framework to integrate interdisciplinary assessment of methods to protect water resources. It will demonstrate how to: integrate scientific investigation with policy, governance and legal provisions; foster decision-making and implementation at the appropriate governance level to resolve conflicts; and share best practice.</p>\n\n<p>The project will provide an international comparative analysis of catchment governance systems, with a focus on processes, organisational structures and institutional arrangements that promote and facilitate local coordination and action. Two UK catchments will be investigated as case studies: the River Tamar in southwest England and the River Thurne in the Broads. The project will research the current issues, drivers of change, water quality targets, pollution mitigation potential and governance systems in these two catchments. Results will be integrated with the findings of the wider comparative study of governance arrangements, leading to the template.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-25-0009","grantId":"RES-229-25-0009","fundValue":"9946","fundStart":"2007-06-09","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurence Edward Smith","coPersons":["Alastair StJohn Bailey","Kevin Miles  Hiscock"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Please see RES-229-25-0009A Please see RES-229-25-0009A Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
