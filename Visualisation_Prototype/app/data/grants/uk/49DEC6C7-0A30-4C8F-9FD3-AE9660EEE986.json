{"id":"49DEC6C7-0A30-4C8F-9FD3-AE9660EEE986","title":"Hydrogels for Epidermal Stem Cell Growth","abstractText":"Stem cells have vast potential to improve human health. Because of their ability to self-replicate and irreversibly differentiate into specialized tissues, stem cells hold promise as an unlimited source of cells for transplantation and cancer therapies. Stem cells use surface receptors to receive important signals from the extracellular environment in order to initiate differentiation. It has been shown that human mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into specific lineages depending upon underlying matrix elasticity. Rigid, bone-like (&gt;100kPa) ubstrates guide the mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into bone cells while softer substrates (kPa range) guide differentiation to cartilage lineages.This travel grant is aimed at learning how to control hyrogel chemistry to tailor the mechanical properties over a wide range and allow the introduction of mechanical as well as chemical patterns into hydrogels. Ultimately, patterned hydrogels will be used to provide platforms for detailed studies on stem cell growth and delineate the influences of paraters such as substrate stiffness, pattern size, pattern density, surface chemistry, ligand density etc.During the month in Santa Barbara, I will receive hands-on training in hydrogel chemistry and learn how the stiffness can be controlled by changing the composition and crosslinking density.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G070253/1","grantId":"EP/G070253/1","fundValue":"11759","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wilhelm  Huck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
