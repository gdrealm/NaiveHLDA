In addition, the economic recession has led to severe budget cuts to green space management as it is a non-statutory service.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to examine the extent to which cross-sector partnerships are effective in managing green spaces.There is a long history of public, private, third sector organisations and community stakeholders getting involved in managing and maintaining green spaces.
