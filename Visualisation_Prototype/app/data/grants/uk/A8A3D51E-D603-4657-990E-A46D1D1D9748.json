We analysed data from the Home Office's Offenders Index which looked at the yearly risk of reconviction given a single non-violent conviction Two birth cohorts of offenders were examined - 1953 and 1958. This risk was compared with the risk of first conviction for a non-offending group obtained by combining the Offenders Index data with population data and using a discrete time hazard rate analysis. We found that the risk profiles had nearly converged by age 35 in both cohorts. This provided evidence that the retention (or disclosure) of criminal convictions long in the past was of no operational value. This research was used by the Information Commissions in an Information Tribunal appeal case where five Police Authorities were appealing against a decision by the Information Commissioners that the Police authorities should delete old criminal convictions from the Police National Computer. Soothill and Francis appeared as expert witnesses at the tribunal. The case continued and the issues raised led to the appointment of an Independent Advisor for Criminality Information Management (Sunita Mason). \nThe following year, a report by the Jill Dando Institute was produced, providing evidence to the then Labour government on the retention period for DNA profile data for those arrested but not found guilty. Soothill and Francis criticised the methodology of the report pointing out that the correct method to use was that used in the Information Tribunal work. This was referenced in The Guardian. The researchers were then involved with the Home Office in advising on more appropriate methodology, attending a day meeting and peer reviewing the research. This led to a revised research report produced by Home Office researchers and , under the new government, has eventually led to legislation under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2010-12 which now suggests a five year retention period for those arrested but not found guilty.\nThe full description of the impact of this work is an ESRC Impact case study. http://www.esrc.ac.uk/impacts-and-findings/features-casestudies/case-studies/7724/reviewing-the-dna-database.aspx \nb) Work with Peter Diggle and Ivonne Solis-Trapala worked with Lancashire County council Multi-Agency Data Exchange (MADE), which is a data warehouse tool for datasets that are relevant to crime and disorder in Lancashire. The MADE project was established in 2001 to help people living in Lancashire to make better-informed decisions about community safety issues in their neighbourhood and to create a common collation and dissemination facility which will improve the speed and reliability of multi-agency information exchange for crime and disorder strategies and other multi-agency policies throughout Lancashire. The team modelled the spatio-temporal distribution of crime in Lancashire, developing appropriate statistical methodology. The work was used as a case study on the reporting of spatial crime data by the Home Office advisory committee on surveys and statistics.\nc) Work with Nadja Reissland on the development of fetal expressions (and the measurement and assessment of such development using longitudinal ordinal models) led to a publication in PLOS-ONE and subsequent substantial media interest in the development of smile faces and cry faces in fetuses. See the comments tab on http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0024081 \nd) Impact of the training materials: The SRME site went live on Restore in December 2011. The SRME-Restore site has 8,996 page views between 01/01/12 and 17/04/12 (data supplied by Restore). A very high proportion are from US (75%), with 12% from UK and remaining from across the globe. The tutorial videos created for the site have been available since 2010 and are continuing to prove popular on Youtube. The eighteen videos produced have been viewed over 165,500 times at time of writing (see http://www.youtube.com/user/StatRegMethEdu). The chi-square analysis video has proved particularly popular, having been viewed over 61,800 times, while the three simple linear regression have been viewed over 23,000 times, logistic regression 18,000 views and Multiple linear regression with nearly 10,000 views. Comments on these videos from students have been extremely positive, indicating that the resources are meeting a real need.

For the last three years we repeated the structural equations course as it was so popular.\nThe masterclasses, workshops and conference activities are all listed in Annex A. In general, masterclasses were aimed at more advanced users, whereas workshops were aimed at bringing practitioners and academics together to discuss new methodological advances. \nA further route to methodological understanding was through the publication of books . We highlight two books published as a result of our node's work Understanding Criminal Careers (Soothill, Fitzpatrick and Francis, 2009) and Multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models Using R (Berridge and Crouchley,2011)\nThe first book presents the ideas of criminal career research to a criminological audience, targeting primarily British criminologists who need to understand this quantitative approach to criminal histories. It has been adopted as a course text for undergraduate courses in Criminal Careers both in the UK (eg Northumbria University) and in the US.\nThe second book presents the theory and practice of using R to fit multivariate generalized linear mixed models (MGLMMs). The book applies the principles of modelling to longitudinal data taken from panel studies using the SABRE software within R. The book presents robust and methodologically sophisticated models for analyzing large and complex datasets. It highlights the application of the trivariate ordered response model with correlated random effects to BHPS data on attitudes to gender roles. The book has been very well received with sales of almost 500 copies to date, almost a half of which have been sold in North America\n\nb) Enhancing the UK international profile in methodological excellence and ensuring that the UK is at the forefront of international developments in social research methodology.\n\nA strong feature of our node was that we recognised the need to enhance the international profile of our work and to disseminate our methodological research in social science internationally. We collaborated with both US (Alex Piquero, Scott Zeger, Danielle Harris) and European (Paul Nieuwbeerta, Reinhold Hatzinger, Regina Dittrich, Arjan Blokland, Francesco Bartolucci, Mogens Christoffersen) colleagues, building up methodological networks of researchers in particular substantive fields. Dissemination of our work to international conferences was an important aspect of our work for this aim, as was targeting the most important international journals. \nWe attended and presented at both international statistical meetings (Statistical Modelling workshop, CSDA European meetings, Italian meetings on latent variables) and also substantive international meetings on discipline-related methodology (Criminology: American Society of Criminology, European Society of Criminology, International Society of Criminology, :Sociology: RC33 meetings in Naples and Sydney; Psychology: European Society for Developmental Psychology; Society for Research in Child Development; Psychometrics Society meeting in Cambridge) We have produced a large number of papers in international journals such as the Annals of Appiled Statistics, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society A. \n\nc) Enable members of the UK social science community to learn about recent developments in research methods \n\nBoth conference presentations and workshops to target busy researchers played an important role here. We believed that it was important to embed methodological development into substantive talks, so that different audiences of researchers are exposed to new methodology. Conference presentations were given to the British Society of Criminology, the British Psychological Society, the British Sociological Association and the Royal Statistical Society. We also organised two focused workshops to disseminate our work, both held in London at the Royal Statistical Society, and invited other leading researchers to give masterclasses in recent quantitative developments (see Annex A)\n\nd) Undertake research and training activities relevant to research users and of benefit to the economy and society. \n\nAll of our research strands are on highly relevant and topical themes. The relevance of our work to the economy and society is evidenced by the impact of our work and the future impact new projects arising out of our node's work. One method that we used to target researchers was to give targeted mini-meetings on methodological topics before conferences. Thus, developmental psychologists were targeted in half day meetings before the British Psychological Society Developmental Psychology Section. We specifically targeted practitioner meetings to present our research work for example, for the crime strand, talks were given to the ESDS Government Research Conference and the Government Statistical Service methodology conference; in education research , to the Harrow Children &amp; Young Peoples' Service and Hertfordshire County Council Children, Schools and Families Service Meeting, and in Sociology, to the European Survey Research Association.\n\ne) Play a strategic role in the promotion of high quality research methodology. \n\nTo assist with this strategic aim, we sought to join committees relevant to the promotion of quantitative methodology for the social sciences. Thus Francis joined the ESRC Research Grants Board in 2005, serving for five years, and also joined the ESRC working group on quantitative methods. He also chaired a commissioning panel for a quantitative research initiative HUMVIB for the European Science Foundation, accepted an invitation to join the Home Office advisory subcommittee on Survey, Design and Statistics(2006-2011), and joined the editorial board of the Journal of Quantitative Criminology. Similarly, Diggle played a similar role at the Medical Research Council, being a Member of Public Health and Health Services Research Board from 2007-8, then a member of Population and Systems Medicine Research Board, 2008-2011 and is now MRC Chair of Strategic Skills Fellowships Schemes Panel. There are at least two potential sources of future impact.\na) The work on the statistical modelling of criminal career data has led to the Lancaster group being commissioned to carry out research on the Criminal Careers of Organised Crime by the Home Office. This work is still ongoing, but is likely to led to impact once peer reviewed and published. \n\nb)The work on Latent Class Analysis, combined with the work on generalised nonlinear models, both carried out as part of these two grants are, in combination, being used as part of a new grant from the Australian Research Council as part of the Project &quot;Statistical Modelling of Social Networks&quot; with Murray Aitkin, at Melbourne University. This will lead to a book and new methods of modelling social network data Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
