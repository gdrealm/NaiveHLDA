{"id":"F1C1003C-2FDA-4409-AEE4-11DAB30E1A5E","title":"Modelling the Evolution of Climate Change Policy Uncertainty on Electricity Investment Incentives and Risk","abstractText":"This project will explore how decision-making in the electricity sector is affected by risks arising from the uncertainties in the economics of climate change.&nbsp; The project will include analysis of two main sources of uncertainty.&nbsp; Firstly, it will analyse in the way in which the EU emissions trading scheme translates national climate change policy objectives into a price signal to companies.&nbsp; Secondly, we will look at how uncertain levels of international commitment to climate change mitigation may lead to uncertain targets and timetables, and may alter a government's view of the costs and benefits of abating greenhouse gases.&nbsp; The project will use an option valuation methodology to quantify risks associated with these sources of uncertainty, drawing conclusions about the likely effect on investment behaviour in the power sector as well as conclusions about the implication of these risks for the design of climate change policy and energy policy. In more general terms, it will seek to quantify the effects of institutional intermediation in transferring the uncertainties of climate change through carbon trading markets into the business risks of electricity investment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F032536/1","grantId":"ES/F032536/1","fundValue":"338644","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek William  Bunn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Business School","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
