Therefore many of the findings of the projects are integrated within the sector as they emerge. Two examples are cited here:\n\nA Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Scottish Screen (later Creative Scotland) considered the management and exploitation of digital technology in the film industry. The KTP Associate, Michael Franklin, conducted research which directly benefitted over 20 companies and Creative Scotland. The impacts on film companies include improved marketing and distribution campaigns, access to innovative digital technology, diversified revenue opportunities, developed skillsets and attraction of increased investment. Creative Scotland has benefitted from redeveloped and increased industry funding programmes, improved capture and use of industry data, and enhanced staff skills. Overall the KTP impacted the ability of Scotland's film industry to capitalise on its intellectual property (films and related creative content) and compete in national and international markets. \nOrian Brook's PhD research informed an evidence review by Arts Council England (2014), The Value of Arts and Culture to People and Society, which cited her work; Orian also has been working to incorporate accessibility indices for cultural venues into new local area estimates commissioned by ACE. In addition, Orian's work is being incorporated into a major new resource for the arts sector being developed by The Audience Agency. Audience Finder is a programme which aims to support cultural organisations in reaching more people, new audiences and greater efficiency by modelling the combined inputs of major cultural participation surveys, box office data, and online interactions. For the first time in the cultural sector the modelling of attendance in local areas will also incorporate the area's access to cultural opportunities, in the form of arts venues, museums and galleries, using analysis developed in Orian's PhD.

The work engages with sole traders and enterprises across the sector, as well as with public and charitable bodies, a UNESCO city of music, and local authorities. Three major impacts for policy and research are highlighted: \nDeveloping new methodology: PhD student Orian Brook considered rates of arts attendance at major venues in London and Scotland. Using spatial modelling and vast datasets, Orian explored the importance of neighbourhoods' socio-economic and demographic characteristics and distances from venues and commuting patterns. She found previous statistical modelling failed to account for the location of venues and significantly overestimated attendance in areas with poor access to venues, and underestimated in areas close to venues. She developed a negative binomial spatial interaction model of flows between residential neighbourhoods and arts venues in Scotland, showing a strong effect of distance from a venue. The research affirms that without considering distance from a venue as an important factor in participation, policymakers fail to acknowledge their own role as suppliers of cultural services. \nIdentifying under-researched areas: Two PhD researchers extended their knowledge in dance and theatre to approach the subjects from organisational and creative industry perspectives. Bethany Whiteside conducted a sociological analysis of participatory dance activity and practice in Glasgow. She examined six cases: a professional company ballet class, an inclusive creative dance class, a line dancing class, a salsa club, a Highland dancing class and dance in primary school education. This study analyses the hierarchy and patterns of social interaction inherent to them. \nBen Fletcher-Watson surveyed the production of performing arts for very young audiences (birth to age 3) in Scotland. Encompassing theory of the performing arts, developmental psychology and pedagogy, the rights of children and citizen participation, the thesis explores the legitimacy of Theatre for Early Years (TEY). The genre challenges traditional conceptions of theatre in the effort to entertain, train spectators in 'theatre-literacy', provide societal benefits, act as 'babysitter', or to engage. Ben's work led to an industry placement in 2013 to help develop a digital app for the very young. \nDevelopment of a capitals framework for understanding the creative industries: the original grant application was built upon a conception of interlinked capitals involved in the classic, creative vs commercial tension within creative industries. This framework of intellectual, social, cultural, and economic capitals, informed by Bourdieu (1984, 1993), was further explored in a Business Voucher with a visual arts curator, Judith Winter. Her efforts to start a new company were shown to rely on ideas, networks, markets and economic investments, or forms of capital, relevant to the visual arts field. The findings were presented (Townley, B., Grewar, M. and Winter, J. &quot;Thinking in capital mode&quot;), to the ESRC Capacity Building Clusters National Conference 2013, and published in the proceedings (Clegg BT., Scully J., and Bryson, J., eds). Findings which emerge from the PhD studentships are expected to publish in the familiar academic forms of journal articles, book chapters and books. In terms of non-academic activity, the research programme delivered 23 business voucher projects, involving concentrated academic focus on operational issues identified by the commissioning enterprises; and a series of dissemination events for practitioners and policymakers in the sector (Strategies For Success, 23 May 2013, and Up Your IP (3workshops for theatre, design and games industries held in 2014) regarding Intellectual Property management; and Create in Fife: Searching for Solutions, 22 October 2013, a showcase of findings from the CBC's Business Voucher and Knowledge Transfer projects). The audience responses to the IP events indicated that while the targeted sectors initially lacked deep understanding of IP, participants grasped the importance of improving their understanding of the area and will be investigating related issues further. The research programme also maintained a public-facing website with news items and blogs which helped to raise awareness of the creative industries generally and of the research programme specifically.
