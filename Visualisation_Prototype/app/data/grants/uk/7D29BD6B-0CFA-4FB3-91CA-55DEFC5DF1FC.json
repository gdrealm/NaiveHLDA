The research is designed to answer two crucial questions:</p>\n\n<p>1. How can jurors be prevented from improperly using the internet during trials? </p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p>2. How can jurors be provided with guidance that will ensure effective jury deliberations?</p>\n\n<p>Working exclusively with real juries at Crown Courts, this project will establish new tools to be used in jury trials to ensure proper conduct and effective deliberations. It will survey jurors to assess juror understanding of improper conduct and juror requirements for information about deliberations. Then, drawing on the survey results, it will pilot new forms of information about both improper conduct and deliberations with juries at court to identify the most effective tools. Economic costing of introducing the new tools will also be carried out and recommendations made to the judiciary and HMCTS. The research is designed to ensure that trial by jury can survive the digital age and continue to play a crucial role in a 21st century criminal justice system.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J000876/1","grantId":"ES/J000876/1","fundValue":"88344","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  My findings have resulted in the increase in judges providing written directions to juries and influenced the content of judicial directions to juries on contempt and the use of the internet during trial.

In stage 1 post verdict surveys have been carried out with real juries at Crown Courts. The information from these surveys will be used in Stages 2-4 to trial new tools with juries at court. This research project is still in progress but findings from Stage 1 indicate the following. A quarter of jurors currently do not understand the rule on internet use during trial. A small proportion of jurors are currently using the internet during trial in ways that may result in committing a contempt of court. Almost all jurors want more information about how to conduct deliberations. What jurors want deliberation information about the most is: what to do if confused about a legal issue, how to start deliberations, how to ensure a juror is not unduly pressured into reaching a verdict and what to do if something goes wrong in deliberations. Jurors also want directions from judges in writing; all jurors who received written directions from judges said they found them helpful and almsot all jurors who did not received written directions said they would have liked them. This research is specifically designed to help HMCTS and the judiciary establish new tools and instructions for jurors at court to prevent jurors committing contempt of court (especially through misuse of the internet during trial) and to improve jury deliberations. The research findings will provide Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), the Ministry of Justice and the Judiciary of England and Wales with robust and reliable empirical evidence of how best to ensure jurors know what improper juror conduct is (including the rules on internet use during trial), follow these rules and properly report any breaches of the rules, as well as evidence about what type of deliberation guidance is needed and is most effective at improving jury deliberations.
