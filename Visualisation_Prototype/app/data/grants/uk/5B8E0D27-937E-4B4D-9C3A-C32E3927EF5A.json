These signals are generated by a particular set of molecules called sodium channels. Many drugs used to treat neurological illnesses, such as epilepsy and chronic pain, bind to sodium channels. These drugs do not simply block the channels (that would be fatal to the patient). Instead they allow the channels to make the electrical signals, but they ensure that in between the signals the channels are firmly closed. We have discovered that the genes that code for sodium channels can often be read in two alternate ways in order to make two slightly different channels from each gene. These different channels are called splice variants, because they are made by splicing the genes differently. We have shown that the splice variants from one gene are much more likely to open in between electrical signals, and consequently they may be the most important target of many drugs. \nWe have also found that some diseases, such as epilepsy, cause the sodium channel genes to generate more of the splice variants that open between electrical signals. This means the disease itself may lead to neurons in the brain having more of these channels that require drugs to keep closed between signals. Many diseases are thought to change the number of channels that open between signals, including Parkinson s disease, motor neurone disease and neuropathic pain, as well as epilepsy. We ask whether any or all of these diseases change the amount of sodium channel splice variants, and whether these sodium channel splice variants may represent a more specific target for drugs that would produce fewer side effects than drugs that affect all sodium channel splice variants. \nBy looking at the behaviour of neuronal cells grown in petri dishes, and examining how drugs bind to the sodium channels and how the genes are being spliced we will determine whether the splice variants are specifically targeted by drugs and how removing the splice variants will change the neurons. We will also investigate whether conditions that mimic diseases lead to changes in the splicing. It is possible that by preventing the neurons from making the splice variants that open between electrical signals, we will be able to directly alleviate some of the changes in neuronal behaviour linked to neurological disorders. This may lead to a new approach to treating some of these difficult and persistent disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601440","grantId":"G0601440","fundValue":"514057","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephanie  Schorge","coPersons":["Parmjit  Jat","Dimitri Michael Kullmann"],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
