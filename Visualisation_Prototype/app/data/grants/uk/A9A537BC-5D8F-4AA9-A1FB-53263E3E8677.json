The four pieces uses different 8-channel loudspeaker arrays to maximise the varying characteristics of space and motion of their sound materials. The research examines the relative merits of these different formats from the perspectives of both composition and performance practice, and then explores ways of rendering these 'audio images ' into commercial Dolby 5.1 format for DVD-audio release.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112895/1","grantId":"112895/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonty  Harrison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
