The principal investigators are Stan Siebert and Xiangdong Wei (Lingnan University, Hong Kong), with John Heywood of Wisconsin-Milwaukee as co-investigator. </p>\n\n<p>The aim is to find the root of China's world-beating productivity, and in particular to assess how the company has adapted to China's relatively high levels of labour regulation. (as measured, for example, by the World Bank's current Ease of Doing Business Report). The company is experimenting with various innovative labour practices such as team-working and incentive pay schemes, and the results will be tracked. A further aspect of the research is assessing the consequences of these practices for workers, by conducting periodic job satisfaction surveys.</p>\n\n<p>The project addresses central concerns of personnel economics and strategic human resource researchers. The evidence on the high performance paradigm tends to be distorted by omission of the management ability factor which our quasi-experimental approach avoids. In fact, our results may well not support the paradigm, or support a &quot;contingency&quot; view whereby high performance practices improve outcomes when applied to some worker groups (eg full-timers), but not when applied to others.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3653","grantId":"RES-000-22-3653","fundValue":"80026","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our project provides exciting prospects of answering key question in the analysis of worker compensation, though it is too early yet for its findings to be used. These are still being developed. As noted, we have developed a second experiment arising out of the first, and also plan to assess the practical implications using data on workplace practices from the WERS.\n The project has had academic impact so far having been discussed at conferences and seminars including the Hong Kong Economic Association Conference (December 2012) the EU FP7 e-Frame Workshop on Human Capital (British Academy, May 2013), the Goethe Business School at the University of Frankfurt (April 2014), and the Work, Pensions and Employment Group Conference (DWP), University of Sheffield (July 2014).

The first was in August 2012, and then we staged an improvement in June 2014. We have thus achieved our main research objective of using the field experimental methodology to overcome the &quot;selection&quot; problem that particular worker types with unobservable ability may select pay schemes where ability has an extra pay-off, leading to misleading conclusions. Our project is one of the few to use this robust methodology to study incentive pay. \n A fundamental finding is that piece rates do not simply raise quantity at the expense of quality, which is a common criticism of piece rates. Instead, our results imply that the careful selection of (&quot;committed&quot;) workers interacts with monitoring practices and the piece rate's high-powered incentives to influence the workforce's quality-quantity performance. Different combinations of these three practices have different costs, and the firm selects among practices to deliver a chosen workforce quality-quantity outcome. In other words, the firm can refine its worker selection and monitoring options together with the payment system to deliver a chosen (optimum) quality-quantity. Our two experiments have implications for the design of incentive pay systems which are central to worker motivation. The findings will contribute to the literature on what really happens, using robust experimental methodology, when piece rates are instituted under various monitoring and worker selection conditions. These results will also indluence practical management. \nAn important next step is to show how the three payment system variables that we identify are used in practice. We are therefore aim to analyse how payment systems and worker selection are used by the firms in practice, and the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) offers questions on all three of our variables which could make it a suitable database. We are taking this approach forward. Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail","dataset":"gtr"}
