Advances in lens design and Oxygen permeability have not significantly improved CLD so the lens\nsurface is now considered the major factor in patient perception of comfort. Surface factors that can enhance comfort are\nthe reduction of both (i) the friction between the CL and ocular surfaces &amp; (ii) levels of lipid &amp; protein deposits. This project\nwill exploit a novel bio-inspired nanoscale surface engineered approach to create PEG (polyethylene glycol) surfaces with\nself cleaning properties (Smart) to provide enhanced CL comfort eliminating the causal factors (i) and (ii) outlined above\nThe technology will be combined with existing materials and a new and innovative high efficiency CL manufacturing\nmethod with substantial environmental benefits. CL wear provides a uniquely accessible site for demonstration of wider\nbiocompatibility behaviour with the findings allowing this technology to be exploited in other medical devices including\nintraocular lenses (IOLs).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N510075/1","grantId":"EP/N510075/1","fundValue":"249891","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Stuart Wolffsohn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
