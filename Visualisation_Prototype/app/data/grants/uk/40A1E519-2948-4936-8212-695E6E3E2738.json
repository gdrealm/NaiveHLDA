The cell divides into two, four, eight and so on, ultimately to make the hugely complex human body. In each cell division the DNA and other cell components must be separated equally into the daughter cells, and this is achieved by a special scaffold framework called the protein cytoskeleton. In this process, there must be a source of force to move the DNA and cellular components into the correct locations in the daughter cells. The force is supplied by motor proteins, which interact both with the cytoskeletal proteins and with the DNA etc, and they act like tiny railway engines carrying their cargoes along the cytoskeleton tracks. During the day-to-day life of the cell, these motor proteins act as transporters between the cell surface and its nucleus and between different structures within the cell.\nThe length of a single human nerve cell can be more than a metre from the tip of the toe to the spinal cord within the backbone. The proteins necessary to maintain nerve cells can be made only in the cell body near the nucleus, not at the tip of the nerve in the toe. So proteins needed in the toe region must be transported there. Some proteins and other cargoes are transported back to the cell body. Abnormal function of the motor proteins in nerves can cause neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, HIV, Herpes and other viruses can infect the body through a surface of the neuronal cell and are then transported into the cell nucleus along that one metre distance, where they can then wait to cause disease later on. This movement is also driven by the motor proteins, which move along the cytoskeletal transport network.\nIf we understood the principle behind the movement of the motor proteins, we would gain a new target for drugs to prevent virus infection and to prevent the rapid cell division in cancer cells. We already know that the motor protein, dynein is involved in all the movements we have mentioned, but we don't know how it works, so we don't know how to regulate it.\nDynein is a motor protein that uses a high energy fuel molecule called ATP to generate force on cytoskeletal tracks called microtubules. There are two major classes of dyneins. One is for transporting cargoes from the periphery of the cell towards the centre, and is the motor that gets hi-jacked by viruses. It also is needed for cell division to work properly. The other dyneins are what make the tails of sperm cells wiggle so that they can swim to fertilise the egg. So dynein is important for many vital functions of the body.\nThe transporter dynein consists of a pair of identical motor domains, which are joined together by a complicated tail. To understand how the motor works, we make just the dynein motor domain with a tag that holds two motors together. This mini-dynein walks along microtubules using ATP fuel, but because it has no tail, it can't carry cargo. \nTo understand how dynein walks on microtubules, we will study the structure of this mini-dynein by flash freezing it while it is walking and then viewing the individual molecules using a special electron microscope. By looking at many thousands of molecules we will see the different structures dynein adopts as it walks. Our study is helped by special computer software that lets us see the 3D structure more clearly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K000705/1","grantId":"BB/K000705/1","fundValue":"452681","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stanley Alan  Burgess","coPersons":["Peter Jackson Knight"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
