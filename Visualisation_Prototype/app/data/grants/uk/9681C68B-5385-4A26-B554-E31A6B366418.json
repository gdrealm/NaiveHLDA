The programme is split into two parts. </p>\n\n<p>The first part focuses on corporations, is primarily theoretical in nature, and consists of three research projects. A first project develops a dynamic model for corporate investment, payout and financing policy when there is a separation of ownership and control. The project also analyzes the effect of financing constraints and economic uncertainty on corporate decisions. A second research project intends to model corporate liquidity and its interaction with investment and financing policy in an uncertain economic environment. A third project analyzes the effect of economic uncertainty and industry competition on corporate investment, financing, outsourcing and vertical merger activity.</p>\n\n<p>The second part focuses on households and is primarily empirical in nature. A first project empirically examines the financing and liquidity policy of households using a dataset of Dutch households that covers the period 1993-2003. A second project intends to analyze the determinants of homeownership in the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>The study should provide an answer to the questions how socio-economic factors, household demographics and the degree of urbanization influence homeownership, how housing is being financed and how the availability of different types of financing affects homeownership.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D005116/1","grantId":"ES/D005116/1","fundValue":"238133","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bart Maria Lambrecht","coPersons":["Grzegorz  Pawlina"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
