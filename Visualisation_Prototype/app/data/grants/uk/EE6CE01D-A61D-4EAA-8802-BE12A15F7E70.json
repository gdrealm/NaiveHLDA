This is achieved by complex interplay between the best known cell type in the brain, the neuron. However, there is a second kind of cell type in the brain, the glial cell. The most common type of glial cell is the astrocyte, named after its star-like appearance. Astrocytes out-number neurons and play important roles in regulating the environment within which neurons operate. Neuronal activity results in inbalances in the extracellular space of the brain, and astrocytes act to counter these unwanted effects. Recently, we have learned that astrocytes are also involved in the processing of information in the brain, a role previously though to be restricted to neurons. In order to perform this signal processing function, astrocytes must maintain tight control of their intracellular environment. This is particularly true for pH, any large variation of which will severely compromise the astrocytes ability to communicate with neighbouring cells. Previous studies have examined astrocyte ionic handling in reduced preparation, such as cultured cells removed from the brain and maintained in glass dishes. This grant will apply cell imaging and ion-sensitive electrode techniques to reveal how astrocytes within the normal brain manage to regulate their internal pH and ion concentrations while at the same time controlling the extracellular environment as required by neurons. Understanding how astrocytes achieve this balancing act will tell us a lot about how the brain functions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J016969/1","grantId":"BB/J016969/1","fundValue":"340551","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Fern","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
