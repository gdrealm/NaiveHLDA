{"id":"9A82D3EA-D953-4609-B58E-DD4778EA955D","title":"Evaluating Enhancing and Improving Feedback","abstractText":"<p>Interpersonal feedback is a fact of daily life. Students, employees, actors, and athletes receive frequent feedback from their instructors, supervisors, directors, and coaches, respectively. How do students, employees, actors, and athletes perceive the feedback they receive? This question is important, because how one perceives feedback will influence how one behaves. Thus, misunderstandings can occur. Behaviour may not be responsive to the feedback and may not be the long-term interest of the recipients. Research, then, into feedback perceptions may help well-meaning evaluators shape recipients' behaviour and may help recipients maximise their personal benefits.</p> \n<p>This programme of research consists of four laboratory experiments that use a somewhat similar experimental design but moderately divergent experimental procedures. The research asks whether feedback that is enhancing (ie, positive) is perceived as more satisfying than feedback that is improving (ie, orientated toward progress). Also, is improving feedback perceived as more useful than enhancing feedback? </p> \n<p>In addition, this research will address the behavioural consequences of enhancing versus improving feedback, especially the kind of feedback that is administered on multiple occasions. Finally, the research will assess the role of individual differences in perceptions and behavioural consequences of multiple-occasion feedback.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00282X/1","grantId":"ES/E00282X/1","fundValue":"80375","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Constantine  Sedikides","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
