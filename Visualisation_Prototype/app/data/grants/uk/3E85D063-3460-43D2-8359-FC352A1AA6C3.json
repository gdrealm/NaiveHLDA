We aim to challenge and expand dominant understandings of research by drawing on insights and methods from the humanities and interpretive social science. Contemporary social problems are widely perceived as increasing in scope and complexity, and needing to be better understood if appropriate policy responses are to be developed. However, there is a longstanding problem that the relevance of academic research in understanding this complexity is not always obvious to potential 'research users' in government. \n\nThe heart of the proposed research is to observe the use and translation of research outputs generated by CC projects as they move into central government and local government policy processes. This process involves the interaction of academic researchers, research analysts and policy teams in Whitehall and local practitioners who implement policy initiatives. We will pose three research questions:\n\n1: how are different kinds of CC research 'outputs' taken into policy arenas? \n2: what modes of communication and types of knowledge are explicitly preferred and habitually adopted in different domains (academic, government research analyst etc.) and why?\n3: what assumptions about the value of different kinds of findings and modes of communication characterise the domains, and how susceptible to change are these? \n\nThe research will focus on following outputs from the CC Policy Reviews for DCLG. This will allow comparison of a wide range of different kinds of communication whose uptake and translation will be taking place during 2014/2015 and so can be followed 'in real time'. Drawing on the research team's wider experience, and the review of CC projects carried out for the Reviews, other CC outputs will be introduced into the 'conversations' between academics and researchers as and when appropriate. This detailed, interpretive work will be put into a broader context through a survey of all CC projects to identify the extent and nature of policy engagement across the programme. \n\nThe research will be co-produced by a team of academics and the research analysts of DCLG's Decentralisation and Big Society (DABS) division. Its execution will involve close engagement with the Division's policy team and local government officers in the pilots of the 'OurPlace!' neighbourhood budgeting programme (i.e. key 'users' of the Policy Reviews). \n\nWe will:\na) Survey CC policy engagement: on-line survey of all CC projects, followed up by five interviews.\nb) Observation: non-participant observation of DABS meetings averaging two per month over the 12 month fieldwork period (and/or others as opportunity arises) plus 4 periods, of one week, embedded participant observation fieldwork within DABS; obesravtion and interviewing in 3 OurPlace! authorities.\nc) Semi-structured interviews: with Policy Review academics, DABS and OurPlace! officials. \nd) Initiation workshop: with wider group of expert academics and policy makers and practitioners.\ne) Workshops: three workshops in which the assumptions affecting and processes of translation across team borders will be explicitly examined by all participants.\nf) Reflective writing: Our collective, continuous analysis of translation processes will be summarised and tested by monthly one-page reflections across the research team and research partners.\n\nThe outputs will be:\na) a survey of the CC programme's engagement with policy making \nb) guidance for academic researchers (especially those working from arts and humanities perspectives) on co-production and increasing impact with policy-makers\nc) guidance for government officials on using arts and humanities research \nd) academic articles in selected journals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013223/1","grantId":"AH/L013223/1","fundValue":"99923","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-10","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Connelly","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Richardson","Peter John Matthews","Catherine Elizabeth Durose"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
