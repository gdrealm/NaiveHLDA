{"id":"1E3586DD-5641-412B-8062-F29874ACFDEE","title":"Core Capability for Chemistry Research - Leeds","abstractText":"In Part A of our Bid, the School of Chemistry, University of Leeds requests funds to purchase a 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer, a Single Crystal XRD Spectrometer and a Variable Pressure SEM.\n\nThe 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer will replace the main service instrument in the School, which is used by 75% of the academic staff. The new instrument will have low and high (variable) temperature and multinuclear capability (including 11B) and is employed for more complex analyses, including selective excitation experiments, more 'exotic' nuclei detection, dynamics studies, and for (very) sample limited data collections. It will also provide increased resolution as compared with the existing instrument and a shielded (high cryogen hold time) magnet and new probes will provide greatly improved signal-to-noise characteristics for all nuclei. The spectrometer will primarily be used to provide the School service, but its superior performance as compared with our old instrument means that the facility can also be opened up to less experienced users for specialist applications. \n\nThe new single crystal diffractometer system will replace a failing 10 year old instrument and will support the work of approximately 50% of the academic staff in the department, providing vital access to structural determination. The instrument will have a microfocus X-ray source that has dual wavelength (Mo and Cu) capacity, along with peripheral equipment such as a cryogenic crystal cooling unit and server for raw data storage and backup. The new system will have enhanced and expanded capabilities in comparison with our current set-up through improved power and sensitivity, and the ability to determine absolute configuration of light-atom samples which we cannot currently do. \n\nA variable pressure FEG-SEM with integral EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) will provide new capability and will enable high resolution imaging and elemental analysis of solid samples at the nanometer level. The instrument will be equipped with a temperature-control stage, and we will also purchase software enabling automated analysis of multiple samples. In addition, it will have multiple ports which will permit interfacing with further analytical tools (such as atomic force microscopy (AFM)). That the instrument can be operated from high to low vacuum provides maximum flexibility, allowing analysis of both conducting and non-conducting samples. We also need to purchase a metal coating unit to coat larger, non-conducting samples which can be prone to charging. The request of a variable pressure FEG-SEM reflects the changing landscape of chemistry research in the UK. While chemistry departments have not traditionally housed electron microscopes, as research areas such as materials chemistry continue to grow in importance, and the specification of microscopes continues to improve, it is essential that researchers have ready access to high specification instruments.\n\nPart B of the proposal makes the case for establishment of a centre for &quot;High Resolution Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of Beam Sensitive Materials&quot; with purchase of a state-of-the-art Titan Krios cryo-electron TEM which combines high resolution 2D imaging with electron tomography and advanced analytical techniques (electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron diffraction). This instrument makes it possible for the first time to look at dose-sensitive structures with such high resolution that atomic imaging of soft matter becomes a reality. \n\nIn Part B we also request new capability with the purchase of a liquid cell holder for a TEM, and an AFM to integrate with the SEM purchased in Part A. A powder XRD will also bring new capability to the school. Finally, we request a LC-MS(MS) mass spectrometer to replace our workhorse, user-operated instrument and a 600 MHz instrument, equipped with a cold probe which will replace an existing instrument and bring new resolution capabilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039202/1","grantId":"EP/K039202/1","fundValue":"1046000","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This research grant supported purchase of three key pieces of analytical equipment: XRD, NMR and SEM. These instruments are used by all members of staff in their research. This grant has therefore had an enormous impact on the research carried out within the School of Chemistry, University of Leeds.\n\nA number of representative publications which have used these instruments are listed as examples.\n\nFurther examples of impact include:\n\n(1) The new diffractometer has significantly increased the number of data sets that we are able to collect, has expanded the user base, and has allowed us to investigate different sample types and perform more sophisticated experiments compared with our previous capability. The new instrument has had a particular impact in research in supramolecular and coordination chemistry, switchable materials, organometallics for catalysis and drug discovery, CO2 and process development chemistry. We are now able to routinely determine absolute structure for light atom molecules which has increased the usage from organic colleagues. The Cu X-ray source allows for different collection times at different resolution arcs and this has had a marked effect on our ability to determine structures of materials that we would have previously only been able to investigate at a synchrotron, for example complex supramolecular assemblies which crystallise with large unit cells and diffract weakly due to significant disorder. Automated data collections at multiple temperatures has enabled facile investigation of structure switching materials.\n\n(2) Key findings from the X-ray diffractometer include the structural characterisation of a series of new hybrid organometallic-coordination cages which are functionalised by carbene ligands which both stabilised otherwise unstable assemblies and gives non-porous materials capable of binding iodine and other guests. \n\n(3) Data from the XRD instrument has contributed to determination of intermediates in the catalytic cycle, and decomposition pathways, in the iridium catalysed racemisation and resolution of amines. This data is a key part of both an Innovate UK project and two EPSRC / industrial funded CASE student awards. \n\n(4) The NMR instrument has undergone a commissioning period for the last 6 months and is now fully operational. During this time it has provided 13C data for a series of potential pharmaceuticals (designed by the Fishwick group) - and we have been able to detect quaternary carbons that we just could not pick up on the other instruments. We have also provided data for highly symmetric molecules containing stereocentres; in this instance the enhanced resolution has been the key factor, and this analysis would not have been achievable with our other instruments.\n\n(5) The SEM instrument has provided greater resolution, the ability to screen multiple samples using automated scanning and in particular to image non-conducting samples without coating. The automated scanning mode has enabled high throughput screening of samples generated using a robotic liquid handler, and by imaging uncoated samples we are able to view surface features that cannot be observed with coated samples.

These underpin the research carried out in the department and also provide new capabilities.\n\n(1) Single crystal XRD. We purchased an Agilent Supernova dual source diffractometer with Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream nitrogen cryostat. The Supernova was specially adapted to be able to function with our pre-existing Oxford Cryostream Helix helium cryostat. The instrument has a microfocus X-ray source that has dual wavelength (Mo and Cu) capacity.\n\n(2) High resolution SEM. We purchased an FEI Nova NanoSEM. This variable pressure FEG-SEM has integral EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and enables high resolution imaging and elemental analysis of solid samples at the nanometer level. The instrument is also equipped with temperature-control stages, and software enabling automated analysis of multiple samples.\n\n(3) NMR. A Jeol ECAII 600 MHz NMR instrument with sample changer, broadband probe, variable temperature capability and pulsed field gradients was purchased. This spectrometer is providing the primary School service. The three instruments purchased are used on a daily basis by all academic staff. The research outcomes therefore cross all disciplines represented by the school of chemistry.
