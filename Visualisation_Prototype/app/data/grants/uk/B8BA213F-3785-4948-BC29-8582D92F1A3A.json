A serious problem with these composite materials, particularly glass-reinforced polymeric composites, which are the most prevalent in marine and other surface transport applications, is that they support combustion and in fire conditions burn, most often with heavy soot and smoke. Insulation can reduce the fire hazard, but does not eliminate it. Moreover the insulation adds weight and cost to apply.The combustible part of the composite is organic resin matrix. Most common method of fire retarding the resin and hence, the overall composite is the physical and chemical modification of the resin by either adding fire retardant element in the polymer backbone or using fire retardant additives in the resin. For polyester or vinyl ester resins, usually halogenated chemicals are used. While the presence of halogen significantly reduces the flammability of the resin, due to increasing environmental awareness and strict environmental legislations thereof, halogen - containing fire retardants are being strictly scrutinised. When non-halogen flame retardants are used, invariably they are required in large quantities (&gt;30% w/w) to achieve required level of fire retardancy. The high concentrations of additives however, can reduce the mechanical properties of the composite. Moreover, they also affect resin's processability for resin transfer moulding technique, commonly used for these types of composites. We propose here a step change in the resin matrix by reducing the combustibility of vinyl ester and/or polyester resin by co-blending with inherently fire retardant resins, such as phenolic or melamine-formaldehyde resin.This proposal is a joint attempt by 'Fire Materials' group at the University of Bolton and 'Fluid Structure Interactions Research Group (FSIRG) at the University of Southampton to develop, construct, test and model novel, fire-retardant composites, initially for marine applications. The principal focus is to develop a modified polymeric matrix to reduce the combustibility of the vinyl ester or polyester resins by blending with appropriately modified phenolic and melamine resins, which will increase the thermal stability and char-forming capacity of the matrix. The physical and chemical properties of the modified resin will be optimised to enable: (a) the resin to be infusible for moulding leading to good processing ability: (b) low temperature cure capability to maximize compatibility and bonding with glass fibres; and (c) up-scaling to produce large laminates and structures. It is proposed that two different approaches will be taken: the first one 'Material' based, mainly by Bolton, and the other 'Structure' based, to which both Bolton and Southampton will contribute. The specific tasks include resin blending, chemical / physical modification of the resin, process modelling and resin infusion, composite laminate preparation and flammability evaluation. The composite laminates and structures thus produced are expected to comply with the fire performance requirements contained in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as `IMO/HSC Code (Code of Safety for High Speed craft of the International Maritime Organisation). Additionally, the structural performance of the composite would be expected to be comparable with current glass/vinyl ester. We also propose to conduct fire performance modelling, mechanical characterisation and progressive damage analysis from a structural design viewpoint.We expect these composites to find applications also in other engineering arenas for which low-weight, thermally resistant and fire-retardant structures are increasingly being sought.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H020675/1","grantId":"EP/H020675/1","fundValue":"427079","fundStart":"2010-07-19","fundEnd":"2014-07-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  1.

Bolton's focus was material based, i.e., identification and/or chemical modification of char-forming resins to render them chemically and physically compatible with unsaturated polyester (and vinyl ester) resins; establishment of curing conditions for these blended resins; casting of them into plaques in order to study their physical, mechanical and fire performances; and preparation of glass-reinforced composite laminates by adjusting curing conditions followed by study of their fire and mechanical performances.\n\nThe significant discoveries and developments are listed below:\n1. Resole phenolics: Three phenolic resole resins with varying degrees of compatibility with UP resins were sourced from an industrial partner. It was observed that while mechanical properties of the composite laminates from co-blended resins increases with increase in compatibility, the flammability also increases. The resin least compatible with UP conferred the most flame retardance, which however was shown to form interpenetrating network structures with the UP and hence gave acceptable mechanical performance. While flammability of the co-blended resins was significantly reduced over that of the UP, curing temepartures were required to be much higher than that of the latter. Such co-blended resins, although not suitable for bulk marine composites, will be useful for specific applications such as in engine compartments.\n2. To further reduce the flammability of UP-resole blends, liquid and reactive types of flame retardants were used. Selected flame retardants were very effective in the UP and also in the least compatible phenolic resole blended system, which is advantageous because of the good mechanical properties of these blends.\n3. To further reduce the flammability of UP and UP-resole blends, the styrene was partially replaced with other reactive diluents, without sacrificing the mechanical properties.\n4. Novolac phenolic resins were chemically modified and blended with UP resin. These blended resins could be cured at temperatures similar to those used for UP alone and had good mechanical and fire retardant properties.\n5. A melamine-formaldehyde resin was also blended with UP. The flammability, and particularly smoke production during burning, were significantly reduced in the blended resins and their composites. However, their mechanical performances were not good, and so further study of these systems was not prioritised.\n6. Bio-derived furan resins of varying degree of compatibility with the UP resin were also studied. Compatible resin blends showed good fire performance. However, owing to lack of time, this route was not pursued.\n\nIn summary, a number of resin blends were studied in depth. Their chemical natures, mechanisms of thermal degradation and burning have been established and presented in scientific papers. Their processabilities in terms of composite preparation is the main contribution to knowledge. Some of the resin blends developed in Bolton were used by the Southampton team in their studies of resin infusion and process modelling. Resin manufacturers can develop and market new resins identified/developed in this project. For example, one of the functionalised novolac resins is self curing, which can be of interest to a phenolic resin manufacturer. \nScott-Bader can market these blended resins.\nComposite manufacturers can use these blended resins. Boatbuliders can use these resins in the construction of light-weight flame retardant vessel superstructures. \nThese systems also have great potential in other transport areas such as in the rail industry.\nThis work is of interest to DSTL who are able to explore the use of modified resins in military vehicles.
