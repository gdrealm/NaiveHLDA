{"id":"2DB53172-7F30-41CF-9732-BE0C85337E0E","title":"Workshop on Spectral Geometry, Chaos and Dynamics","abstractText":"The subject matter of the workshop will address, from a mathematical point of view, questions from physics dating back to Einstein, namely, how do different kinds of classical dynamics affect the predictions of quantum mechanics? Many questions arising naturally in this context are extremely hard to tackle and are likely to require new mathematical toolsets. The workshop will try to bring together experts from different areas of mathematics to identify these.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J02192X/1","grantId":"EP/J02192X/1","fundValue":"17766","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2013-12-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The workshop has had a lot of discussions between experts and problem sessions were well attended. We had a lot of talks where new findings were presented. I personally have used some of the time for collaborations with participants. The workshop was the major event in this field in the UK and one of the important ones in Europe this year.  ","person":"Alexander  Strohmaier","coPersons":["Brian  Winn"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":" The workshop was one of the major conferences in Europe in the field of Quantum Chaos. It has reemphasized the role of the UK as a major player in this field of research. Future directions in Quantum Chaos were identified. Examples are Applications in Number Theory, Relations to Geometry, as well as refinedments of the known results. The workshop will naturally have impact on the research in the area. The conference itself has not produced results as such. Our objectives were instead to identify future directions and questions. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
