{"id":"77FBB7C1-5D29-42F2-8ACE-7F1ADCE466BD","title":"Bayesian model assessment for stochastic epidemic models","abstractText":"Mathematical models for epidemic spread play an increasingly important role in understanding, predicting and controlling real-life disease outbreaks. During recent years, there has been considerable progress in the area of parameterising such models, i.e. estimating model parameters such as infection rates from data on epidemics. However, far less attention has been devoted to model assessment, i.e. determining whether or not models adequately fit the data, and determining whether or not different models would be more suitable. The proposed research seeks to systematically address model assessment for stochastic epidemic models. In particular, (i) simple situations will be analysed in detail to provide generic insights; (ii) new methods will be developed for model assessment for more complex models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F017006/1","grantId":"EP/F017006/1","fundValue":"201440","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  O'Neill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Two distinct topics were considered:\n\n1. Analysis of an epidemic model with non-linear infection pressure. We addressed how far one could distinguish different models for infection rate based on either time-series data or final-outcome data.\n\n2. Bayesian model choice for 2-level-mixing models. We explored methods for calculation of Bayes factors for epidemics among a population partitioned into households in which infections can occur within and between households. Could be of use or interest to those working in modelling of infectious diseases. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
