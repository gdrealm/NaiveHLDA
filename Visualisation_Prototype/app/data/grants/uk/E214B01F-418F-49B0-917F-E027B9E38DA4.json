However, in recent years, there has been a continuous drive to reduce the level of animal testing undertaken to\nsupport risk assessments for new cosmetic products, and a move towards a mechanistic understanding of human\nexposure. Consequently, the development of mechanistic/biologically relevant in vitro, in chemico or in silico models for\npredicting the sensitising potential and/or potency of new chemicals is necessary to generate data leading to increased\nconfidence in predictions of in vivo scenarios. The chemical and biological events driving the induction of human skin\nsensitisation are now well understood and companies such as Unilever use this information in non-animal models to test\nthe safety of new compounds. Discs of ex vivo skin (from cosmetic surgery procedures) are mounted in diffusion cells and\nthe permeation of a test item through the skin is monitored over time. While this has proved to be an adequate model, it\ndoes not truly represent living skin. At present, little is known regarding chemical clearance via dermal capillaries, and this\nis a gap in our mechanistic understanding of the bioavailability of a topically applied chemical in the elicitation of skin\nsensitisation. The proposed capillary bed bioreactor (CBB) better replicates the in vivo environment of the skin and its\nblood supply by providing a bed of pseudovascularisation in the form of hollow fibre membranes. Therefore it should more\naccurately predict permeation of chemicals through the skin, and provide data that more closely resembles that of the in\nvivo scenario. The new bioreactor will be more physiologically accurate than the current model and can therefore\npotentially refine inputs to our mechanistic models for skin sensitisation, to give us more accurate predictions of adverse\noutcomes. This in turn will give greater confidence in our ability to risk assess new ingredients in the future without the\nrequirement for animal testing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506850/1","grantId":"EP/M506850/1","fundValue":"105790","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marianne Jane Ellis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
