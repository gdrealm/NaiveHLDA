However, as malaria transmission levels decrease, it becomes harder to identify individuals who might be carrying parasites using conventional methods (microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests), as many of these infections will be of low density and asymptomatic. Therefore, there is a need for innovative and affordable approaches to identify likely parasite carriers and the areas where they reside. One approach is serological surveillance. A malaria infection will leave an antibody 'footprint' in the serum of the human host that will last longer than the infection itself. Detection of these antibodies is an additional sensitive and specific approach to measure a population's level of exposure to infection. Using antibodies in this way has recently been revitalised by researchers at LSHTM as a method to estimate malaria burden with considerable accuracy.\n\nAntibody measures have been shown to correlate with other conventional estimates of malaria burden (entomological, parasitological and clinical). It has also been shown that by evaluating the antibody responses and age of individuals it is possible to recreate the history of exposure to malaria. This facet allows a retrospective examination of the effect of malaria control interventions in a given locality. This work has primarily been conducted in African settings where Plasmodium falciparum is predominant, however a more recent analysis of samples from Para state, Brazil showed the approach was applicable in this setting. Therefore, the aim of this project is to extend this work by assembling the current evidence on sero-epidemiology and antibody dynamics in Latin America and extending this with novel antibody targets and analytical approaches.\n\nThe expected results of this project are to promote better understanding of the current landscape of sero-surveillance evidence in Latin America and to identify research needs to be addressed in future studies. These studies will be formulated to further strengthen collaboration between participating institutions in developing reliable sero-surveillance methods to estimate species-specific malaria burden in the region, target control methods and ultimately contribute to malaria elimination in the region. This proposal specifically addresses the need for rapid and reliable tools and strategies to measure malaria burden and we believe it will provide considerable information to guide policy makers in Latin America.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M02623X/1","grantId":"MR/M02623X/1","fundValue":"50405","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Drakeley","coPersons":["Kevin  Tetteh"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
