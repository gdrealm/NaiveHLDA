In particular, it will explore the extent to which parents are seeking schools with specific ethnic and class populations ('people like us'). </p>\n\n<p>The project investigates the way in which schools are intimately connected to local spaces and the ways in which parents perceive and participate in their local communities. In-depth qualitative interviews with parents, as well as observations in schools, will be analysed to illuminate how people often view local areas as marked by specific race and class characteristics and how this influences their everyday interactions. It will also enable an analysis of how this affects the way they engage with local institutions, such as schools.</p>\n\n<p>The research will analyse how and why parents do or do not consider questions of race, ethnicity and class in their evaluations of schools. This links to questions of the extent to which they are engaged producing a sense of ethnic, race or class identity for their children. The research will also throw light on parents' perceptions of local areas and community and how this is influenced by their understanding of its class and ethnic make-up. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3466","grantId":"RES-000-22-3466","fundValue":"80483","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bridget  Byrne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
