The results form this work enabled the project to progress through to its current stage and importantly defined the project as one of the main global infrastructural projects. The SKA is now a major Big Data iconic project.\n\nWe are now working on the detailed design of the SKA software and computing system as well as the low-frequency aperture array. The former is of significant impact on the ICT industry and the latter has many design implications for Digital communications.

These Research and Development studies addressed key technology issues for the the SKA, the next generation radio telescope. The main advances made include: development of a full system description and costing model; development of an early design for a low-frequency antenna; analysis of the computing requirements for the SKA.
