We have good reason to believe that climate change will cause a number of infectious diseases to spread to new places or occur more often, particularly vector-borne diseases - those spread by arthropod (mostly insect) pests, such as malaria and dengue. This is because the arthropods that spread these diseases are themselves affected by climate and the environment they live in. While we recognise that climate change will affect vector-borne diseases, we currently have very limited ability to make predictions about what will actually happen in future - even to say which disease will threaten next. We cannot, therefore, give policy makers the information they need to be able to take necessary and timely measures.\n\nOur main aim here is to develop a tool for exploring the nature of vector-disease outbreaks under future conditions of climate and environment, and to assess what interventions may be needed to contain them. We develop the tool for bluetongue (BT), a viral disease of sheep and cattle that is spread by tiny biting insects (midges). BT reappeared in Europe in 1998 after a gap of several decades and, in the next ten years, spread over most of the continent, including the UK in 2007, leading to the deaths of millions of animals, mostly sheep. This BT outbreak was unprecedented: the longest and largest on record; numerous countries, including Italy, France, Germany and UK, were affected for the first time; disease occurred much further north than ever before; and a large number of viral strains were involved. Furthermore, the disease continues to threaten: midges are hugely abundant on our farms, feeding on our animals, and for the majority of viral strains there is no vaccine immediately available for use.\n\nWe have chosen BT because it is considered a prime example of a disease that has emerged already in response to climate change. The tool we propose to develop is a novel mathematical model for the spread of BT between farms in GB, integrated with state-of-the-art climate model projections of the future, so that we can investigate the way in which the disease will spread under conditions of future climate (up to 2050), and what interventions may be required in the event of an outbreak. \n\nIt will not only be climate that changes by 2050 however. Other environmental changes may also affect BT, although we have only limited understanding of what these 'drivers' are and very little knowledge of how they will change. We will hold a workshop to solicit expert opinion about non-climate drivers and scenarios for how they might change in future; and we will then consider the effect of these changes within our modelling system.\n\nModel-based predictions of the future are always uncertain. It is useful to try to measure the scale of this uncertainty, and also from where in the model it is arising, so as to better understand the limitations of the predictions and to guide further work. We will investigate whether the main source of uncertainty in our model arises because we do not understand BT well enough, or because we have insufficient clarity about the future conditions that BT will occur in.\n\nFinally, we know already that some uncertainty arises in our disease model from limited knowledge of the biology of the insects that spread BT. We will trap Culicoides at 144 farms across England and Wales in order to map them, statistically analyse the results with weather and climate data to improve our models; and undertake detailed studies on a smaller number of farms to investigate how able the midges are to spread BT virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J016144/1","grantId":"BB/J016144/1","fundValue":"107340","fundStart":"2013-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Diggle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" We are still in the early stages of this project, which is being conducted in collaboration with a team of veterinary scientists at the University of Liverpool.
