{"id":"D9BBFB0D-6A87-433A-BD25-EA525DB06D9B","title":"Understanding Household Finance through Better Measurement","abstractText":"To date there are no surveys in the UK (or other developed countries) that measure income, expenditure, assets and debts for the same households. These data limitations constrain our understanding of the dynamics of living standards. For example, expenditure surveys in the UK and other countries suggest that households with the lowest incomes spend as much as households with much higher incomes. It is however not known whether this pattern is the result of measurement error in expenditure or income or whether it reflects genuine borrowing or dissaving. Having data about the assets and debts of a household over time, in addition to income and expenditure, would enable analysts to resolve this puzzle. Understanding the spending, saving and borrowing of households is critical for assessing the sustainability of economic growth, including whether the current recovery is fuelled by unsustainable consumer spending. There are other similar unresolved puzzles. For example, in survey data richer households save larger proportions of their income, however aggregate savings rates have not increased over time as real incomes have increased. This discrepancy could again be due to measurement error or reflect true behaviours. A better understanding of household finances will allow a clearer picture of which households are disadvantaged, and how advantage and disadvantage cumulate across time and generations.\n\nThe reason why no existing survey collects data about all aspects of a household's finances is because it would take a very long questionnaire. This would be costly to conduct and burdensome for respondents. Through interdisciplinary collaboration between topic experts, survey methodologists and experts in commercial market research, we aim to develop methods of data collection that reduce costs and respondent burden, while maintaining or improving the quality of each data component. We will develop a web survey that will have at its core a reconciliation screen where respondents are asked to balance the totals of their income, expenditure, assets and debts. We will repeat this survey, to test the potential of boosting the reconciliation by incorporating information from the previous interview. To reduce the length of the survey we will assess ways of collecting components of household finances prior to the survey, using new technologies already routinely used in commercial market research. These data would be preloaded into the web questionnaire and incorporated into the reconciliation screen. We will explore the feasibility, data quality and costs of different potential technologies, including technologies that would reduce respondent burden by capturing data passively. For example, barcode scanners to collect detailed expenditure data, coding of till receipts, linking to store card data, or asking survey respondents to sign up to a &quot;financial aggregator&quot; service and relaying the data to us. To help respondents provide more accurate reports in the web survey we will also assess the potential for in-the-moment surveys triggered at salient dates such as the deadline for self-assessment tax returns or tax credit renewals, when sub-groups of respondents will have better knowledge of their income, and the potential for using elements of 'gamification' to increase respondent engagement with the survey and reduce burden. We will assess the quality of data obtained with different methods by examining the balance of the household accounting identity and the quality of individual components. To inform the development work and methodological tests we will carry out experiments in an existing survey (the Understanding Society Innovation Panel) to test methods aimed at reducing under-reporting of income. In addition, we will carry out secondary analyses using existing data sources. \n\nWe will apply the data generated to understanding current puzzles in household finances, and make the data available to other researchers in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N006534/1","grantId":"ES/N006534/1","fundValue":"250813","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Elisabeth Jackle","coPersons":["Mike  Brewer","Mick  Couper","Thomas Fraser Crossley","Cormac  O'Dea","Carli  Lessof"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
