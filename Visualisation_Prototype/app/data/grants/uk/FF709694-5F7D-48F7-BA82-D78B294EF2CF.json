{"id":"FF709694-5F7D-48F7-BA82-D78B294EF2CF","title":"A protocol for assessing the effects of treatment on the function of brain networks implicated in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and ADHD","abstractText":"In both schizophrenia and in ADHD, cognitive impairments are seriously disabling yet current treatments are not adequate. In schizophrenia, current treatments have limited effect, while in ADHD the main concerns are adverse side-effects and limited long term benefits. In both conditions, the cognitive impairments appear to arise from poor coordination of activity in networks of neurons linking widespread brain regions. \n\nThe chemical messenger molecule glutamate plays a key role in delivering the information carried by long range neural fibres between remote brain regions, while another messenger molecule, GABA, acts locally to fine-tune the message. Pharmacological agents that modulate glutamate and/or GABA may therefore enhance cognitive function in conditions such as schizophrenia and ADHD in which these networks are disrupted. However, progress has been slow, partly due to lack of good techniques for testing drugs at an early stage of development, and partly because efficient network connectivity is not simply a matter of neurotransmitter levels. The brain's plasticity means that that the networks are sculpted by use, and pharmacological correction of neurotransmitter levels alone may be inadequate to restore function unless it is also accompanied by cognitive training designed to re-sculpt the abnormal networks. Psychiatrist and neuroscientist John H Krystal has invoked the analogy of fitting a horse shoe: drug treatment is like heating the metal to make it malleable, while training is the process of hammering it into shape. Neither alone is likely to produce a well fitting shoe. Therapy that combines pharmacological correction of neurotransmitter abnormalities with cognitive training programs designed to sculpt healthy network connections may hold considerably more promise than either strategy alone. \n\nWe will use a novel treatment-testing procedure that combines ultra-high-field Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), which can measure levels of glutamate, GABA and other related molecules at specified regions of the brain, with Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which can measure the amount of neural electrical activity between nodes of the brain networks that support cognitive performance. Using the internet, we will recruit healthy volunteers with traits similar to those of schizophrenia (&quot;schizotypy&quot;) and of ADHD, as well as a group of volunteers with low levels of these traits, and record MRS and MEG data, as well as &quot;resting state&quot; fMRI data. Then in the participants with schizotypy and ADHD traits, we will test the effects of a drug that is predicted to enhance cognition by modifying glutamate and GABA signalling in the brain. Half the participants will take the active drug, and half a placebo. We will also ask the volunteers to engage in a cognitive training exercise while MEG scanning is in process, allowing us to measure not only the average effect of the drug, but also any effects of the drug on the way their networks change during learning. \n \nUnlike other MRS techniques, our ultra-high field MRS techniques allow us to distinguish clearly between the various molecules associated with communication between neurons. We have also developed novel procedures for analysing MEG data, which is acquired at closely spaced time points using 275 sensors, giving us high resolution in both time and space, and enabling us to map rapid changes in network activity. In this project, we will refine these techniques and analytical procedures further in order to develop a powerful research tool with which to test potential new treatments for cognitive impairments in mental disorders, particularly those that arise from disruption to long-range brain networks. With this tool, we plan to conduct further research into new treatments for cognitive impairment in mental disorders, particularly those that combine pharmaceutical agents with cognitive training.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J01186X/1","grantId":"MR/J01186X/1","fundValue":"333677","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Francis Liddle","coPersons":["Peter Gordon Morris","Matthew Jon Brookes","Rhiannon  Corcoran","Lena  Palaniyappan","Marios G  Philiastides","Elizabeth Bruce Liddle","Chris  Hollis"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
