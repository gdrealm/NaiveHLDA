{"id":"B8AC8989-23BD-40EE-A008-10E45A46CC47","title":"Embedded minisymposia in Equadiff 2011","abstractText":"The `Equadiff' meeting is held every four years in Western Europe, and will take place from 1 to 5 August 2011 at Loughborough University. It is concerned with the mathematical analysis of differential equations (equations which model the physical world). This year's Equadiff has two strands: plenary talks which survey the state of the art in the subject, and research minisymposia.\n\nThis proposal is for the funding of fifteen invited research minisymposia at the conference. The themes of the minisymposia are chosen in areas in which classical UK strengths will attract new international collaborations or in areas in which the UK is underrepresented and will benefit from international expertise.\n\nThe plenary lectures and summaries of the research carried out at the minisymposia will be published in a special issue of an academic journal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J006343/1","grantId":"EP/J006343/1","fundValue":"18709","fundStart":"2011-08-09","fundEnd":"2011-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark David Groves","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
