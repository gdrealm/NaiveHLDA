However, our predictive methods for this region are unreliable, due to a lack of observations and a poor understanding of the processes controlling the West African Monsoon (WAM). As part of the international AMMA programme the UK will undertake a substantial effort, involving 8 institutions and more than 30 scientists, to measure the physical and chemical processes which determine the local climate and its global impacts. AMMA-UK will install an array of ground-based stations, between the tropical forest of the Guinea coast and the Sahara desert, to monitor climate over a two-year period. Within the vegetation canopy, measurements will be made of the environmental quantities which determine disease propagation and these will be related to the larger-scale weather and climate as derived from satellite observations. In the summer of 2006, an intensive campaign of aircraft and balloon-borne measurements will be used to analyse the atmospheric state and composition. Using a synthesis of the full set of measurements, the interaction of patterns of soil moisture and vegetation with weather systems and atmospheric composition will be determined. A co-ordinated programme of modelling will describe the role of the WAM in the global climate, improve our understanding of droughts and contribute to improved forecasts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/B505554/1","grantId":"NE/B505554/1","fundValue":"156405","fundStart":"2006-01-11","fundEnd":"2009-09-10","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas  Parker","coPersons":["Richard  Harding","Alastair  Lewis","Adrian John Matthews","Christopher Matthew Taylor","Andrew Paul Morse","Paul Steven Monks","Hugh  Coe","John Adrian  Pyle","James Benedict McQuaid","Dwayne Ellis Heard","M  Pilling","Claire  Reeves","Roderic  Jones"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" Please see details for lead institution: NE/G505538/1.
