{"id":"AFE27B17-2BC1-45CA-9EF1-C0A91BF95620","title":"Age Diversity at the Workplace: A Comparative Study on the Influence of National Institutions on Employers' Age Manageme","abstractText":"<p>The management of an ageing workforce will be one of the most important human resource (HR) challenges of the next decades. The European Union has set ambitious targets for increase in older peopleâ€™s participation in the workforce which can only be realised if employers are encouraged to make work more attractive to older people by offering flexibility, training, and rewarding jobs which contribute to self-worth.&nbsp; Progress in achieving an age positive approach to HRM varies by sector, but skills shortages and pension demands are persuading many employers of the benefits of encouraging delayed retirement.</p> \n<p>This one year study will explore age diversity practices of two matched case study pairs of British and German organisations. The research will focus on the role of industrial relation institutions in implementing age management policies, and a comparison will be made of case studies operating under the German social model and British voluntarist industrial relations regimes. The research will focus on occupations where there are significant skill shortages, and will draw case studies from both the private and public sectors. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be held with managers and employee representatives, and focus groups will be conducted with employees from selected occupational groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E020380/1","grantId":"ES/E020380/1","fundValue":"80765","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Muller-Camen","coPersons":["Matthew Chrisopher Flynn"],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
