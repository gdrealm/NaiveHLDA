{"id":"4EADE29F-C009-4307-978E-7CE2079A5701","title":"QuDOS: Quantum technologies using Diffractive Optical Structures","abstractText":"The project will develop a compact and simplified apparatus for the preparation of cold atomic samples. Conventionally, a\nmultiple beam geometry is required to laser cool and trap atoms and, with this, comes a corresponding overhead of optical\ncomponents within a mechanical framework. Here, we propose to use a novel approach in which all the beams required for\ncooling and trapping are generated by a single beam reflected from a grating chip. The technique has wide relevance to\nquantum technologies as it forms the primary stage for all atomic sensing devices including gravimeters, inertial sensors\nand clocks. The project brings the academic excellence of the University of Strathclyde together with the industrial knowhow\nof M Squared Lasers to exploit this world-leading innovation from the UK's research base. We will take it closer to\ncommercialisation by commissioning a chip trap within an industrial environment, enhancing the technique and\ndemonstrating measurement capability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M50824X/1","grantId":"EP/M50824X/1","fundValue":"93055","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Aidan Shaun Arnold","coPersons":["Erling  Riis"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
