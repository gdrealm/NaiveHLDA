The Dzero experiment is searching for the Higgs boson and other new physics phenomena. More than 600 physicists from the US, Europe, Asia and South America work on the experiment. In this proposal I ask for support to work on the Dzero experiment in the coming two years as Physics Coordinator of the experiment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F003447/1","grantId":"ST/F003447/1","fundValue":"55662","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
