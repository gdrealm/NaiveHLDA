Such systems may involve hardware, software and human organizations; though very common in practice, as yet such systems lack robust scientific and engineering support. The project will do this by developing a rigorous methodology supported by a toolkit based on structured behavioural representations (structured occurrence nets). The effective use of such representations greatly reduces the cognitive complexity of, and the storage and computational resources involved in the modelling and manipulation, of large systems. Moreover, it offers a solution to the difficult problem of representing and analyzing the behaviour of systems that are evolving, e.g. through being subject to modification (by other systems). The power and generality of the new formalism of structured occurrence nets, and the potential of our planned toolkit, will be demonstrated using three case studies: (i) the verification of asynchronous VLSI circuits, (ii) on-line deadlock detection in networks-on-a-chip, and (iii) in partnership with a leading commercial developer of such systems, a major crime investigation support system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K001698/1","grantId":"EP/K001698/1","fundValue":"559122","fundStart":"2013-01-14","fundEnd":"2016-01-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maciej  Koutny","coPersons":["Victor  Khomenko","Alexandre  Yakovlev","Brian  Randell"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
