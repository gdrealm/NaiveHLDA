{"id":"AD5709ED-DB30-4065-BFB3-17BE45166D2D","title":"The Structural basis of Toxoplasma gondii invasion: Micronemal protein interactions","abstractText":"The phylum Apicomplexa contains some of the most widespread protozoan parasites of humans and animals. Key members include Plasmodium spp., Eimeria spp., Neospora caninium and Toxoplasma gondii. Not only has T. gondii emerged as the principal model for the study of other apicomplexa parasites it is an important pathogen in its own right, causing severe disseminated disease. Infection by apicomplexans is established in the host by rapid and forced invasion of host cells. Proteins secreted at the first stage of this process, participate in apical attachment to host cell surfaces and the formation of a connection with the parasite actinomyosin system, thereby providing the platform from which to drive invasion - these are called microneme proteins (MICs). \nWe plan to investigate some fundamental aspects of how MICs assemble into surface complexes and discriminate host ligands, which will provide new information on how the parasite works at the molecular level. Our work should provide a foundation that may reveal new pathways to the development of antimicrobial strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400423","grantId":"G0400423","fundValue":"230151","fundStart":"2005-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Matthews","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
