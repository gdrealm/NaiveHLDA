Participants will revisit key moments in their life histories (eg transition to adulthood) and aspects of their everyday life (eg established routines) to prompt awareness of their personal investments in energy use. </p>\n\n<p>Phase 2: an extended period of more in-depth qualitative longitudinal research (supplemented by visual methods) incorporating repeat interviews after a further 5 and 10 months with a subset of participants in each case location. </p>\n\n<p>The aim is to produce more complex and realistic understandings of how and why individuals' energy biographies develop as they do, and the unintended and intended consequences of energy demand reduction interventions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-628-25-0028","grantId":"RES-628-25-0028","fundValue":"699910","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Henwood","coPersons":["Karen Anne Parkhill","Catherine Christina Butler","Nicholas  Pidgeon"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
