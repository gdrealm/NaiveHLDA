{"id":"C1738B5C-9AD5-4724-9416-C9BC4FCDF195","title":"Human Epidermal Neural Crest Stem Cells","abstractText":"Stem cell biology is a promising new area of research that is likely to lead to new treatments for many debilitating diseases. There exist different types of stem cell, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. This application deals with a novel type of adult stem cell. Adult stem cells are safe because they do not form tumours when transplanted into the body and they do not raise ethical concerns. Adult stem cells have been used in medical practice for many years. A prime example are blood stem cells that are used to treat leukaemia. The adult stem cells on which this application focuses are named epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSC) according to their origin and their location. They originate from an embryonic tissue, the neural crest, and they persist after birth in the epidermis of the hair follicle. The neural crest is an embryonic tissue that forms many vital tissues in our bodies. Some examples include bone of the face and skull; the teeth; all nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord; neurons sensing pain, touch, and temperature; muscle cells of the top part of the heart and their connecting large blood vessels. The Sieber-Blum group and colleagues have discovered and characterized EPI-NCSC in the mouse and found, among other results, that they can give rise to all neural crest derivatives, including bone/cartilage cells, nerve cells, nerve supporting cells, and muscle cells. The most exciting result was that mouse EPI-NCSC implanted into the injured mouse spinal cord caused improvement in sensing touch. The current grant application deals for the first time with EPI-NCSC from humans. It has 5 aims; (1) developing techniques to amplify the cell numbers into millions of stem cells in the culture plate; (2) making sure that there are no chromosome breaks while the cells grow in culture; (3) separating EPI-NCSC from cells that already might have started to develop; (4) confirming that human EPI-NCSC do not form tumors when implanted into the body; (5) create bone cells within a three-dimensional scaffold and identify markers that characterize the bone cells. After all five aims are fulfilled, expectations are that the manufactured bone cells are ready for pre-clinical testing in animal models. There is a high demand for bone in regenerative medicine with an annual market opportunity of 155 billion dollar for dental/cranial regeneration and orthopaedic biomaterials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802547","grantId":"G0802547","fundValue":"406361","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maya  Sieber-Blum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
