{"id":"2C27AEB4-A930-4926-BD99-58934BEF36F5","title":"CCP on Computational Magnetism","abstractText":"CCP-mag is a newly proposed Collaborative Computational Project, which brings together UK researchers in the field of magnetism. Magnetic phenomena are technologically highly relevant, and have applications, ranging from magnetic storage in computers, over strong permanent magnets, as used in wind driven generators, to magnetic cooling devices, which could replace current refrigerators by more energy efficient ones, or magnetic sensors.\n\nA full understanding of these complex phenomena, which could lead to the development of novel materials, requires a simultaneous understanding of different aspects of magnetism, starting from the microscopic, quantum mechanic phenomena, giving rise to magnetism in the first place, to geometrical effects of electromagnetism, which are relevant at larger length scales. The UK already has very strong groups, working on different facets of magnetism and using different techniques to study magnetic phenomena.\n\nThe main emphasis of this CCP-mag network is on a multi-scale description of magnetic materials, and on methods and codes used by experimentalists to analyse and interpret their measurements. The aim is to combine the present expertise, and bring the groups together to tackle the complex phenomena simultaneously on different length scales. To this end, we will interface the existing codes, such that they can exchange data in an easy way, to provide new ways of calculations, which previously would be very difficult to perform.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M022668/1","grantId":"EP/M022668/1","fundValue":"203010","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2020-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Staunton","coPersons":["Martin  Lueders"],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
