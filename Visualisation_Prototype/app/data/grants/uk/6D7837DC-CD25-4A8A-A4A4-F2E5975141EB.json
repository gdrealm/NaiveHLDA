{"id":"6D7837DC-CD25-4A8A-A4A4-F2E5975141EB","title":"UKCA-NASA Astrobiology Summer Academy 2014","abstractText":"The UK Centre for Astrobiology (UKCA)-NASA Astrobiology Summer Academy is a summer school run in July 2014 designed to give teachers and high school students the opportunity to experience research, engage with scientists and work at the interface of some of the most exciting cutting edge questions in science today such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is there life elsewhere? The academy builds on our highly successful 2013 pilot scheme.\n\nThe summer school is split into two weeks. One week is for teachers and one week is for students. In this proposal to STFC, we seek funding for just the teacher segment of the academy. The aims of the academy during this week are as follows:\n\n&gt; Expose teachers to researchers and the excitement of taking part in real science.\n&gt; Give teachers ideas in astrobiology and interdisciplinary science that can be incorporated into lesson plans and the national curriculum.\n&gt; Develop focused, fully integrated lesson plans that can be transplanted directly from the academy to the school environment, thus achieving national impact.\n&gt; Building a cadre of astrobiology teachers that can work with us in the future in advancing astrobiology teaching in the UK.\n\nThe legacy of this project will be to generate new lesson plans that will aid in delivering national curriculum, specifically using astrobiology to teach information across interdisciplinary boundaries, where some of the world's major questions and challenges lie (e.g. climate change, resource limitation). We see astrobiology as a vehicle for teaching wider ideas in science, communication and collaborative working through teachers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005115/1","grantId":"ST/L005115/1","fundValue":"8535","fundStart":"2014-07-06","fundEnd":"2014-08-05","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Seaton Cockell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
