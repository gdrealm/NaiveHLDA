{"id":"7C736511-16F0-4B57-BD35-3F7021D2FFBB","title":"Workshop - Complex Nanophotonics Science Camp","abstractText":"The community that investigates light propagation, localization and its nano-scale interaction with quantum emitters in complex photonic and biological media is standing up with multidisciplinary background and a joint interest in complex nanophotonics. A new generation of scientists engaging with the topics of complex nanophotonics is emerging from different fields, from single-molecule nano-optics to biomedical imaging and sensing, from quantum networks to light management for solar cells, from Anderson localization of light to high sensitive biosensing. \nThe Complex Nanophotonics Science Camp will discuss latest progress, future developments and facilitate the formation of a community driven by the next generation of junior scientists linked by the common passion for complexity and nano- and bio-photonics, by giving them visibility and building a contact network around them.\n\nWe have chosen the format of a &quot;science camp&quot; to break from the traditional conference format, which are often showcases of career-long investigations, to try to engage the creativity of early-stage scientists (strictly &lt;10 years from their Ph.D.) and create new scientific connections, fostering critical thinking. For this reasons we have left one last afternoon free to self-organize during the conference, with an open program, taking inspiration from other science camp events, like Google SciFoo, and we have chosen a long poster session to prepare for an evening debate on science-related topics like science communication, data visualization or open access and social media for science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K034030/1","grantId":"EP/K034030/1","fundValue":"13208","fundStart":"2013-04-02","fundEnd":"2013-12-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The workshop has been very successful, we have started forming a community of early-career researcher, via the website sciencecamp.eu as well as a linked group. Among the participants research exchanges have been promoted as well as scientific new results. \nThis year the meeting will take place again, as we believe that further impact of this field will benefit from a discussion on how to capitalize on these fundamental ideas and convert them into real-world applications.

Evening discussions were held with expert panellists (Kosmas Tsakmakidis, Nature Materials; Ad Lagendijk, professor and opinion-maker; Timo Hannay, Digital Science/NPG; Kostas Repanas, A-Star Singapore) about a variety of topics related to scientific publishing, data sharing and visualization, and open innovation. The event helped shaping a new community and brought together a next generation of scientists in an informal and stimulating setting which has raised much praise (see the www.sciencecamp.eu website for a podcast of the 2013 event). The website of the workshop has a detailed record of the meeting, including programme and podcast. The Linkedin group is open to researchers and students.
