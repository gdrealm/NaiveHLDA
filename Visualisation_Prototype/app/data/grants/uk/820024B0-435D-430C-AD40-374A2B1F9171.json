It is found throughout the world and in some countries it affects humans too, causing serious and sometimes fatal disease.\nFluke infected cattle lose weight, become anaemic, lethargic and stop being productive. This has a serious effect on the welfare of the animal and serious economic consequences for the farmer. It is thought that fluke costs UK agriculture at least &pound;300million pounds a year through direct losses, but real costs are probably much higher. \nFluke has become much more common over the past 10 years, due in part to our changing weather patterns, wet summers and mild winters favour the development of the parasite and its vector - a mud snail, found commonly throughout Britain. In a recent study we found 75% of dairy herds had evidence of fluke infection. Future climate change is predicted to have a significant impact on prevalence of infection, changing the epidemiology and increasing incidence of disease. Increased cattle movements and changes to both farm management and environmental schemes are exacerbating the problem. A limited range of drugs is available to control fasciolosis. Only one drug - triclabendazole (TCBZ), is effective against early and late juvenile and adult stages of the parasite and is used extensively for prophylaxis and treatment of disease. There is growing evidence of resistance to TCBZ in fluke populations, moreover the European Medicines Agency has recently revised its advice on drugs used to treat fluke such that they are now contra-indicated in dairy animals.\nTargeted use of drugs, at specific times of year will slow the development of drug resistance and reduce the overall quantity of drug used, but a better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission of disease is vital if we are to develop control programmes that rely on improved on farm management practises rather than depending solely on drugs. This ultimately will be a sustainable and cot-effective way to control both clinical and sub-clinical disease in cattle and is the express desire of the livestock industry. \nSpecifically requested by the farming industry, the purpose of this project is to produce new, sustainable, bespoke control programmes for beef and dairy farms, to reduce losses associated with fluke infection. \nIn order to achieve this we must first develop diagnostic tests to identify infected herds. We already have good tools that we can use on milk samples to detect infected dairy herds but we need similar tests that are appropriate for beef herds. In addition we are aware of a newly emerging parasite problem, the rumen fluke. It is not clear if this parasite causes disease but it has the potential to interfere with the diagnostic tests we are developing for fluke. Therefore we will also develop a molecular test for rumen fluke.\nSecondly we will develop a system to categorise snail habitats that can be used to analyse satellite maps on a regional geographic scale to obviate the need to visit every farm to investigate snail habitat. We will also investigate how cow behaviour affects how the parasite gets to a snail host and from the snail host back to the cow.\nThese are risk factors for fluke infection on a farm. Other risk factors, particularly husbandry practices, physical and environmental factors will be obtained from a study of 250 farms and these data fed into statistical and mathematical models to determine theoretically which of these factors are the most important in determining whether a farm has fluke or not. Concurrently we will assess the cost-benefit of changing these practices. Finally we will conduct a trial to evaluate if changing farm practice is effective in reducing levels of infection. We are working in partnership with the Agricultural Levy boards of the UK to implement improved control of fluke infection to benefit animal health, welfare and profitability of livestock farming in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K015249/1","grantId":"BB/K015249/1","fundValue":"148062","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Members of the consortium have participated or organised 16 workshops and presentations to farmers groups, industry, vets through CPD and the public. This has raised awareness of the impact of fluke infection in cattle, in terms of disease and welfare of individual animals but also the economic impact of sub-clinical infection. We have also had impact on the use of the drug, triclabendazole.

Copro-antigen test no better than FEC and not effective with composite samples. Composite faecal egg counts, sampling 40 animals, making 4x10 animal composites using 10g faeces most cost-efficient method of identifying and semi-quantifying level of infection in beef herds.\nWP2 - Cattle grazing behaviour and snail distribution analysed on four test farms. Snail and grass samples evaluated for evidence of fluke infection. Snails were only found in poor (rushy/wet) ground. Low numbers of snails found this year - unusually dry year. Cattle tended to defaecate more frequently on improved pasture or around water courses.\nWP3 - Lists of dairy and beef farms in England and Wales obtained from DEFRA and permission sought to contact them. Questionnaire developed and trialled. 250 farms in Shropshire/Staffordshire contacted; 10 farms visited and sampled to date.\nWP4 - A herd level economic model has been parameterised for dairy, grower, suckler and finisher enterprises. Development of a national economic model is under way. The findings are from Year 1 of the project so are still to be validated within the project.\nThe economic models are in progress but when published will inform policy makers and the industry on appropriate cost-effective control measures Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
