We explored ways of exploiting opportunities for literacy educators as follows: </p>\n\n<p>Bringing&nbsp;together senior and new scholars from a variety of fields in order to develop appropriate approaches to research. In 5 seminars and a 1-day conference in 9 months we were able to identify key themes and approaches. </p>\n\n<p>We identified and explored exciting contemporary innovations in educational activities that are making use of virtual online spaces. Using our core group and other connections, we were able to bring together analyses of many cutting-edge activities.</p>\n\n<p>We were particularly pleased that we succeeded in finding excellent practice across the relevant ages and stages from the Early Years to Secondary. We aimed to make a distinctive contribution through enacting a creative approach to dissemination. Intenet telephony (Skype) enabled us to involve colleagues in USA and Australia. We held the second half of our one day final dissemination conference in the virtual world Second Life, enabling substantial international participation at no cost to delegates. This creative approach saved one third of the original budget. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001638/1","grantId":"ES/H001638/1","fundValue":"17619","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Gillen","coPersons":["Guy  Merchant","Jacqueline Ann Marsh","J  Davies"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
