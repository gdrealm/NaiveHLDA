Commitments made\nby the UK government and others to tackle climate change require an expansion in development and deployment of\nrenewable technologies and it is widely recognised that ocean wave energy will play an important role in meeting future\ntargets for the reduction of carbon emissions. Whilst significant advances have been made over the last 35 years in\ndeveloping new ideas aimed towards producing robust and economically viable wave energy converters (WECs) there\nremains no clear consensus on future direction of design and operation of WECs.\nIn addition to supporting existing concepts, it is important that promising new ideas for wave energy conversion continue to\nbe explored. It is widely accepted that there are two key elements to a successful WEC design. First, the design should be\ndriven by fundamental theoretical principles of wave energy absorption as these ultimately determine the capacity for\npower conversion. Second, prospective designs must take account of the significant engineering challenges that arise\nwhen operating in harsh marine environments.\nIn a recent paper &quot;A submerged cylinder wave energy converter&quot; Crowley, Porter &amp; Evans, Journal of Fluid Mechanics,\n2013, vol 716, (hereafter CPE) advocated a WEC design which sought to address these two demands. In particular, the\ndesign was assumed to use an internal power take-off system consisting of a pendulum rotating on a horizontal axis whose rotation was damped to produce power. Such a design benefits by its isolation from the marine environment, mechanically\nrobust by relying on few moving parts and free from end-stop problems associated with over-excitation of the device. A\ncombination of theoretical and numerical results demonstrated that the device of CPE extracts significant power over a\nbroad range of energy-dense wave periods. Indeed, a mean capture factor more than double any existing WEC of its type\nwas predicted.\nThe WITT developed by WITT Limited under whom this TSB grant is being led is closely related to the device conceived in\nthe work of CPE. Instead of a linear device working in surge/pitch modes of motion enclosed within a long cylinder, the\nWITT is a device designed for use in buoys. It not only converts power in surge and pitch modes but also in sway and roll.\nThe WITT has been developed by specialists in gear transmission systems and has been shown to have high efficiency in\nconversion of kinetic to electric power. It is scalable and robust.\nThe project being led by WITT includes partners specialising in mooring systems and marine deployment, power take-off\ndesign and manufacture and experimental methods including wave tank testing.\nIn Bristol, the project will develop a theoretical model for the operation of the WITT WEC device as a spherical buoy either\nfloating or submerged, to include effect of the mooring lines, the device and its interaction with a model sea state and the\ninternal power take-off system. The work will be based on the earlier work of CPE, with changes implementated to account\nfor the revised converter geometry, mooring line configuration and power take-off system. After verification tests have been\ncompleted, an optimisation method will be applied to determine parameters for optimal power conversion for WITT devices\nover a range of physical scales.\nThe work will develop in tandem with other partners on the project, in particular in developing the optimal mooring system\nand through the validation of theoretical predictions by the experimental work performed in Southampton.\nThe successful completion of this project will result in a set of experimentally-validated theoretical results for a WEC design\nwith the potential to be developed a larger scale and eventually to full scale commercialisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508640/1","grantId":"EP/N508640/1","fundValue":"85601","fundStart":"2015-05-05","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Porter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
