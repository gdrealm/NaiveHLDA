Are traditional meta-analysis approaches to reviewing the self-concept intervention literature appropriate for addressing this question? </p> \n<p>To answer these questions, we propose a new multilevel approach to meta-analysis to test a multidimensional theoretical model of self-concept intervention studies. The proposed research represents an innovative, synergistic blend of methodological and substantive research interests. The substantive emphasis is on exploring what factors contribute to the effectiveness of self-concept interventions, as well as issues in evaluating self-concept interventions. In particular, the multidimensionality of the self-concept construct will be examined through a construct validity approach. The methodological emphasis is on differences between traditional meta-analytic models and a new multilevel approach developed as part of the proposed research. These different approaches will be compared for both real (self-concept intervention) and artificial (simulated) data to evaluate implications of violations of statistical assumptions underlying meta-analysis that are particularly relevant for multidimensional constructs like self-concept. It will have important implications for policymakers and practitioners - those with a particular interest in self-concept and self-esteem, as well as potential consumers of meta-analyses, which are increasingly being used as a basis for public policy development</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E005667/1","grantId":"ES/E005667/1","fundValue":"75163","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Herb  Marsh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
