Work and employment remain a central concern to people's livelihoods, wellbeing and identities. But how are the terms, nature and quality of work and employment determined? In other words, what is the system of regulation that shapes and reproduces these terms?</p>\n\n<p>The regulation of work and employment has always generated debate about the competing demands between economic concerns (eg, competitiveness and productivity), and social concerns (eg, worker rights, equality and social justice). However, the global financial crisis has created a high degree of tension as businesses struggle to reconcile the need to survive intensified competition whilst dealing with the fragmentation of work and employment relations.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series takes an important step in looking at regulation of work and employment from multidisciplinary, multilevelperspectives, framing the discussion within the context of an international dialogue as the most appropriate way to have concrete impact on different stakeholders. The series will contribute to developing understanding of these issues and in doing so; it will inform policies, strategies and practices of government, businesses and unions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000660/1","grantId":"ES/L000660/1","fundValue":"28131","fundStart":"2013-11-30","fundEnd":"2015-11-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny K  Rodriguez","coPersons":["Stewart  Johnstone","TRACY  SCURRY","Stephen  Hughes","ROBERT PAUL  STEWART","Greg  Bamber"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
