It is a complex combination of specialized cells and proteins that recognize and kill bacteria and viruses. It is also extremely effective in recognizing and eliminating normal cells that may be sick or damaged. \n\nA key protein that we all have in our blood is called serum amyloid P component (SAP). A closely related protein (CRP) is better known as an inflammatory marker that is routinely tested by doctors in blood samples of patients with suspected infection or inflammation. Much research has been performed to understand the role of SAP in numerous diseases especially protein folding conditions (such as systemic amyloidosis), and amyloid-related diseases that principally affect the brain, such as Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) and Alzheimer's, however we know very little about the normal function of SAP.\n\nA major discovery was that SAP binds to DNA - the component of our cells that contains our genetic information. However, because SAP is normally found in our blood rather than inside cells where the DNA is normally located, it is believed that SAP scavenges DNA that is released into our blood from diseased or damaged cells. This is of critical importance, because it prevents the immune system from attacking our normal DNA, which can have disastrous consequences (such as in the disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)).\n\nAs well as binding to DNA, the applicant and others have shown that SAP binds to a number of important targets including RNA - another critically important molecule normally found in our cells. Other important binding targets of SAP include bacteria, the extracellular matrix (a supporting scaffold for cells and tissues) and a wide range of immune proteins and cells. The full significance of these other interactions is yet to be determined.\n\nThe aim of this project is to determine how SAP binds to DNA at the molecular level. The applicant has successfully performed preliminary experiments making initial mutants of SAP in collaboration with the Oxford Protein Production Facility (OPPF). Now, in pilot studies with colleagues in Portsmouth who are experts in DNA-protein interactions, the applicant has determined how tightly SAP binds to DNA sequences and, for the first time, to RNA. We are poised to identify the sections of SAP responsible for binding to the various targets by mutating parts of the SAP molecule.\n\nThis fundamental research work will help us understand various human conditions linked to ageing. Furthermore, by understanding more about how this protein works, we can determine whether it is a suitable drug target for diseases such as Alzheimer's, SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility that by acting as a DNA scavenger, SAP prevents DNA vaccination working in humans. By understanding more about how SAP recognizes DNA, this work could significantly contribute towards the development of new and safer vaccines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L019442/1","grantId":"BB/L019442/1","fundValue":"356371","fundStart":"2014-09-22","fundEnd":"2017-09-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Erik Kolstoe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
