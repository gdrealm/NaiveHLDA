Currently, there is great interest in nanotechnology, the science of constructing and studying objects at nanometre scales (a billionth of a metre). Research in this area has shown that when materials are reduced down to this size scale, or have alterations to their shape at this length, entirely new properties can arise that are radically different from when they exist in a bulk form. By finding ways of harnessing these unusual properties, new technologies can be developed for improved electronic devices, medical tools and even construction materials. However, the development of convenient methods for assembling structurally and chemically complex surfaces with such nanometre control remains a formidable challenge.\n\nOne possible means of addressing this issue is to combine two powerful methods of generating nano-scale objects: The first uses an instrument called a &quot;scanning probe microscope&quot;, which employs miniature electrical motors to move a very sharp tip, the &quot;probe&quot; of the instrument that is only a few nanometres wide. The instrument is also able to control the movement of this probe with nanometre precision. This ability to move and position the probe with such fine control makes it possible to use it to &quot;write&quot; patterns on surfaces. Together with this method is the use of specially designed &quot;block copolymers&quot;, which are a type of plastic material where different parts of the polymer molecule have different physical properties. Since the different portions of the polymer molecule interact with their surroundings and other polymer molecules in different ways, they separate themselves out into microscopic and nanoscopic structures. For example, the way oil droplets separate from water is due to the fact that the oil molecules prefer to associate with other oil molecules rather than water molecules. Thus, by using a scanning probe to deposit block copolymers, it will be possible to generate extremely small droplet-like structures on surfaces, which would be even smaller than could normally be produced by standard scanning probe methods alone.\n\nThis travel grant will allow Dr. L. S. Wong to visit Northeastern University in Boston, USA, to work with Prof. K. Zhang, an expert polymer chemist and develop new methods that combine these two otherwise disparate areas of research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L005417/1","grantId":"EP/L005417/1","fundValue":"5786","fundStart":"2014-03-29","fundEnd":"2014-08-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lu Shin  Wong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
