Depending on the operating environment and application, 60 GHz wireless networks with ranges between 10 m to 100 m are attractive and currently are under research and development. They can have immense applications in consumer and professional electronic markets. Not only do wireless networks eliminate cabling between communicating terminals, but they permit high definition (HD) uncompressed video streaming over air, can support wireless HD video interactive games, allow secure multi-gigabit data link between close city offices, and can provide safe and fast data, audio and video wireless distribution in planes, trains, cars, offices, hospitals and many other places of interests. Restricted to these applications alone, the sale of 60 GHz chipsets is estimated to run into billion of units. In the 60 GHz band the external interference is extremely low as the absorption of electromagnetic signals by oxygen and obstacles are extremely high. Unfortunately, the high attenuation together with the low transmitter power adversely affects the transmission quality. As flagged by the industry, this problem can be overcome by the implementation of directional antennas in 60 GHz transceivers, capable of steering their beams automatically for maximum signal reception. The aim of this work is to develop beam steerable planar antenna arrays for the 60 GHz band using nematic liquid crystals as a means for controlling the phase distribution over the antenna elements and hence, to provide prototype antennas which are compact, low-power and low-cost for multi-gigabit 60 GHz wireless networks. For this purpose, we will investigate, develop and compare two types of phase shifters based on liquid crystals, and design and build beam steering antenna arrays integrating the best alternative. Both the optimisation of the phase shifter performance and the development of the antenna arrays require detailed liquid crystal and electromagnetic modelling for which there is no commercial software available. In this work, our own advanced liquid crystal and electromagnetic modelling methods are extended and software tools capable of dealing with fully inhomogeneous and anisotropic dielectrics (on a point by point basis) will be developed in order to analyse and design accurately and reliably the 2D and 3D liquid-crystal-based devices including phase shifters and antennas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I003894/1","grantId":"EP/I003894/1","fundValue":"326847","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings in this project are being used by researchers in academic institutions.

The reflection type phase shifter (RTPS) was found to have a small footprint compared to the meander-line phase shifter (MLPS) for a differential phase shift exceeding 180 degrees, but it has a narrower bandwidth. The RTPS design has essentially lower insertion losses than the RTPS. These devices can be further optimised by using a patterned alignment of the liquid crystal substrates, to take maximum advantage of the liquid crystal anisotropy, and by using especially developed liquid crystal materials for the millimetre wave frequency bands.\nAntenna arrays for the 60 GHz band have been developed using both types of phase shifters and especially designed patch antenna elements. These patch elements include a slot to provide frequency and coupling adjustments without sacrificing radiation characteristics. Adjustment of the coupling is important to ensure that each element in the array receives an appropriate power level in a series array feed system. Due to the rather high levels of dielectric loss in ordinary liquid crystal materials, the distribution circuits for either series or corporate feed systems can experience high insertion losses.\nComplex software for the modelling of liquid crystal phase shifters has been developed. Two of these programs is for the modal analysis of electromagnetic waveguides containing liquid crystal materials, based on the magnetic field formulation and on the electric field formulation; the latter being more appropriate for microstrip waveguiding structures.\nAdditionally the developed software include a full vector, 3D program to find the output field on designated ports and the corresponding scattering parameters for a structure containing liquid crystals when an input excitation is defined. This program can also include radiation effects and is linked to the full liquid crystal modelling suite that determines the permittivity tensor distribution over the complete liquid crystal region. Further extensions to this program are needed to generalise the type of devices covered and to optimise the calculations. A new liquid crystal modelling approach is also necessary to deal efficiently with structures that are massively different to the optical devices for which this program was first designed.\nSeveral papers based on the work in this project have already been published and there are a few more under preparation. There is already interest in the liquid crystal phase shifters developed in this project by a research group from a university in the USA. This group is developing a millimetre wave compact vector network analyser and a microwave camera and plan to use these devices in their systems.\nMerck has been interested in our findings throughout the project as they would help them develop liquid crystal materials and mixtures especially designed for the RF and millimetre frequency bands.
