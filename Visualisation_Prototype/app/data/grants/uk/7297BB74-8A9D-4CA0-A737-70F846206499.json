Building upon the DIaD (Data Integration and Dissemination) demonstrator project (RES-348-25-0008) and focussing on the cartogram production aspect of that work, we propose to create an open web service and supporting web site 'galleria' and tools that will allow social scientists to create, share and reuse custom, bespoke cartograms. Our objectives in undertaking this work are to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>make more robust (in terms of software implementation and service quality), an existing, proof-of-concept service, previously funded by the ESRC under its Census Programme Innovation awards</li>\n\n <li>ensure that tools exist which are both readily available and comprehensible for use by novice and non-expert users</li>\n\n <li>showcase user generated datasets in a way that is engaging and permits onward sharing, reuse and remix of original and derived data</li>\n\n <li>deliver a sustainable infrastructure that supports both machine-to-machine and human-machine interaction.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009954/1","grantId":"ES/J009954/1","fundValue":"29900","fundStart":"2011-10-03","fundEnd":"2012-07-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Reid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
