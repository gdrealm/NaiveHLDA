It becomes a debating chamber for discussing responsibility, freedom, war, sacrifice, democracy and authority, as well as a template for reflecting on (for example) the First World War, the Holocaust, the 'war on terror' and the nature of the modern Israeli state. This study investigates the persistence of this striking biblical moment in the modern (secular?) world. Responses to the sacrifices act as keyholes into major moments and questions in the histories of Europe, Israel/Palestine and the United States.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112828/1","grantId":"112828/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Yvonne  Sherwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
