[2]Lubricants to replace mineral based oils. These have applications in the areas of gear/transmission and hydraulics. Additionally we wish to investigate: [1]The metabolic assembly and chanelling/compartmentalisation of the ricinoleic acid/triacylglycerol pathway in plants [2] Explore the possibilities of using ricinoleic acid as a wider feedstock for production of novel polymers and other applications. [3] Development of B.carinata as an industrial oil crop for UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F004354/1","grantId":"BB/F004354/1","fundValue":"797505","fundStart":"2007-09-04","fundEnd":"2011-09-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antoni Ryszard Slabas","coPersons":["Josiah William Simon"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
