This project proposes to use design as a kind of Trojan Horse to ‘smuggle’ QM approaches into areas where UGs have traditionally found the use of statistics difficult and unappealing.

These were in addition to the members of the project team and their consultant experts. All expressed interest in the premise of the project, and hoped both to contribute and learn more. The project had a focus on working with the teachers, rather than their students directly. \n\nWe held seven recruitment events, with 146 distinct attendees. The events took place in seven university centres, across England and Wales, and were open to all QM teachers. Each recruitment event consisted of a workshop led by the local host, on a range of themes including developing research questions, the elements of research design, problems of attrition, and more generally what is 'wrong' with QM teaching. The last two such events had already begun to work on possible solutions. Each workshop was followed by small group discussion of the challenges and barriers to teaching social science topics and analyses using numbers. The results were collected by a scribe in each group and also via a written confidential feedback form completed by all attendees. The key points of a meta-synthesis of feedback were as follows. \n\nThere is considerable variability in the experience and prior qualifications of QM-relevant teachers, with some just thrown in as the most recent arrivals with no pedagogic training. Many teachers mentioned fear both for themselves and their students. Senior staff who use QM regularly for research are seldom required to teach these skills to UGs. The teachers themselves often confused methods of data collection with research design. What they had been taught was often poorly explained and plain incorrect - especially in relation to significance testing and related issues. These errors are then transmitted to new generations of students. Numeric data are seldom used naturally in substantive courses, and those lecturers prepared to use numbers are forced to become QM 'experts' for methods courses seen as irrelevant by many students. Fuller reports are available at:\nhttps://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/education/research/ESRC-Interim-report-July-2013-.pdf)\nhttps://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/education/research/ug-quantitative-methods-phaseone-completion.pdf.\nThe users for this RDI project are other academics such as QM teachers, and less directly their UG charges. The project forms part of the move towards a 'new statistics', embracing judgement of substantive findings about extent rather than apparent but mistaken precision concerning binary decisions. Such an approach is safer, encourages researcher and research integrity, and allows findings to be inspected and judged by a wider audience. As part of that move, this project may, via impact on staff and students, help improve the quality of work with numbers in social science, its wider use, and its easier interpretation by potential research users. \n\nFor example, we used the same approach as with QM teachers on four occasions when training groups of school leaders and teachers how to plan, conduct and analyse a rigorous evaluation of an innovation in practice. This was part of two aggregated randomised controlled trials led by schools, and funded by the Educational Endowment Foundation. The focus on effect sizes, for pre-specified primary outcomes, was simple and very enthusiastically received by practitioners. They proved able to conduct these analyses correctly and accurately themselves. There will be other areas of public policy such as housing, health and criminal justice where these approaches would be useful. \n\nOne of the many barriers to impact is the sheer number of intiatives (reducing attendance at each event perhaps), and the lack of quality control in the kinds of QM resources now publicly available. The latter can lead trainers and students to regard what are matters of fact as though they were matters of opinion.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the issues raised were specific to individuals and their HE contexts. Some were general but also beyond the scope of this project - low levels of numeracy among potential UGs, for example. Phase II of the project focussed on working together to simplify approaches, correct errors in teaching, provide realistic resources for teacher development, and overcome barriers to the natural integration of numbers in social science curricula. As part of this, we held four training and resource development events in three universities in England, with 70 invited attendees selected from those in Phase I, plus consultant experts. Around 40 academics continued to be involved, and 15 of these were primary authors of resources. We held two public showcase events at successive national confences, one on the value of considering reseach as an argument, and the second illustrating how design aids analysis, each attended by around 60 academics and doctoral researchers across the social sciences and public policy. We organised a session at the second conference in which Larry Hedges urged the importance of effect sizes, and presented a typology with their relative merits. \n\nWe developed a number of resources mostly for the website, but also in print, and this process is ongoing as part of the sustainability of the project. So far, these include books, chapters, papers, brief teaching guides, videos, and other resources (see below). In Phase III of the project, these were tried out in a variety of settings, most notably the UG QM teaching by Patrick White for all social scientists at the University of Leicester. Feedback has been excellent, and the trial at Lecicester formed part of a successful application for a Teaching Fellowship (just awarded). We have also presented the work of the project around the country in at least 25 invited seminars and workshops (see below). \nThe resources from Phase II are being collected on the project website which will be sustained indefinitely. The resources are for the development of QM trainers themselves and for UGs. They need organising further into a narrative for each audience so that they can be used more easily in modules, and in an appropriate sequence. They also need 'advertising' and in some cases academic justification. This is being achieved by a combination of peer-reviewed publication, presentation, lecture tours, videos, social media, and email list discussions. Considerable discussion has taken place on SAGE Methodspace, where queries by researchers worldwide have been addressed, project resources have been directly uploaded, and a Case Study produced for the first round to be published by SAGE.\n\nSo far, the project has produced one methods book, 10 peer-reviewed methods papers, 4 book chapters in methods texts, one case study, 29 invited presentations wholly or partly about this project, and the resources themselves. These include sections on:\n\nStarting out\nResearch Design\nIdentifying the cases\nThe behaviour of numbers\nPresenting one value at a time\nPresenting a comparison of two or more values \nRandom sampling theory and its serious limitations\nThe meaning of numeric results\nWorking with existing data\n\nPerhaps most notable are the series of videos for UGs, showing how to use SPSS. These are intended for stand-alone use or as part of a taught module in a blended learning format. Although in some ways SPSS is not ideal, since there is not yet a button to simply turn off the default emphasis on significance testing and asterisk-based presentation without consideration of the nature of the cases involved, the videos are innovative in the way that they ignore this. Instead they focus on the ability to explore, display and model datasets, and they do so in a way that is non-threatening to most social scientists. Feedback from UGs has been universally excellent. -To be used as a teaching resource\n-To be applied for data analysis\n-To be used by researchers in all the field of sciences Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace","dataset":"gtr"}
