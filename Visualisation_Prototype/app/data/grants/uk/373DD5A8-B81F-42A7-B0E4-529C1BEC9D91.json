Others try individuals for serious international crimes, such as war crimes and genocide. Yet little is known about the judges that sit on these courts, and how they come to be appointed. This project identifies the processes that states use to nominate and elect international judges, and the formal criteria and other considerations that play a role in the nomination and election process. \nThe project will also generate proposals for enhancing the transparency and legitimacy of international judicial selection processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119189/1","grantId":"119189/1","fundValue":"260445","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Philippe Joseph Sands","coPersons":["Kate  Malleson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
