The computation is based on spatio-temporal interaction of self-localisation mobile patterns (defects, gliders, quasi-particles). Data and results of the computation are to be represented by initial and final configuration of the localisations (generators of localisation or bound states); algorithm of computation is represented by initial trajectories and self-localisations and configurations of reflectors (stationary patterns that change trajectories of the localisations). The pilot project is the first phase of designing structureless computers in non-linear system: we aim to study cellular automata with binary and ternary cell states, discover all types of mobile localisations, characterise their interaction dynamics and develop analytical tools for automatic search of localisaton-supporting discrete media. To fulfil the aim we invite Dr. Genaro Martinez (Polytechnical National Institute, Mexico), an internationally recognised expert in phenomenology of localisation dynamics in cellular automata, to visit University of the West of England, Bristol, for the period of 12 months. We are applying for support for salary costs and travel subsistence for Dr. Genaro Martinez.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D066174/1","grantId":"EP/D066174/1","fundValue":"74576","fundStart":"2006-10-06","fundEnd":"2007-10-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Adamatzky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
