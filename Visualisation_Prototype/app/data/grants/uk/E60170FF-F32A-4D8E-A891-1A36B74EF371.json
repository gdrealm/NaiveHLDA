This is very challenging due to the quality of service requirements and tight constraints on available radio spectrum in practical systems. The ultimate aim of our work is therefore to enable wireless systems such as WLANs and WMANs to provide seamless data transmission beyond 100Mb/s, and possibly up to 1Gb/s, as a replacement for established wire-line technology such as cable modems and ADSL. We believe that it will only be possible to support such very high speed data transmission through the exploitation spatial diversity, i.e. exploiting the plurality of paths provided by having multiple antennas at the transmitter and most probably at the receiver too.We will in particular propose advanced transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing techniques and associated resource allocation algorithms for broadband wireless access systems. The proposed diversity techniques will be based on channel state information feedback. Since such channel state information requires considerable bandwidth in the reverse link for its transmission, we will investigate various novel feedback quantization techniques and will propose Grassmannian plane (subspace) packing based matrix quantization techniques to reduce feedback overhead significantly. We will also develop space-time-frequency based statistical mean and covariance feedback techniques to further reduce the feedback overhead. The performance of all of our methods will be evaluated using in depth mathematical analysis and simulation studies (on synthetic and field datasets, with guidance from Telecom Modus) based upon error statistics such as bit error rates and block error rates. Our work will be presented at the foremost international conferences and published within the leading IEEE technical journals, such as IEEE Trans. Wireless Communications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E041817/1","grantId":"EP/E041817/1","fundValue":"290454","fundStart":"2007-09-30","fundEnd":"2010-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This research has been very successful in terms of providing new insights into advanced spatial diversity techniques for wireless communications.

Spatial diversity techniques in the form of, for example transmitter beamforming and multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) system could help enhancing spectrum efficiency due to simultaneous access of multiple users or multiple data streams. In this project, we have proposed advanced transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing techniques and associated resource allocation algorithms for wireless access networks. The proposed diversity techniques are based on channel state information (CSI) feedback. Since such channel state information requires considerable bandwidth in the reverse link for its transmission, we investigated various novel feedback quantization techniques and proposed Grassmannian plane (subspace) packing based matrix quantization techniques to reduce feedback overhead significantly. We have also developed robust transmitter diversity techniques in order to reduce the sensitivity of the transmission scheme to errors in the CSI due to quantization of CSI and channel time variations. Due to the potential of cognitive radios and relay technology as a solution for spectrum scarcity for emerging and future generation wireless systems, we have developed our algorithms within the context of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) based cognitive radio and relay networks. The performance of our methods was evaluated using in depth mathematical analysis and simulation studies. The results of the project were published in three IEEE journals, two IET journals and numerous international conference articles. The project has proposed various optimization techniques for spatial diversity and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) network. The work also covered relay networks and beamforming. Various variations of relay and beamforming methods are being promoted into wireless standards such as LTE. Hence there will be interests in the proposed methods to industries specialising in wireless communications. Spatial diversity techniques for enhancing spectrum efficiency in wireless communications are of significant interests to both academic and industrial research community. The results produced have been published in eight highly reputable journal articles and sic international conferences. Some of the works have already received many citations. Apart from these exploitation routes, the results are also being presented in various invited and plenary talks. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
