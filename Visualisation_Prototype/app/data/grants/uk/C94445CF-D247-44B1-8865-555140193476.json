Representatives will sit on the project advisory board, help with all patient information and communication documents, provide advice on how best to contact applicants and advice on the use of the media for recruitment and publicity. They have been centrally involved in the development of our research plans. The study will depend upon high level media publicity for success and this group will help us with this aspect of the subject and with using the links that are consequently developed to publicise results of the research when the trial is complete.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700648","grantId":"G0700648","fundValue":"74584","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Hawkey","coPersons":["Carol  Coupland","Denise  Kendrick","Julia  Hippisley-Cox","Richard  Logan","Anthony John Avery","John  Atherton"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
