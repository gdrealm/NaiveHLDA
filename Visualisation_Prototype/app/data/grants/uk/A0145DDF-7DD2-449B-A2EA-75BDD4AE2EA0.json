{"id":"A0145DDF-7DD2-449B-A2EA-75BDD4AE2EA0","title":"A web-based survey of the clinical and psychological characteristics of internet gamblers","abstractText":"<p>Recent changes in the legislative framework governing gambling within the UK mean that internet, and remote access, gambling is set to grow substantially within the next decade. Internet gambling provides continuous and unrestricted access to a wide variety of gambling activities, including online betting and online gaming, with a very high degree of privacy. Little is known about how people use these services or the effects of the internet on gambling behaviour more generally. This project aims to expand understanding of the subject by undertaking a web-based survey of users of internet gambling sites. Respondents will be able to access the survey through links placed on a broad range of internet gambling sites, all of which have shown commitment to responsible practice. Areas covered by the survey include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Demographic and occupational characteristics of users of internet gambling sites</li> \n <li>Type, frequency and extent of online/offline gambling</li> \n <li>Psychological characteristics, including any evidence of problem-gambling</li> \n <li>Attitudes to risk and gambling behaviour as an entertainment</li>\n</ul> \n<p>This project has important implications for policy and practice, as improving our understanding of online gambling will inform regulation within the UK, and assist the design and provision of appropriate interventions for individuals who develop problems controlling their gambling behaviour amongst users of such services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000556/1","grantId":"ES/D000556/1","fundValue":"105481","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert David Rogers","coPersons":["Guy  Goodwin","John Richard Geddes"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
