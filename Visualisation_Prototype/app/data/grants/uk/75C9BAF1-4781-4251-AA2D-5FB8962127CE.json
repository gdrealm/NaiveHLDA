The major challenges posed by tuberculosis, MRSA and hospital acquired diarrhoeas (C. Difficile and norovirus) would be easier to tackle if we could recognise individual outbreaks of infection with different strains. However, current typing schemes, which try to classify how different bugs are related to each other, are too slow and inadequate to reliably do this. \n\nHigh-throughput sequencing of the human genome has revolutionised scientific research. We intend to exploit these advances to improve infectious diseases clinical practice. We will systematically collect strains of four pathogens from major UK hospitals and the clinical details of each case. The genomic techniques will allow us to precisely type large numbers of isolates so that we can track individual local outbreaks even if the bugs are very closely related. Better descriptions of routes of transmission will identify where guidelines for infection control can be improved. We will then develop rapid typing techniques so that infection outbreaks can be recognised and followed in real-time, and then successfully interrupted in a rational way. We will develop a web-based computer database so that a single system can be used across the country.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800778","grantId":"G0800778","fundValue":"2588140","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Derrick  Crook","coPersons":["Rosalind May Harding","David  Mant","Jenny Cameron Taylor","Philip Nigel Monk","Kate  Dingle","Paul  Klenerman","E Grace Smith","David  Wyllie","Christine  McCartney","Jonathon  Green","Mark Harvey Wilcox","Timothy Edward Peto","Peter  Donnelly","John  Paul","Julian  Parkhill","Ann Sarah Walker","David William Brown","Andrew J Pollard","Adrian Vivian Hill"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
