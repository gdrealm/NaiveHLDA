In mathematics thereis a strong emphasis on proof. Mathematics is about the solving ofproblems that abstract from reality, so-called mathematicalmodels, which leads to the formulation of equations which need to be`solved', often with the help of computers to do the numbercrunching. A `solution' in engineering often comprises makingsomething work; turning a piece of fundamental science intotechnology. Increasingly engineering deals with systems, such as atransport network or a complex industrial plant. ICT on the other handis in some sense bi-polar. Theoretical computer science concernsitself with the deriving clever algorithms for manipulating data, andproving how fast they will work. At the other end, artificialintelligence and robotics involve building clever machines thatenhance human capabilities. Increasingly, the research challengesthrown up by today's society require an overlap between these threeseparate approaches. For example, modern aeroplanes represent complexsystems with powerful embedded computers that `fly by wire' withoutthe pilot's intervention. However, before any plane is allowed to flyit must be certified using mathematics to prove that the flightcontrol algorithms really will do the required job.The University of Bristol has a strong track record ofinterdisciplinary research, including in areas that bridge the gapsbetween maths, engineering and ICT, e.g. in nonlinear dynamics, andin quantum information. However there are also huge opportunities inother areas where the University of Bristol holds significantexpertise within separate Departments, but there is a perceived orreal `gap' that prevents the relevent researchers from interacting andpursuing common goals. This grant aims to provide the framework forbridging these gaps by focussing on four specific areas of research:(A) Uncertain systems, (B) Pure Mathematics and Algorithms, (C) Mediaand materials, (D) Computational Science. Specifically, a virtualorganisation, an Interface Centre will be set up that sponsorsgap-bridging activies. These will include a dedicated web loungefor communication of opportunities and requests for help, exploratoryaway days linked to a social activity, research open days, staffsecondments, visiting lecturers, interdisciplinary research workshops,and highly focused research retreats.Bristol University is well placed as the largest Higher EducationInstitute in the South West region and is in one of the governmentannounced `Science Cities' to interact with key hightech industriesand other academic institutions. It also plays a key role within theSETsquared enterprise internationally, within the World WideUniversities Network. The proposed Centre will therefore make themost of this position, by ensuring that all activities haveinvolvement from those outside of Bristol. By aligning itself with theUniversity's research strategy the Center will achieveself-sustainability within 3 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E022685/1","grantId":"EP/E022685/1","fundValue":"319301","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was one of the pioneering &amp;quot;Bridging the Gaps&amp;quot; awards from EPSRC and the only one to be run like a &amp;quot;virtual research coucil&amp;quot; at institution level.

It was clearly successful because the methodology we developed has now been hard wired into &amp;amp;quot;pump priming&amp;amp;quot; calls across the University. There were several notable successes at the individual PI level too. One particular success was a grant funded by Dr Sameer Rahakatar on the interface between nanocomposite materials and dentistry. \n\nAnother success was the setting up of a research group in the mathemtics of algorithms which ran four national-level meetings on algorithm research that has helped to establish the UK as a centre for this kind of activity.
