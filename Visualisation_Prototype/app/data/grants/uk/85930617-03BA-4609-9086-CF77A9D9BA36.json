For an animal to become asymmetric, symmetry must somehow be broken during development. This raises the interesting problem of how one side is consistently distinguished from the other, given that the side that we call 'right' is essentially arbitrary. The solution is that in the early stages of development a hypothetical, asymmetric 'F-molecule' lines up with the front/back and top/bottom planes, so creating a left-right asymmetry. Later organ asymmetry comes about because the F-molecule sends some substance(s) toward one side or the other (i.e. to the right, or, to the left). To attempt to understand how asymmetry is established, scientists have focussed their research on model organisms such as the mouse, chick and zebrafish. In these animals, it has been found that rotational beating of small hairs ('cilia') in the early embryo create a fluid movement that is asymmetric, leading to a suggestion that this is the critical symmetry-breaking step: the asymmetry of motor proteins around the cilia leads to directional fluid movement, ultimately determining the molecular and organismal asymmetry. While these findings are elegant, some recent and also much older research indicates that the symmetry-breaking event is much earlier, putting the ultimate relevance of the above research into doubt. For instance, in the nematode worm, left-right asymmetry is established by the six-cell stage, and probably earlier. In the pond snail chirality is determined by a substance that the mother deposits in the unfertilised egg. In the frog, molecular asymmetry is established by the four-cell stage, and even in zebrafish and chick, there are indications of differences prior to the cilial stage. Together, the results suggest that in many animals, including our close relatives, molecular asymmetry is established early in the development of embryos, with morphological asymmetry only becoming apparent later. We believe that snails may be a crucial model organism in coming to understand the symmetry-breaking step, because their asymmetry is established very early, yet they have been almost completely neglected in recent years. The objective of this project, therefore, is to utilise the power of new DNA sequencing technologies to directly identify the gene sequence that determines chirality in snail eggs. As one idea is that this gene is also the F-molecule, then this work will lead in the future to an understanding of the symmetry-breaking event in snails. The results will then invigorate analyses of the same or related molecules in other organisms, including vertebrates. Finally, as the methodology that we will use is an entirely new application of ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing, then success in this project would be a springboard towards using the same method to identify other genes with the same methodology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F018940/1","grantId":"BB/F018940/1","fundValue":"321199","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Angus  Davison","coPersons":["Aziz  Aboobaker"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The main objective of the grant was to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify the gene that determines shell coiling or chirality in snails. This was always a very ambitious aim, given that the genome of the snail was completely uncharacterised, and also, repeat rich. We have come a very long towards identifying the gene, and are working on getting proof of its identity. The example of variable snail chirality, or left -right symmetry, is useful in communicating ideas to the general public, specifically the issue of our own external bilateral symmetry and internal asymmetry, as well as the asymmetry of molecules - some of the snails that we bred were used as props in filming for Brian Cox's Wonder of the Universe. Davison developed a highly inbred line of snails (&gt;99.9% inbred). From this, ~ 6000 snails were scored for chirality. This inbred line is being used to generate a better genome assembly (e.g. application by others to French Genoscope is pending decision) and to fine map the chirality gene. \n\n\n\nPDRA Davey (Edinburgh) developed a suite of tools for RAD-Seq analysis, RADtools, which have been released openly through a dedicated web site.
