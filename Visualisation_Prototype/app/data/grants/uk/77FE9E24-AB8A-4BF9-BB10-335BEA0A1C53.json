{"id":"77FE9E24-AB8A-4BF9-BB10-335BEA0A1C53","title":"Developing Sustainability Pathways for Social Simulation Tools and Services","abstractText":"<p>Social simulation is a new and rapidly expanding field with applications across and beyond academic research. Its models enable social processes to be investigated 'in silico'. Interest in social simulation has gained momentum recently partly due to the widening availability of data against which simulations may be validated, but also because of the availability of greater computational resources for the execution of more complex and more accurate models.<br /><br />This project aims to create a pathway to sustainable infrastructure and services for social simulation.<br /><br />The project has three elements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>developing of a pilot social simulation service for delivery to a selected UK market sector</li>\n\n <li>establishing the technical requirements for social simulation infrastructure and services</li>\n\n <li>researching the wider market potential and business models for sustainable social simulation services.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>For the pilot social simulation service the project has chosen to focus on the UK academic sector, and on graduate training provision in particular.<br /><br />This choice has been informed by a number of factors: first, the experience of delivering training for this sector; second, the potential for significant impact from introducing early career researchers to social simulation; and third, our familiarity with many of the key groups and stakeholders within it.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010049/1","grantId":"ES/J010049/1","fundValue":"49376","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Procter","coPersons":["Mark  Birkin"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
