The purpose of the network is to improve understanding of the historic, current, and potential roles that community music (hereafter CM) can play in promoting community engagement, within the terms of the AHRC's 'Connected Communities' initiative. Given that CM activity in the UK is currently negotiating a period of relative austerity, the network organisers see this as a crucial moment to critically reflect on the contemporary condition of CM and to revitalise understandings of its (potential) role in connecting communities. Such a revitalisation of understandings of CM stands to benefit not only the AHRC's 'Connected Communities' initiative but also to connect with the 'Big Society's emphasis on localism, voluntarism and community empowerment.\n\nIn the UK, CM has undergone significant shifts over recent decades. Undoubtedly, these shifts have been due - in no small part - to what Everitt (1997) has termed the 'subsidy revolution' facilitated by the funding opportunities made available by the National Lottery. One key development accompanying the upsurge in state funding has taken the form of 'increased expectation and an emphasis upon 'outcomes'' (Price 2002: 3). This has brought important changes in the ways those involved in facilitating CM activities both go about and think about their work, something perhaps most evident in the 'noticeable shift in focus...from collective to individual outcomes' (Matarasso 2007: 449). Such a shift is also indicative of a more subtle yet significant move away from CM's longstanding concern with issues of community empowerment, participatory processes and democratic decision-making practices (including learning about community-level decision making and grass-roots organisation processes). Such concerns, articulated within a broader philosophy of empowerment and reflected in the work of writers such as Saul Alinsky, Carl Rogers, Ivan Illich and Paolo Friere, were central to community development theorists and the burgeoning community arts movement of the late 1960s/early 1970s alike. Over time however, their centrality has been diminished for a CM movement which, as a recent AHRC 'Connected Communities' scoping study notes, has been primarily 'resource-oriented rather than actively reflexive' (McKay and Higham 2011: 6).\n\nTo date, this resource-orientation, on the part of CM managers and practitioners, has served to inhibit a productive dialogue between the former and those commissioning, funding and developing policy relevant to CM activity, with the result of obscuring the potential contribution of CM activity to community development. The formation of this research network, comprising of academics and researchers with expertise in the areas of informal music education and community cultural development (including the authors of the aforementioned AHRC scoping study), established CM funders and commissioners, experienced managers and respected practitioners will provide a forum within which to both explore the potentially valuable dimensions of CM for community development and formulate a future research agenda through which to respond to a series of core concerns facing CM initiatives in the UK.\n\nThe network organisers have developed a series of structured network events, engaging key stakeholders at appropriate junctures, in order to address issues including: \n\n- Individual and collective motivation to participation \n- CM participation as a pathway towards community engagement/activism \n- Evaluation of different models of developmental practice and community engagement \n- Community as a site of democratic expression and/or oppositional critique \n- Freedom and control in community engagement \n- Relationships between intent, process, and outcome in CM activity \n- Ethical issues in CM practice","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005723/1","grantId":"AH/K005723/1","fundValue":"24021","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Rimmer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The following summary provides some insight into what the research team has, on the basis of the accounts gathered, found to be the most significant findings: \n\n\n\nA Chameleonic Practice \n\no There remains no agreed definition of community music (hereafter CM) and a number of recent developments appear to have stretched already-catholic understandings of CM into a further expanded form. \n\no Adopting a broad definition of CM enables a sense of unity across the profession and provides practitioners with the flexibility to tailor their CM activity to the requirements tied to different sources of funding. We therefore enountered resistance to engaging with questions about what CM is. Instead, delegates sought to retain an understanding of CM as a 'chameleonic practice', capable of responding to shifting policy and funding agendas. \n\no Problematically however, this situation risks obscuring the aims underpinning CM activity, thereby leading to challenges in clearly communicating the value of CM to external constituencies.\n\n\n\nMythologies of Practice \n\no There appears to be a degree of 'myth making' around understandings of intent, process and impact in CM activity. This occurs, it seems, in order to maintain as open as possible a view as to how initiatives might achieve outcomes. \n\no However, given the opportunity, many delegates would prefer a more robust, distinct and accountable identification of CM principles and practices. \n\no With the National Lottery came the combination of significantly increased resources and apparent political interest in the area of CM. Yet this development created tensions for many in CM, as the personal development aspects of the work became less valued and policy-driven outcome objectives (particularly in terms of social inclusion and employability) became more pronounced.\n\no CM interests, purposes and practices (motivated by an ethos and informed by an ethical framework), should not only be situated in an understanding of the present operational context but also informed by an appreciation of the history of CM as an emancipatory practice. Explicit in this is the need for constructs of CM that confuse such a purpose - what we might call 'mythologies' - to be actively discouraged. \n\n\n\nQuiet Radicalism \n\no CM has traditionally claimed to draw on 'radical', 'activist' or broadly 'political' motivations. We found little evidence of this in delegates' accounts of contemporary practice. Rather, delegates provided accounts of how CM practice has come to accommodate itself to - and position its value in relation to - the agendas of formal service providers (in education, health and social services). \n\no This was figured as 'quiet radicalism'. Here CM practitioners meant that their approach was influencing the work of providers of other (primarily social and educational) services across a diversity of contexts.\n\no Yet the values of CM, closely allied to what are sometimes termed 'informal education processes', sit uneasily, in certain ways, with the objectives, measures and approaches typically to the fore within, for example, formal educational settings. \n\no Some delegates were keen to draw attention to the ways work undertaken within certain settings and with certain agencies, threatened to undermine some of the core concerns of CM practice. \n\no One question which emerged concerned the extent to which CM risks - in the course of its various accommodations, strategic re-configurations and adaptations - divesting itself of those elements and attributes capable of yielding the kinds of personal, social, cultural or community-level benefits which fall outside of the remit of its current funders' scope of interest. \n\n\n\nQuality, evidence, and faith\n\no We encountered contested understandings of quality, evidence, and evaluation. This was reflected in discussions about 'excellence,' and differing views about the relative importance of 'process' and 'product.' Since it was unclear what was meant by 'quality', it was difficult to know what sorts of evidence might be sought to prove value. \n\no Where can we look for reliable, non-partial accounts of the results of an intervention? Capturing these is likely to be expensive in proportion to the cost of delivering interventions; and would require sophisticated data collection and analysis before and after the event.\n\no Stories and anecdotes are commonly used to provide accounts of successful practice, but the storytellers are often implicated in the project delivery - and commissioning - and so have a vested interest in the stories having a happy ending.\n\no It appears to be important to distinguish between outcomes that are 'measurable' and what delegates noted as 'important' \n\no There seems to be a risk of confusing evaluation with advocacy. Evaluation should be independent and neutral, carrying a risk of uncovering failure; whereas advocacy is all about presenting the best possible case, and, if necessary, suppressing bad news.\n\no Much/most work is commissioned based on the hope/belief that something good will come of it. This faith, ideally, is shared by all parties to the activity.\n\n\n\nPathways to an elusive consensus \n\no We encountered a persistent difficulty in drawing together the views of participants into a consistent, coherent account of CM and its activities and practices. The only consistency lay in the diversity of experience. The reluctance to be defined functions as a more or less deliberate strategy for keeping artistic, and most importantly commercial, options open.\n\n\n\nThe Role of Research \n\no Considerable methodological difficulties thwart attempts to quantify the outcomes of participation in CM activity. Much of the research carried out to date has been considered anecdotal and has been criticised by commentators for its lack of robustness. \n\no CM appears to lack either the terminological or pedagogical specificity through which to explain its processes to the uninitiated. As a consequence, potentially valuable dimensions of its practice and outcomes are often not effectively communicated to wider constituencies. \n\no The field's longstanding resistance to definition and articulation appears to play into the current lack of understanding - both from within and without - of the core processes and mechanisms used in CM.\n\no The current lack of precise and clear analyses of the processes and mechanisms enacted within CM projects, and of the ways these variably connect with different outcomes in different contexts, therefore leaves the field unable to offer anything but an underspecified accounts of its benefits. \n\no This challenge appears to be an especially important matter at a time when questions about the delivery of 'value' are - from the point of view of funders and policy makers alike - more pressing than ever. The project report (available: https://www.uea.ac.uk/documents/429551/0/AHRC+CM+Network+-+Final+Report/9d84cb3e-0099-48ab-8166-6095cede47e5) has been disseminated to a range of non-academic stakeholders including community music practitioners, managers and organisations, arts researchers, funders and commissioners and policy makers. It has also been disseminated, through wider network delegate contacts, to individuals within local authorities, other government agencies and institutions.
