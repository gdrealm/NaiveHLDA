These bio-lentiviral vectors have been demonstrated to efficiently complex with streptavidin paramagnetic particles. This combination has resulted in the most efficient purification and concentration method yet described for lentiviral vectors. We wish to use the platform of these new biotin-lentiviral packaging cells to exemplify their value to the gene therapy community. By virtue of their biotinylated surface these viruses can be attached to specific cell binding proteins so that they can be targeted to specific sites of disease. Their unique properties also allow us to increase our knowledge of the cell derived accessory proteins that are also resident on the lentiviral surface. Information on the influence of these proteins on the process of lentiviral infection can then be applied to more efficient targeting of gene therapy vectors to specific sites of infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014301/1","grantId":"BB/D014301/1","fundValue":"197129","fundStart":"2006-07-31","fundEnd":"2010-07-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Farzin  Farzaneh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
