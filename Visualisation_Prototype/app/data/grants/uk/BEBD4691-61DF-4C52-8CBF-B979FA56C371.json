{"id":"BEBD4691-61DF-4C52-8CBF-B979FA56C371","title":"Protein modules for systematic analysis of cellular signalling pathways","abstractText":"Higher organisms are characterised by complex interactions between cells such as normal white blood cells that mediate immunity and abnormal cells such as in cancer. Following these interactions, signals are transmitted through interactions of many proteins, to control cell activities such as division, migration. Some of these controls fail in cancer. Thus there is considerable interest in deciphering these interactions but with the genome projects we realise that there are many proteins involved. This project utilises high throughput methods developed at the Oxford protein production Facility to provide panels of these proteins to researchers. They can then identify interactions in normal and abnormal cells and then work out how these signals are transmitted. Understanding these signals has implications for diseases such as cancer when cells grow out of control and autoimmune diseases where cells that can interact with self tissues are incorrectly controlled. Thus these interactions could be targets for therapies in the longer term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700076","grantId":"G0700076","fundValue":"102564","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"A Neil Barclay","coPersons":["Marion Hanbury Brown","Ray  Owens"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
