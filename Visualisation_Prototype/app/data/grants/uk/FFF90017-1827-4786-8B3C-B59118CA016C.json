We will provide conclusions and recommendations about how such treatment decisions can be managed. \n\nPeople are used to paying towards dental treatment costs. However, dental implant treatment is much more expensive than existing treatments - such as removable dentures - and is usually only available if paid for privately. We know very little about how dentists make decisions about offering such treatments, or what patients consider when deciding whether or not to pay for them.\n\nPrimary care dentists in North East England will be surveyed to identify how and where implant treatment is provided. A sample of dentists and patients will be interviewed to find out how decisions about whether or not to pursue dental implants are reached.\nThe study has wider relevance to society and other healthcare providers because it will provide information about what factors clinicians consider when offering patients treatments that they must pay for. We will also determine what influences patientsâ€™ decisions when faced with the choice of having a treatment that incurs a personal financial cost.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500968","grantId":"G0500968","fundValue":"174042","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Exley","coPersons":["John Mark Thomason","Tracy  Finch","Cam  Donaldson","Janice Susan Ellis","James George Steele","Carl  May"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
