This\ncan be used to prevent data breaches such as ATM 'Skimming' attacks. Our project seeks to develop practical application\nof QKD in securing short-range wireless communication between a terminal such as an ATM and a handheld device (e.g.\nmobile phone). Our consortium, Nokia R&amp;D UK Ltd., Alpha Contract Engineering (ACE) and University of Oxford have\nidentified the 3 main barriers to commercialisation, namely, the lack of low-cost optical wireless steering techniques, high\ncost barrier to complex optical assembly for quantum receivers and the lack of mass-manufacturable single photon detector\n(SPD) arrays on CMOS platform. A fast and precise optical steering device (University of Oxford) that directs single\nphotons from a handheld device to a quantum receiver will be developed. Testing of individual system components will be\ncarried out. In particular, miniaturised and simplified optical assemblies using existing UK manufacturing capability will be\nresearched, built and tested for QKD use (ACE). Critical parameters of SPD arrays on scalable CMOS platform will be\nmeasured (University of Oxford) and used in detailed simulation and modelling to select the best suited steering method.\nFinally, a prototype wireless quantum link will be built (Nokia &amp; University of Oxford) with simplified optics (ACE) to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of secure quantum wireless transactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508366/1","grantId":"EP/M508366/1","fundValue":"123968","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic Christopher O'Brien","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
