{"id":"BE6612DD-CC65-44C5-9912-A0AE02D43691","title":"The Wayzgoose: a social history of printers' outings in 20th century Scotland.","abstractText":"<p>‘Wayzgoose’ is a term formerly used in the UK to describe the annual social outings organised by unions and management in the publishing and printing trades. These form a long tradition dating back to the earliest days of printing and the forms of work and social organisation that characterised it. The Wayzgoose was a major fixture in the working calendar of staff of Scottish publishing and printing firms. </p> \n<p>There exists little record, however, of the nature and role of such social gatherings in the working lives of those employed in what was one of the major industries of twentieth-century Scotland. Their distinctiveness from other forms of activity such as the Miners' Gala has been noted but not detailed. Nor have differences between diverse types of company been elaborated. This one-year project, under the auspices of SAPPHIRE (Scottish Archive of Print and Publishing History Records - <a href=\"http://www.sapphire.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sapphire.ac.uk</a>) will use oral and ephemeral material, some of which has been gathered over the course of the past five years on other projects, to investigate and document the Wayzgoose as a social and work-related phenomenon. The ouputs will include a documentary film and accompanying book of testimonies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1914","grantId":"RES-000-22-1914","fundValue":"75484","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alistair  McCleery","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Edinburgh Napier University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
