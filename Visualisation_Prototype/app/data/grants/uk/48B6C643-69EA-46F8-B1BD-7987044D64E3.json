Only certain tissues within our bodies possess the capacity to maintain or increase the telomere structure that protects our chromosomes from instability, akin to a shoelace aglet (or cap ) that prevents shoelaces from fraying. This capacity is encoded by a cellular protein, termed telomerase. How telomerase is able to maintain telomere length and structure in some tissues, but not others, is not completely understood. For example, in some tissues, telomerase is active but is inadequate to prevent telomere fraying. This proposal aims to uncover the novel activities, both within the telomerase protein itself, and in proteins that associate with telomerase, in promoting the maintenance and replenishment of telomeres. We hypothesize that these partially understood protein activities play a crucial role in helping to tether the telomerase activity to the telomere. Thus, a deeper understanding of these activities may shed insight into telomere integrity, and its importance in the health of cells and tissues as we age.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800081","grantId":"G0800081","fundValue":"718686","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Svetlana  MakovetsLea  Harrington","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
