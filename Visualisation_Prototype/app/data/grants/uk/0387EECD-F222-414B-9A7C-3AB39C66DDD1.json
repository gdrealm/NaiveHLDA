{"id":"0387EECD-F222-414B-9A7C-3AB39C66DDD1","title":"Effect of statins on asthma control and airway inflammation in smokers with asthma","abstractText":"Statins are the commonest type of cholesterol-lowering drugs used in clinical practice. Recent research suggests that they may also have anti-inflammatory properties. \nStatins have been found to reduce inflammation in experimental models of asthma and smoking induced airway disease. These findings point to a potential use of statins in treating airway diseases.\nSmokers with asthma have difficult to control symptoms, in part due to a reduced sensitivity to corticosteroids. We plan to perform a ‘proof of concept’ study to determine the effectiveness of statin therapy in smokers with asthma. \nThe study will be an 8-week randomised controlled clinical trial comparing the effect on asthma control of oral atorvastatin therapy with that of a matched placebo. A total of 74 smokers with asthma will be recruited to the study. We will examine the effect of statin therapy on lung function, symptom scores, exacerbation rates, as well as on measurement of airway inflammation in sputum and in the blood. \nThis study will determine the benefit of atorvastatin as a therapy in smokers with asthma and establish if statins might have a role in asthma management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501955","grantId":"G0501955","fundValue":"416947","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Campbell Thomson","coPersons":["Alex  McMahon","Frances  Mair"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
