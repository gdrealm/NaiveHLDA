It is these interactions which give rise to overall cellular processes, and their study has has been termed systems biology.\n\nSystems biology brings together a wide range of information about cells, genes and proteins, as well as the small molecules that act on and within these biological structures. In the service of its application areas, such as drug discovery and industrial biotechnology, it gives a holistic perspective aiming to track and eventually simulate the entire functioning of biological systems. In order to build up such holistic models from such a vast collection of diverse data, integration of individual units of information from many diverse databases needs to be performed. This integration of such a high volume of data can only feasibly be performed computationally. To facilitate smooth integration, individual molecular components within the cellular system require stable and unique identifiers. These identifiers are assigned to entities such as genes, proteins or small molecules by standardization bodies and database providers, and effectively allow the molecular parts list to be catalogued. In addition to this, human-relevant information such as names and chemical and biological structures, relationships and properties are also associated with the various entities in the databases, providing resources that are useable by both software tools and researchers themselves.\n\nThe database Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) acts as a resource for such information and stable identifiers in the area of small molecules of biological interest. ChEBI provides for the bioscientific community semantic, biological and chemical information as well as stable identifiers for small chemical compounds relevant in biology, including the so-called metabolites. Metabolites are small molecules in organisms that are implicated in diverse processes including supplying the body with energy, serving as building blocks for tissue, and acting as a defence or as a signal within the organism or between organisms. For these purposes, ChEBI is widely used in the bioscience community, which sends formal requests for the assignment of identifiers for particular small molecule entities to the ChEBI team, who then perform the assignment, publish the information into the public domain and inform the requesting party that the request has been fulfilled.\nThe aim of the current proposal is to further develop the ChEBI resource and create surrounding tools towards comprehensively addressing the chemical informatics (software and data) needs of the systems biology and metabolic modelling communities, so that they in turn can further their objective to create meaningful simulations and models that enable whole-systems research into pressing public health and energy challenges. In order to facilitate this use, we propose to:\n\n1. Develop a comprehensive software library for accessing ChEBI programmatically which will work across all major available operating systems;\n2. Extend the ChEBI database resource to enhance stability, increase community involvement, add additional biologically relevant relationships, and provide a new powerful visualisation for the biological context of molecular entities;\n3. Curate into ChEBI all known metabolites across important organisms in systems biology studies: human, mouse, E. coli and yeast.\n4. Create new training materials and delivery of training courses to the community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K019783/1","grantId":"BB/K019783/1","fundValue":"682950","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pedro  Mendes","coPersons":["Chris C  Steinbeck"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
