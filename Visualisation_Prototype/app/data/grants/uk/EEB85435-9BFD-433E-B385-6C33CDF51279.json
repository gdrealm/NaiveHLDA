There have been few successful research trials of therapies in childhood IBD, so we draw conclusions from studies in adults with IBD, where the issues can be different. Throughout Scotland, many children and teenagers (more than 450) have already joined our research study into the causes (in terms of genetic makeup and triggers in the environment) of IBD. This group is called a cohort, and our studies have been very successful in scientific terms to date. Although we have studied all potentially important genes that may have a role in the cause of IBD, none have been shown to have a major role ? the responsible genetic causes have yet to be found! \n\nWe are increasing the numbers of Scottish children and young people in the cohort, which will help identify more potential genetic and environmental causes. We also wish to perform trials of therapies which will answer key questions such as what is the best treatment?, what side effects can occur? With a larger group, we can also show the expected course of some of the rarer forms of childhood IBD, such as oral Crohn?s disease, perianal-only Crohn?s disease, and ulcerative colitis of only the rectum, which have been poorly studied in childhood to date.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800675","grantId":"G0800675","fundValue":"815162","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Charles Wilson","coPersons":["Richard  Russell","Jack  Satsangi"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
