The researcher support broadly falls into three categories: (1) academic mentoring (through attendance at project meetings/events and providing ongoing advice by phone and email), (2) delivering formal workshops on specific skills or resources (e.g. collecting oral histories, archaeological field survey), and (3) student volunteers working with projects as part of organised placements.\n\nA Researching Community Heritage project officer will coordinate researchers' contribution to events, training workshops, open days, student placements etc. that will taking place as part of the All Our Stories projects.
