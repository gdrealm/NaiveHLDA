{"id":"2F4E4641-7D9E-4A8C-8C02-195E758FC732","title":"Commercialisation of a Super-Resolution multiphoton microscope","abstractText":"We have developed a new microscope that produces images with a resolution that is better than previously thought theoretically possible. The microscope uses an infrared laser for deep tissue imaging and combines structured illumination with software based localisation methods to resolve points of interest with nanometer resolution. We commissioned a market report and patent landscape survey to help develop a commercial strategy and confirm that we have freedom to operate. In response to comments from industry experts and end users, we will improve the depth of penetration to allow super-resolved imaging at depths of up to 0.5 mm. We will also develop a method for simultaneous measurement from two fluorescent markers and demonstrate the utility of these improvements using in vivo and in vitro and use the data to generate high impact papers. We will also protect the intellectual property underpinning our invention and speak with industry experts with a view to licencing our technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024284/1","grantId":"BB/L024284/1","fundValue":"142011","fundStart":"2014-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-09-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant has only just started Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology Economic","person":"Nicholas Anthony Hartell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" This grant has only just started.
