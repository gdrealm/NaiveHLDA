{"id":"8B0BD1C6-EEE8-4E13-870D-2B84545FCC7A","title":"Staging and Performing Emergencies: The Role of Exercises in UK Preparedness","abstractText":"In response to a changing set of 21st Century threats and hazards new ways have emerged of anticipating uncertain and complex futures. These include preemption, prevention, and preparedness. The problem that these different ways of anticipating respond to are events - events that are contingent in their potential occurrence and complex in their potential effects. The most high profile of such events are new forms of terror post 9/11 and 7/7, but they also include other threats to the smooth functioning of societies (such as Avian Flu, infrastructure loss, or high impact flooding). The research will focus on one way of anticipating future threats -&nbsp; exercises in UK preparedness â€“ in order to address wider questions of how such ways of anticipating function. Post the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act, exercises have been essential to the emergence of UK 'preparedness'. Exercises promise to enable the development of the capabilities and resiliences that would allow response and recovery post disruptive events. The research focuses on how exercises perform these and other functions through; observation of the exercises undertaken in one UK region; interviews with practitioners involved in the planning, designing and undertaking of exercises; and archive work on the wider policy context.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G007136/1","grantId":"ES/G007136/1","fundValue":"80046","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben  Anderson","coPersons":["Peter  Adey","Stephen Douglas Graham"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" The project has had the following research impacts\n1: Developed a new understanding of how UK emergency planning is organised around scalar and networked forms of coordination, thus showing how new organisational forms have emerged to deal with the problem of how to govern disruptive events. This challenges one-dimensional understandings of the growth of networked modes of organisation. \n2: Contributed to moving the debate on how western states govern through emergency away from a preoccupation with the formal declaration of a 'state of emergency' and towards a focus on ways of anticipating future emergencies and responding once an emergency occurs. \n2: Made a leading contribution to work on how techniques of anticipation function to secure life, by outlining a precise account of the roles and functions of 'exercises' in contemporary UK emergency planning and the relation between exercises and other techniques (such as risk registers or scenarios). Through observations of exercises and interviews with emergency planners involved in the design and undertaking of exercises, we have shown how exercises are operationalised within a specific system of emergency preparedness. \n3: Moved debates on how contemporary western states govern through the future, by developing and putting to work a theoretical vocabulary that distinguishes between types of anticipatory action and between specific anticipatory techniques. First, the findings can be taken forward in the study of the variety of ways in which emergencies are governed today, and the varied implications of those different ways of governing. \n\nSecond, the research can be taken forward by focusing on the specific practical and institutional arrangements that are invented and happen as emergencies are governed. \n\nSecond, the research has implications for how emergency planners design and undertake exercises, particularly thinking through what constitutes learning in exercises and how to manage exercise dynamics more effectively to achieve the varied aims and objectives of exercises.
