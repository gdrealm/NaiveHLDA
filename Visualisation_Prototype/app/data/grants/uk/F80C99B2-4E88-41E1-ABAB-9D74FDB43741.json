{"id":"F80C99B2-4E88-41E1-ABAB-9D74FDB43741","title":"New word learning in Down syndrome","abstractText":"<p>Individuals with Down syndrome have particular difficulties in language acquisition, and also show relatively poor verbal short-term memory skills. These deficits may be related, as the ability to hold new word sounds in short-term memory is thought to be a crucial aspect of vocabulary learning. To test this possibility, this research will investigate the new word learning of individuals with Down syndrome using a task in which they have to associate nonwords with unfamiliar objects. By varying whether individuals have to provide the nonword associated with a given object, or whether they have to select the object associated with a given nonword, we can test quality of individualsâ€™ representation of the sound pattern of nonwords. By varying the nature of the nonwords to be associated with objects, in terms of their similarity to existing known words, we can determine whether individuals with Down syndrome compensate for the effect of poor memory skills on word learning by relying instead on associations with existing known words. As a result, this work will identify the strengths and weaknesses in word learning experienced by individuals with Down syndrome, which in turn may suggest ways of improving vocabulary development further.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00721X/1","grantId":"ES/E00721X/1","fundValue":"77478","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Jarrold","coPersons":["Annabel  Thorn"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
