{"id":"8C533039-8B2E-4DF2-99BF-FA76FB8E3798","title":"Critical Issues for Preschool Education: Towards a Research Agenda","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this seminar series is to articulate a research agenda that will address contemporary issues about preschool education. Each seminar will provide a forum to look again at what we need to know to make a difference to childrenâ€™s preschool experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade the growth of educational provision for children before they begin primary education looks like a success story. However, that should not suggest that there are no longer challenges that warrant further research and recent developments mean that looking afresh at our understanding of preschool education is a timely process. A key characteristic of the seminars will be the wide mix of perspectives represented from across the four UK education systems. Participants will include researchers with expertise in education, psychology and social policy as well as those from across the UK who shape policy and develop curricular and practice guidance.</p>\n\n<p>An important feature of the seminars will be the opportunities which they offer for engagement between participants from the voluntary, private and public sectors, all of whom have important interests in learning in the early years and developed understandings of the needs of children, their families and the processes of preschool education. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0367","grantId":"RES-451-26-0367","fundValue":"11058","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Stephen","coPersons":["Elizabeth Helen  Brooker","Lynn  Ang"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
