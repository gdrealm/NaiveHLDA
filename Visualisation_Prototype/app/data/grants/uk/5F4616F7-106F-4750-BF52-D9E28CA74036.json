While education will play an important role in reducing their incidence, pharmaceutical intervention will remain a very important method of treatment until methods of beta cell transplantation improve (e.g. stem cells), and/or public attitudes towards diet and exercise change. Indeed, the importance that is placed on diabetes research was exemplified by the ?Department of Health and MRC Review on Diabetes Research? which was published in 2002 as part of the National Service Framework for Diabetes.\n\nOne of the most important actions of insulin is to stimulate the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and fat tissue. In type I diabetes, insulin is not produced due to auto-immune attack on the beta cells which are responsible for insulin production. In type II diabetes, insulin production is often normal or elevated (until late stage diabetes) but the target tissues for insulin action do not respond effectively (?insulin resistance?). While we have an increasing understanding of how insulin works on glucose uptake, many aspects are still completely unknown. For example, we know that an enzyme called protein kinase B (PKB) is involved but we do not know in exactly what capacity and how this may be affected in diabetes. Our work involves using a unique combination of state-of-the-art cell and molecular biology techniques as well as proteomics to examine the mechanism by which insulin brings about its effects on glucose uptake with particular emphasis on the role of PKB. \n\nWe take public engagement and dialogue extremely seriously. Professor Tavare was recently part of a programme broadcast on the BBC called ?Cell City? which examined the inner workings of cells. The programme was part of the Open University?s Open Science series and he discussed our work using green fluorescent protein to follow the dynamics of insulin action inside single living cells. Professor Tavare has also appeared on both HTV and BBC local news programmes and has given a number of lay presentations at Diabetes UK Regional Groups (including Swindon, Bournemouth and London). Two members of the research team are part of the Bristol Teacher-Scientist Partnership Network and have taken part in primary and secondary school science education.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G7708269","grantId":"G7708269","fundValue":"4256300","fundStart":"1978-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Tavare","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
