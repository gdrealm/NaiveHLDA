International students whose first language is not English encounter many difficulties when attempting to use language in real life situations. Although there is some reference to 'real' English in English Language Teaching materials used in China, the lack of existing research to develop context-sensitive descriptions of language-in-use mean that many English Language Teaching materials are often limited in providing the kind of language competencies required to interact in the host culture. </p>\n\n<p><br />Building on previous ESRC-funded research in this area, this research tests a concept demonstrator for a multi-modal ELT resource for teaching academic English in different contexts and subjects. The aim is to develop a high quality product in collaboration with commercial partners aimed at improving listening skills of Chinese-speaking students who intend to join or are on postgraduate courses in English-speaking universities. Materials will be developed in different formats and will be trialled initially via web-based delivery and through mobile learning environments. The end-user data will be analysed with a view to establishing key usability issues in terms of content and navigation as well as the strategy for commercial delivery of the material.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0146","grantId":"RES-189-25-0146","fundValue":"69962","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald  Carter","coPersons":["Svenja  Adolphs"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
