Providing cheaper mobile phone calls for home usage would greatly benefit the general public. The objective of this research is to investigate of the possibility of a Femtocell based on WiMAX technology, particularly in the home environment. The comparison to the proposed 3G Femtocell will be done. Cost, performance and implantation difficulties are the main concerns. The feasibility study will also identify the technical areas that need further research that could improve/enhance the implementation. The research outcomes of the proposed project will ultimately benefit the consumers as well as the service providers. The research is in the telecommunication sector, but consequently it affects to our daily life in terms of socialising, entertaining and learning at home. The research will also benefit the operators in the way of extending their network coverage, and retaining existing subscribers with low prices and good service is the only way to maintain the market share.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F067364/1","grantId":"EP/F067364/1","fundValue":"70357","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Enjie  Liu","coPersons":["Jie  Zhang"],"organisation":"University of Bedfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
