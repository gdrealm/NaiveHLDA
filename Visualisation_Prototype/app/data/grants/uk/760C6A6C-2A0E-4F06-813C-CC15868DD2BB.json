{"id":"760C6A6C-2A0E-4F06-813C-CC15868DD2BB","title":"Computer-Aided Design of Sustainable Separations: CADSep","abstractText":"The research team will develop a fast and automated approach to identify the solvent mixtures that give the best separation\nof pharmaceutical compounds. This can mean finding the best mixture amongst existing ones or inventing a new mixture\nfor a particular application. This work can have a large impact on pharmaceutical discovery and manufacturing, as the fast\nidentification of good solvent systems will help to test more potential drug compounds and to explore a larger number of\nmanufacturing routes.\nKey aspects of the work will include: (i) developing predictive models of the physical properties of pharmaceutical\ncompounds in a wide range of solvent mixtures, (ii) developing an algorithm for solvent mixture identification, (iii) testing\nthese advances by working with industrial partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K504099/1","grantId":"EP/K504099/1","fundValue":"136354","fundStart":"2013-03-04","fundEnd":"2014-09-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Sandrine Adjiman","coPersons":["Andrew  Livingston","George  Jackson","Amparo  Galindo"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
