To become the &quot;go-to&quot; website for information on the tobacco industry, the project aims to: </p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make preliminary research findings publicly available in a timely manner;</p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enable the systematic storage and retrieval of&nbsp; preliminary research findings so they can be further analysed into traditional academic papers;</p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serve as a means of disseminating published research findings to a large audience; </p>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compile research findings in a way that is useful to policy-makers and journalists.</p>\n\n<p>This will be achieved by working with stakeholders and knowledge exchange-experts to maximise the relevance of TobaccoTactics to key users and identify the most effective ways of driving users to the site.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00206X/1","grantId":"ES/L00206X/1","fundValue":"98757","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna  Gilmore","coPersons":["Eveline Jolanda  Lubbers","Andrew  Rowell"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
