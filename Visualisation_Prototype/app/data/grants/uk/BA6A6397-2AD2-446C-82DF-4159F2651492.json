This group have over 30 years experience with use of such systems. Disposal of low and intermediate level nuclear wastes containing reactive metals such as aluminium and magnesium cannot be handled readily in the current cement formulations due to metal corrosion and hydrigen generation. These systems have a different chemistry which preliminary trials have shown give little corrosion. We want to draw on the Chinese experience which has not been widely published in the West.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D039533/1","grantId":"EP/D039533/1","fundValue":"16582","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Brennan  Milestone","coPersons":["Kenneth Thomas Victor Grattan","Yun  Bai","Muhammed  Basheer"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
