{"id":"E97588E8-C6EE-4CDC-BB67-3C0E90B19275","title":"New generation nuclear detectors for use in well logging","abstractText":"Well logging is a key tool for oil and gas exploration, where the composition and structure of strata are probed by introducing instruments down a borehole. Radiation detection is important to this type of approach but is challenging as it must perform highly in an environment with strongly elevated temperatures. We will evaluate the potential for silicon carbide-based APDs as a platform for such radiation detectors when coupled to appropriate scintillator crystals. The test system will be evaluated at temperatures realistic to well logging.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L006251/1","grantId":"ST/L006251/1","fundValue":"101998","fundStart":"2014-07-30","fundEnd":"2015-07-29","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The impact is low at present as the project has only really just started. We have been engaging with companies working in the oil and gas sector and have some good initial results but these are far from the final goals.

This exploits our earlier projects working on scintillators and silicon photomultipliers. As we are only a few months into a 12-month project, the impact so far is low. We hope to develop detectors that will be taken up by the oil and gas exploration industry. We have already engaged with various companies working in this area which ensures that we are well informed with what their requirements are. Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
