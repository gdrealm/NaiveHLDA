The aims of the research are to examine the scope and nature as well as what it means in children's lives to participate in faith literacy activities.

Paradoxically, research into faith as a mediator of learning remains extremely limited, perhaps because it is considered a private and intimate part of family life. This study has uncovered a remarkable breadth and depth of learning effected through faith in the lives of 16 children living in London. \n\n\n\nAcross all settings, we identified and examined important overlapping themes: beauty and emotion; the learning of skills and knowledge; syncretism and intergenerationality, continuity and belonging:\n\n\n\ni) Beauty and emotion infuse learning in the places of worship, and learning is multimodal and multisensory. Children regularly perform music, mime, dance and text recitation which become part of their bilingual repertoires. Faith is steeped in symbols which children learn in the faith classes, alongside the history, culture and stories of their heritage country. Children learn by participating in celebrations and rituals then enacted in their sociodramatic play.\n\nii) The learning of languages and literacies is interwoven with artistic, aesthetic, social, cultural and moral learning. Children learn a range of formal oral and written texts with difficult lexis, complex narratives and intricate rituals where high expectations demand mature behaviour and performance; simultaneously, they act these out in a supportive environment, rehearsing texts and concepts with parents or through sibling play. We argue that faith is thus 'imbibed' rather than formally learned, yet its structure means that faith activities provide a bridge between the informal early learning of the home and the formal learning of school. \n\niii) Children syncretise aspects of culture from both their heritage and London worlds. Although faith itself offers a body of permanent texts, rituals and traditions, our study shows how children draw upon different languages, literacies and narratives as well as the internet, other media and their own experiences to make personal sense of these. This is illustrated through children's mind maps revealing complex interwoven aspects of school, home and faith in their everyday lives. \n\niv) Faith activities link generations, providing recognition of the expertise of older people who mediate the heritage language, history and culture. At the same time, children transform their heritage tradition, using new media to interpret their faith. \n\n\n\n(see web-site: http://www.belifs.co.uk for a full account of our findings) Faith leaders and faith teachers should become aware of the academic, social and cultural skills children are developing alongside their knowledge of their faith so that they can draw more explicitly upon these in their faith lessons.\n\n • Mainstream school teachers need to know more about the knowledge and skills learned by children in their faith settings so that they can support the whole child.\n\n • Parents of children who are members of their faith community should be proud of their children's skills and achievements.\n\n • This knowledge should be recognised and celebrated by the whole community. \n\nThe findings from this project are being distributed to Head Teachers, teachers and faith communities who are already using some of the practical ideas from this work (activities involving grandparents and older people, scrap-books, mind-maps etc.) Currently, findings are being disseminated through key-notes and other seminars and talks to both an academic and non-academic audience. Two books are in preparation: an authored book 'Faith Literacies and Children's Learning' (Gregory and Lytra) Sage (2015) and an edited collection (Lytra, Volk and Gregory) on the learning of languages and literacies through faith and religious activities in a global context.
