However, as evermore of our culture is digitised, other disciplines including architecture, natural and built environment, performance, and others are re-discovering transdisciplinary notions of site and embodied experience of place. They are broadening their research from studies of the purely material cultures of roads, paths, and buildings in order to encompass the experiences and social relationships for which these were constructed. While developing their definition of Intangible Cultural Heritage, members of UNESCO looked at Rangihiroa Panoho's example of the marae, as simultaneously a building and a cultural meeting space for the Maori: a place in which certain kinds of behaviors and values are learned and transmitted. These sites are often documented by researchers using traditional research tools including cameras, GPS loggers, etc, but the behavior, the embodied experience of the place is lost. Architects long ago realised that it is not possible to get a proper understanding of a location by simply looking at drawings or images. We need to move around a building in order to understand it. Traditionally, architects would build 3D models to allow people to look at places from different viewpoints. Recently, many have turned to digital techniques to enable virtual fly-throughs, but have discovered that in order to get a truly embodied understanding of what they intend to build, they must 'walk the site'. Only by moving through a site, can they comprehend the scales, orientations, and relationships. \\n\\nMany reconstructions of historic structures built specifically to accommodate human movement as an art form demonstrate their awareness of the value of human movement through their use of Second Life for visualisations, but fail to inject the gravity of embodied movement into such environments. Consequently, this need for new approaches and methods of framing problems in order to exploit and productively challenge data capture and visualization technologies is giving rise to a richly interdisciplinary research community linking architects, geographers and anthropologists, with the artists, archaeologists, dancer-choreographers, cultural theorists, and software and interface developers behind the current proposal. \\n\\nWhereas numerous projects exist to allow researchers to walk through virtual or re-constructions of sites, the Motion in Place Plaftorm (MiPP) will provide new methods for researchers to visit existing sites and generate research data as they move through them. The platform will be a collection of hard and software tools enabling two forms of movement data to be captured on site:\\n\\n- positional data from multiple people moving over large areas and large time scales (e.g., the movements of a team of archaeologists over an entire 6 month dig) following multiple people...\\n\\n- high resolution, full-body data from 2 people in a 200 m2 area over shorter periods of time (e.g., the sequence of movements needed to bring water from a well to a hearth)\\n\\nIn addition, the project will develop a number of tools and test projects to demonstrate how this motion data can be shared and used by a variety of disciplines. Initial test projects will address the use of data captured on site in virtual restorations, relationships between the movements of an excavation team and the items they uncover, the use of augmented reality systems to view movement on the site itself, and manners in which the exploration of a site for the creation of performances and cultural artifacts can uncover here-to-fore hidden relationships between elements of a place. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037675/1","grantId":"AH/H037675/1","fundValue":"434345","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings from the project have led to a re-thinking of movement and mobilities in virtual heritage (re)construction as well as questioning the nature of site-specific and virtual performance.

In this context, environments can refer to archaeological sites or modern habitats. The research team determined the viability of measuring human activity and behaviour outdoors using current inertial motion capture technologies and conducted a number of tests to see how movement captured on-site differed from movement captured in a studio. The research team then developed a number of examples for use of this motion data in heritage and cultural settings. \n\nThe findings have been presented at a number of Archaeology, Digital Arts, and Digital Performance conferences and festivals.
