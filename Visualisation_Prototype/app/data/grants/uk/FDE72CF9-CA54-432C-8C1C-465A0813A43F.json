The launch of this new Centre signifies the determination of China to become a leading country in the development and applications of nanotechnology. The recent significant advances in scientific research in China can be linked directly to the increasing level of international collaborations which are strongly encouraged by sustained investments from the State. The UK has a strong base in nanoscience research with a number of research centres and labs openned more than 10 years ago. Surface science, one of the most important branches of nanoscience, is represented strongly by an internationally recognised academic community in the UK. There is now a golden opportunity for initiation of academic links between China and the UK in this fast developing field of nanosceince. The aim of this proposal is to bring scientists from the UK and China to a workshop in Beijing, where they can have face-to-face discussions about mutually interested topics and establish useful links for future collaborations.The UK delegates have been carefully selected after consultation within the academia, with a strong emphasis on choosing relatively young academics with a proven record of conducting independent and internationally leading research. This is essential for making the proposed research most effective and bringing the most benefits to both the UK and the Chinese scientific communities. Prof. P Moriarty and Dr Q Guo are committee members of the Thin Films and Surfaces Group and the Nanoscale Physics and Technology Group of the Institute of Physics, respectively. Prof. N V Richardson, who served as the Director of the UK Interdisciplinary Centre in Surface Science from 1990 to 1997, is a leading figure among the international surface science community, with a vast experience in management of collaborative research. The workshop will take place in the top Chinese HE institution: Tsinghua University which itself has a newly opened nanoresearch centre. Prof. L Z Cha there has kindly agreed to host the event after being approached by Dr Q Guo. the workshop is expected to attract a number of leading researchers from Tsinghua University, Beijing University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The UK delegates will visit research labs in the National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology, and several Universities including the two named above, to ascertain the state-of-the-art in nanoscience research in China.It is envisaged that follow-on visits (funding not seeked for these in the current application) by Chinese researchers to UK labs will take place in order to raise the awareness of UK researchers of the research activities in China. This will, without any doubt, lead to a wide range of long lasting collaborations between the UK and China, which will be mutually beneficial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D036445/1","grantId":"EP/D036445/1","fundValue":"8113","fundStart":"2006-07-05","fundEnd":"2007-01-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Quanmin  Guo","coPersons":["Martin Rolf Castell","Timothy S Jones","Neville  Richardson","Philip  Moriarty"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
