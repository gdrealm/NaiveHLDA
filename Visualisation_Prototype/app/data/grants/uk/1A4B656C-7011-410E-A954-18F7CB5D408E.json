The Centre builds on the existing capability and resources across the University of Surrey, which has been investing in Cyber Security research as a high-priority research area since 2004. The Centre focuses on three main research directions - Privacy and Data Protection, Secure Communications, and Human-Centred Security - building on the University's strength and the background of members of the Centre. Recognition of the Centre as an Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research will help in consolidating research activities that are currently carried out across three faculties, and in creating new synergies for long-term collaborative research projects on the emerging interdisciplinary challenges of Cyber Security. It will also foster the international visibility and positioning of the Centre and expand its linkage with businesses, industry research institutions, and governmental bodies.\n\nThe initial composition of the Centre consists of 8 Core Members from Computing and Electronic Engineering (Institute for Communication Systems), with established track records in selected key areas of Cyber Security. Within the University there are also a further 19 Associate Members, who hold strong research expertise in areas that are strategically important in addressing interdisciplinary cyber security challenges and where existing mutual interests and potentials are likely to lead to the establishment of joint research initiatives within the proposed Centre.\n\nIn the short-term the Surrey Centre for Security will:\n\n- consolidate and promote its research activities, \n- establish an efficient organisation and management structure (including an Advisory Board), \n- identify new directions and bid for interdisciplinary and technology-focused cyber-security research projects, \n- establish a regular seminar series, \n- expand on its postgraduate teaching and PhD programmes, \n- refine its strategy upon the consultations with its liaison officer from GCHQ (and other governmental stakeholders).\n\nIn the medium-term the Centre will \n- actively bid for new research projects and increase its research output in high-quality publication venues,\n- engage in collaborative projects with other ACE-CSRs and our partners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N002717/1","grantId":"EP/N002717/1","fundValue":"20185","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Schneider","coPersons":["Shujun  Li","Mark  Manulis"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
