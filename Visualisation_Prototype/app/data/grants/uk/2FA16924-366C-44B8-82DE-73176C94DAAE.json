{"id":"2FA16924-366C-44B8-82DE-73176C94DAAE","title":"Making Publics across Time and Space","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project is to construct a new network of connections between researchers in the UK and North America who have been working on similar concerns but whose work has been separated by time and space.</p>\n\n<p>The North American group have focused on the making of publics in early modern history; while the UK group has addressed contemporary practices of public making. However, the two groups share some significant questions, analytical approaches and methods. We aim to bring members of the two groups together in conversation to explore these differences and similarities in question, method and analysis. We are interested to assess:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the significance of historical period</li>\n\n <li>the effects of the social, political and cultural contexts of possibilities and practices of public making</li>\n\n <li>to consider how the methodological and analytical orientations might be developed further. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a very strong commitment to seeing this network as a means of developing future scholarship and future scholars, darwing on existing practices in the two groups towards the development of early career researchers.</p>\n\n<p>What can we learn from these different 'publics'? What can they tell us about the way publics are formed and how public interests rise and fall?</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019771/1","grantId":"ES/J019771/1","fundValue":"23740","fundStart":"2013-01-29","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Clarke","coPersons":["Nicholas  Mahony"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
