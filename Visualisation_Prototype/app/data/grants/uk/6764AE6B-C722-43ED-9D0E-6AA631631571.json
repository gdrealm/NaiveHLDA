{"id":"6764AE6B-C722-43ED-9D0E-6AA631631571","title":"Modelling the geological factors in pipe failure for better infrastructure management","abstractText":"Water companies manage extensive networks of clean and waste water pipes. Sometimes these pipes fail catastrophically, resulting in; loss of supply to properties, public highway closures and potentially long-term inconvenience to business and the general public. Pipes also frequently suffer leakage resulting in loss of pressure, increased demands on water treatment works (increasing carbon emissions) and water-related ground instability for example. The potential for pipe failure is, to some extent, controlled by ground conditions, in particular soil corrosion and stresses resulting from ground movement. This project is concerned with understanding the relationship between ground conditions and pipe failure so that we can attempt to predict where pipes are more likely to fail. The project will focus on the Yorkshire Water region and will take advantage of their pipe failure database. Locations where pipe failure has occurred will be analysed against data on ground stability, terrain and soil corrosivity sourced from the British Geological Survey. A conceptual model of pipe failure and a map showing predicted failure rate will be developed. The results of this project are anticipated to improve the ability of Yorkshire Water to plan their asset investment strategies for repair and maintenance. This will allow them to target investment to pipes that are most susceptible to fail, and thus use customer's money more efficiently. It will also reduce the frequency of catastrophic pipe failures, long-term leakage and reduce diffuse pollution caused by leaking sewerage pipes and infiltration of groundwater into pipes (causing combined sewers to overflow). Whilst this project is specifically concerned with the Yorkshire Water region, the results and/or methodology tested during this project are anticipated to be transferable to other water companies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M008339/1","grantId":"NE/M008339/1","fundValue":"38458","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel Ann Dearden","coPersons":["Richard Murray Lark","Andy Mark Tye"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
