Specialized cells of the immune system, called macrophages, are particularly equipped for clearance of particulate material, a process referred to as phagocytosis. Anomalies in recognition or uptake result in inflammatory diseases and life-threatening infections. We need to better understand the fundamental mechanisms of phagocytosis to help design new drugs for patients suffering from these diseases. To do so, our research will focus on a particular class of molecules that control phagocytosis. We will determine which of them control uptake of different types of particles, and how they are regulated to do so. Thereby, it will later be possible to design drugs that block the adverse effects of phagocytosis, whilst maintaining of even boosting (where necessary) the beneficial sides of this fundamental physiological process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700154","grantId":"G0700154","fundValue":"340357","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gad  FrankelEmmanuelle  Caron","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
