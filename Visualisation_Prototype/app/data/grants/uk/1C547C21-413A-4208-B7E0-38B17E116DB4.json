The time course and severity of the disease is extremely variable and there is no way to predict whether it will follow a mild or aggressive course. Current treatments are only successful at decreasing the number of attacks but have no effect on the progression of the disease. Damage to the brain is thought to be caused by an attack by the immune system on the insulating myelin sheath that covers nerve fibres. This appears as multiple areas of inflammation in the fibre tracts. Recent research in our laboratories on post-mortem brains has identified a subgroup of MS cases (40% in the current study) in which there is also extensive damage to the surface layers of the brain. These cases are characterised by inflammation in the meninges, the tissue that forms the outside lining of the brain. We have found that antibody producing cells, B-lymphocytes, are proliferating in the meninges. This suggests that substances toxic to the cells of the brain are diffusing into the underlying layers of the cerebral cortex and causing the damage in this subset of MS cases. These cases also followed a more aggressive disease course, resulting in a shorter time to wheelchair dependence and earlier death. \n This project is designed to gain an understanding of the mechanisms of damage to neurons in order to identify drug targets for the development of novel treatments. We will use two groups of MS cases for which post-mortem tissue is available, one group that has B-lymphocytes in the meninges and which followed the more aggressive disease course and a group that does not. Firstly, we will study the changes in the number of neurons in areas of tissue damage and then investigate which genes are being turned on and off by the neurons that might explain why some of them are dying. This will be achieved by studying all 30,000+ genes in these cells simultaneously using gene chips. The presence within the brain tissue of proteins known to be toxic to neurons, which may have diffused from the brain surface, will be analysed. Patient histories will be used to correlate this information with variables such as disease onset and relapse frequency. Identification of this sub-group of MS patients at high risk of a poor outcome could facilitate early treatment before extensive and irreversible damage occurs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700356","grantId":"G0700356","fundValue":"513439","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Reynolds","coPersons":["Paolo Paolo Muraro","Owain  Howell","Deanna Lesley Taylor"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
