Current treatments fail in the long term as they do not address the aberrant memory processes that maintain drinkers' susceptibility to relapse even after years of abstinence. This quiescent susceptibility is due to Maladaptive Motivational Memories (MMMs) that accompany and support alcohol abuse. Associations formed between environmental 'cues' and drinking imbue the cues with motivational properties that cause cravings, alcohol seeking and relapse when similar cues are re-encountered in the environment. Recent evidence shows that memories can be permanently altered by manipulating a process called 'reconsolidation.' This process is initiated under certain circumstances, causing a retrieved memory to become destabilised. During the 'reconsolidation window' - the interval between destabilisation and restabilisation - the memory is rendered malleable. These findings suggest an exciting opportunity for treating alcohol problems by weakening the MMMs at the heart of AUD.\nIn rodents, MMMs can be destabilised using a reminder of previous learning (e.g. a tone that previously signalled drug availability). Since restabilisation requires activity at certain brain receptors (especially NMDARs), it can be blocked pharmacologically. If this occurs, the animal later behaves as if the memory association had been 'erased' and drug seeking stops. Available NMDA antagonists - like ketamine - could similarly be used to block restabilisation of MMMs in humans. It may also be possible to 'overwrite' MMMs behaviourally, by training adaptive new associations while MMMs are unstable. This type of procedure would also be expected to reduce cue-induced craving and drinking.\nWhile these strategies are promising, there are key issues which must be resolved before MMM-modification can be developed for addiction. These are i) that MMMs only destabilise under certain conditions and ii) we cannot yet measure memory destabilisation directly. The critical first step towards developing MMM-modifying treatments for AUD is therefore to develop methods for reliably destabilising MMMs and metrics for measuring this. The primary factor determining memory destabilisation at retrieval is a mismatch between the outcomes predicted by a memory association (e.g. drinking alcohol) and actual outcome (e.g. the drink is withheld), also called a 'prediction error' (PE).This PE enables memory destabilisation when new information about the availability or effects of alcohol coincides with memory retrieval, allowing the memory to be updated with new information. \nThis project aims to identify robust procedures for destabilising alcohol-MMMs and measuring this destabilisation. To do this we will examine the effects of i) blocking restabilisation using the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine and ii) overwriting destabilised MMMs so that they no longer promote drinking.\nIn both studies, we manipulate the mismatch between expected and actual drinking outcomes during retrieval of alcohol-MMMs in harmful drinkers. We predict that unexpected information about alcohol availability or value when recalling alcohol-MMMs will cause their destabilisation. In Study I, we aim to block re-stabilisation with ketamine, weakening the alcohol-MMM's ability to activate alcohol seeking and drinking. In Study II, we will use a behavioural procedure to over-write destabilised alcohol-MMMs by training associations between the alcohol cues and unpleasant outcomes (a very bitter drink and aversive pictures) in the reconsolidation window. This procedure should update the effect of alcohol cues from pro- to anti-consummatory. Both interventions should result in reduced alcohol-seeking and drinking.\nIf one or both of the procedures are successful, they will have significant potential as clinical treatments for AUD, although wider application to other addictions and psychological disorders is also possible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M007006/1","grantId":"MR/M007006/1","fundValue":"477509","fundStart":"2014-11-03","fundEnd":"2018-04-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sunjeev  Kamboj","coPersons":["Merel  Kindt","Leuntje Jacoba Otten","Helen Valerie Curran"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
