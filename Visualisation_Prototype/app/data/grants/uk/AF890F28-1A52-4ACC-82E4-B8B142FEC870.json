Youtube is a sign of things to come. This project's aim is to investigate the usually hidden 'engine room' of the editing suite in amateur and professional communities. The approach to investigating editing arises out of a concern with its practical skills. The research questions therefore are: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is editing as a form of work and what are the diverse creative skills which go into editing together movies?</li> \n <li>How do editors, professional and amateur, analyse and assemble materials? </li> \n <li>What can social scientists learn from these experts in this kind of video-analysis?</li> \n <li>What sorts of dialogues, agreements, disagreements and forms of reasoning underpin editing?</li> \n <li>What is involved in becoming a competent editor? </li>\n</ul> \n<p>Appropriate to such a project, video-ethnography is the methodology that will underpin the investigation and will be developed by its engagement with experienced video-makers. Ethnography is the systematic study of the relationship between accounts and actions. Fieldwork will involve immersion in seven editing communities, specifically: home editing 'rooms', a community resource centre, a wedding video-maker, a live-edit suite, a mobile edit suite, and two professional suites.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E021603/1","grantId":"ES/E021603/1","fundValue":"316468","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project findings are informing the design of mobile video editing tools.

It drew out the lessons for social scientists doing video-analysis can learn from vernacular expertise. This was achieved in part through documenting and describing the forms of dialogue, agreement, disagreement and reasoning that underpin editing. Detailed analysis of video editing practice captured the ‘accountability’ of cutting decisions in real time as they are done, as well as preceding and succeeding the edit. This revealed the complex skills involved in becoming not only a competent but also an excellent editor, as understood via learning by doing. Home Movies\n\n• Home movie editing continues a tradition of home production (e.g. sewing clothes, dark rooms in the house).\n• It makes heavy use of certain editing technologies to do so (e.g. the cross-cut dissolve &amp; pre-made templates).\n• The sharing of these products has been enabled and transformed by video content sharing sites (e..g Youtube, Vimeo etc.).\n• Central to the logics of the home movie are desires for and logics of commemoration, recollection and the giving of the movies themselves as gifts.\n\nProfessional Editing\n\n• Editors that have worked across linear tape-based and non-linear tapeless production continue to reflect on and provide insights into transformations in technology, technique &amp; organisation.\n• Editing traverses conventionalised production (e.g. sports highlights) to creative (e.g. cinema release documentary) that have distinct practices and timeframes.\n• Institutional asymmetries between director/producer &amp; editor are constituted and drawn upon as resources in organising the work of editing.\n• Creating the video-to-come draws upon professional imaginations that can see it, in audio-visual media that are opaque to the untrained observer.\n• Epistemic access to video media relies upon the skills of the editor in marshalling and playing just what is required for the production team to work on the video materials.\n\nSocial Sciences\n\n• Editors are vernacular video analysts and thus we can learn from them what more video analysis might be.\n• Social sciences can borrow both techniques for video products but also techniques for organising, viewing, sharing and archiving video recordings of social practices.
