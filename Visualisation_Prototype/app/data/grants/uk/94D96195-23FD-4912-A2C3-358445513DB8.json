We hope to be able to identify avian H5N1 viruses that could cause a human pandemic. \n\nWe know that to start infection, influenza viruses first need to bind to carbohydrate structures (receptors) on cells. Normally, human and avian viruses bind to different carbohydrates. \n\nWhen the genes of avian viruses change or become mixed with genes of human viruses, they can switch to have preference for human cells. Human pandemic viruses can emerge in this way.\n\nIt is very challenging to detect and determine particular carbohydrate structures that the viruses bind to. This is because carbohydrates on cells are very diverse. They are like a forest containing innumerable trees with only a few specimens of each. \n\nWe have been developing a unique approach to identifying receptors among this vast range of carbohydrates. This is Carbohydrate Microarray Technology that involves spotting minute amounts of carbohydrates from cells onto a glass slide.\n\nWe are adapting the microarray technology to detect binding of the proteins known as haemagglutinins of different influenza viruses. We hope by this approach to be able to predict the pandemic potential of a given virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600512","grantId":"G0600512","fundValue":"242030","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ten  Feizi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
