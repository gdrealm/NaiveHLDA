This will be followed by a two-day residential seminar at the Brathay Trust's residential centre, to which we shall invite Brathay staff and academics with expertise in the relevant areas, from the Institute of Applied Social Research as well as visiting professors at the university. The outcomes will be collected in an edited book or a themed issue of a relevant journal.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I028382/1","grantId":"ES/I028382/1","fundValue":"9750","fundStart":"2011-05-04","fundEnd":"2012-05-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  cf Final Report - No new information Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"John  Pitts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bedfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
