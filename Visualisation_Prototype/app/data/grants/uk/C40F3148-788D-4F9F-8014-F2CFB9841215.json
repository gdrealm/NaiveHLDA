The researchers propose to use a source of intense high frequency radio waves (terahertz), available at the university of califonia, to modulate the wavelength of light emission from such devices. Since it is possible to detect visible light using very sensitive (photon counting) technologies the effects of such studies will open up routes to detect such radio waves with extreme sensitivity. This will impact in many areas such as astronomy, telecommunication, medical imaging.....","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D051304/1","grantId":"EP/D051304/1","fundValue":"18233","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The proposal was aimed at funding sabbatical at the UCSB to research the application of free electron lasers to electronic material research.
