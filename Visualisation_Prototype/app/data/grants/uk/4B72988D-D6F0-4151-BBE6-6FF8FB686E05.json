From here, they send projections which innervate widespread areas of the forebrain. As a consequence, it is perhaps not surprising that the dopamine systems are implicated in a wide range of normal brain processes (for example certain types of learning) and clinical disorders (for example Parkinson's disease). Although we know much about the neurotransmitter dopamine, the function or purpose of the message which dopaminergic neurons (i.e. ones that use dopamine to communicate with other areas on the brain) convey to the forebrain remains elusive. Studies in animals have shown that dopaminergic neurons are activated when an animal is presented with unexpected sensory events ('stimuli') in a range of modalities which have important implications for the animal / for example when an animal is presented with food or a food related stimulus. At present, the two main theories concerning the content of the dopamine message are that it is specifically related to 'rewards' like food, or that it has a broader remit, telling the forebrain that something important or salient has happened without telling it what it is. How do we choose between these two? We believe that an important strategy for decoding the dopamine message is to identify and then elucidate the perceptual properties of the sensory pathways providing input to dopaminergic neurons, because these neurons can only pass on (albeit in processed form) the information they are given. We already have evidence that visual information is relayed to dopaminergic neurons via an evolutionarily primitive structure, the superior colliculus, more in keeping with the 'salience' than the 'reward' hypothesis, given that the colliculus is much better at telling the brain that something has happened than ir is at analysing its properties. However, our knowledge of the sensory control of dopaminergic neurons is still incomplete: in particular, we lack fundamental information about the sensory systems which provide auditory and non-noxious somatosensory information to these neurons. The overall objective of the present proposal will be to determine the source(s) of this information in the rat, using a unique combination of techniques. Firstly, we will use anatomical techniques to trace the connections to dopaminergic neurons arising from auditory and somatosensory structures: this will give us an initial indication of the potential sources of this information. Secondly, we will record the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the anaesthetised animal whilst the animal is presented with auditory and somatosensory stimuli. By manipulating the activity of the anatomically identified putatitive sources of auditory and somatosensory information (either increasing or decreasing activity by the injection of chemicals), and observing the effect of these manipulations on the activity of dopaminergic neurons responding to auditory and somatosensory stimuli, it will be possible to identify which sources seem to provide the requisite information. Finally, we will use a technique called electrochemistry to determine whether the changes in the responses of dopaminergic neurons to auditory and somatosensory stimuli which the above manipulations produce have an impact on the release of dopamine in the forebrain. The proposed experiments will provide essential information required to assess the nature and quality of the perceptual information available to dopaminergic neurons. As a consequence, the functional role of the message conveyed to the forebrain via the activation of these cells, which is at present a matter of considerable debate, will become appreciably clearer. A corollary of this is that, when the dopamine systems 'go wrong' in dopamine-associated disorders, the nature of the subsequent deficit will be clearer, potentially opening the way for new therapeutic interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D019648/1","grantId":"BB/D019648/1","fundValue":"304451","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The finding have been incorporated into talks that have been given to non-specialist audiences.

These cells play a central role in many normal brain functions and are implicated in a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Understanding how dopamine-containing neurons are regulated is a key step towards developing effective interventions for these disorders. In particular we have found: \n\n1. That widespread areas of the cerebral cortex (including somatosensory and auditory areas) project to the superior colliculus in the rat.\n\n2. That the somatosensory cortex can 'talk' to the dopamine systems via the superior colliculus, thus elucidating the origin of a component of the dopaminergic response to somatosensory stimuli.\n\n3. The demonstration that the visual cortex (primary and secondary) can also talk to the dopamine systems via the superior colliculus, elucidating the origin of a component of the dopaminergic response to visual stimuli. The findings have already attracted academic interest, as evidenced by the citations that papers arising from the project have received. On a wider scale, elucidating the means by which the dopamine systems are regulated could be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, given that dopamine plays a central role in a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders. In support of that possibility, I have received funding from pharmaceutical companies in the past to conduct related research. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
