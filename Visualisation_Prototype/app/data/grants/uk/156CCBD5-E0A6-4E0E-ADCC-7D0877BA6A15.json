The deployment of energy efficiency technologies and management techniques depends on the physical conditions present in the existing building stock, as well as the ownership characteristics and management practices in each building. That is, adopting better technologies and practices depends on what fits, where, and for whom.\n\nThe Working with Infrastructure, Creation of Knowledge, and Energy strategies Deployment (WICKED) project uses a segmented socio-technical approach to work with and learn from different configurations of building energy data and ownership in the existing UK non-domestic stock. The project develops and implements the concepts of &quot;data rich&quot; and &quot;data poor&quot; to identify and map energy-related technical and organizational infrastructure, as well as barriers to and opportunities for change. Top-down analytics on large anonymized non-domestic data sets from energy provider partners will be combined with middle-out case studies of landlord and tenant fleets and bottom-up empirical work in SME buildings, focused predominantly on the retail sector. The project will use this information to engage with and co-create appropriate knowledge for different types and scales of stakeholders: owners, occupiers, landlords, tenants, and energy providers. Through this knowledge and interaction, the project enables adoption of energy efficiency technologies and management techniques appropriate for each stakeholder segment. Based on our findings, our project will develop an action toolbox oriented towards the different needs of different market segments. Indicative innovative products to emerge from this work are: online energy advisor backed up by large data sets, &quot;smart-er&quot; technologies to retrofit legacy gas and electric meters, new forms of leasing agreements, and effective energy management procedures tailored for different stakeholder groups. \n\nAnalyzing this complex landscape and its many opportunities and challenges requires a broad based, problem-directed and interdisciplinary approach. The University of Oxford academic team brings together expertise in social and technical aspects of energy demand (Dr. Kathryn Janda and Dr. Russell Layberry), information technologies (Dr. David Wallom), mathematics (Professor Peter Grindrod) engineering (Dr. Malcolm McCulloch), and law (Professor Susan Bright). Non-academic partners for this project are energy suppliers, retailers, local and national government stakeholders, landowners, tenants, and energy advice companies. These partners will leverage the EPSRC funding requested by the provision of data, management practices, lease agreements, test sites, and equipment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L024357/1","grantId":"EP/L024357/1","fundValue":"492581","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Grindrod","coPersons":["David  Wallom","Susan  Bright","Malcolm  McCulloch"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
