{"id":"46F4BDC2-F18D-489D-90B1-E0111D4CE5EE","title":"Scaled Electricity Storage Using Lithium-Sulfur Batteries","abstractText":"The University of St Andrews and OXIS Energy Ltd will collaborate in order to demonstrate a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) flow\nbattery. Li-S chemistry has two key advantages; it uses cheap and abundant raw materials; and delivers vastly improved\nenergy density in comparison to incumbent technologies. Li-S batteries are therefore cheaper per unit of energy stored\nthan incumbent technologies. The proposed project will seek to demonstrate how this can be exploited together with a\nnovel Redox Flow Battery (RFB) design to deliver cost effective energy storage at a grid level. The project will demonstrate\nthe operation of a lab scale Li-S RFB. This will involve the design and construction of new test hardware; the development\nof new electrolyte formulations; the testing of novel electrode materials and composites; and finally the investigation of\noperation conditions. The resulting battery will establish the commercial feasibility of the concept for stationary applications,\nwhere large battery capacity and low cost are essential. This inexpensive grid-scale battery promises to efficiently connect\nintermittent renewables to the grid thus increasing energy security while simultaneously reducing both bills and emissions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508639/1","grantId":"EP/N508639/1","fundValue":"137564","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Irvine","coPersons":["Paul Alexander Connor"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
