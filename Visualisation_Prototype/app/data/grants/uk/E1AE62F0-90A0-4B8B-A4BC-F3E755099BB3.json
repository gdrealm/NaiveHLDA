In this First Grant we will develop a new class of ultracompact photonic devices based on nanoscale plasmonic antennas. Plasmonics, the science dealing with confining light at the surface of metals, has the potential to become one of the key nanotechnologies capable of combining electric and photonic components on a single chip. Photonic integration is important to achieve medium-range information transfer and chip-to-chip interconnects in next-generation communication networks.Analogous to their radiowave counterparts, plasmonic nanoantennas are ideal structures for matching incident optical radiation to a nanoscale volume. We propose that the small footprint and ultrafast response of a single antenna can be used to design a new type of ultrafast optical transistor. We introduce here a novel design of an antenna optical switch capable of producing a large modulation depth and requiring only a fraction of the optical power used in state-of-the-art microphotonic switches. In the first part of the project we will demonstrate the proof-of-principle of antenna switching. In the second part, we will integrate a nanoantenna onto a silicon photonic waveguide. We will use the antenna to control the transmission of the photonic waveguide using its very strong scattering at the resonant plasmon wavelength. During our experiments we will work together with a UK fiber-laser company in optimizing a new light source for single-nanoantenna ultrafast spectroscopy.As a follow-on to this project, we will explore the use of antenna switches as saturable absorber medium in a novel class of ultrafast semiconductor lasers. For this we build on the very strong expertise already present in Southampton on semiconductor lasers. The proposed research programme will combine fundamental scientific research with novel technological applications, bringing together yet unconnected fields of research. Successes will benefit to a new generation of light-driven information technology and to low-cost ultrafast lasers for use in applications like biosensing and terahertz generation. Although the initial research will be at a fundamental level, its results will have a large application perspective, with potential benefits to the UK photonics industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H019669/1","grantId":"EP/H019669/1","fundValue":"111439","fundStart":"2010-01-14","fundEnd":"2012-01-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Societal impact has been generated through training of postgraduate researchers and through associated undergraduate research projects.

Similar to radiowave antennas used to transmit and receive information, the metallic nanostructures act as antennas for visibile and near-infrared light. Our aim was to develop hybrid devices where the antenna properties could be controlled using an external optical pulse.\n\n\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n1. We have developed a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new type of conductively-loaded nanoantenna, where the antenna can be switched between a capacitive and a conductive state by controlling a nanometer-sized gap between the two antenna arms. This design has been shown to be favourable for use as optical transistor, because of its low switching energy per bit, small footprint, and potentially large modulation contrast in both the far-field and the near-field response. \n\n\n\n2. Experimentally, we have demonstrated strong optical modulation of hybrid structures consisting of a gold nanoantenna on top of the transparent conductive material indium-tin-oxide (ITO). We have shown that the antenna acts as a sensitizer for the ITO; fast local heat injection by the antenna results in large variation of the free-electron density and a resulting strong change in the refractive index. \n\n\n\n3. We have demonstrated that this hybrid modulation occurs in a variety of systems, where we studied antennas fabricated using a new method of colloidal nanosphere lithography. In addition, we investigated different deposition methods for the ITO and have done the first preliminary studies of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). The ALD method results in layers of improved quality compared to sputtering, which is of importance to obtain devices with reproducible characteristics.\n\n\n\n4. In our experiments we have made use of a custom-built laser system, which was provided by Southampton spin-off company Fianium. We have shown that it is possible to use this system for picosecond pump-probe experiments where the probe light could be tuned over a wide range in the visible and near-infrared. Our work has contributed to the adoption of supercontinuum fibre lasers into new nanophotonics applications. Photonics is finding its way into everyday life through broadband internet, optical storage, and next-generation information devices. Nanoscale optical elements based on antenna hybrids are still at an early stage in their development but it is anticipated that they will form an important building block for next-generation devices in a 5-10 year timeframe. Currently we are continuing research on the development of plasmonic nanoantenna transistor devices. As a direct potential application we are considering the use of nanoantennas in saturable absorbers for modelocked semiconductor lasers. For this we are collaborating with a group in Southampton working on VECSELs, which has direct links with laser companies. We expect to deliver first demonstrators on this technology within the next 1-2 years.\n\n\n\nUltimately, we aim to develop a fast nanoantenna transistor which can be used for on-chip routing of optical information. This requires an additional 3-5 years of development which is currently supported by an EPSRC grant. We expect that such a prototype antenna transistor will find disruptive new applications in ultracompact integrated optical switching devices.
