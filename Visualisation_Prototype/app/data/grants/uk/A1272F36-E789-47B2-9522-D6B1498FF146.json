{"id":"A1272F36-E789-47B2-9522-D6B1498FF146","title":"The Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium","abstractText":"This application is to support a) a research network meeting in June 2013 between established collaborators who have never met face-to-face to discuss and finalize the intellectual and technical protocols for a major project in digital curation in 19thc literary manuscripts. Arising from the extremely successful Carlyle Letters Online project (450,000 hits in July 2010-July 2011), the newly created Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium (VLLC) is an affiliation of scholars, libraries, and technicians from the US and the UK initially developing an initially free-access, high quality, digitization of the complete diary journals of the art and social critic, John Ruskin, and of the two poets Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper, who published under the name 'Michael Field'. The directors' meeting will be focused on solving the key issues remaining to the group including metadata quality protocols; practical coordination of photography; sustainability. We will consider plans for the transcription and editing of the material through crowd-sourcing type involvement where high quality is assured through the monitoring of established, distinguished, and international editorial boards; and we will discuss the exploitation opportunities at the four partner libraries--Beinecke, Pierpont Morgan, British Library, and University of Lancaster Ruskin Centre--and beyond). The VLLC intends to set the highest standards of digital curation in the long 19thc, and a workshop that brings the key players together will enable us to achieve that aim after more than 18 months of e-discussions, allowing us focused time to solve remaining issues, and agree terms for the implementation of our plans. This stage of the VLLC is intended to be the first step in the establishment of a digital database for life-writing in the long 19thc. In due course, the intention of the VLLC is to expand to include the manuscript archives of major (but not necessarily canonical) literary and cultural figures in the long 19thc in both the US and the UK, and to become the field leader in standards of digital presentation and editing. The significance of Ruskin and Michael Field is considerable in themselves, but they are also, in effect, the pilots of a new approach to research and access to 19thc materials for the 21st century.\n The application is also to support b) a two-day colloquium in the University of Leeds on 19thc (and 20thc) digital curation and editing, which will follow from the workshop also in June 2013. The purposes of this colloquium, which will be open to all interested parties to a maximum of 50 attendees, are i) to bring together academics, curators, technicians, librarians, and students to discuss the common challenges and opportunities in digital curation in the two centuries for literary material (broadly defined); ii) to disseminate the work and plans of the VLLC, including its protocols, standards, and intellectual significance to a wide audience; iii) to learn more about the whole sector's investment in digital curation and its approach to persistent issues of, for instance, technical durability, sustainability, and intellectual quality, and public value. Papers will be invited covering such major topics, and there will also be an open call for papers. It is intended for this colloquium to be highly significant in the development of digital humanities in the UK and beyond, and to provide a major opportunity, in effect, to establish a community and network for those working in the cognate areas of 19th and 20thc curation. It will be partially pod-casted, and written material will be included in the VLLC site when launched. The event will have a major role to play in expanding the range, and depth of research in this area, with its enormous academic and public education potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00395X/1","grantId":"AH/K00395X/1","fundValue":"21746","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As noted, our network grant enabled the quickening of the development of the VLLC and both the directors' meeting and the colloquium fed directly into planning of the development of our advanced digital technologies and in the development of e-archives for inclusion in the VLLC.
