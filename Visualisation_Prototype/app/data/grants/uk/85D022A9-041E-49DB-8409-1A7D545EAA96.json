Scholars will execute the entire editing process within the Workspace. The Workspace will be based on the editorial tools developed by the Text Grid project and partners in the COST-ESF Inter Edition project. The Kompetenzzentrum f&uuml;r elektronische Erschlie&szlig;ungs- und Publikationsverfahren in den Geisteswissenschaften, Universit&auml;t Trier (hereafter Kompetenzzentrum), are members of the Text Grid consortium and are leading the development of the respective Text Grid tools. \nThrough an essential collaboration with them, the Workspace project will refine and elaborate these tools to meet the demanding requirements of the two leading groups of scholars involved in editing the Greek New Testament. These are the Institute for New Testament Textual Research at the University of M&uuml;nster (INTF) and the International Greek New Testament Project (IGNTP). The Workspace will support the full range of functionality needed by two partners: for transcription of texts from many languages, in many different writing systems; for precise scholarly comparison of the texts; for comprehensive analysis of the relations between the texts; and for full print and online publication. The Workspace will fulfil these needs for the New Testament texts. Other texts edited by the Birmingham partner will also move into the Workspace.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I50057X/1","grantId":"AH/I50057X/1","fundValue":"183823","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The results of this project are (1) an online platform for editing textual traditions; (2) individual software applications for different stages of this process; (3) standards for data files.\n\nThe individual applications, in addition to being available on the Workspace's own platform, have also been integrated into the NT.VMR (http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de).\nThe encoding of XML transcription files has been adopted by the International Greek New Testament project for its work on John and Paul and related projects on Coptic and Latin manuscripts of these books, and the M?nster Institut f?r neutestamentliche Textforschung for all its transcriptions.

The applications created by the project include an online transcription editor, producing TEI P5 XML transcriptions in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get environment, and interactive tools for producing and editing a collation of witnesses using the CollateX collation algorithm.\n\nFor further information about the project, please contact the principal investigator, Dr Hugh Houghton at ITSEE in the University of Birmingham. The platform itself is being used by teams in Birmingham and M&uuml;nster to edit the Editio Critica Maior; other teams participating in the project may also adopt it as it stands. There has been interest in the platform from a number of other editing projects, leading to a joint application in February 2014 to adapt it for editing the Zoroastrian Avestan corpus with members of SOAS. The modular nature of the software developed means that it may also be integrated into other platforms and we are currently in contact with projects seeking to do this.
