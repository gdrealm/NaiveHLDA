This suggests that an immune defect occurs during ageing. However, the nature of this defect at the molecular level is not known. One of the key protective cells of the immune system is the cytotoxic T lymphocyte that is a very effective safeguard of our health in youth. However, these cells lose vigour as we age and this may explain the increased incidence of infection. To mount an immune response, there is a massive recruitment drive in order to mobilize the immune army. Recruitment increases the number of cytotoxic combatants that are essentail to clear the infection. This increase occurs as the cytotoxic cell is induced to divide and proliferate. Our previous data has shown that the cytotoxic cells from old individuals do not divide as well as those from young subjects because the activity of a crucial enzyme within these cells known as telomerase is lost. This enzyme confers unlimited proliferative capacity to cells. The studies that we propose here are to investigate the nature of the telomerase defect in old cytotoxic T cells, with a view to determine if thes changes are reversible. This has obvious implications for the improvement of health in old subjects. The studies that we hae proposed are based on our previous data that has been generated through BBSRC funding and is a logical follow-on of this work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E019188/1","grantId":"BB/E019188/1","fundValue":"403103","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Arne Nalpon Akbar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The first aim of this project was to investigate reasons why telomerase is down-regulated in highly differentiated human T cells. We found that the signalling kinase Akt, that is required for activating hTERT, the catalytic component of telomerase was not phosphorylated in highly differentiated CD8+ T cells. \n\nThe second aim of the grant was to determine whether telomerase down regulation can be counteracted by the cytokines IL-2 and IL15. We have found that we can increase telomerase activity in highly differentiated CD8+ T cells to a limited extent by both these cytokines. This indicates that other mechanisms are responsible for the decrease in activity of this enzyme and shows that cell survival and cellular senescence in human CD8+ T cells can be regulated separately.\n\nFurthermore, we found that by blocking KLRG-1 signalling we could enhance the proliferation and Akt phosphorylation of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells. However, we could not alter the reduced expression of telomerase or IL-2 secretion by these populations. This indicates that some but not all the defective functions that are found in highly differentiated CD8+ T cells can be regulated by inhibitory receptors on the cell surface. We identified signalling pathways that may be manipulated to boost immunity in older individuals. This information has led to investigation of P38 signalling that contributed to the patent filed (PCT -GB2012-052948) Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
