{"id":"BDD89E91-BBFB-4943-994C-F765505CFDC5","title":"Fibres and Coupling Agents for Composite and Tissue Engineering Applications (FaCCTA) - Pilot Stage","abstractText":"The aim of the project is to test a number of potential new coupling agents for phosphate glass/polycaprolactone composites. Surface spectroscopy methods will be used to assess the attachment of the coupling agents to the glass surface. Interfacial shear strength studies will assess the effectiveness of the agents in coupling the glass and matrix materials. Samples will also be aged over a period of weeks in order to determine the durability of the interface when exposed to hydrolytic attack. These studies will provide a suitable primary candidate coupling agent that would be used in the larger FaCCTA project in order to produce effective biodegradable composite materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F025831/1","grantId":"EP/F025831/1","fundValue":"38241","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Douglas Rudd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
