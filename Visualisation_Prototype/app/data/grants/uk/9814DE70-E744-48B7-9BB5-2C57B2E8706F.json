{"id":"9814DE70-E744-48B7-9BB5-2C57B2E8706F","title":"Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science 2007-2009","abstractText":"The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing Science is an annual event for UK-based PhD students in theoretical computer science, a research domain in which the UK is a longstanding world leader. The central aspect of the MGS is the training of PhD students in the mathematical foundations of computing, by means of a yearly Spring School that provides a series of technical courses on introductory, advanced, and emerging topics.This application is to seek continued EPSRC support for the MGS --- which it has enjoyed in recent years via two successive grants --- by means of funding twenty places for PhD students at each of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 events, together with support for the invited lecturers, and (as required under full economic costing), the local organisers and the director of the MGS. This application will secure the future of the MGS for the next three years, and hence contribute to maintaining the leading position of the UK in theoretical computer science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E06180X/1","grantId":"EP/E06180X/1","fundValue":"11756","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Crole","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
