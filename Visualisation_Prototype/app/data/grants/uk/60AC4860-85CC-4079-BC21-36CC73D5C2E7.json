The roles which astrocytes play in the brain are only currently emerging. It is established that these cells have a unique ability to store glucose in the form of glycogen and convert it into lactic acid (lactate) which they then release. Lactate for many years was thought to be used as an intermediate in the energy generating machinery of the body. However we have evidence that it has also another role in the brain where it acts as a transmitter or messenger between astrocytes and neurones. \nUsing cutting edge technologies we have discovered that lactate can act on specific subsets of brain neurones which release a critical neurotransmitter and modulator, called noradrenaline. Action of lactate on these neurones excites them and makes them release more noradrenaline. This mechanism could be involved in many functions of the brain, including regulation of sleep-wake cycle, appetite, emotions, blood pressure, attention and others. This needs to be further investigated. Our research implies that there is a dedicated excitatory receptor for lactate in the brain and we aim to discover it in this project. We are therefore proposing a programme of research which will look for the candidate genes which could encode for this new receptor, verify its sensitivity to lactate and prove that it is able to confer sensitivity to lactate to neurones which are naturally not sensitive to lactate. These steps will form the basis for more in depth studies aimed at detailed characterisation of this novel mechanism and ultimately to the understanding of its role in health and disease. Without knowing the molecular identity of the lactate receptor further progress in this direction is essentially impossible. However, when we find the protein responsible for lactate effects we will be in a position to design drugs which act on this receptor and via this route potentially develop new therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L019396/1","grantId":"BB/L019396/1","fundValue":"492210","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergey  Kasparov","coPersons":["Anja Gabriele  Teschemacher"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
