The control of offspring number is an extremely important adaption to the physical limits of the mother to bear to term, give birth to and successfully rear young in these species under prevailing environmental conditions. The mechanism whereby offspring number is limited in these so-called monovulatory species involves selection of just one follicle to release an egg (ovulate) per reproductive cycle. The mechanisms controlling follicle development generally, and follicle selection in particular, have been the subject of intensive investigation for many years as they are central to our understanding of the causes and treatment of infertility. A mechanistic model has emerged from these studies that involves the action of local growth factor system (insulin/IGF, inhibin/activin, bone morphogenetic proteins [BMP]) that augment or attenuate the stimulatory role of the pituitary gonadotrophins, LH and FSH, during the terminal gonadotrophin-dependent stages of follicle development (when follicle selection takes place). The sheep has been extensively used as a model species for these studies due to the occurrence of a number of naturally occurring mutations in prolific breeds which lead to varying degrees of disregulation of these selection mechanisms. The Booroola or FecB mutation is one of the most dramatic of these mutations as it results in sheep having up to 6-8 lambs per pregnancy due to complete disregulation of the follicle selection mechanisms. Over recent years, we and others have been able to show that the FecB mutation occurs in the type 1B BMP receptor (BMPR1B). However, the ligands that bind to the BMPR1B and the effect of the FecB mutation on the response of cells within the ovary to stimulation, are not fully understood. On the basis of work we have carried out so it is thought that the BMPR1B interacts with a number of other factors known to be present in the ovary including anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), BMP15 and BMP6. Our mechanistic model of follicle selection therefore predicts that the effect of the Fec B mutation may be due to alteration of the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of one or more of these ligands of the BMPR1B receptor which normally act to augment (BMP-6) and attenuate (BMP-15, AMH) the activity of pituitary gonadotrophins in stimulating the development and selection of ovulatory follicles. This project will utilise a series of highly developed cell culture and whole animal models in combination with advanced molecular techniques to examine this idea by determining: (i) the identity and function of ovarian ligands to the BMPR1B receptor and the effect of the FecB mutation on receptor-ligand interactions and down-stream signalling events in cultured cells; (ii) the effect of increasing or decreasing the activity of ovarian ligands of the BMPR1B receptor on ovarian function in whole animals which do or do not carry the FecB mutation and (iii) if we can replicate the FecB phenotype of multiple small ovulatory follicles in sheep which do not carry the FecB mutation by modulation of the activity of multiple ligands of the BMPR1B. This works brings together the whole animal, cell culture and molecular expertise of experienced investigators in Edinburgh and Nottingham along with the unique availability of the FecB sheep mutant models in order to allow the elucidation of the complex homeostatic interactions between endocrine and local factors that act to regulate this complex and key physiological system. It is expected that this information will add to our fundamental understanding of ovarian function in order to address causes of ovarian disfunction and infertility and to devise innovative means to assess and treat these conditions","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014098/1","grantId":"BB/H014098/1","fundValue":"543494","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bruce Kenneth Campbell","coPersons":["Alan  McNeilly","David T Baird"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
