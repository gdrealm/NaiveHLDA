{"id":"869DCAAB-D386-4A89-892A-9AD28E81AE71","title":"Virus pathogenesis and immune evasion","abstractText":"Many viruses have been identified which cause human diseases. However, although a considerable amount is now known about the viruses themselves, much less is known about the actual mechanism by which viruses cause disease - this process by which viruses produce disease is called pathogenesis. The production of disease results from the interaction of the virus with the host (human or animal) it has infected: one of the most important host factors which determines the outcome of infection is the immune response against the virus. Antiviral immune responses are normally very effective but it is apparent that viruses have evolved mechanisms which enable them to evade the immune response -immune evasion. \n\nThe MRC Co-operative Group whose renewal we seek will work on virus Pathogenesis and Immune Evasion. The 9 Principal Investigators already have established programmes of research which address key areas of virus pathogenesis: the biology of membrane proteins of viruses which determine virus entry into cells (Minson), the way in which the cellular immune response controls infection (Sissons), how genetic differences in receptors on naturally immune (natural killer) cells may determine susceptibility to infection (Trowsdale), the identification of proteins which viruses make specifically to interfere with the immune response (Alcami, Stevenson, Lehner, Reyburn), and the mechanisms used by viruses to produce, and maintain, silent infection (known as latency) - which makes them invisible to the immune system (Efstathiou, Sinclair &amp; Sissons). These programmes focus on important human viruses which produce persistent infection (herpesviruses), or on models which can be used to study pathogenesis. The MRC Co-operative Group will enable the participants to combine their expertise to enhance these existing research programmes, but will also allow them to initiate new collaborative work. This new work will focus on identifying novel virus proteins involved in evading the immune response, the role of natural killer cells in resistance to virus infection, and the genetic mechanisms used by viruses to become latent in the cells they infect. Understanding how viruses produce disease should make it easier to design means for their prevention - such as vaccines and drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9800943","grantId":"G9800943","fundValue":"570291","fundStart":"1999-02-22","fundEnd":"2009-02-21","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Sissons","coPersons":["John  Sinclair","John  Trowsdale","Tony  Minson","Philip  Stevenson","Stacey  Efstathiou","Antonio  Alcami","Hugh  Reyburn","Paul  Lehner"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
