{"id":"DE250ED2-AB3C-4682-9E6E-3843F0D033F2","title":"SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TRUST: A LONGITUDINAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE","abstractText":"<p>Citizen trust and engagement in social and political actors and institutions is currently a key area of concern for policy makers, social commentators and&nbsp;academic scholars around the world. The 2006 UK General Election, in which ‘the trust issue’ dominated the campaign, provides a vivid example of the importance that trust, or lack of trust, in political actors can have in mobilising electoral support. Yet, it is not just in the realm of electoral politics that the notion of trust has been postulated as key to a range of important outcomes at the social and individual level. Trust has been advocated as key to variation in economic growth, rates of criminal offending and victimisation, morbidity, quality of life&nbsp;and the stability of democratic systems of government. Our aim is to make use of the rich array of variables pertaining to different dimensions of trust across the ESRC’s core large-scale data sets. By analysing a range of different indicators of social and political trust, their inter-relationships, cross-country and temporal variation, we aim to provide some much needed clarity in the debate regarding the individual, social and historical factors which affect and are affected by trust.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-163-25-0021","grantId":"RES-163-25-0021","fundValue":"163832","fundStart":"2006-03-13","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Sturgis","coPersons":["Nick  Allum"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
