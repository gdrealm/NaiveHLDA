{"id":"B863DFB5-40D7-4D9C-80AB-4630B51B79A5","title":"A 3d psychological face database and tools","abstractText":"<p>The overall aim of this project is to enable the next generation of research into face perception and recognition by making available a rich database of face images, including many 3 dimensional scans, and the tools to manipulate and present them.&nbsp; There are many existing collections of face images, usually collected for a specific project and often either very consistent or very varied, limiting their general utility.&nbsp; The aim here is to collect both highly consistent and highly varied images of the same people, including 3D scans, both standard and stereo video sequences, and a variety of photographs. 3D imagery is becoming more common but the images remain difficult to use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second part of this project is therefore to develop tools for handling 3d images, for example morphing between two faces to create an average, or making a given face look older, or more trustworthy. Finally, it will make available two different software packages for presenting 3D faces in experiments. It is hoped that the database will gradually grow in value as researchers contribute their data, for example ratings of faces.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010081/1","grantId":"ES/J010081/1","fundValue":"67127","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hancock","coPersons":["Bernard  Tiddeman"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
