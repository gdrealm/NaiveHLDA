{"id":"BC073E7B-4DE2-4434-B7AB-6CD2448EDDBB","title":"Landmarks in Music Since 1950: Peter Sculthorpe's Irkanda IV","abstractText":"The project examines the music and biography of Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe (b.l929), focusing on one landmark work, Irkanda iV, and relates this piece to a wider musical and historical context. Sculthorpe is Australia's best-known composer, yet the musical language of Australian composers has been little discussed to date. \nThrough Irkanda IV the project looks at the relationship between music and the Australian landscape (notably the Iltawarra region of New South Wales), music and literature (D.H. Lawrence) and music and the family (Sculthorpe's childhood in Tasmania).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113162/1","grantId":"113162/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona  Richards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
