Often there are laminar and turbulent regions in the same flow. Such flows are of interest but were not often investigated numerically using a computer. In this project such a study will be done in the case of the flow inside a pipe, which has an eccentric cylindrical core inside. Then where the gap between the core and the pipe wall is small the flow can be laminar, and it can be turbulent on the opposite side of the core. This geometry is convenient for numerical calculations, and therefore the nature of such a laminar-turbulent flow can be investigated in more detail.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D050871/2","grantId":"EP/D050871/2","fundValue":"59865","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  See the same for EP/D050871/2.
