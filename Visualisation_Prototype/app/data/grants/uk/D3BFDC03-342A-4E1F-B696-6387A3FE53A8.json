Because the late colonial Indian state remained notably hesitant to extend its welfare measures to include the provision of contraception or contraception advice, the south Indian history of conception is a story about the mixed economy of late colonial welfare. My aim is to make sense of this mixed economy by outlining both the role of the state as well as the diverse local actors who animated the south Indian indigenisation of contraception.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113127/1","grantId":"113127/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Hodges","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
