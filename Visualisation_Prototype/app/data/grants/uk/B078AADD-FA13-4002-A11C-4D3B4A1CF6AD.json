OPHI has become a lead actor in this work, due to innovative methodologies and empirical applications at the national and international level, including official national multidimensional poverty measures, an international Multidimensional Poverty Index for 109 developing countries, and tailored indices such as one relating to womenâ€™s empowerment in agriculture. But many methodological issues remain in this new and fast-growing field . Under this ESRC-DFID research project, OPHI is developing new methodologies related to multidimensional poverty measurement and analysis related to three themes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;weights, trade-offs, and policy incentives in multidimensional poverty measures</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;multidimensional poverty dynamics</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;multidimensional poverty and welfare economics</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project is generating working papers, academic publications, and web resources in each of these three areas. Periodic research workshops convene collaborating researchers of diverse ages and backgrounds to finalise papers. OPHI researchers are simultaneously offering intensive training courses, online materials, and direct support to research users. Hence as the methodologies and results emerge, they are naturally and organically being incorporated in these other activities, leading to impact. <br /><br />As this research project uses secondary data only, no research ethics clearances are required for it.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0617","grantId":"RES-167-25-0617","fundValue":"387416","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Mexico's national multidimensional poverty measure, launched in 2009, was the first official national measure using the AF method. The Mexican government examined five different approaches to multidimensional poverty measurement. OPHI presented possible applications of the AF method, based on Mexico's legal framework of social rights, which was then used by the government in its new index. The measure is calculated every two years, and is used in the design of Mexican social policy. A former OPHI researcher works in the new national Crusade Against Hunger.\nIn 2011, Colombia launched its national multidimensional poverty measure using the AF method. The measure, whose customised dimensions and indicators reflect the priorities of the National Plan, underpins the country's ambitious poverty reduction goals, and is used to monitor and coordinate progress towards them. OPHI has provided extensive technical assistance to government measurement experts. OPHI has also worked closely with senior Ministers, attending a Colombian Government Cabinet meeting, where President Santos and Ministers review new results from their measure and determine changes the direction and focus of sectoral programmes.\nBhutan and the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil also use the AF method for official poverty measurement. In Chile, El Salvador, Malaysia, Vietnam and Nigeria official measures are also underway. Additionally, the AF method is also used to assess and improve the US Government's food security programmes with regard to women's empowerment and gender parity (via the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, constructed by OPHI with USAID and IFPRI).\nAdditional policy impacts have been catalysed by OPHI's intensive collaboration with national statisticians to build rigorous measures. OPHI's outreach to policymakers has included many seminars and hands-on training sessions enabling research users to develop and release a measure confidently. OPHI organises two-week intensive courses in different regions of the world, training members of national statistics offices, international agencies and universities (it trained 110+ professionals from 30+ countries in two such courses in 2013). Via Skype, OPHI are available - and often called upon - for informal troubleshooting. OPHI is now finalising a textbook with OUP on the AF methodology to further spread technical skill. \nThe impact of the AF method also extends well beyond national multidimensional poverty measures. In 2009-2010, OPHI worked with the Human Development Report Office at the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to construct a global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), a measure of acute poverty that covers over 100 developing countries, for UNDP's flagship Human Development Reports since 2010. OPHI computes a high-profile MPI using household survey data for every single country, and reveals patterns of poverty within and between countries and over time, and releases policy briefings, articles, and web resources.

The AF method provides policymakers with a 'high-resolution lens' on individuals' lived experiences of poverty. By doing so, the method suggests real improvements in how poverty-reduction interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. Demand for the methodology has been so extensive that a Global Policy Network has been created to provide support, advice, and 'South-South' learning opportunities for the policymakers using it.\nConscious that poverty is more than a lack of income, Dr Sabina Alkire and Professor James Foster developed the Alkire Foster (AF) method to capture the aspects of poverty that blight poor people's lives at the same time, such as poor health, lack of education and inadequate living standards. An AF measure reflects both the incidence of poverty (the percentage of people who are poor) and the intensity of poverty (the average percentage of dimensions in which poor people are deprived). This flexible method can incorporate context-specific variables, providing an at-a-glance poverty 'rating' which can be broken down to show who is poor - by gender, ethnicity or region - and how they are poor: which aspects of poverty they are experiencing.\nDemand for AF measures has escalated in recent years and now far outstrips the capacity of the small OPHI team to meet it. In response, in June 2013, OPHI, together with the governments of Mexico and Colombia, launched the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), an international network that connects senior policymakers exploring or implementing AF measures. The Network enables early adopters to share experiences of poverty measure design, political processes and institutional arrangements. Participants include countries as diverse as China, India, Nigeria, Morocco and Chile (a total of 27 countries and institutions now participate, including ECLAC and SADC).\nOPHI was requested by members to host the Network Secretariat. In this central coordinating role, it pro-actively facilitates knowledge-sharing, convenes regular communications, and establishes working groups to take timely topics forward. OPHI played a key role in staging a special side-event at the UN General Assembly in September 2013. The event, attended by over 100 leading development figures, saw five national ministers from the Network, the Secretary of State of Germany, and senior representatives from the World Bank and UNDP, call for an AF measure to be adopted both as national statistics and as a headline measure in the post-2015 development context. In June 2014 we received the ESRC Impact Award for Outstanding International Impact. We hope that this recognition will help to further interest in our work and more widely in multidimensional poverty analysis. \nThrough the work of the MPPN we hope to continue to provide support and advice to countries developing and implementing national MPIs, as well as providing a strong coordinated voice for inclusion of multidimensional poverty analysis in the post-2015 SDGs.\nWe plan to launch a book written by our research team for publication by the Oxford University Press in mid 2015. The book will provide a systematic conceptual, theoretical and methodological introduction to multidimensional poverty measurement and analysis, with specific references to the Alkire Foster methodology. It will situate this methodology within the wider set of multidimensional tools, and address issues relating to the choice of parameters which are common to most multidimensional poverty measures. It is hoped that the book will provide a useful background and guide to both students and practitioners interested in multidimensional poverty analysis. \nOver the time of the grant we have run a number of workshops and two-week intensive summer schools (Netherlands, 2011; Jakarta, 2012; Washington DC, 2013; Oxford 2014). These courses have provided methodological and practical training to high-calibre participants from across the world, who have in many cases have gone on to develop MPIs within their home countries or furthered research in the field. Alongside this we have provided in-country training to practitioners from countries including Brazil, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Rwanda and Vietnam, among others.\nFollowing substantial interest generated by UNDP's release of the global MPI in 2010, plus growing awareness of the limitations of using income measures of poverty alone, OPHI has been invited to present in academic and policy fora around the world, ranging from the American Economic Association to DFID's Chief Economist Seminar Series and the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Measurement and Analysis Practice Group.\nOPHI researchers have applied the AF method in academic studies, comparing their results with income poverty to show value-added. They developed methodologies for analysing poverty dynamics and robustness to changes in weights and other parameters. Their findings, published in journal articles and working papers, demonstrated how the AF method provides credible policy insights regarding the structure of poverty and how it varies between regions and groups of people, enabling policymakers to improve targeting, address interconnected aspects of poverty together cost-effectively, and monitor progress swiftly.
