But events at Salem meant that such texts acquired immense political and cultural significance. My research identifies the place of witches ('real' and imaginary) in the fashioning of American identities. It demonstrates that the figure of the witch is still important literary-cultural currency, and delineate the origins of American witchcraft fictions in the conjunction of the European Renaissance with the cultural imperatives of the American colonies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112937/1","grantId":"112937/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marion Heather Gibson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
