They usually catch the disease after eating poultry that has not been cooked properly, in which some bacteria survive. In the UK there are around 50,000 reported cases of gastroenteritis caused by Campylobacter each year - but many more cases go unreported because most people recover naturally after a few days. Even so, disease caused by Campylobacter costs the UK economy an estimated &pound;500million. Surprisingly, the bacteria thrive in the guts of poultry, without causing any disease. The control of disease caused by Campylobacter is likely to require several interlinked control measures, including reducing carriage in poultry flocks, cleaning and decontaminating carcasses as they pass through the food chain and encouraging the appropriate cooking of poultry. It has been shown that most of the poultry on sale in the UK is contaminated with Campylobacter. Therefore, in this proposal we focus on ways of controlling carcass contamination. We have already found that some Campylobacter cells are able to resist killing by antibacterial chemicals, limiting the effectiveness of decontamination methods. In this project we will investigate how Campylobacter cells resist killing, how we might use antibacterial chemicals in more effective ways and how we might change some farming practices to limit carcass contamination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024631/1","grantId":"BB/I024631/1","fundValue":"405721","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard William  Titball","coPersons":["Orkun  Soyer","David John  Studholme"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" A baseline for our work was to characterise a panel of C. jejuni strains from Asia, to complement our existing panel of N. American and European strains. We sequenced the genomes of 4 C. jejuni strains from Thailand, 4 from Pakistan and 4 from Vietnam. Eight of twelve (67%) Asian C. jejuni isolates possessed a cluster of genes homologous to the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Our analysis of these genomes and previously reported genome sequences from USA and European strains allowed us to construct a phylogenetic tree based on multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of core conserved genes. The presence of the T6SS was limited to certain MLSA clades. \n\n\n\nStrains possessing a complete T6SS cluster could be distinguished by the presence of the hcp gene. Therefore, we used hcp as a proxy for the presence of a functional T6SS in a wider range of C. jejuni from chickens, humans and environmental sources. Most isolates from Europe and N. America lacked the hcp gene. Conversely, the hcp marker was frequently identified in isolates from Thailand, Pakistan and Vietnam. Among the Vietnamese patients in our study, those presenting with bloody diarrhea were more likely to be infected with hcp-positive C. jejuni (32%) than those presenting with non-bloody diarrhea (5%). This suggests a potential correlation between presence of T6SS and bloody diarrhea symptoms, which might be considered the more serious clinical manifestation of the infection given its associated higher rates of hospitalization and antibiotic treatment. \n\n\n\nPoultry are a well-documented reservoir of human Campylobacter infection and we found that Campylobacter strains harboring the hcp marker were significantly associated with chickens in Asia. Large numbers of poultry are imported into North America and Europe from low-income countries, including Thailand. This may introduce T6SS-positive Campylobacter genotypes into the food chains of importing countries, posing a potential emerging threat to public health. \n\n\n\nThis work is currently in press; James W.

We have found no differences in the responses of strains to antibiotic (or acid) stress. Therefore we selected one strain (C. jejuni 1168) for subsequent studies on the formation of persister cells in response to antibiotic stress. Using different dosing regimens we have determined the survival patterns of C. jejuni 1168 and used this data to construct a mathematical model describing the survival pattern. This model has subsequently been used to investigate persister cell formation in other bacterial species.\n\n\n\nWe have devised methods for sorting persister cells based on their metabolic activity. This has allowed us to collect different populations of persister cells and determine their proteomic makeup. Our findings suggest that poultry imported into the UK from low-income countries, including Thailand may introduce T6SS-positive Campylobacter genotypes into the food chains, posing a potential emerging threat to public health. Further work is required to investigate this possibility Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
