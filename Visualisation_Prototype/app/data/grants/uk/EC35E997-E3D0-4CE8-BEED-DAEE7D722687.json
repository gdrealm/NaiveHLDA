{"id":"EC35E997-E3D0-4CE8-BEED-DAEE7D722687","title":"An Internet of Cultural Things: Creative Explorations of Data in Cultural Institutions","abstractText":"The project will examine born-digital material generated by the British Library. This cultural institution of international standing will make available data about itself--ranging from items ingested to reading room occupancy to catalogue searches--which primarily has remained available for internal use. We will collaborate with a practice-based digital artist and make this data visible in a series of temporary site specific installation projects open to public engagement. The project presents a creative and collaborative intervention into the growth in digital information in cultural institutions and addresses the research question: How does making visible the cultural data generated in situ illuminate and transform the way both people and cultural institutions interact?\n\nThis project builds directly on the current AHRC-funded research projects of our Principal Investigator. The first, 'Our Data Ourselves' studies the 'big social data' we generate through our mediated cultural practices, namely mobile devices. The second project, 'Empowering Data Citizens' examines how that big social data might be transformed into open data as a means for creative and cultural empowerment in new data communities. In all instances, data democratisation is at the forefront, insofar as we seek to make available the data we generate as an open resource for public engagement and scholarly inquiry.\n \nWe will continue to make significant and innovative contributions through our Small Grant by expanding our focus to the data generated in and by our shared cultural institutions. Partnering with a data visualisation artist, our scoping project will create an exemplar for engaging with new forms of cultural data. We propose that this will provide new insights into not the Internet of Things (IoT) but what we call the Internet of Cultural Things (IoCT).\n \nOur research question expands upon a key area of interest in networked digital culture. The IoT denotes the diffusion of the internet-as a data generating, transmitting, receiving and processing infrastructure-into the material world and everyday life. The IoT-be it the appliances in your home or a traffic sensor network-is embedded all around us, in multiple scales of things in order to reach smoother, effective, affective and predictive &quot;smart&quot; situations.\n\nWe propose the IoCT as a means to discuss the networked and data-rich nature of cultural things that constitute institutions. This enables us to better think of cultural institutions not just as physical repositories of holdings and collections but as living organisms of data. Thus in partnership with British Library and the artist, we will develop a critical and creative set of working ideas and practices via data on digital items ingested, catalogue searches, requests, books re-shelved, numbers of new reader passes, etc. Our focus on new data aspects of cultural institutions enables us to demonstrate how the British Library is increasingly built on data. We will create an exemplar for further research into the IoCT wherein users are points of networked articulation and dynamic visualisation between people and cultural institutions reveals cultural things as material data relations.\n\nOur creative and collaborative intervention combines artistic methods (data visualization), critical humanities and partnership with the British Library and addresses the following research questions:\n1) What are best practices for engaging with such data as created by BL?\n2) What is the specific added-value provided by visual methods in engaging with born-digital content created in expert systems and environments?\n3) How does the site-specific output of the partnership between the artist and BL facilitate user-centric forms of public engagement and development of data literacy?\n4) What are the best practices and ideas that are transferable from our creative intervention into data culture?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M010015/1","grantId":"AH/M010015/1","fundValue":"40179","fundStart":"2015-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-09-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Edward  Cot√©","coPersons":["Jussi Ville Parikka"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
