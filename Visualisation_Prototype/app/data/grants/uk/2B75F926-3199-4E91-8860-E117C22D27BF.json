(SUNTRAP)","abstractText":"This research project aims to tackle the barriers inhibiting the rapid introduction of large amounts of low-cost electrical and thermal solar energy generation by driving down the cost per kWh. To do this we will:\n* Develop enhanced optical concentrator systems which exhibit improved luminance uniformity over the photovoltaic cell;\n* Extend the lifetime of the PV cells to beyond 50 years by the use of active thermoelectric cooling;\n* Increase the energy conversion efficiency by linearising the PV cell electrical generation, controlling cell temperature and by implementing enhanced Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms;\n* Integrate a thermal storage system with the PV / TE receiver.\n* Capture large amounts of thermal energy from the solar-&gt; electrical conversion process and use this to enhance the efficiency of co-generation plant or displace fossil fuel combustion.\n\nThe technology resulting from this 4 year research programme will be commercialised throughout the project life by a number of industrial partners and be equally suited to domestic use or to utility-scale power plants connected to the grid. Such installations will make a significant contribution to the UK meeting its 2020 CO2 reduction targets and help ameliorate the growing problems of energy insecurity and energy poverty.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K022156/1","grantId":"EP/K022156/1","fundValue":"2455230","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew R Knox","coPersons":["Robert  Freer","Subramanian  Arjunan","Manosh Chandra Paul","Martin William Macauley","Tapas Kumar Mallick","Douglas J Paul","Duncan Hudson Gregory","Min  Gao"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
