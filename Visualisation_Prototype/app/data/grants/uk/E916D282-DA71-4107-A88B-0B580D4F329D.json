We have designed a series of experiments to use this unique sample to test the validity of laboratory determined diffusion parameters, 3D argon diffusion, and large diffusion domains, in order to make a step change in our understanding of K-feldspar thermochronology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I016023/1","grantId":"NE/I016023/1","fundValue":"48346","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Peter Kelley","coPersons":["Sarah  Sherlock"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
