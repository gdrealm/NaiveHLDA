In cells from multicellular organisms, most of the genes are interrupted by large chunks of meaningless sequence, known as introns. These comprise on average 90% of the length of the genes. They are removed form the linear RNA molecule, in a process known as splicing. However, there are a few genes in which some of the encoding sequences are tandemly duplicated. These duplications appear to interfere with the signals in the linear code, and are probably a serious impediment to the biological function of the gene. It seems probable that they arise by a chance mis-direction of other cellular activities while the newly-made RNA is still closely associated with the gene. This raises some very interesting questions. How does the duplication happen? Why aren t all genes affected? Have most genes evolved in such a way as to prevent these reactions? By determining which sequences or features in a gene are required for the duplication reactions, and by investigating the nature of the reaction, we should be able to explain why it is restricted to only a few genes. On the way, we might discover some very interesting information about the ways in which RNA synthesis and the removal of the meaningless chunks are coupled.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400441","grantId":"G0400441","fundValue":"186499","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian C EPERON","coPersons":["Nilesh Jayantilal Samani","Nicholas Jarvis Proudfoot"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
