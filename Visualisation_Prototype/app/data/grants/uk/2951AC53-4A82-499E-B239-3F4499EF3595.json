This clock, when correctly set, organises biological processes in the body such that they occur at the optimal time of day. The light we experience during the day is the most important environmental cue for setting this clock. What then happens in the case of animals that have evolved in complete darkness, within deep caves. Do these animals possess a clock with which to tell the time of day, and, if so, how is it set? We intend to explore these questions by looking at the molecular mechanism of the clock in a blind, eyeless species of cavefish. We will examine the genes involved in the clock mechanism and see how they have changed (evolved) after about 100,000 years in the dark. Have critical elements of the clock changed after evolving for so long in the dark? Can these cavefish clocks still detect light? What environmental signals set these cavefish clocks? We hypothesise that either daily temperature changes, or feeding signals, are the critical cues. Our favoured idea at this time, is that feeding cues are the critical signal, as temperature has been reported to be very constant in these caves in Mexico. In fact, we think that it is the faeces from the bat population that enter the water every morning, which sets these cavefish clocks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D522346/1","grantId":"BB/D522346/1","fundValue":"269632","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  These results are of significant interest to those interested in evolution and environmental change, as much of the work was performed in the field.

This clock works in the lab, but not in the actual cave. The major changes in cave strains are that the light pathways are switched on. Animals in a cave look as if they are living in constant light. This includes an increase i the ability to repair damaged DNA. This has led to a greater understanding of the evolution of biological clocks, answering a classical old circadian question about cave animals. It also demonstrates the central importance of DNA repair, which we have now gone on to study in a cancer context. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
