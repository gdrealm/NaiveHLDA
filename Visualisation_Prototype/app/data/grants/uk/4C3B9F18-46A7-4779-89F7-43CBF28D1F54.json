The deployment and management of these networks, however, is handled by a central controlling entity and the sensor network is often dedicated to a single application. We argue that this is due to the fact that we do not yet have the means to deal with a secure multi-purpose federated sensor network, running different applications in parallel and able to reconfigure dynamically to run others.The communication paradigms which have been usually devised for small and single owner sensor networks simply do not have the right scalability, security, reconfigurability characteristics required for this environment.With FRESNEL we aim to build a large scale federated sensor network framework with multiple applications sharing the same resources. We want to guarantee a reliable intra-application communication as well as a scalable and distributed management infrastructure. Orthogonally, privacy and application security should also be maintained.We evaluate our proposal though a large scale federation of sensor networks over the Cambridge campus. The sensors monitor different aspects (temperature, pollution, movement, etc) and the network will be running various applications belonging to different authorities in the city.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G070687/1","grantId":"EP/G070687/1","fundValue":"446934","fundStart":"2010-01-10","fundEnd":"2013-04-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The key findings from this project have contributed to the scientific literature surrounding wireless sensor networks and privacy of public information.

To achieve this, we have developed and demonstrated attacks that are effective against all known mechanisms for privacy-preserving data aggregation in wireless sensor networks, and developed new aggregation mechanisms that, partially or fully, mitigate our attacks.\n\n\n\nA second strand of research has focused on developing protocols to communicate securely between wireless devices. Due to their restricted capabilities and power, our research has produced new protocols for secure wireless communications that are fast, flexible for multiple usage scenarios, and low in their power requirements. Aspects of this research are directly applicable to the development of improved key exchange mechanisms in future wireless network designs. The protocols developed in the research, accompanied by proof-of-concept implementations, could be directly applied.\n\n\n\nThe privacy-preserving data aggregation attacks and mechanisms are less directly applicable at this stage, but present a clear route towards improved privacy mechanisms in future systems. The protocols for secure communications, specifically fast key-establishment for federated wireless networks, provide equivalent levels of security to existing mechanisms whilst reducing time for setup and power requirements. Implementation of these protocols in new productions systems would be a relatively direct route of exploitation.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the protocols for privacy-preserving data aggregation provide protection against a class of privacy threats. Due to the nature of such aggregation, however, these protocols result in a customisable loss of accuracy in results. It seems likely that, for direct exploitation, the implications of this loss and the need for particularly forms of privacy protection would need further study.\n\n\n\nIn an academic context, this research has demonstrated attacks against existing state-of-the-art privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanisms, as well as providing partial solutions to these attacks. At the same time, this research has been evaluated in the context of differential privacy, a highly active strand of privacy research, and have led to new insights in the ways that this approach to privacy is applied.
