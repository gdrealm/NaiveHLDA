At least 60 bacterial species are naturally transformable, a number that is thought to be considerably underestimated. Natural transformation is an extremely valuable tool for research and was instrumental to one of the most important discoveries in biology (i.e. that the genetic material is DNA). Moreover, it is now clear that horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation is a powerful mechanism for generating genetic diversity and a dominant force in bacterial evolution. This can have devastating consequences, e.g. by promoting spread of virulence or antibiotic resistance genes.\n\nType IV pili (Tfp), or related organelles, play a key role in DNA transformation. In addition, they are one of the most widespread colonization factors in bacteria. Therefore, Tfp have been and continue to be intensively studied as they might be primary targets for the development of new therapies against bacterial pathogens that place a heavy burden on human health and economy by infecting mankind, livestock and crops.\n\nIn current models, naked DNA needs to be bound by Tfp before it is taken up by the bacteria upon pilus retraction, but this remains to be formally demonstrated. The existence of a DNA receptor in Tfp is strengthened by the fact that in some species only self DNA is taken up because it contains a signature sequence motif known as the Uptake Sequence. In Neisseria, this DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS) motif is 10 bp long and is found in approx. 2,000 copies per genome. How competent bacteria bind DNA and are able to discriminate self from non-self DNA during uptake remains a mystery. The identification and analysis of a DUS receptor would represent a major breakthrough and would improve both our understanding of DNA transformation and Tfp biology in general.\n\nThis proposal originally derives from our recent characterization of N. meningitidis proteins involved in Tfp biology. Three of these proteins (ComP, PilV and PilX) are minor (low abundance) components of the Tfp. ComP plays a key role in competence. This prompted us to purify the ComP protein and test its DNA-binding activity, which led to a major finding: ComP has DNA-binding activity and shows a preference for the DUS (unpublished data). During this project, we plan to thoroughly characterize ComP's DNA-binding activity using biochemical and cellular assays, together with high resolution structural techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J016764/1","grantId":"BB/J016764/1","fundValue":"323371","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2015-11-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Pelicic","coPersons":["Stephen  Matthews"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
