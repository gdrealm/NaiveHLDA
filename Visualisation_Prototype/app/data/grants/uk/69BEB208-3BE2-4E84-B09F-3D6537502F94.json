{"id":"69BEB208-3BE2-4E84-B09F-3D6537502F94","title":"Evaluating the impact of freedom of information in the UK","abstractText":"<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 is intended to make government more transparent, participatory, effective and responsive to its citizens. Has it worked? Who uses the Act, and what do they want to know? Has it improved their trust in government? Has it made government more effective and responsive? Have there been adverse side effects on the working of Whitehall? </p> \n<p>This study will help to clarify the purposes of FOI, and to evaluate the impact of the legislation through empirical testing of its effects. We will accomplish this by carrying out surveys of FOI requesters and of senior managers and officials in central government departments. To check their views we will also hold focus group discussions with stakeholders of those departments, and analyse departmentsâ€™ publication schemes and FOI request disclosure logs. To get a feel for the effects of FOI on the wider public who do not make FOI requests, we will analyse newspaper coverage of the FOI Act and disclosures. </p> \n<p>The findings from this study will help to clarify the benefits and disbenefits of FOI, especially as they relate to government transparency and accountability, public understanding, public participation in the political process and the quality of government decision-making.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E003591/1","grantId":"ES/E003591/1","fundValue":"157577","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Hazell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
