Exposure to mechanical stresses is a normal part of physiology for such monolayers: lung alveoli deform during respiration, intestinal epithelia resist peristaltic movements in the gut, and endothelia are exposed to pulsatile fluid shear stresses in blood flow. The mechanical function of monolayers is particularly apparent in disease when mutations or pathogens affecting the cell skeleton (cytoskeleton) or intercellular junctions result in increased fragility of tissues (e.g. epidermis bullosa, staphylococcus blistering). Despite clear physiological relevance, little is presently known about the mechanics of cell monolayers.\n\nCells within these monolayers are tightly connected to one another by intercellular junctions: tight junctions form barriers restricting the passage of solutes whilst adherens junctions and desmosomes integrate the cytoskeletons of constituent cells into a mechanical continuum. To date, research in cell mechanics has primarily focused on isolated cells and much is now known about their mechanical properties as well as the underlying biology in normal physiology and disease. Comparatively little is known about the mechanics of monolayers and how it relates to the mechanical properties of the tissue's cellular constituents and their cytoskeleton. This is primarily due to the lack of specific experimental techniques to assess the intrinsic mechanical properties of tissues while monitoring cellular and subcellular traits.\n\nWe aim to develop a novel tool to stretch cultured cell monolayers that are mechanically isolated from any substrate. During tissue deformation, the applied mechanical tension will be directly measured and monolayers will simultaneously be imaged at subcellular, cellular and tissue length scales, such that the architecture of the sub-cellular components, the shape of the cells and their eventual reorganisation can be accurately monitored as a function of the imposed force. \n\nThe studies enabled by this novel instrument will allow us to understand how the structure of individual cells and their arrangement relative to one another participate in setting the mechanical properties of whole tissues. As a consequence, we will be able to understand how pathological changes in the proteins that form part of the cytoskeleton or the intercellular junctions can have catastrophic consequences for tissue mechanics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K013521/1","grantId":"BB/K013521/1","fundValue":"113054","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are not aware of others using the method at this stage.

The instrument was designed to work on millimeter size suspended epithelia. Our objectives were to design an instrument that could: \n(a) stretch epithelia on time-scales ranging from the fraction of a second to tens of hours.\n(b) accurately record stress on the tissue in the 10-105Pa range with an acquisition rate &gt;10Hz. \n(c) image the evolution of cellular and subcellular morphology within the tissue during stretching.\n(d) study tissue fracture with a high degree of control.\n\nObjective a was achieved by integrating a fast and precise motorised micromanipulator into the experimental setup. This micromanipulator is piloted via Labview such that movement and feedback routines can be implemented to suit the experiments to be conducted. With this setup, strain rates &gt;75%/s can be achieved signifying that a monolayer can be extended by 30% length in less than 0.5s. Driving at such fast rates allows the study of the rheology of monolayers. For long duration experiments designed to examine cellular responses to application of extrinsic mechanical stresses, the micromanipulator is utilised to apply the initial extension with high precision. The micromanipulator prong is then fixed at the final position using glue and detached from the micromanipulator arm. This allows multiple experiments to be carried out in parallel. \n\nObjective b was achieved by integrating an SI-KG7B force transducer into the setup. This allows measurement of forces up to 10mN with a 1uN precision at rates of &gt;1kHz, far exceeding our original goals. Data acquisition is integrated into Labview, allowing force feedback routines to be implemented. \n\nObjective c was achieved by purchasing a long working distance high NA 30x objective and integrating the experimental platform into an environmentally controlled chamber. The new objective allows imaging of large fields of view with high signal and allows zooming on scanning laser confocals.\n\nObjective d required the integration of a laser ablation system to the setup to create controlled multi-cellular cracks in the tissue. The laser ablation system was built to interface directly to the FV-1000 laser lines and controlled through Olympus software (similar to the one described in 11). It allows the generation of subcellular cracks by cutting single junctions as well as multicellular cracks ranging from 1 to 10 cells in length. The fracture can be detected by optical microscopy using the objective and chamber described in objective c. Combined with molecular perturbations, these measurements will be applied to understanding the magnitude and biological origin of intercellular adhesion. The tool developed for this grant is now currently enabling research on:\n-a) the biological origin of the elastic and viscous properties of monolayers \n-b) the intercellular adhesion energy in monolayers\n-c) the role of oriented mitoses and cell rearrangement in dissipating applied stresses (with Prof Buzz Baum, LMCB, UCL)\n-d) the mechanical properties of Drosophila wing disk (With Dr Yanlan Mao, LMCB, UCL).
