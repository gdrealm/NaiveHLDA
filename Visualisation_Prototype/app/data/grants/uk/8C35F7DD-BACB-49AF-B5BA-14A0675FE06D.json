{"id":"8C35F7DD-BACB-49AF-B5BA-14A0675FE06D","title":"Modelling therapies for surgical adhesions","abstractText":"In this project we will discover new medical treatments to prevent the formation of internal scars, or 'adhesions'. \n\nPeople often have to undergo operations which involve opening up their abdomens e.g. to cut out a tumour or an inflamed appendix. A common complication after these operations is the development of adhesions which can glue our guts together. These adhesions are painful and can even cause guts to become blocked and stop working. This then requires a major operation to put things right, yet these second operations may themselves lead to more adhesions. \n\nWe will work out how cells inside the abdomen form scars after operations and then use this knowledge to block the process. We will also work out ways to grow scars outside of the body. This will make it easier for us to monitor how well our new therapies are working. \n\nBy the end of the project, we aim to have a list of new medicines which can then be tested to help people who suffer from recurrent adhesions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M012751/1","grantId":"MR/M012751/1","fundValue":"714532","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Elizabeth Herrick","coPersons":["Adrian  Woolf","Bettina  Wilm"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
