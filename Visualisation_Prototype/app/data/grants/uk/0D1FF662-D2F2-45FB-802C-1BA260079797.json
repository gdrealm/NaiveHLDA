Wherever possible data from previous clinical presentations, neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging are also collected. The brain tissue is examined by neuropathologists and illness is diagnosed according to internationally agreed criteria. Samples of brain tissue in various fixation states, such as frozen and formalin-fixed, are then made available to Neuroscience research centers along with, where available, spinal cord tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. \nThe purpose of the project is to provide clinically studied and pathologically verified brain tissue to facilitate and promote internationally competitive research into Neurodegenerative disease.\nThe Brain Bank aims are to fulfill international recommendations and guidelines with regard to brain tissue banking. As such, this involves the systematic and focused collection of well-characterised post-mortem material and its subsequent distribution to research groups both regionally and nationally. This will necessarily underpin high quality and peer-reviewed research. \nThe following is a summary of the key functions of the Brain Bank: \n1. To advance the understanding of, and facilitate research into the underlying causes of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases through the provision of clinically and neuropathologically well-characterised brain tissue to the research community. \n2. To facilitate brain donation through an ethically approved programme of informed consent for cohort studies and ad-hoc donation.\n3. To provide pathological diagnosis to the relatives of brain donors according to best national and international protocols.\n4. To coordinate the processing and dissemination of well-preserved brain tissue for clinical, biochemical, molecular pathology, genetic and transcriptional research projects, and maintain an open door policy of responding to requesters without prejudice.\n5. To ensure ?donor care? and keep contact with ?brain donor? families, informing them about diagnosis and progress in research.\n6. To disseminate and promote knowledge of brain banking through scientific meetings, public open days, collaboration with charities and MRC newsletters.\n7. To provide professional teaching, training, information and educational resources for neuroscientists.\n8. To facilitate collaboration between basic research scientists, pathologists and clinicians to promote transitional research to help develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for brain diseases.\n9. To maintain gold standards of excellence in Brain Banking for storage of frozen and formalin-fixed brains.\n10. To follow most recent ethical principles for best practice in Brain Banking, from recruiting donors and consent for postmortem to tissue requests and follow strictly the guidelines of the Human Tissue Act.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900635","grantId":"G0900635","fundValue":"427102","fundStart":"2009-11-02","fundEnd":"2011-11-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Safa  Al-Sarraj","coPersons":["Christopher E Shaw","Simon  Lovestone"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
