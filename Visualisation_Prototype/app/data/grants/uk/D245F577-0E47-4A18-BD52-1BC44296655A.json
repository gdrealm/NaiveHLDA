Understanding how genes drive brain development is valuable in its own right, but it is also needed to advance our understanding of abnormalities and disorders, whether of development or degeneration, and the mechanisms that limit regeneration. By understanding the generative programmes for brain development, we expect to devise regenerative programmes for the replacement and re-growth of nerve cells in the adult.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901899","grantId":"G0901899","fundValue":"3135230","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Gino Lumsden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
