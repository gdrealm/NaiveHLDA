{"id":"E7739FDA-1D8F-4DAE-86CA-24CC343A6877","title":"Public Attitudes and Public Service Responsiveness","abstractText":"<p>‘Reform’ of the public services is currently a major preoccupation amongst policy makers. Doubt has been cast on the ability of hierarchical bureaucratic ways of delivering services to meet the public’s allegedly increasing expectations of public services. Instead there are widespread demands for more individualised market style forms of delivery, such as delegating provision to the private sector and giving those who use public services more choice and about where, when and how they access services. However, while the UK government has favoured such reforms in England, they have received a more cautious reception from the devolved Scottish and (especially) Welsh administrations. These administrations are, for example, concerned about the possible impact of&nbsp; ‘choice’ on the equitable provision of services.</p> \n<p>Through survey research this project is ascertaining the public’s expectations and evaluations of public services in each of the four territories of the United Kingdom. It is asking how much demand there is for choice and whether private provision is acceptable. By comparing attitudes in different parts of the UK it is assessing whether differences of public policy reflect differences in public opinion and whether particular ways of delivering public services are associated with higher levels of satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0043","grantId":"RES-166-25-0043","fundValue":"496865","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Kevin Curtice","coPersons":["Miranda  Phillips"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
