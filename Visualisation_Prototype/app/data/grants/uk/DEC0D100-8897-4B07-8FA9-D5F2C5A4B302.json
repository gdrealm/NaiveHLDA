Before water reaches a customer's tap, it must pass through a train of processes to remove the impurities from the water before it is safe to drink. The bulk of the contaminants are removed from the water in the process of coagulation and flocculation. Here, a destabilising chemical, such as an iron or aluminium salt is added to the water which enables dissolved, colloidal and particulate material to aggregate into large, fragile particles called flocs. In most water treatment plants in the world, these particles are removed by a sedimentation or flotation process. Any fine residual particles remaining are then usually removed by a sand filter. Failure to remove these particles results in high turbidity in the filtered water, which can reduce the efficacy of disinfection and the particles can be a vehicle for more toxic compounds entering drinking water. For this reason, turbidity in drinking water is strictly controlled. In the UK, a target value for turbidity in drinking water is 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). Recent revision documents from the European Commission indicate that this will soon move to a mandatory value of 1 NTU, with a target value of 0.5 NTU.The properties of the floc particles that form has a strong influence on how well they are removed by the clarification and filtration processes. If the flocs are too small or break apart too easily, water quality is compromised. The composition and structure of the floc is a function of a number of factors, including the source water matrix, the coagulant and flocculation chemicals used and the mixing regime deployed. Measuring the character and the strength of the flocs can therefore provide some very useful information on how well they may be removed in water treatment systems. To date, floc strength tests have concentrated on characterisation of large scale floc breakage products. This can significantly underestimate the concentration of small particles in a heterogeneous system containing a wide range of particle sizes. However, it is the small particles (normally centred around 1 um for most filtration conditions used in practice) that can cause operational difficulties because they are least well removed in a filter. The intellectual contribution of this work is in developing an operationally applicable and relevant floc strength test that integrates particle size and particle removal in depth filtration. For the first time we will investigate floc strength in terms of the formation and concentration of small particles before and after floc breakage by measuring floc strength in terms of the small particles around 1 um. The project will therefore deliver a methodology to determine floc strength through understanding the formation of problem particles. In addition we will establish how the system water quality and coagulation conditions influence floc strength and the formation of particles that cause turbidity in drinking water. Finally we will develop coagulation control strategies to limit the formation of FBP to enable longer filter run times and more effective filtration which could be applied on full-scale water treatment systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018506/1","grantId":"EP/H018506/1","fundValue":"100049","fundStart":"2010-05-10","fundEnd":"2011-05-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has been used to identify nano-particle breakthrough in pilot scale and real filtration systems used in wastewater and drinking water. This analysis has been carried out on industry funded research projects with a UK water supplier and a manufacturer of a commercial filter. This is of importance because these particles are often the first to breakthrough a filter and are not routinely picked up by conventional turbidity based instrumentation. Importantly, these nano-particles include bacteria and other micro-organisms, so identifying the presence and concentration of these particles is key to ensuring high quality treated water streams.

This is because the bulk of the floc also represents the bulk of the pollutants removed from the water in clarification systems. In many experimental studies, floc size measurements are made using an instrument that measures particle volume. Laser diffraction (LD) is the method most widely used for this purpose, where the instruments can size particles in the range 20-2,000,000 nm. However, it is the small particles that come into the colloidal size range that also need to be considered in the context of floc breakage as these are the particles that will challenge filters, cause operational difficulties and include micro-organisms. The scope of this work was to assess for the first time how a new nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) system was able to measure nanosized particles and determine if they may be used for measuring sub-micron sized floc particles effectively. The results were compared against two commonly used particle sizing instruments based on LD and dynamic light scattering (DLS).\nThe NTA required significant operator training and experience for measurement of particles and in most cases settings needed to be optimised for a given particle size range meaning that samples of unknown particle size and concentration cannot be effectively measured because prior knowledge of the sample is needed in order to select the appropriate settings. The results have highlighted some of the key issues associated with accurately measuring sub-micron sized particles quickly and easily. All of the instruments were successful in measuring particle size for mono-modal particles between 100-500 nm, but did not provide a good indication of particle concentration. When the instruments were challenged with more complicated particle systems composed of bimodal or unknown particle sizes, the instruments struggled. The NTA instrument is therefore appropriate for a qualitative understanding of nano sized floc particles. However, the limitations of the NTA means that going beyond measurement of bulk floc characteristics (those particles &gt;10 um) is not currently feasible, because although the range of particle sizes measured may be accurate, no indication of particle concentration or distribution can be gleaned. \nThe impact of this research has been the successful validation of an NTA for measuring nanoparticles relatively quickly, with little sample preparation beyond some dilution. The NTA instrument does have limitations, however it is another tool available for scientists and engineers for measurement of nano-sized particles in environmental sample . In our laboratories, the instrument has been used for measurement and understanding of water and wastewater floc particles, titanium dioxide particles and aggregates and natural organic matter colloids. Taking this forward, we will be using the NTA system to analyse and diagnose problems and associated with full scale water treatment plants, particularly those associated with filtration. \nThe findings from this research were presented as an oral talk at the World Filtration Congress in Salzburg in April 2012. Two research papers are in preparation for publication, one detailing the calibration of NTA system in comparison to the LD instrument and the second investigating the measurement of floc breakage products using a combined approach of the LD and NTA tools. The post doctoral researcher who worked full-time on this project has successfully been able to use the knowledge and skills acquired in this work and has been able to secure a follow on position at Bangor University in the School of Ocean Sciences on a three year contract investigating particle size in situ in the ocean. For monitoring improvements in output water quality from drinking water treatment plants and optimisation of the treatment processes required for water purification. The NTA system and methodology developed can be used to analyse and diagnose problems and associated with full scale water treatment plants, particularly those associated with filtration.
