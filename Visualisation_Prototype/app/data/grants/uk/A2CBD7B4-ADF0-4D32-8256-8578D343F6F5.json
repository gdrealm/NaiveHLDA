By having the DNA sequence of these mouse strains we will be able to better understand what makes each mouse strain unique and this will in turn illuminate the basis behind genetic variation and disease susceptibility in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800024","grantId":"G0800024","fundValue":"2300000","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Allan  Bradley","coPersons":["Jonathan  Flint","David James Adams","Ewan  Birney"],"organisation":"The Wellcome Trust  Sanger Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
