They can both attack infectious pathogens themselves and they can organise other types of white blood cell to attack infections. To do this, T-cells must be able to recognise what is ?self? and what is ?non-self? and so should be attacked. T-cells are produced in an organ called the thymus. When they are mature they leave the thymus and patrol our bodies looking for infections that they will attack. During the time that they are in the thymus, T-cells are selected so that any T-cells that might attack ourselves (attack ?self?) do not complete their maturation and die, but T-cells that are able to fight infections are allowed to leave. This selection of T-cells in the thymus is very important to our health because if T-cells that recognise ?self? leave the thymus they might attack our bodies causing autoimmune diseases like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. This project will study how the thymus controls which developing T-cells are allowed to complete their maturation and leave the thymus because they recognise ?non-self? and which T-cells do not complete their maturation because they recognise ?self?. We will study how molecules called ?Hedgehog? proteins that are made by the thymus control the fate of developing T-cells. \nHedgehog proteins are molecules that are made by cells and secreted to tell other neighbouring cells to undergo a particular process, such as to divide, die, or change into a different type of cell. They do this by influencing which molecules are made in the target cell, and this is determined by which genes are active in that cell. Hedgehog proteins are essential in our embryonic development because they transmit messages to developing organs controlling how the organs form and grow. We have shown that after birth Hedgehog proteins are also important in our immune systems because they allow communication between different cells of the immune system. They determine how many T-cells are produced in the thymus and they can tell developing T-cells to survive, divide, or mature, depending on if the developing T-cell recognises ?self? or ?non-self?. We aim to find out what messages Hedgehog proteins give to developing T-cells by finding out which molecules are made and which genes become active when Hedgehog proteins signal to developing T-cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900161","grantId":"G0900161","fundValue":"541252","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tessa  Crompton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
