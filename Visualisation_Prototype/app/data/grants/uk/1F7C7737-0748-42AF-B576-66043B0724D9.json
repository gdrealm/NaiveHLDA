We will do this using a Consortium of eight of the leading members of the UK's Distributed Institute for Atmospheric Composition, utilising the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement's BAe 146 research aircraft, the resources of the UK's University Facility for Atmospheric Measurements, the Malaysian Meteorological Service's Global Atmospheric Watch station at Bukit Atur, Sabah, Malaysia, and the Royal Society of London-supported Danum Valley Field Centre. We will bring significant added-value to NERC resources by the active participation of international collaborators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D004217/1","grantId":"NE/D004217/1","fundValue":"183423","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Nicholas Hewitt","coPersons":["Brian James Bandy","John Maurice Plane","A.
