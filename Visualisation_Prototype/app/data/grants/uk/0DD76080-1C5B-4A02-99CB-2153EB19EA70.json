Protein-coated microcrystals (PCMC) are a dry powder composed of a crystalline core onto which biomolecules are coated. PCMC are attractive for vaccine use as they are stable at high temperature and humidity. The aim of this work is to use\nproteins currently included in vaccines against whooping cough caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis as a model system to establish if these proteins retain their functional integrity when formulated as a dry powder. It is anticipated that the pertussis antigen PCMC formulations will serve as models for the development of more stable formulations of other protein vaccine candidates. The physical state of the proteins on the PCMC will be examined by microscopy and techniques designed to determine how the protein folds on to the PCMC. To ensure retention of functional activity, the PCMC will be solubilised and injected into mice and the immune responses to the PCMC, including a capacity to protect the mice against challenge with virulent B. pertussis, will be determined and compared with the responses to the unprocessed protein preparations. The stability of the proteins contained in the PCMC dry powder preparations (with regard to maintenance of a protective immune response) will be determined at different temperatures and humidity, to monitor the potential shelf-life of the vaccine components.\nCombinations of different pertussis proteins will be formulated as PCMC to determine which combination provides the most effective protective immune response. Administration of the PCMC formulations by different routes of inoculation, as an alternative to needle injection, will also be examined. Verification that proteins formulated as PCMC retain functional activity would lead to evaluation of other vaccine components as PCMC and the possible formulation of commercial vaccines in this form, as their potential stability would offer the ability to extend shelf-life and allow vaccine storage without the need for refrigeration, a feature that is particularly attractive for vaccine use in developing countries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801955","grantId":"G0801955","fundValue":"455289","fundStart":"2009-09-14","fundEnd":"2012-09-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Parton","coPersons":["John Graham Coote","Dorothy  Xing"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
