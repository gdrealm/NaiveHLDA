These patients not only overproduce lipid mediators called cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are powerful pro-inflammatory and bronchoconstricting agents made by inflammatory cells in the lining of the airways, but also are more sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous leukotrienes. The recent cloning of two cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2, will enable us to investigate the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to leukotrienes in these patients reflects increased expression of one or both of these receptors on inflammatory and smooth muscle cells of the airways. Drugs which block one of these receptors, CysLT1, are already clinically available and have been shown to exert partial benefit in reducing disease severity in aspirin sensitive asthmatics. If our studies implicate both receptors, then this study will provide a rationale for the employment of drugs which block both receptors, which exist but are not yet in clinical use, or alternatively focus more attention on drugs such as zileuton which inhibit leukotriene synthesis, but which are not universally available (for example, they are not available in the UK). The other key question addressed by the proposed study is why only a proportion of asthmatics are sensitive to aspirin and similar cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors. COX-1 mediates the production of prostanoids, also from membrane lipids. Recently it has become clear that certain prostanoids, particularly PGE2, inhibit or ?brake? the effects of leukotrienes in asthmatics. We hypothesise that this braking system is defective in aspirin sensitive asthmatics. This deficiency is unlikely to lie in deficient production of PGE2, since COX-1 inhibitors reduce PGE2 production in all asthmatics. We hypothesise that is it more likely due to reduced expression of PGE2 receptors on target inflammatory and muscle cells in aspirin sensitive patients. Again, with the recent cloning and characterisation of the 4 PGE2 receptors EP1-4, we are in a position to test this hypothesis. Again this may point the way to new approaches to therapy of aspirin sensitive asthma, for example with stable, selective EP receptor agonists. In both cases, many thousands of patients will benefit, moreover in the relatively short term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400897","grantId":"G0400897","fundValue":"199779","fundStart":"2005-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Corrigan","coPersons":["Ying  Sun"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
