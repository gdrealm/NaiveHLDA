However, the molecules have to be designed to target the sites of the brain to be investigated, which is done by attaching a biological compound to the radioactive molecule to create products called radiopharmaceuticals. Due to the severe lack of scientists in the UK who have the specialised skills to design and prepare these radiopharmaceuticals we plan to recruit and train a scientist to join our multidisplicinary team. To achieve this we have created a bespoke training programme which will involve learning from researchers in academia and industry, who are either developing and/or using this imaging technology. As part of this training the scientist will help design new radiopharmaceuticals that would then be used in our on-going research programmes to understand the biological mechanisms of some major diseases and disorders of the brain, and thereby identify some possible treatments. For this specific programme we would be undertaking research projects on Alzheimer?s disease, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and drug addiction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900903","grantId":"G0900903","fundValue":"602098","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Franklin Imo Aigbirhio","coPersons":["Peter  Nestor","Trevor William Robbins","Jeffrey Wayne Dalley","John Douglas Pickard","Jean-Claude  Baron"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
