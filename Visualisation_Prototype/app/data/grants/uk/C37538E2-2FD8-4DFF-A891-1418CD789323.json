Potentially this will provide a vast amount of information about the nature of climate change on a global scale and over long time periods. Importantly, many of these types of geological deposits can be very precisely dated by measuring the small amounts of uranium and thorium they contain, and because very small samples (about a milligram) can be used for temperature measurements, it should be possible to obtain temperature records with very high time resolution (probably decadal or less). To achieve the goal we shall use a custom built mass spectrometer, an instrument that is capable of measuring very small differences in the masses of calcium carbonate molecules within the rocks. This is a technically challenging project that will require a lot of experimentation and calibration before it can be used routinely and it is these technical aspects that are the focus of this project. When perfected, this technique will probably have many other geological, mineralogical and hydrothermal applications in addition to investigating past climates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E010105/1","grantId":"NE/E010105/1","fundValue":"53764","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The data derived from development of the MIRA mass spectrometer are being used to:\n(i) Characterise the evolution of Earth surface temperature through geologic time from the mess-Proterozoic to the poresent day.\n(ii) Better understand fluid-rock interaction in the upper crust, notably that associated with hydrothermal veins in carbonate terrains and the develoipment of MVT type base metal deposits.

We have demonstrated that a single equation describes the clumping of 13C and 18O in calcite as a function of temperature between 0 and 1000 degrees C. These results are in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations based on lattice dynamics.\n\nThe MIRA mass spectrometer remains the only instrument globally that is not limited in its performance for clumped isotope ratio measurements by ion optic aberrations etc. The project has led to several non-academic developments.\n\n1) It's product development, marketing and construction as a commercial instrument by SerCon Ltd.\n\n2) Clumped isotopes are being used as a tool to understand the genesis and development of hydrothermal systems as a guide to Pb-Zn mineralisation. Since this proposal we have had:\n\n1) Two MSc research projects on lacustrine carbonates and lake temperatures and Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) Pb-Zn mineral deposits.\n\n2) Three new PhD students (one NERC funded) looking at Earth surface temperatures through geologic time and temperatures associated with deformation and faulting in the Gulf of Corinth, Greece.\n\nThe MIRA instrument is now being marketed and built by SerCon Ltd. who continue to provide ongoing support for our research.\n\n2013-2014\n\nThree new MSci studies completed:\n(i) Calibration and refinement of the clumped-isotope palaeothermometer for foraminifera (Rebecca Layland). Thgis study confirmed earlier calibrations of the clumped isotope thermometer and is now in the process of being written up.\n(i) A study of the temperature and source of fluids associated with hydrothermal vein development in the Carboniferous Limestone as a result of the Variscan orogeny (Daniel Myhill and Neil Allanach).
