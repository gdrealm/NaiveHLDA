Given its importance methods of so-called bisulfite sequencing have been developed that allow comparative 5-methylcytosine/cytosine analysis of Genomic DNA. \n\nHowever in addition to 5-methyl-C another cytosine modification, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hydroxymethyl-C or 5-hmC) has recently been identified as an epigenetic modification. In humans, mutations in the enzymes that make hydroxymethyl-C are associated with myeloid malignancies. Evidence also suggests that's that 5-hydroxymethyl-C is an epigenetic marker of &quot;stem-cellness&quot; and neuronal lineage specification. \n\nHowever current DNA sequencing techniques cannot differentiate between 5-methyl-C and 5-hydroxymethyl-C. Indeed it is certain that previous studies have misread 5-hydroxymethyl-C as 5-methyl-C. The presence of 5-hydroxymethyl-C makes it necessary to not only re-evaluate existing DNA methylation data, but also to develop a new method to determine the relative distribution and changes of 5-hydroxymethyl-C in human tissues of healthy and diseased status. The basis of this proposal is to develop chemistry based approaches to allow the genome wide analysis of 5-methyl-C and 5-hydroxymethyl-C.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J007587/1","grantId":"EP/J007587/1","fundValue":"529710","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Bradley","coPersons":["Paul Alexandre De Sousa"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
