To understand a text, the reader (or listener) must go beyond the meanings of the individual words and phrases and make links between sentences to construct an integrated and coherent representation of the text’s meaning. Interclausal connectives (eg, ‘because’ and ‘after’) can aid this process by signalling the relation between events. For example, connectives can specify the direction of causality between two events, eg ‘Sue was late, so/because she caught the bus’ or the sequential order, eg ‘Jane was tired, before/after her run’. Connectives influence how adult readers process and interpret text. This project will investigate how connectives influence text processing and comprehension in 7-10-year-olds, who often fail to establish links between sentences. Typically developing readers and children with poor reading comprehension will participate. An important feature of this work is the use of computer-based reading tasks to measure how children process connectives as they read. The research will determine the age at which connectives play a functional role in children’s ability to construct and represent meaning, and how this is related to their reading comprehension level. The findings will inform our theoretical understanding of the development of text comprehension and benefit literacy instruction.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0133","grantId":"RES-062-23-0133","fundValue":"116129","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate  Cain","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
