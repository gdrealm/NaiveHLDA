Although these bacteria are sensitive to most antibiotics in current use, and vaccines are available against some strains of these bacteria, they continue to cause high morbidity and mortality in all age groups. Better understanding of the disease process is required before novel preventative and treatment strategies are designed. In recent studies, we identified a key human molecule (laminin receptor, LR) that is involved in mediating bacterial invasion of the blood-brain barrier. We identified LR-binding molecules on each of the three bacterial pathogens and carried out extensive experiments confirming the specificity of the interactions. In this proposal, we plan to study molecular and biological properties of the interaction with the ultimate goal of exploiting the LR-bacterial interaction to develop therapeutic and/or preventative agents that can block bacterial invasion of the blood brain barrier.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801173","grantId":"G0801173","fundValue":"665147","fundStart":"2009-09-17","fundEnd":"2012-12-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dlawer  Ala'Aldeen","coPersons":["Stephen John Hill","Jafar  Mahdavi","Karl Graham Wooldridge","Neil James Oldfield"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
