It presupposes, for example, that people who infect others can be identified by the police, prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service and effectively and fairly brought to justice in a criminal court applying the law. This process involves a potentially difficult relationship between the organs of criminal justice and public health bodies, whose agendas and priorities may not necessarily coincide.</p>\n\n<p>It is to address these concerns that this Seminar Series bring together researchers, healthcare professionals, diseases charities and practitioners concerned with the creation and enforcement of criminal laws on disease transmission, with a view to producing outputs for both academic and non-academic readerships.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021555/1","grantId":"ES/J021555/1","fundValue":"15101","fundStart":"2012-12-03","fundEnd":"2014-12-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  In the course of this seminar series, we have identified four key organizations, all of which are involved in one or more of policy engagement, legal reform and clinical practice, which would benefit from our discussions, outputs and findings. These are the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH - an organization made up of professionals working in sexual health), Amnesty International, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Law Commission. We have established links with each of these, and with the exception of Amnesty, we have had representations from each of them, alongside participants across a range of other relevant organizations and institutions at the seminars. We have agreed with all four of these organizations that we will send them this report at the end of the project. In the case of Amnesty and the Law Commission this is particularly timely. For Amnesty, the Law and Policy programme 'Criminalization of Sexuality and Reproduction: exploring limits on state punitive regulation', led by Jaime Todd-Gher, has convened an informal expert group. Sending a copy of our report will be a contribution to this group's current work on the potential of human rights advocacy in responding to criminalization worldwide. The other three users are based within England and Wales. The Law Commission is currently conducting a scoping exercise in preparation for a more detailed look at relevant criminal provisions, and our project (and seminar 4 in particular) represents a contribution to that exercise. We will also send the report to the CPS and to BASHH to contribute to their own on-going reflections on their crucial work in (respectively) prosecuting cases of disease transmission and advising and treating patients who may be both defendants and complainants in those cases.

For example, should such a person be treated as a criminal, in the same way as someone who injures another? This project has brought together experts from a range of disciplines to answer these questions. Some of these experts argued (in the seminars we organised, the related publications we edited, or both) that measures such as detention and criminal sanction are indeed appropriate and proportionate tools for preventing or punishing serious harms. Others argued to the contrary that severe public health measures or criminalisation are not an appropriate response in this context, and for a number of complex reasons. In this seminar series, we have tried to highlight and explore some of the most pressing implications that the deprivation of a personâ€™s liberty in the response to infectious disease transmission has for a number of professional and public organisations. \nThe papers presented in the course of this seminar series have led us to at least two broad conclusions: 1) that there is a rich diversity of ways both for law to approach the problem of infection and its spread, and 2) that this is a topic that engages a number of different interested groups and discussion that can be both rich and also polarizing. While we did not identify any one view on criminalisation, we heard and read both strong criticism of the use of criminal sanctions in this context, as well as defences of criminal sanctions in some circumstances. We see five primary ways in which our findings might be taken forward. Firstly in terms of academic routes, given that the project provided an opportunity for advocates of different and divergent legal and ethical positions to be heard together, our findings will be useful for scholars pursuing academic research in this area. Secondly, the findings will be useful for human rights advocacy groups such as Amnesty International and the HIV Justice Network in their current efforts to use scholarly research and professional experience to address what they regard as overzealous and stigmatising uses of criminalisation of sexual and intimate behaviours around the world. Thirdly, the findings will be useful for organisations and bodies in the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales such as the Law Commission whose responsibility it is to draw up proposals for law reform. Fourthly, lawyers who are involved in the prosecution and defence of cases of disease transmission in the criminal courts will be able to use these findings to inform their work. In particular, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would find our findings useful in developing and reflecting on their prosecutorial policies. Fifthly, diseases charities and sexual health clinicians will benefit from making use of our findings in informing the advice they give to their own service-users.
