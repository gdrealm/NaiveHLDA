The method proposed offers benefits over existing detection methods in terms of speed and cost since it would not require an initial step to increase the amount of DNA in the sample before detection of the specific sequence in the sample could be carried out.The research involves the use of a technique called surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS). If light of a particular wavelength is directed onto very small pieces of silver metal, known as nanoparticles, then some of the reflected light will have changed wavelength. This change in wavelength is related to the molecules on the nanoparticles' surface and provides a molecular fingerprint that can be used for identification. The metal is used to amplify this effect and can be used to study a single molecule. Since a fingerprint spectrum of a molecule is produced, the composition of mixtures can easily be identified without separation. These signals are further increased if the molecule being analysed has a chromophore i.e. is a coloured molecule. Coloured molecules or labels can be attached to DNA giving it the ability to generate intense SERRS signals.To detect a defined DNA sequence a complementary sequence is used which will hybridise specifically and hence recognize the desired sequence. Since the complementary sequence is added it can be modified to incorporate a label, usually a coloured molecule which will only be 'seen' when the complementary sequence has bound. This label will only be seen when the target DNA is present, if it is not present the complementary sequence will not bind and no signal will be seen. The complementary sequence can be designed in several different ways to allow a signal to be detected when it binds to its complement. Here is proposed a new method whereby a special dye label is attached to the complementary piece of DNA which will not give a SERRS signal. When this piece of DNA binds to the target DNA, an enzyme will be added which will digest the complementary DNA, releasing the special dye label which will then be free in solution and now able to give a SERRS signal. The signal will only be present when the target DNA is present and it is envisaged that the nature of the probe will allow another probe molecule to then bind to the target and then be destroyed releasing more signal and so on. This will allow for an amplification in the signal obtained, compared to current methods which rely on amplification of the target rather than the signal. This enzyme only works when the specially designed probe is bound to the target and will not digest the probe and release the dye when it is free in solution and in a single stranded form. The attraction of this approach is the combination of extreme sensitivity and the multiplexing capacity i.e. the ability to detect multiple DNA targets at once. The ultimate aim is to achieve PCR-less detection of a specific DNA sequence from a clinically relevant sample.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F005407/1","grantId":"EP/F005407/1","fundValue":"390978","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen Jane Faulds","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" The initial approach utilised fluorescence detection since existing labelling methodologies could be used. Several different approaches were developed each based around the use of a fluorophore and quencher system, whereby when the probe was intact the fluorescence was quenched and after hybridisation to the target and subsequence digestion by the _-exonuclease, the fluorophore and the quencher were separated and a fluorescence signal was observed. These assays proved to be highly successful and the only issue with taking these assays forward was that the signal amplification was difficult to prove using the fluorescence instrumentation available. \nThe fluorescence assay allowed the action of the enzyme to be studied and the conditions for the enzyme to be optimised. Unfortunately the enzyme was found to have significant single stranded activity i.e. the _-exonuclease would also digest a proportion of single stranded probe with a 5' phosphate when it was single stranded and not hybridised to the target. Therefore the fluorescence assay was used to optimise conditions in terms of buffer, pH, time, temperature etc to try to minimise the digestion of ssDNA and optimise the digestion of dsDNA. To further study this area a DTG funded student was aligned with the project to further study the action and specificity of the enzyme as well as further the assay work started during this funded project.\nThe development of assays which utilised SERS as the final optical detection methodology were developed alongside the fluorescence based assays. The synthesis of a specific probe which is designed to not give a SERS signal until it is digested by the specific enzyme proved to be challenging and is still ongoing. However, another SERS assay format was developed which utilised a separation step to remove any unhybridised SERS active probe which had the added advantage of overcoming the issues with digestion of ssDNA that was identified in the fluorescence based assays. This format was highly successful and not only allowed the detection of exact complement target DNA but was also successfully detected longer length PCR product targets.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
