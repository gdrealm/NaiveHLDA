{"id":"DCF4AF01-97EB-4198-88CA-8862E864168E","title":"Who Cares? Interventions in 'unloved' museum collections","abstractText":"'Who Cares? Interventions in 'unloved' museum collections' explores the role of enthusiasm, creativity and affection in the stewardship of 'unloved' or under appreciated collections. The project asks how care for objects has varied over time, and in relation to different time periods. It also considers what this experience means for how we care for collections in the future. Most significantly, from the professional curator to the serious hobbiest, to the nation as a whole, we consider who cares about collections and why.\n\nThe core team will bring together their collective expertise to interrogate, rediscover, engage, and experiment with collections of seemingly mundane or everyday objects. Through a combination of theoretical dialogues and action research case studies the project will examine the affective components of stewardship, engagement, and collections-based research. As well as considering who cares about collections now and who cared in the past, this project also aims to develop strategies for opening these collections up to a wider audience. These interventions include workshops with teenage non-participants, events for an adult audience at national museum, focused workshops for enthusiast groups, and collaborations with creative practitioners. Many of these interventions have been tried by museums in the past, but in the course of practical museum work there is often little time to research what these brief events mean in the context of the full life of the collection.\n\nThe project is focussed around 3 case ctudies:\n1. Science Museum Group: The Lock Collection is a comprehensive record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ranging from the elaborate to the everyday. Until recently a small proportion of this collection had been on display in the 'Secrets of the Home' exhibition but it will soon all be in storage. This case study will work with the Lock Collectors Association who describe the study of locks and their history as a 'specialised sector of Industrial Archaeology'. Dr Hess will explore the role of community enthusiasm and national museums in keeping this kind of collection alive in the public imagination even when they are not on display.\n\n2. Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust: The National Slag Collection housed at Ironbridge comprises an enormous number of samples of archaeo-metallurgical residues. Most of it was collected and processed by the former Ancient Monuments Laboratory (now the English Heritage Centre for Archaeology). The collection includes samples from excavations undertaken on sites of all periods across the country since WWII. It has been augmented since 2000 with samples from recent excavations undertaken by Ironbridge Archaeology and others. Working with young people and the Historical Metallurgy Society, Dr Woodham will explore strategies for reinvigorating this collection.\n\n3. Museum of English Rural Life: This 'Designated' Collection' was formed by academic collectors and private enthusiasts and holds multiple regional examples of certain kinds of objects, in this case hand tools. As the Museum embarks on a HLF funded redisplay the thematic scope of these stored objects is once again being explored. Working with crafts associations, students, enthusiasts and collectors groups the project will explore the histories held in MERL's hand tool collections. Dr Smith will draw on current research into collectors and collections at MERL and examine the role of nostlagia, crafts and enthusiasm in shaping connections with these objects.\n\nThough very different, these collections face similar issues. In a world where time, money and space are at a premium within heritage organisations, finding innovative ways to meet these challenges becomes all the more important. The project engages with experimental forms of stewardship by bringing traditional stakeholders together with new audiences. In this way it explores creative solutions and imagines new futures for these collections","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M006123/1","grantId":"AH/M006123/1","fundValue":"34516","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rhianedd  Smith","coPersons":["Alison  Hess","Anna  Woodham"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
