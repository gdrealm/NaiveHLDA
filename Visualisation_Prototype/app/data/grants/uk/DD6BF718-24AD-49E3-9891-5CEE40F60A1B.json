It provides a major resource for understanding issues which face societies around the world and unique information on the persistence of such states as child poverty or disability, on factors which influence key life transitions, such as marriage and divorce, and on the effects of earlier life circumstances on later outcomes. There is also a particular focus on health measures and assessments. Understanding Society is a valuable resource for policy related research.&nbsp; It has a very large sample size, representing all ages and all aspects of UK society including an ethnic minority boost sample.&nbsp; Data is collected directly from respondents and also linked from external sources.</p>\n\n<p>The study started in 2008 and this award covers collection of wave six to eight and a range of other activities to develop methodology, to provide data from the study to research users and to support their activities and promote the study to a range of audiences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005146/1","grantId":"ES/K005146/1","fundValue":"31475800","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michaela  BenzevalNicholas Hedley Buck","coPersons":["Annette Elisabeth Jackle","Lucinda  Platt","Heather  Laurie","Stephanie L.
