Marine scientists, engineers and managers therefore need to be able to measure fine sediment fluxes to assess their impact on the coastal environment. However, fine suspended particles rarely exist in their primary state but form flocs which are typically aggregated, heterogeneous assemblages of mineral grains, biogenic debris, bacteria and organic material. Optical and acoustic instruments are used to measure suspended sediment mass concentrations but with almost no understanding of the effects that flocculation has on the light and sound. Instruments are 'calibrated' against water samples from which sediment mass concentration is measured. We intend to investigate this long-standing and scientifically-challenging problem of how sound and light respond to muddy sediments and develop, through both theory and experiment, algorithms capable of quantitatively inverting backscatter signals from cohesive sediment to predict mass concentration, combining the best features of optical and acoustic sensors. The theoretical results of the study will be tested and evaluated using carefully controlled small-scale (Couette-type tank) and medium-scale (flume) laboratory experiments where a degree of control can be exerted on the flocculation processes, and against a full-scale field campaign at a muddy estuarine site. Both the flume and field trials will use a variety of acoustic (ABS, ADV and ADCP) and optical instruments (OBS, LISST-100 and INSSEV) together with pumped-sampling, velocity and turbulence measurements. The INSSEV (up-graded for this project) will be especially valuable, allowing digital images of individual flocs to be processed and their fall velocity measured.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E006647/1","grantId":"NE/E006647/1","fundValue":"154212","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  In terms of the operational use of acoustics for measuring the concentration of flocculated sediments,\nwe have been able to fit an empirical relationship to our observations.

While the results show that, in their current form, neither model is capable of adequately representing the scattering characteristics of a suspension of flocculated particles, the two models did provide upper (ES) and lower (FS) bounds to the measurements. \n\nIn terms of the operational use of acoustics to measure the concentration of flocculated sediments, empirical relationships could be fitted to the observations but, until a better theoretical understanding of how sound interacts with flocculated particles is achieved, the fitting of such empirical relations may be somewhat premature. See above for relevance to operational oceanography In terms of the operational oceanography and sediment transport empirical relationships could be fitted to the laboratory observations which may allow the routine use of backscatter data from instruments such as the ADCP or ADV to measure the concentration of flocculated sediments, Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
