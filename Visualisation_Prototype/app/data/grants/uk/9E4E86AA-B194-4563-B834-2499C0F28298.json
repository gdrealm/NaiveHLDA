Metastasis to the brain is one of the most feared complications of cancers such as breast and lung, as they cannot be detected at a stage when they can be treated and life expectancy once diagnosed is generally only a few months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for diagnosing brain cancer, but the techniques are only sensitive to tumours that are large and well advanced. These MRI methods use so-called contrast agents, which can be thought of as dyes that alter the colour or intensity of the images in the areas where they are present. Until now the contrast agents used in cancer diagnosis have been passive in that they require major damage to the brain blood vessels to allow their passive accumulation within the tumour. As a result, treatments that might have been successful at earlier stages do not work, because the disease is too far advanced. To overcome this problem, we have been developing a new type of MRI contrast agents that will actively bind to specific molecules associated with disease, and identify areas where levels of these molecules are increased. We have found that the levels of certain molecules on the blood vessels in the brain are increased early in the development of brain disease. In particular, we have identified specific molecules that are increased in the early stages of brain metastasis. By designing contrast agents that will bind to these specific molecules, we believe that we have found a way of detecting early brain metastasis when it cannot otherwise be seen. We have already shown that our targeted contrast agent works in mouse models of brain metastasis. The first aim of this project, therefore, is to take our agent and convert it to a form that will work in humans. We will then test this humanised form of the agent both for detection of the target human molecule and for any potentially harmful or toxic effects. When we have completed the work in this proposal, the humanised contrast agent will be taken forward into a clinical trial. We believe that our approach will greatly improve our ability to diagnose brain metastases in the early stages and, as a result, change the way in which patients with this currently incurable disease are treated and managed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902181","grantId":"G0902181","fundValue":"748234","fundStart":"2011-01-17","fundEnd":"2013-03-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola Ruth Sibson","coPersons":["David Gareth Williams","Benjamin  Davis","Ruth Josephine Muschel","Robin  Choudhury","Daniel Clive Anthony"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
