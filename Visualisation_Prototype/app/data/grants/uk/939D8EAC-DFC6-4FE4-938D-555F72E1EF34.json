{"id":"939D8EAC-DFC6-4FE4-938D-555F72E1EF34","title":"Transcription elongation processivity: backtracked complexes formation and resolution","abstractText":"Transcription is the first and the most heavily regulated step of gene expression. Many internal and external signals, such as sequences in the template, proteins bound to the template, etc., may influence the movement of RNA polymerase along DNA. These signals can slow down or even stall transcription, which leads to the formation of inactive backtracked complexes. Backtracked complex forms due to backward movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA template, which leaves the 3' end of the RNA out of the active centre and thus inactivates the elongation complex, e.g. leads to the premature termination of transcription. More importantly backtracked complexes are obstacles for different cellular machineries that work on RNA or DNA. Thus, there should have been mechanisms invented by cells to 'rescue' or 'resolve' these harmful complexes. The proposed mechanism of resolution via unassisted transcript hydrolysis by RNA polymerase active centre was found to be too inefficient. Cleavage factors that increase this hydrolytic activity were shown to be dispensable for cells. Thus, the mechanisms ensuring efficient resolution of backtracked complexes are still poorly understood. Here I propose a new factor-independent mechanism for the resolution of backtracked complexes that would explain how they can be efficiently resolved during transcription. The proposal is based on hypothesises (supported by preliminary results) that: i) resolution of backtracked complexes occurs at specific sites on the template DNA, at which transcript cleavage reactions are highly increased; ii) the transcript itself assists cleavage in the back-tracked complexes, thus reactivating them. We are going to test these hypothesises, and further investigate mechanisms of backtracking and rescue from it. The research of this proposal will also improve understanding of the structure and properties of transcription elongation complexes, and will shed light on the mechanisms of transcriptional pausing and termination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F013558/1","grantId":"BB/F013558/1","fundValue":"387139","fundStart":"2008-08-11","fundEnd":"2011-08-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The PI gave a live phone interview to the radio station BBC Russia in May of 2008. The interview was then deposited on-line on the website of BBC. The interview was in relation to a discovery made by Newcastle University scientists in the area of stem cells research. The PI explained to the audience in lay terms the principles behind stem cell research, the potential benefits and downsides of it. Then, in the conversation, the PI described the functioning of a biochemical/molecular biology laboratory, what an average day of a research associate scientist and a PI looks like. Given that the PI had experience of working in Russia and USA, he explained the benefits of being a young PI and setting up a laboratory in the UK, and funding opportunities in the UK.\nThe PI and the RA were involved in several university open days, and in the Baddiley-Clark Building (where the lab is based) Official Opening by Sir Paul Nurse, FRS, which involved informal communication and visits to the labs by the guests, including the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.\nThe PI participated in the &quot;Patient and Public Engagement: Improving the Impact of Teaching, Learning and Research&quot; conference held by Beacon North East.\nWe have set up a collaboration with a University campus-based biotech company, Demuris Ltd. (www.demuris.co.uk), chaired by Professor Jeff Errington FRS. Demuris are using experimental systems developed in the course of the grant for search of novel antibiotics targeting transcription. Demuris have agreed to supply us with these compounds on a marginal cost basis for investigation of their modes of action. Demuris provide a potential route to clinical practice for inhibitors that turn out to have commercial potential.

We discovered an ability of RNA polymerase to recognise sequences of the RNA-DNA hybrid, which can influence the elongation rate via pausing, and showed its involvement in some important transcriptional pauses, for example involved in development of HIV-1 or virulence of some bacteria (EMBOJ).\n2. We discovered that RNA polymerase core can recognise upstream DNA sequence during sigma-dependent pausing and discovered a new promoter element recognised by core of RNAP (EMBOJ). \n3. We discovered that translocation can be rate limiting step of transcription elongation, thus being the first evidence for &quot;in pathway&quot; pausing (EMBOJ, NAR). \n4. We discovered that antibiotic Tagetitoxin inhibits translocation by RNA polymerase, thus being the first known inhibitor targeting solely translocation. This also highlighted the role of the Trigger Loop in translocation and provided an experimental system to analyse translocation (NAR).\n5. We discovered that in response to backtracking and/or misincorporation, Gre factor substitutes for the catalytic domain of the RNA polymerase active centre, the Trigger Loop, to switch the activities of the active centre for efficient resolution of these dead end complexes. This is the first example of an exchange of catalytic domains in proteinaceous enzymes (Transcription, Microbiology, NAR).\nTaken together the above discoveries brought insights into how RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template during transcription and how this movement can be regulated or inhibited in the case of antibiotics. We generated around 30 new plasmids and E. coli strains for overexpression of mutant E. coli and T. aquaticus RNA polymerase and accessory factors.\nWe have highly improved the technique of assembled elongation complexes, by in depth analysis of the properties of few dozens of various complexes. We found complexes that can change translocation properties of RNA polymerase. The properties of the complexes are published and are used in crystallography, Cryo-EM and single-molecule techniques by our collaborators. \nWe showed that Tagetitoxin inhibits translocation of elongation complexes, that may now be used as a tool for analysis of phenomenon of translocation.
