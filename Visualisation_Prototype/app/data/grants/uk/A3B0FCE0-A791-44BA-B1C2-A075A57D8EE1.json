The area has seen some of the most dramatic events in modern history fought out over the invention of 'ethnic nations', still a powerful form of collective identity building today. Scholarship often considers these identity building projects either from the 'top-down', on the level of the nation state or region, as agents of construction; or from the 'bottom-up', seeking to define the place of individuals and minorities who contested the process. \n\nIn this project, we aim to revise the notion of 'ethnic minority', such as the 'Germans of Timisoara', 'Jewish Lodzer', the 'Ukrainians of L'viv', by examining how they distanced themselves from the majority whilst maintaining their 'privileged' status. We propose a specific definition of 'subcultures' to show how these groups in fact existed in the interstices of ECE identity-building projects, partly adopting and partly rejecting the majority agenda and/or the cultural practices of other minority groups.\n\n'Subcultures' are not understood as 'passive' colonial communities; non-normative and/or marginal groups in urban environments; or as subaltern youth cultures. In the specific context of ECE, the term 'subcultures' expresses a multi-layered, simultaneous form of identity, which developed 'underneath' the locally dominant project of identity construction but was not in a 'subaltern' position; neither necessarily opposing the majority, nor excluding it. In sum: our use of the term aims at a better understanding of these complex, shifting, and often-contradictory forms of ethnic identity.\n\nWe will study subcultural identity construction through case studies of five cities in Poland, Romania and West Ukraine, combining different historical approaches. The longue dur&eacute;e perspective transcends the periodic limitations, which obscure the fact that ECE identity-building projects in the 20th century drew on an eclectic range of elemets from different historical experiences: Imperial; Republican; Wartime; Communist; post-Communist. This not only offers a key to understanding the specifics of identity building in ECE, but also provides a more sophisticated approach, with contemporary relevance, that challenges the mapping of Western experiences elsewhere. Our perspective suggests that we do not have a conflict of cultures (majority vs. minority) but simultaneous constructions of cultures cutting across national borders and historical periods. \n \nThis project brings together four participants across two institutions (University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University). It combines the linguistic skills and disciplinary range of: Jan Fellerer, a historical linguist with German, Polish, Czech and Ukrainian; Marius Turda, a historian with German, Romanian and Hungarian, and Robert Pyrah, a cultural historian of post-Habsburg ECE with Polish, German and Ukrainian. It also includes the training of a Ph.D. student to provide career development within the field.\n\nThis project will reach audiences inside and beyond academia through workshops in Oxford (Years 1-2), in Central Europe (Year 3), a closing international academic Conference (Year 4), plus outreach lectures at National Cultural Institutes in London and the region, podcasting of material and a website. An edited volume arising out of the Workshops and the Conference, a monograph, as well as refereed journal articles resulting from the investigators' research, are also planned; and a seminar series led by the investigators at the University of Oxford on Central Europe utilises an established academic forum.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J00507X/1","grantId":"AH/J00507X/1","fundValue":"692897","fundStart":"2012-08-31","fundEnd":"2017-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  So far, our findings have attracted genuine interest from, and sparked discussion with, stakeholders, so far diplomatic representatives from the region, notably the Polish, Romanian and Austrian embassies and national cultural institutes in the UK; as well as cultural institutions and charities in the region which challenge monolithic national paradigms, notably the Vienna-based 'Initiative Minderheiten' and the national Zacheta Gallery in Warsaw. \nImportantly, according to the Impact Plan for our project, there will be a Central European Cultural Politics Symposium in the next calendar year where we will actively enter into a dialogue with local cultural policy makers from L'viv (Ukraine), Wroc?aw (Poland), Cluj and / or Timi?oara (Romania) about hybrid, 'sub-cultural' identities and their legacies in these East-Central European cities. This has the potential of subsequently facilitating expressions of greater and more positive awareness of mixed, 'sub-cultural' identites and can be relevant for local policy activities, such as in the planning of public commemorations, in museum work, in partnerships between cities and regions.

This has important social and political implications. Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious hybridity in various forms is a frequent fact in East-Central Europe's recent history and its legacies. Generally, it is a frequent fact in many other parts of the world too. However, 'sub-cultural' identities of this kind are often unrecognised, denied or stigmatised. For attempts at practically challenging this, cf. Narrative Impact. The project's main scholarly achievements are as follows:\n- The project creates significant new knowledge. The notion of 'sub-cultures' as specific forms of hybrid, mixed identity in national, ethnic, religious and linguistic terms fills a crucial gap in our understanding of East-Central Europe and its recent history.\n- The project has opened up important new research questions. Numerous constituencies in East-Central European societies cannot be understood through the prevailing prism of national, ethnic, religious, linguistic homogeneity. This has raised the important question of how these constituencies can be understood, and whether this understanding translates into other contexts, beyond East-Central Europe.\n- The project substantially increases research capability. East-Central Europe, i.e. the lands between Germany and Russia, is large, but generally understudied. The project has created an active international network, including scholars from the region itself. It fosters expertise in this area in the UK. The project is creating a diverse international network of institutions and researchers interested in mixed identities and in East-Central Europe. The project engages members of this far-reaching network with each other by way of a succession of workshops, seminars and publication projects. It is expected that the notion of 'sub-cultures' will continue to shape the research agenda of participants of the network in the UK and internationally.\nThe project engages select cultural policy makers and diplomatic representatives from the region, where the paradigm of national, ethnic, religious and linguistic homogeneity has been prevalent, and the source of recurrent conflict. Historical legacies, on the other hand, are precisely the reverse, with numerous forms of 'sub-cultural' national, ethnic, religious and linguistic mixing. Engaging these partners contributes to topical ongoing political discussions in the region and may ultimately influence local policy decisions.
