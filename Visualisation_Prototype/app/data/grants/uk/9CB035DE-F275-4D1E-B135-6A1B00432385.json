Smart clothing of the future will be able to monitor&nbsp;an individuals vital signs; determine body movement, posture and geographical location; regulate temperature; offer impact protection from falls and communicate this information to care providers 24 hours a day. Does this technology really address the concerns and needs of older people? </p> \n<p>The aim of the network is to define a methodology for the application of emerging smart clothes and wearable technologies, which enable older people to enjoy better quality lives. The network will foster new multidisciplinary academic, professional and user partnerships. It will embrace the expertise from: independent experts, university research groups, textile and garment developers, wearable computing, telecommunications, product design, interaction design, policy makers and health care professionals; and will seek users of health and social care services to work within the network. </p> \n<p>A series of workshops will enable network members to better understand issues surrounding independence and autonomy, user involvement within product design and development, and the use of information technology by older people. The final workshop will focus on developing a high quality collaborative research project proposal, which is grounded and informed by the expertise of the network and its potential end-users. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E020984/1","grantId":"ES/E020984/1","fundValue":"16917","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  McCann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wales, Newport","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
