{"id":"443AB6D0-A28B-40C6-A8D3-82D47DECFE61","title":"Roman and Late Antique Mosaics of Crete: long term continuity and change","abstractText":"The first time publication of the corpus of Roman and Late Antique mosaics of Central and East Crete will provide an original approach to the study of mosaics and an innovative method of presenting a diachronic view of provincial society in the East. Full iconographic details of the mosaics are provided and it is well illustrated with plates, figures, plans and maps. \\nIn the context of progress both within Crete and within Roman studies in general, particularly in light of the application of globalization theory, it is clear that a diachronic analysis of the island from a range of perspectives (local and centre) is needed in order to reverse the 'creeping determinism' that has propagated the idea of Roman and Late Antique Crete as a provincial dead end. As such it is apparent that a study of mosaics can provide an alternative means of assessing the nature of Crete within the context of the Empire. \\nThe introduction provides the Cretan context; a brief summary establishes the historical framework, building on that already detailed in Sanders' 1982 publication. The overview of the topography of the island allows the reader to become familiar with the landscapes of Crete and the reasons why such multiplicity of consequences to inclusion in the Empire could exist. Discussions of issues of terminology are presented and an overview of the application of globalization theory to Roman studies shows how pertinent the application is in achieving a realistic understanding of the diversity of Roman and Late Antique Crete. This allows the methodological aims to be clear. \\nThe catalogue of mosaics is included in the main text as the primary research material. Full iconographic, chronological, contextual and publication details are given and as such the corpus will fill a void in Mediterranean mosaic studies to date. Chapters 3 to 4 present the iconographic and contextual analysis of the mosaics, including the mosaics while Chapters 5 to 7 focus on the application of the evidence to building a new interpretation (function of space, craftspeople and broader context). An analysis of the date, distribution and iconography of mosaics will show that the fluctuating styles, locations and density of mosaics indicate subtle changes in the nature of society of Roman Crete as she grew into her position in the Eastern Roman Empire. Diversity between cities, between the urban and rural landscapes and over time are reflected in the analysis of mosaics; differences in occupations of cities in the 1st century, increasing communication with the Eastern Empire in the 2nd century and shift in focus from the south to the north in the 3rd century is reflected in mosaics. The lack of scholarly discussion on Late Antique Crete has lead to false perceptions of a society in decline from the 4th century. The inclusion of the Late Antique mosaics will emphasis the importance of the island during the period and show contrary to common belief, that the island was not only booming but the evidence of itinerant mosaicists suggests that she played a pivotal role in the communication network of the Eastern Empire.\\nFinally, having explored the evidence of the mosaics in detail with perceptions of globalization in mind, it is possible to approach the study of Crete from a different perspective to the norm; the variety in mosaics will show that while Crete was an important economic part of the Empire but that there were areas, such as Knossos, that had a strong desire to maintain the cultural identity within. Furthermore, by placing the material culture in the Mediterranean context, it will be clear that cultural developments in Crete can be viewed as relative to Rome and the Empire, rather than falling under a subsuming process of Roman acculturation. The resulting diachronic study from Hellenistic to Late Antique will present a much needed insight into the transformations with Cretan society, both urban and rural when the island becomes part of the Roman Empire.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F001851/1","grantId":"AH/F001851/1","fundValue":"26384","fundStart":"2008-09-22","fundEnd":"2009-05-25","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca Jane Sweetman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
