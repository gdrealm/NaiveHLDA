Using different primary targets, ISOLDE can produce beams of varying intensity of over 700 isotopes of 70 different chemical elements. This facility is unique worldwide in the diversity of available beams which it can produce. A recent advance at ISOLDE has been the REX-ISOLDE facility which accelerates these radioactive nuclei to energies where they start to resist the Coulomb repulsion of other nuclei in a fixed target. At such energies, interactions take place which allow us to probe the structure of these exotic radioactive nuclei with high precision. For one of these mechanisms, Coulomb excitation, some of the energy of the interaction goes into exciting the nucleus into higher energy states. The ease with which this takes place reflects the nuclear collectivity, a property which is generally largest for nuclei which are deformed, typically having a non-spherical shape such as a rugby-ball shape. Coulomb-excitation measurements therefore allow us to study the nuclear shape, in particular, a certain special class of nuclei which exhibit shape coexistence. This phenomenon occurs when different states in a particular isotope have different distinct shapes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/F000898/1","grantId":"PP/F000898/1","fundValue":"174170","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Anthony Butler","coPersons":["Robert  Page","Rolf-Dietmar Kurt Herzberg","Edward Stephen Paul"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
