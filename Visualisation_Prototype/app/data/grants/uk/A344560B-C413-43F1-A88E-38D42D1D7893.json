Cellular immune responses, which control infection, allergy and transplant rejection, are co-ordinated and effected by white blood cell called T-cells. T-cells develop in a specialized organ, the thymus, and a key component of immunosenescence is the early degeneration of the thymus, termed thymic involution. The mechanisms underlying this process are however poorly understood. Steroid hormones, especially androgens, are thought to be major contributors to thymic involution, and androgen blockade can result in thymic regeneration. The current proposal seeks to identify the cellular and molecular targets of androgen signaling in the adult thymus and during thymic rebound.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H021183/1","grantId":"BB/H021183/1","fundValue":"496210","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Presentations at scientific meetings.

This theory proposed that sex steroid signalling was the cause of age-related thymic involution. Our work has disproved that theory. We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal. We expect them to affect how other researchers in the field understand and investigate the mechanisms that cause thymus degeneration. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
