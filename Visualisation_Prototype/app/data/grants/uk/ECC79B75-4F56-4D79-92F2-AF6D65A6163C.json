The proposed application of SFCL is to limit the ever-increasing fault current level of the grid network due to the increasing capacity of newly integrated renewable energy, especially wind power. Compared to exiting technology, e.g. SFCL using 1st generation HTS, the proposed SFCL has the advantage of quick recovery and low AC loss, which is enabled by thorough understanding of the underlying HTS physics. \n \nThe project has three phases. The initial physics study focuses on the quench development and propagation of HTS which is closely related to the performance of SFCL. Experimental and numerical methods will be employed in the study to explore how HTS reacts to applied currents which are higher than its critical current. The second phase focuses on the design of SFCL, optimized geometries will be identified, and the critical current and ac loss of the designs will be estimated by the modeling. The third phase is the integration simulation platform of grid system study with wind power, considering the real time reaction of SFCL. This simulation platform will serve as a strong tool to evaluate the SFCL performance under various system fault conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K029940/1","grantId":"EP/K029940/1","fundValue":"282013","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is at a very early stage Energy ","person":"Timothy Arthur Coombs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project is still at its early stages they will be used in the power generation and supply industry Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
