Some fungi make complex molecules which have useful properties as herbicides which could be used to control weeds in crop species, or plants grown as bio-fuels. The use of such herbicides from a natural source could help increase crop yields and make farming more efficient and effective. This project focuses on a class of fungal herbicides known as nonadrides. It is not known how fungi produce these compounds, but it is known that genes within the fungi control the process. These compounds are unique because they kill weeds by a mechanism which is different from all other known herbicides. This project aims to discover the genes for nonadride biosynthesis with the aim of manipulating them to produce higher amounts of nonadrides and related compounds. This will be useful for the partner organisation Syngenta who will test the compounds produced for herbicide activity. We also aim to manipulate the nonadride genes to make a range of related compounds which will also be tested as herbicides. Establishing the relationships between the chemical structures of the compounds and their herbicidal effects will allow Syngenta and other agrochemical companies to design and make more effective compounds for use in agriculture. Eventually we may be able to ferment modified fungi on large scale to produce safer, more effective herbicides. Using fermentation in fungi rather than synthesis in a chemical factory will also make the production of herbicides cheaper and more environmentally sustainable.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006289/1","grantId":"BB/J006289/1","fundValue":"445211","fundStart":"2012-09-17","fundEnd":"2015-09-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work is covered by a confidentiality clause with Syngenta and results cannot presently be revealed.
