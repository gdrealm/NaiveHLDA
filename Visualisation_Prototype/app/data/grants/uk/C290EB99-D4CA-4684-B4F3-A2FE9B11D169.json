Couple relationships in the 21st century \nImpact and Public Engagement Report\n\nThe Enduring Love? study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC RES-062-23-3056) to examine meanings, understandings and experiences of couple relationships, aiming to break down the dichotomy between enduring relationships of quality and good enough or endured relationships. The project capitalized on recent moves in the UK Higher Education sector and funding landscape which require impact and public engagement activities to accompany academic research. For us, this was not only a matter of tagging on external-facing activities; we wanted to embed impact and public engagement. As such, from the outset, we defined Enduring Love? as a dialogic study.\n\nThe project was initially conceived as part of a wider thematic area that was convened through Intimate Futures and Relational Lives (IFRL) Research Group, funded by The Open University. This IIFRL initiative enabled us to host a meeting to discuss the ways in which professional practice, public sector and media interests might productively come together around ideas of couple relationships. The input from this group underpinned the project proposal and reinforced our commitment to working in dialogue with such organisations and non-academic partners. Once funded, the project established a management structure that underpinned our dialogic aims. Strategy Group members included representatives from the Department for Education (Section for Family Law and Relationships), The Treasury Office, Relate, One Plus One, The Tavistock Institute, CoSRT (College of Sexual and Relationships Therapists), Marriage Care, Bristol Community Family Trust, Asian Family Counselling Service, PACE (LGBT, Project for Advocacy and Counselling and Education). At the start of the funded project, interviews were conducted with representatives from all of these key organisations. As well as enhancing the policy and practice relevance of our work, the interviews established an ongoing dialogue with these organisations, which informed the project thereafter. \n\nOur 'pathways to impact' were, therefore, shaped through different modes of cross-sectoral engagement. The event also used the momentum of the new political administration of the Coalition Government, to consider how potential changes in policy might affect personal relationships and families, to identify what research questions and findings would be useful to beneficiaries and in what format, and to agree the most productive ways of continuing and developing communication. Until recently, political and policy interest in family lives has tended to concentrate on supporting children and parenting practices, structured through such government initiatives as Every Child Matters (DfES, 2003), Every Parent Matters (DfCSF, 2007) and Support for All: Families and Relationships (DfCSF, 2010). Following on from the General Election (May 2010), political and media attention may be tightly focused on the economy, but concerns remain about the 'state of relationships' in Britain today. Discussion at the OU-sponsored Intimate Futures Symposium (June 2010) highlighted the coalition government's commitment to support quality relationships and maintain family stability. This highlighted the need for more nuanced understandings of relationship capability and how some relationships are managing to successfully work through the 'stressors' that are encountered during uncertain socio-economic times. The end of the project was equally well-timed, coinciding as it does with the end of this period of government. \n\nDialogue with third sector organisations has thus ensured that insights generated through our study have professional practice relevance. Research evidence in this context is being used to inform delivery and development of relationship support and sex and relationship education (SRE) services. For example, we are currently working with the Family Planning Association to pilot SRE materials that are targeted at young people. We are also working closely with organisations involved in the Relationships Alliance to contribute to the development of relationship support services, through advancing understandings of what constitutes 'quality' and 'stability' in the context of long-term relationships and the emphasis placed upon these values in contemporary political rhetoric and policy thinking. The Relationships Alliance, formed of four leading relationship support organisations - Relate, Marriage Care, OnePlusOne and the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships - has, for example, suggested a range of alternative policy proposals to support couple relationships that go beyond the purely financial (RelationshipsAlliance, 2013). One of its recommendations is the targeted provision of services at those life transition points, such as unemployment, becoming a parent and retiring, that have long been recognised in academic, policy and practitioner research as 'stressors' (Walker, Barrett, Wilson, &amp; Chang, 2010) that some couples struggle to cope with. We were invited to participate in the 'Relationship Summit' that was hosted by the Relationships Alliance (College of General Practitioners, London, 18 August 2014). Here, in the long run-up to the 2015 general election, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all future domestic policies would have to pass a 'family test' that would examine their impact on family relationships. The research has also directly impacted on the democratic debate on couple relationships through invitations to participate in all-party parliamentary briefings, receptions and consultation events, including House of Commons (July 2013, April 2012 and October 2014) and Houses of Parliament (February 2013). Written research evidence was requested and has been presented to the Centre for Social Justice and Labour policy review. \n\nIn knowledge exchange activities with stakeholder groups (clinicians and relationship support organisations), and in dialogue with researcher and psychotherapist Reenee Singh, one other area was identified for further exploitation. The emotion map method was pioneered by Gabb (2008) in her previous research on family relationships, Behind Closed Doors. Researching intimacy and sexuality in families (ESRC, RES-000-22-0854) and formed part of multiple methods palette in the Enduring Love? study. The technique is designed to generate data on the emotional dynamic of everyday experience, locating how and where relationships are enacted, in this instance at home. Having worked as a researcher on the Enduring Love? project, Singh was convinced that emotion maps could make a valuable contribution in the clinical assessment and clinical practice toolkit. The graphic depiction of events and interactions literally opens up relationships for personal (and clinical) scrutiny, with the sharing of individual emotion maps between the couple and amongst family members encouraging critical reflection on how events and emotions may be perceived and experienced differently. In collaboration, drawing on case examples from Singh's work as a systemic family psychotherapist, we have explored the applied use of emotion maps in clinical contexts (Gabb &amp; Singh, 2014). \n\nThroughout the duration of the project we established regular communication with a wide and general audience. A regular newsletter was produced with a circulation of over 3,500 including many participants from the online survey and qualitative research. Copies of the newsletters are archived and remain available on the project website http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/communication-outputs/newsletter A collection of audio and video podcasts was also produced, being designed to introduce the study to participants and to provoke reflection among a general audience: https://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/enduring-love-for-ipod-iphone/id495106174 In these podcasts couples reflected on love and commitment, the effect of children, and the 'relationship work' which they do to sustain their relationships. The podcasts remain highly popular, receiving more than 24,000 hits in the first 3 months; they continue to offer an accessible portal into the conceptual themes developed in our academically-oriented analysis. The podcasts have a further purpose in that they provide case studies that are readily and publically available for journalists. \n\nThere has been extensive national and international media coverage of the Enduring Love? project and its findings. Between mid-January and mid-February 2014, the study generated 135 media features including a slot on the BBC TV news channel. The extent of this coverage has moved beyond the dissemination of findings, provoking on-going policy and public debate on the impact of parenting, sexuality, and what constitutes relationship work more generally. The media coverage has been generally good although some headlines were highly selective in how they read the rich survey findings: 'British women prefer tea to sex' (South China Morning Post, Sunday 19 January 2014). The feature goes on to explain, 'small gestures of appreciation matter far more than big flash romantic displays of affectionbeing made a cup of tea by your partner is a bigger turn-on than sex, but we are talking about Britain here remember'. The academic book has now been completed (Gabb &amp; Fink, forthcoming) and we have been approached by a leading publisher to write a 'trade' book from these findings, that will be marketed as 'the only relationship handbook based on research evidence'. This publication will translate the research findings into an accessible format, providing practical exercises aimed at a large international general audience.\n\nThe success of the Enduring Love? impact and public engagement strategy is perhaps best summed up by an endorsement received by Ruth Sutherland (Relate CEO), when speaking at the public launch event of the study findings (British Library, London, 14 January 2014): \n\nThis evidence and research could really raise the national consciousness of [relationship] issues and put them firmly in the debate. I hope we will look back at today and know this is a milestone the beginning of our understanding the need to invest in this area and to generate more and more research to help.\n\nReferences\nDfCSF.

Couple Relationships in the 21st Century\n\nWho and how we love may be changing but our desire to be in a relationship endures. 70% of households are still headed up by married couples and although long-term many no longer mean forever after, there is no sense that couples perceive their relationships as time limited when they are together. The Enduring Love? study has examined how couples experience, understand and sustain long-term relationships in contemporary Britain, paying particular attention to the impact of different relationship contexts on partner satisfaction and relationship maintenance. \n\n1. Study Findings and research evidence\n\nStudy findings provide research evidence on:\no The 'relationship work' that women and men do to stay together - and the extent to which it's gendered;\n\no How enduring relationships are lived and felt by couples at different generational points in the life course;\n\no The experience of adult couples living with and without children, and the impact of family policies and cultural narratives which privilege parenthood and childrearing as part of the life course and family life;\n\no The significance of biographical narratives, socio-economic circumstances, sexuality, ethnicity and religious belief for relationship experience;\n\nMore particularly, these are clustered around the following themes: \n1a) Partnering and parenting\n\nCouples draw on a range of intersecting emotional, cultural and biographical resources that shift across life course and the duration of a relationship. There is, however, one decisive factor which appears to cut across all other dimensions in the experience of couple relationships. Survey data indicate that the intersections of parenthood and gender are crucial in shaping the lives of couples. Parents appear to engage in less relationship maintenance than childless participants and are less positive about their relationships. Mothers, however, are significantly happier with life than any other group. From this it could be inferred that children are the primary source of happiness for women rather than a partner, something that is corroborated by other survey data including responses to the question 'Who is the most important person in your life?' Mothers are most likely to select their children whereas fathers overwhelmingly select their partner. These findings indicate the tensions faced in balancing parenting and partnering. Raising children and being in a relationship both require time and emotional energy, resources which are often stretched in families. The balancing act is often hard to sustain.\n\n1b) Age and generation \nThere is little evidence to support recent theoretical, policy and media emphases on growing social divisions between younger and older generations. It is rather that, regardless of age, couples use generational difference as a trope through which to examine personal choices and relationship practices and to acknowledge how particular socio-economic contexts and couple norms shaped relationships in the past. Couples acknowledge equally the ways their own childhoods, 'biographical anchors' (Heaphy et al 2013) and relational histories have shaped their relationships, thus illustrating an awareness of the significance of inter- and intra-generational transmission for relationship experiences, practices and expectations. \n\nThere are, however, inevitable differences in relationship experience across life course and these can affect relationship satisfaction. Analysis of survey data through age and relationship longevity indicate that the longer couples have been together, the less likely they are to be there for each other, to make 'couple time', to say 'I love you', to talk about everything and to pursue shared interests. It could be that longer-term relationships simply do not require the active investment of those of shorter duration or that 'relationship work', completed and on-going, becomes invisible over time. However, younger and older men tend to score higher on relationship satisfaction measures than men in midlife. Younger women score significantly higher than women in the older age categories. Women over 55 years of age score lower on relationship satisfaction regardless of their parental status. These statistical data indicate that gender and age are, therefore, determining factors in shaping relationship satisfaction. \n\n1c) Relationship practices\nThe study demonstrates the efficacy of everyday 'relationship practices' both as a methodological approach and as a way of understanding the dynamic of lived and living relationships. Relationship practices focus attention onto the everyday; they break down the dichotomy between enduring relationships of quality and good enough or endured relationships. They also contest the separation of couples into distinct relationship types - defined through different dimensions of relationship composition, form and/or categories of behaviour. Looking through the lens of relationship practices it is clear that there is no 'normal couple'. Findings provoke us to rethink what constitutes 'a couple' (dyad) and the slippage into and conflation with cultural understandings of the 'couple norm'. \n\nSpontaneous acts of kindness are valued, but everyday gestures such as a daily cup of tea brought to a partner in bed are especially and highly appreciated. What constitutes a thoughtful gesture in one couple might be seen as interference or unwanted 'fussing' in another. Thoughtful gestures thus operate through the currency of 'couple knowledge'; they are meaningful because they demonstrate 'deep knowing' (Jamieson 1992), that it is this relationship, and this particular other person who is treasured. Practices are, therefore, often routinized, and this regularity generates cohesion and closeness rather than its cultural association with familiarity and boredom. Activities ordinarily associated with 'wasted time' often serve an underlying and positive relationship purpose. For example, the pleasures of viewing TV, DVD and box sets are multi-layered and can bring together the couple - literally sharing a space, often seated in close proximity. Investment in characters, a series and/or storyline becomes woven into the couple narrative, providing a biographical, relationship anchor which connects the couple, over time. \n\n1d) Relationship work\nCutting across relationship diversity, common themes emerged in terms of the 'things' that combine to sustain a relationship, albeit that these are combined in different ways, at different times, in different circumstances; sometimes knowingly and consciously crafted, sometimes part of the everyday imperceptible couple fabric. These themes are grouped together here under the rubric of 'relationship work'.\n\nCommunication \nGood communication is crucial. Making time to talk and listen is highly valued, a means through which couples come to understand, reassure and comfort each other. Getting along and 'having a laugh' together alleviates, or puts into perspective, the everyday strains and difficulties of life. Women often experience their partners' unwillingness and/or inability to express their feelings as adversely impacting on the emotional dynamics of their relationship. There is, however, also an acknowledgement that secrets and silences are part and parcel of family life (Smart 2007). In some instances, silences and poor communication may sometimes be used in an attempt at kindness - a deliberate strategy to protect someone (self and/or partner) from pain and prevent further distress. \n\nOverall, some of the most difficult 'relationship work' that couples do are at the intersections of poor communication, arguments and conflict. Many couples practice 'reflexive bickering' as a process through which niggles and gripes are brought into the open, aired and made safe. Arguments and poor communication, however, especially around money issues, are frequently cited as one of the least liked aspects of a relationship. These are often linked to anxieties and difficulties generated by a lack of 'disposable income', , uncertainties around a partner's financial situation and/or difficulties in managing the household finances. \n\nTime and temporality\nCouples relish opportunities to spend time together, either as a way of catching up with the minutiae of their everyday lives or of sharing individual experiences such as hobbies, friendships and work life. The arrival 'home' after time spent apart is often framed as a highly cherished moment. The difficulties of not having 'couple time' feature regularly as an issue for those who are balancing work and family commitments. Couples acknowledge equally, however, the need for personal space and 'time out' from the relationship because this allows them a sense of independence and agency as well as opportunities to pursue personal interests and spend time with friends alone. \n\nLong-term relationships also include a diachronic dimension, indeed long-term relationships are experienced as being about a shared past, the present day and an anticipated future together. In different ways, to differing degrees, across time, couples seek to mark special occasions that have personal meaning for them, often involving highly personalised gift exchanges that consolidate and 'display' (Finch 2010) a sense of intimate knowledge. \n\nSpace and place \nThe home is highly significant in the ways couples describe their everyday practices, account for past experiences and imagine their future together. Home symbolises security, commitment and ways of being together as a couple. However, for those who are living in cramped or overcrowded conditions, and for couples with young children, especially in the context of long-term unemployment, being together - every hour of every day at home - can create considerable tensions. Couples in these circumstances talked about the pressures of having to share a bedroom with young children. Families and parents on low income are particularly disadvantaged by recent welfare reforms (April 2013) which imposed a 'bedroom tax'. For some couples, sleeping apart may constitute positive relationship work and serve as the bedrock of a successful couple relationship - particularly where, as our survey illustrates, annoying habits like snoring and 'duvet theft' are involved. Welfare reforms enforced living and sleeping arrangements in ways that did not take account of the complex uses of household space and what relationship work might be needed to sustain 'healthy' relationships. \n\nLove, affection and sexual intimacy \nLove is similarly a slippery concept and its articulation and meanings remain hard to pin down. While saying 'I love you' is not something that is either practiced or valued by all couples, the sense of feeling love, the warmth and connection afforded through embodied affection, and the meanings of physical and sexual intimacy are highly cherished, serving to consolidate togetherness, closeness and intimate proximity; a sense of 'being there' for your partner.\n\nThere is consensus across the survey that sex is an important part of a relationship. There remain, however, deep divisions between understandings and the experiences of women and men. Childless men and women are 50% more likely than parents to perceive physical affection as a sign of appreciation. Men are three times more likely than women to mention sexual intimacy as something which makes them feel appreciated. Notwithstanding these differences, dissatisfaction with sexual frequency did not undermine overall (high levels of) relationship/partner satisfaction. For some sexual intimacy was a means to consolidate couple closeness; for others it was taken-for-granted, a problem, or ordinary. As such, sex is everything, or nothing, or something in-between. It has no uniform meaning or sentiment. Policy and practice implications \n\no Couple diversity\n\nCouples are what couples do. Sets of contexts, predispositions and lifestyles combine in myriad ways to form and reform these diverse relationships, being underpinned by interwoven emotional, spatio-temporal and financial resources. The tension and problematic for policy and practice is to hold the specificity of experience in concert with differences in couples' lived lives.\n\n\n\no Patterns of relating\n\nLiterature and empirical studies splinter relationships into discrete objects of study; couples are situated across and within these sites. Relationship typologies, defined through context and/or prescriptive dimensions of dys/functionality, efface the multidimensionality of lived lives. Couple relationships are sustained through everyday interactions. Focusing on 'relationship practices' highlights the work that couples ordinarily do and the processes and practices through which relationships are materialised and sustained.\n\n\n\no Generational landscapes\n\nRelationship experience and expectations change across life course. For younger couples relationships can be 'an adventure', for those in midlife practicalities often overwhelm, in later life opportunities and obligations may combine. Relationship education initiatives need to respond creatively to these shifting relationship landscapes. Study findings, knowledge exchange and impact \n\n\n\n1a) Policy interventions\n\nThe Enduring Love? study provides research evidence on how couples sustain long-term relationships and is strategically well placed to inform and influence relationship support services and relationship education in Britain. The team is working closely with relevant government departments and organisations such as Relate and One Plus One and has presented findings to the Department for Education (DfE) as part of the relationship support policy agenda. The research has also impacted on the democratic debate on couple relationships and the researchers were invited to participate in all-party parliamentary briefings, receptions and consultation events, including House of Commons (July 2013 and April 2012), Houses of Parliament (February 2013) and Labour Policy Review (2014). The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Centre for Social Justice and Labour policy review have also asked for written evidence to be presented. \n\n\n\n1b) Professional practice dialogue \n\nWe are working with Relate and One Plus One to disseminate our findings among their constituent audiences - including counsellors and the general public. Methodologically, there is considerable interest in exploring the uses of emotion maps in therapeutic contexts. Gabb (PI) pioneered the emotion map method in family research, she is now working with one of the project Consultant Researchers, Reenee Singh (Tavistock and family systems therapist), to explore its potential. Several articles have been co-authored (forthcoming) which demonstrate the uses of emotion maps in research and clinical practice. We are also exploring funding opportunities to develop an emotion map App that will enhance its availability and potential use. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
