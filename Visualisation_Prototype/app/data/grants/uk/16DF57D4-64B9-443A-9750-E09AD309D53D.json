{"id":"16DF57D4-64B9-443A-9750-E09AD309D53D","title":"Education and Nationalism: The Discourse of Education Policy in Scotland","abstractText":"The project explores the interrelationship of the new global education policy agenda with policy making in the specific context of Scotland. The situation in Scotland is particularly interesting because of devolution, which may strengthen divergence from UK policy, and because of the recent election in May 2007, of a minority nationalist government. The UK government has been very strongly identified with the needs of the knowledge economy, but a number of policy initiatives that it has promoted in order to support the knowledge economy have not 'taken' well in Scotland. The SNP government is committed to the idea of independence for Scotland, and must translate the importance it attaches to the idea of 'the nation' into a legislative programme in education for Scotland, which marks itself of from the UK government, but at the same time keeps connections to the knowledge economy agenda. In the early months of the government, this task seems to be being attempted through the projection of a new, inclusive, modernised nationalism that helps to create 'smarter Scotland'. The project aims to see how nationalism is being translated and used in constructing and describing education policy in order to assess its use a resource for the government.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G000565/1","grantId":"ES/G000565/1","fundValue":"76353","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Anne Arnott","coPersons":["Jennifer  Ozga"],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
