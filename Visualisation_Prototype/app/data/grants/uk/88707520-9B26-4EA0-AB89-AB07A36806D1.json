{"id":"88707520-9B26-4EA0-AB89-AB07A36806D1","title":"The Politics of Unrecognised States: Democratisation, Self-determination and Contested Identities","abstractText":"<p>Unrecognised states are geographical areas that have achieved de facto independence, but have failed to gain international recognition. These entities are often situated in highly volatile regions and are themselves often the product of violent conflict. They are regarded as security threats and as key obstacles to regional stability, yet they remain shrouded in mystery and are subject to myths and simplifications. Unrecognised states represent a great challenge for policy makers, and the relevance of understanding how they operate is made even timelier by Kosovo's recent recognition and by Russia's subsequent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to further our understanding of the politics of unrecognised states through a close comparison of two such entities, Nagorno Karabakh (Azerbaijan) and Republika Srpska Krajina (Croatia). The research includes six weeks of intensive fieldwork in each of the two areas; a total of 40-50 in-depth interviews will be conducted and non-English archives will be accessed in order to complete a focused comparative analysis. The project charts the internal dynamics of unrecognised states - struggles over dominance, attempts at state-building and democratisation, strategies used for gaining recognition - and analyses how these impact on the possibility for reaching a peaceful settlement.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2728","grantId":"RES-000-22-2728","fundValue":"58877","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nina  Caspersen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
