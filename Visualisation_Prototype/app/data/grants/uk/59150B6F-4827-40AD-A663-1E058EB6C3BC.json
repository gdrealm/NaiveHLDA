While there has been considerable progress with understanding the biology of the virus and improvements in healthcare provision, many issues relevant to the characteristics of HCV infection in the UK remain unresolved, such as the factors that contribute to development of serious liver disease and failure to respond to treatment. To address these issues, this proposal aims to create the infrastructure that will allow recruitment of a national cohort of at least 10,000 patients. Assembling a cohort of this size is necessary to generate a representative but sufficiently diverse collection of patient characteristics and clinical samples to explore in detail the determinants that may contribute to HCV pathogenesis and response to treatment. The key components of the national resource that will be created are a clinical research database for retaining details of patient characteristics, a biobank of clinical samples, which will form a UK repository, and a sequence and bioinformatics database to hold viral and host genetic information. The infrastructure will be supported by and build upon existing knowledge and expertise at national agencies (Health Protection Agency and Health Protection Scotland), the Gastroenterology and Liver Disease Biomedical Research Unit at Nottingham and the MRC Virology Unit in Glasgow. Patients will be recruited from clinical centres across most of the UK who provide care for HCV-infected patients. To provide proof of principle for the utility of clinical research and sequence databases combined with the availability of a biobank of clinical samples, a limited series of research projects will be performed. The projects will focus on examining whether there is a correlation between patient genetic markers and treatment outcome. In addition, the viral sequences of a large number of isolates for HCV genotypes 1 and 3 in different ethnic groups will be determined. These studies will provide the foundation for the information that will be deposited in the sequence and bioinformatics database. The availability of such a well-structured resource is highly likely to stimulate greater clinical and fundamental research into HCV infection in the UK and will also form the basis for longitudinal studies into the natural history of chronic infection in a large cohort of patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_UU_G1000717","grantId":"MC_EX_UU_G1000717","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  McLauchlan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
