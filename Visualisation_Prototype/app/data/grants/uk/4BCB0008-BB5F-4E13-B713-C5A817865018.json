We will ask how big are these T cell responses and do they react only to avian virus or will people whose T-cells recognise the common flu strains have some protection against avian flu? Do these T-cell responses play a part in protecting people who have been exposed to avian flu but who did not become sick? Or is there a possibility that having T-cell immunity to the more common influenza virus strains could actually cause disease in people who are exposed to avian strains of influenza A virus?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600520","grantId":"G0600520","fundValue":"418091","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tao  Dong","coPersons":["Andrew J McMichael","Sarah Louise Rowland-Jones","Jeremy  Farrar","Xiao-Ning  Xu","Coralie  Simmons","Menno  De Jong"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
