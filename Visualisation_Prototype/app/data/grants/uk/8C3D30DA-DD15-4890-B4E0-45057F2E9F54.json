Each receiver coil sees the object (the patient) from a different position, resulting in images from each coil seeing different parts of the body. There is overlap between these views so that when combined a continuous picture is produced. Until recently this image combination was performed in such a way as to provide the best image quality. Recent developments combine these images in a different want to increase the speed at which images can be acquired rather than simply improve image quality. This trade off between quality and speed can be used to image things which have not been possible before, for example, increasing the number of times in a heartbeat that the heart can be imaged. This has the potential to reveal otherwise subtle abnormalities in the heart motion. Parallel imaging has limitations. To make good quality images we need to have accurate measurements of the position and view that each coil sees. If this is incorrect due to accidental or deliberate patient or coil motion after this measurement has been made then images formed from the coils will be incorrect. There are many exams where the patient must be moved during the examination. If we wish to image the whole body then the patient must be moved through the scanner because the part of the scanner useful for imaging covers only a small part of the body. In doing this, coil measurement must be either repeated for every position or new ways of acquiring the coil view information invented. This proposal aims to tackle exactly this problem and replace partially or totally coil calibration for individual scan. Other problems occur when the views from the receivers are not different enough. This also results in poor image quality but for different reasons. This problem will be tackled by looking at the mathematics of the processes involved in image reconstruction and changing the reconstruction based on information provided by a reference image, this second image may have been a previous MRI scan but certainly does not need to identical a quantity called joint entropy will be used. Joint entropy measures how much like a second image a given image is. I will also be looking at the possibility of making the problem of moving the patient a useful part of parallel imaging. If the receivers do not have different enough views of the patient then one solution is to change the view, this is not practical in most exams but when the patient is moving this is possible. The receivers in general will move with the patient but the scanner itself does not move and so there is new information introduced which it may be possible to use to improve imaging, in reality patient motion is quite slow so we may have to add additional information which changes in time to help. All of these scenarios and methods have implications for MRI and will be explored. Many of these problems occur all at once when imaging with small receivers to look at small objects such as the blood vessels in the neck and so this application will also explore this method of imaging with the aim to increase the quality of micro imaging using all that we have learnt to improve it. This proposal aims to improve magnetic resonance imaging by inventing new parallel imaging techniques and as a result give radiologists better information on which to base their decisions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C53820X/1","grantId":"EP/C53820X/1","fundValue":"117364","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2008-01-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Larkman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
