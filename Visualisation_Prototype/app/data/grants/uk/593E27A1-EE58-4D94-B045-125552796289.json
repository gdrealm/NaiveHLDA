{"id":"593E27A1-EE58-4D94-B045-125552796289","title":"Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds","abstractText":"The largest uncertainties in future climate predictions highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC 2007) arise from our lack of knowledge of the interaction of clouds with solar and terrestrial radiation (Dufresene &amp; Bony, 2008). \nIn Antarctica clouds play a major role in determining the continent's ice sheet radiation budget, its surface mass balance and ozone climatology. However in spite of this there are few in situ measurements of cloud properties, aerosol numbers, Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) or Ice Nuclei (IN) with the main focus being on remote sensing data sets (see the review by Bromwich et al 2012). As a result the skill in climate and forecast models at high latitudes is significantly poorer than at mid latitudes. \nIn this is project we plan to extend the regions sampled to ones more representative of the Antarctic continent's coastal region. It is in this coastal region that clouds will have the biggest impact on the climate as in the interior of the continent the total cloud cover is less (Lachlan-Cope 2010) and those clouds that exist are more tenuous. To achieve this we will conduct flights from the Halley research \nstation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K01482X/1","grantId":"NE/K01482X/1","fundValue":"469667","fundStart":"2014-05-29","fundEnd":"2018-05-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas William Choularton","coPersons":["Keith  Bower","Paul James Connolly","Jonathan  Crosier","Martin William Gallagher","James Robert Dorsey"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
