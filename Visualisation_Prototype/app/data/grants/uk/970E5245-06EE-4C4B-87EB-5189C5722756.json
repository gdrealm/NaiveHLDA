Currently, the choice for research is between stem cells from embryos, and those from adult tissues. Embryonic stem cells form more tissue types than adult stem cells, but raise ethical concerns and their development is too uncontrolled to allow transplantation in humans. Fetal stem cells are somewhere in between, growing better and into more tissue types than adult ones. We recently identified a new type of fetal stem cell, which circulates in the blood in the first months of fetal life, and develops in the laboratory into muscle, bone, brain and other tissues. A variety of inherited diseases affecting muscle, the skeleton, brain and other tissues cause organ damage in early life. Examples include muscular dystrophy, brittle bone disease and rare enzyme deficiencies. Transplanting fetal stem cells inside the womb should lead to much greater numbers of stem cells before damage occurs, and therefore better tissue repair than if given after birth. Giving them inside the womb before immunity develops should also reduce the chance of stem cells being rejected. Because fetal stem cells can be collected from an affected fetus in early pregnancy, they could be used replace a defective gene, before being put back inside the same fetus. We will test the ability of fetal stem cells given inside the womb to spread and contribute to developing fetal tissues. Because this is not ready to test in humans, it must first be tried in the laboratory in a mouse model. There is no alternative way of assessing whether transplanting stem cells inside the womb actually works. We will also insert a harmless marker gene to test whether fetal stem cells can be safely modified in the laboratory and still grow in sufficient numbers to be useful for treatment. Fetal stem cells can also be collected from elective abortion, and their ability to differentiate into nerve cells suggests an additional role in repairing brain damage at birth. Demonstrating that fetal stem cells contribute to fetal organ development inside the womb is an essential prerequisite before this type of treatment could be tried in humans. If successful, it may open the door to development of a new approach to disabling genetic conditions for which the only therapeutic option currently is termination of pregnancy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300340","grantId":"G0300340","fundValue":"194233","fundStart":"2005-01-04","fundEnd":"2008-04-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Maxwell Fisk","coPersons":["Malcolm  Alison","Michael  Themis","Huseyin  Mehmet"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
