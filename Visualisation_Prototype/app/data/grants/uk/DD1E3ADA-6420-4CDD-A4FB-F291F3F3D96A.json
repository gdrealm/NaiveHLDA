Mankind has learnt to exploit many of these natural compounds, not least those that act as antibiotics. One class of compounds, the polyketides, are of great importance because they include many molecules with a great diversity of structures which cover a whole range of useful activities - not just antibacterials, but also antifungals, anticancer and anticholesterol agents, to name just a few. Typically, the molecular 'backbones' of these compounds are made by joining simple building blocks on an assembly line, each building block being added by a separate 'module' that also processes the new segment to one of a number (normally three) of modifications (known as the Type I PKS pathway). The resulting molecular chain can be of different lengths and combinations of modifications and can then be decorated with different side chains to produce a unique product ('tailoring'). However, an increasing number of atypical pathways are being uncovered that appear to use additional mechanisms not yet defined. These provide ways of producing new structures in a controlled way. One such pathway, found in Pseudomonas fluorescens, synthesises the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin. It is most active against Gram positive bacteria and is particularly used against MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), one of the most dangerous 'superbugs'. Biosynthesis of mupirocin involves an atypical Type I PKS along with a large number of 'tailoring' enzymes some of which we have discovered act in tandem with the PKS in building the backbone of mupirocin. This is in contrast to typical type I PKS modules which within themselves contain all the information needed to build the backbone. This project integrates microbial molecular genetics, biochemistry and chemistry to study the biosynthetic machinery both in living cells and with purified enzymes to understand the role of the different PKS and 'tailoring' components in building the final active product. It will explore the reactions carried out by different parts of the pathway and their flexibility to produce new compounds. These will be made available for screening for new biological activities that may be of use as prophylactic or therapeutic agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E022367/1","grantId":"BB/E022367/1","fundValue":"356385","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This work led to the production of new analogues of the pseudomonic acid group of antibiotics and provided basis for further grant applications Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal","person":"Thomas James Simpson","coPersons":["Russell  Cox","John  Crosby","Christine  Willis"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" An deeper understanding of a novel biosynthetic pathway to an important clinically used antibiotic.
