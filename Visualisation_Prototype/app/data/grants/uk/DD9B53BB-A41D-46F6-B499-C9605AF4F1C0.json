Much of the conversation has centred on the position of communities as impediments to and assistors of radicalisation and/or intra-communal violence. This discourse has percolated between academe, the media, and government and has been fuelled by government policies and pronouncements, terrorism arrests and general chatter. Most recently, in February 2011, in a speech in Munich, Prime Minister David Cameron signalled a new stage by broadening the focus of government counter-terrorism policy away from violent extremism and toward more general extremism/radicalisation with an underlying suggestion that this might require a greater engagement with some communities or elements within communities. The riots of August 2011 only further emphasized the role of community and `connectors', both negatively and positively, in such outbursts. \n\nThere is, however, a much longer history around communities, radicalisation and intra-communal violence that requires examination in order to generate historically literate policy in the 21st century. It is remarkable how little past historical examples where these elements are present have been examined despite the relevance to current debates. In the interwar period, for instance, thousands of British citizens across a number of different communities, including in the West Midlands, were &quot;radicalised&quot; and found themselves involved with entities on the far right or far left. In the 1930s, for ideological reasons, nearly 2000 young British men, against the wishes of their government, left their communities to fight, and in some cases die, in the Spanish Civil War. In the same period, five young men (later known as the &quot;Cambridge Five&quot;) would be radicalised while at university and, as a result, turn against their country, revealing secrets to the Soviet Union that led to the deaths. Others joined far right organizations, including thousands who belong to the British Union of Fascists, and engaged in intra-communal violence in the 1930s.\n\nIn previous centuries, other movements, such as the Luddites, have developed in Great Britain which today would be seen as involving elements of radicalisation and violence. Even more relevant to the present have been past radicalised movements associated with religious extremism that included the use of terrorism. Elements within Catholic communities, including in the Midlands, became engaged in a terrorism plot that sought to blow up Parliament in 1605, decapitating the political leadership. The Gunpowder Plot revealed the complexities of the interconnection between communities and radicalisation as key individuals served as &quot;connectors&quot; across boundaries.\n\nA scoping study to look at the literature around historical case studies of radicalisation and intra-communal violence and its interaction with communities, including &quot;connectors&quot; within these communities in which both are fleshed out in a three dimensional matter and problematized accordingly is long overdue. Radicalisation and its intersection with community is not a modern phenomenon and it is crucial that its roots be explored so as to inform current policy and debate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J01186X/1","grantId":"AH/J01186X/1","fundValue":"19915","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-08-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Yes, in that I am involved as a CI in another Connected Communities project.
