The question which informs this proposal is: 'How can practitioners in early years settings make meaningful use of the ORIM framework to support their work with parents to promote early literacy development'? This question will be addressed through two national conferences and three residential working groups of practitioners who will adapt&nbsp; and use of the ORIM framework into their current family literacy practices (and where practitioners wish to, to new curriculum areas) and for use with families and a range of practitioners nation-wide. Following the workshops, materials will be collated and uploaded on to the REALonline website and practitioners will share their experiences and new developments of working with the ORIM framework at an end of project conference.<br /><br />Nutbrown, C.
