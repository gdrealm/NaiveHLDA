Policy decisions about which treatments to fund on the NHS, for example, focus mainly on the consequences of different policy options for people?s health (quite narrowly defined). In part this is because there is a well recognised method for valuing health states (called the Quality Adjusted Life Year or QALY). The QALY can be used to compare the health benefits obtained by funding different types of treatment. There is no similarly well recognised technique for valuing other aspects of health care experience (such as waiting time, continuity of care, having a sense of control, not feeling stigmatised, being respected as a person with a life to get on with). This research project aims to: identify and describe the range of health care experiences that matter to people; consider which of these experience policy makers need to consider the value of; assess the techniques that are currently available for estimating how much value people assign to these experiences; and identify what further research is needed to enable policy makers to take the value of these experience into account when making policy decisions. The researchers will fulfil these aims by studying existing evidence about what health care experiences matter to people and about how these experiences can be valued, and by presenting their initial findings to groups of experienced patient/carer representatives and policy makers for discussion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800774","grantId":"G0800774","fundValue":"237661","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mandy Elaine Ryan","coPersons":["Vikki Ann Entwistle","Jilllian Joy Francis","Cynthia  Fraser"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
