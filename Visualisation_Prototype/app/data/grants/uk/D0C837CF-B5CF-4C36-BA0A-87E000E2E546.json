Most of the work for the exhibition, such as the title, was developed during a short residency in the Lake District, which all the team, including people with dementia and artists attended. The exhibition is touring Bradford, Glasgow and Liverpool.</p>\n\n<p>There is a website www.nolimitsdementia.com.

Power of documentary film for provoking dialogue about dementia, and people with dementia; the film has been screened in different places to different audiences, including the Alzheimer's Disease International and Alzheimer's Europe conferences, as well as Dementia Congress. Each time it is interpreted in a different way and typically provokes discussion about profound issues such as end-of-life care, risk taking, and the authenticity of participants' identity as a person with dementia.\n\n \n\n2. Value of a residency for collaborating effectively with people with dementia; in particular, we found that it created a space for people to not only work effectively but also create bonds, extend social networks, and have some fun. \n\n\n\n3. The importance of creating an educational resource pack that reflects the nature and focus of the collaboration (inspirational, quality of material, person-centred) and which encourages action from the resource user (public promise). The overall aim of this project was to raise public awareness and challenge the cultural stereotypes, fear and misunderstandings surrounding dementia. Outputs have been used in a non-academic context, including the International Documentary Film Festival, and at a practice based events.
