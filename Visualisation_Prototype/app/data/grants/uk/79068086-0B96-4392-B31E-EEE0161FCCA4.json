We have identified an unexpected role of ATP in plant disease resistance, a finding that now enables us to discover previously unknown components of plant pathogen defence systems. ATP is a simple organic molecule used as a universal form of chemical energy for sustaining living organisms but, surprisingly, cells excrete it. In plants this excreted ATP is not wasted, but harnessed on the cell's surface to serve as a chemical switch that controls the plant's defences against attack by disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens). The switch is turned on or off by lowering or raising the levels of cell surface ATP, respectively. When turned on, the switch activates the cells to start producing compounds that either directly kill the invading pathogens or indirectly stop the infection. We discovered that this external ATP operates in partnership with salicylic acid, the parent compound of aspirin, which is a recognised natural plant chemical signal that immunises plants against infection by certain pathogens. Although located outside the cell, this switch system recruits other, as yet unknown, signalling components located both outside and inside the cell so as to control the expression of pathogen defence genes. In this work, we propose to identify the key signalling genes/proteins that enable this regulatory control system to work. We will use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and state-of-the-art technologies for identification of these genes and proteins. We will identify proteins that directly interact with ATP at the cell surface as well as the other proteins inside the cell that help to carry the signal to the nucleus to control defence gene expression. Overall, results from this study will increase our understanding of plant signalling systems and provide new opportunities for devising novel strategies to combat plant diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H000283/1","grantId":"BB/H000283/1","fundValue":"535945","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antoni Ryszard Slabas","coPersons":["Josiah William Simon"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
