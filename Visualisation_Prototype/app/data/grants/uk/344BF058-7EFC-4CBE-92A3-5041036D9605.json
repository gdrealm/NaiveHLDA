{"id":"344BF058-7EFC-4CBE-92A3-5041036D9605","title":"Consolidated Moving Image and Sound Database Framework","abstractText":"The UK has a rich heritage of film and radio material. This can provide crucial insights into life during the past 100 and more years. It is a hardly tapped resource for researchers in many disciplines from medicine to fashion, from linguistics to geography.\\n \\nIncreasing quantities of archive television and film content are now becoming available online to the general public (eg Pathe, BBC Archive Collections) or the academic research community (eg. ITN news through the JISC's Newsfilm Online, BUFVC collections, BFI InView). Online catalogues now exist for those collections that can be accessed only by other means, such as archive visits. More will be released as the twin processes of digitisation and copyright negotiations proceed.\\n\\nHowever, this content is often prepared and delivered as 'collections'. You have to know where you are likely to find something before you look. There is no one place where you can search for content about a particular subject, locating material from cinema newsfilm, television or radio. This presents a considerable barrier to anyone contemplating using audiovisual content in their research.\\n\\nThis project will build such a place, by producing a common scalable search interface for the nine databases developed and/or curated by BUFVC. These cover material from the earliest of cinema newsreels to next week's television. It would enable a researcher interested in the break-up of Yugoslavia to discover in one place and moment:\\n- contemporary ITN reports\\n- the BBC's 'first draft of history' documentary series 'The Death of Yugoslavia' from 1995\\n- contextual footage of the history of Yugoslavia from newsreel footage of Tito's partisans\\n- a 10 minute Visnews resume of the background history. \\nIt would allow a geographer to find footage of the same place or the same natural phenomena from the beginnings of cinema to the present; a biographer to discover the many radio and TV interviews given by their subject and any other programmes in which they participated.\\n\\nAt all times, the nature and provenance of the material will be made clear: a newsreel from the 1930s has a very different 'feel' to TV news of the 1960s, as does 1960s news to that of today. Understanding the origin of the content is key to recovering its meanings and then to reusing it for contemporary purposes. The nature of the source collections of content is still vital in this process, as with the equally necessary process of finding content where it is not already available in an online digitised form. Where content is available, an embedded hyperlink will enable it to be previewed as part of the search and discovery process.\\n\\nThe interface will enable researchers to select filters to exclude irrelevant material. It will have a strongly visual design. The design of the interface will be extensively tested with researchers from a wide range of disciplines as part of the project.\\n\\nThe project will create a framework into which further information can and will be inserted when it comes available. Once in place, any relevant information (eg from BBC or overseas archives) can easily be integrated. BUFVC has a 60 year history in providing data on moving images to the academic sector, and is core funded by JISC as well as having over 90% of UK higher education institutions in its membership. BUFVC's continued curation and expansion of this data framework is thus assured.\\n\\nTwo further features will ensure that this database and interface remain a living and growing entity. The software that underpins the work of integrating the existing nine databases in BUFVC's curation will be developed by BUFVC and will be considered for release to the open source community. Second, the Web 2.0 aspects of the interface will allow users to feed in their own information: hyperlinks to specific footage, more detailed metadata and free-text descriptions, contextual material, published academic research work etc.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037047/1","grantId":"AH/H037047/1","fundValue":"332520","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Ellis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
