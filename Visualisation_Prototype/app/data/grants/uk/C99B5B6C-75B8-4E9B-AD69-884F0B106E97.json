The greatest burden is shouldered by 13.3 million African women, who make up 60% of the epidemic in this region. Heterosexual intercourse continues to be the main mode of transmission, and there is strong evidence that some sexual behaviours can increase the risk of HIV infection. We are interested in looking at one set of common female behaviours called intravaginal practices to see if these might be a risk factor for HIV.\n\nIntravaginal practices (IVP) involve putting something inside the vagina to clean, dry, or tighten the vagina. Scientists are concerned that these behaviours may cause tiny cuts or swelling in the vagina that could increase the risk of HIV infection. So far, studies have shown that many women in Africa use these practices, but the evidence linking IVP to HIV risk is still unclear. Studies have also shown that these practices are very different from community to community, and this makes looking at the HIV risk very difficult. Studies must carefully define IVP in each community, so that they can accurately link it to HIV infection. \n\nWorking with our collaborative partners in Africa, we have designed a multi-disciplinary study to see if IVP is a risk factor for HIV infection. We will invite women who work in bars and other food and recreational facilities in the city of Kampala in Uganda and small towns in northwest Tanzania to join the study and they will be followed up for one year. The main point of this study is to measure the risk of HIV among IVP users, but it will also study the types of IVP and the reasons women use these practices. In addition, this study will use clinical observations and laboratory tests to look in detail at whether IVP causes swelling or small cuts inside the vagina. This holistic approach is important, because if there is an increased risk of HIV from IVP, we will be able to give clear information on why women are using these practices and how they affect the vagina. This could provide the foundation for programmes to encourage women to change their IVP behaviour and help decrease the risk of HIV.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701039","grantId":"G0701039","fundValue":"604174","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John  Hayes","coPersons":["Saidi  Kapiga","Janneke  Van De Wijgert","Robin J Shattock","Heiner  Grosskurth"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
