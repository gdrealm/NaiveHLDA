{"id":"813447A5-6071-49B4-BB86-8AE2F3D6E66B","title":"Predicting urban food insecurity under climate change in Brazilian Amazonia","abstractText":"<p>Governments have recognised the need to reduce the societal impacts of climate change by improving the adaptive capacity of poor, marginalised populations to severe weather events.</p>\n\n<p>Extreme events such as droughts cause significant economic losses, and threaten human health and food security. Drought impacts may be significant in regions where food distribution is largely dependent on river-transport.</p>\n\n<p>The main objective of this project is to develop a computer-based tool for predicting where and when food security of Amazonian city-dwellers will be threatened by droughts, because of impaired river transport and higher food prices. In addition to collecting food-price data, household food insecurity will be assessed using questions from the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale.</p>\n\n<p>This data will be combined with freely-available information on river levels and poverty distribution across the whole Amazon to produce predictive models. The outcome will be a tool that can generate maps to show the level of Food Security Risk for all municipalities in the Amazon, which will facilitate strategic investment of resources to reduce urban food insecurity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010018/1","grantId":"ES/K010018/1","fundValue":"241928","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Luke  Parry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
