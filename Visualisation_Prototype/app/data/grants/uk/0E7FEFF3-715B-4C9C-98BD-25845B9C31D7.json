A comprehensive report on long hours of work and adverse health effects based on a survey of Inspectors and interview data was recently published. Obstacles to hoursâ€™ reform in an emergency service that plays a high risk/high demand role in the community must be balanced against Inspectors routinely working beyond the legal limits of the Working Time Regulations. The evidence base is sufficiently compelling that the parties cannot continue to treat long hours as a natural or unavoidable part of being a Police Inspector.</p>\n\n<p>The core activity of the KE project is to jointly organise a series of 11 regional workshops to promote engagement with and impact from the available evidence base. In addition to our own input, these workshops will involve contributions from lawyers and occupational health specialists to establish common ground for all parties to work together, to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, the dissemination of good practice, and the identification of more effective methods to monitor, manage and balance the working hours and working lives of Inspectors.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005618/1","grantId":"ES/K005618/1","fundValue":"52281","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"V J Wass","coPersons":["Peter John Turnbull"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" The principle objective of this Knowledge Exchange (KE) activity was to explore, agree and disseminate meaningful and proactive steps towards rectifying the problems of long (and excessive) working hours amongst Inspectors in the Police Service. Our KEO partners were the Inspectors Central Committees (ICC) of the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) and the Scottish Police Federation (SPF). The objective has been achieved through a series of forty-four Force Reports and ten Regional Workshops (one for each of the nine Regions of the PFEW and a single workshop for the recently combined Police Scotland), the purpose of which was to promote engagement with and impact from a detailed 85-page Research Report (Turnbull and Wass 2012) Time for Justice: Long Working hours and the Wellbeing of Police Inspectors http://library.college.police.uk/docs/Time-for-Justice-report-2012.pdf a representative survey of the Inspecting Ranks in England, Scotland and Wales that provided a compelling evidence-base on the extent and underlying causes of long hours of work and work-related ill health. Many IBBs have used Force Reports as part of their Evidence Based Negotiations over working-time, workload, hours recording and Working Time Agreements (WTAs). Staffordshire used its to encourage inspectors to record their hours, the Force to monitor recorded hours and to raise hours-related equality issues. In Sussex Force Reports were used to support a case for monthly hours' monitoring reports. The Force Report for Scotland was instrumental in the negotiation of new WTAs (specifically in relation to 'on-call' working and working arrangements in the custody division) and in the establishment of a Working-time Working Group (Police Scotland, Scottish Police Authority, SPF). We have developed a network of support for on-going KE by providing training and assistance to IBB Secretaries in administering follow-up surveys of long hours and wellbeing in four constabularies using an annual subscription to an online survey provider funded by the KEO project. A further study into the equality impact of a long hours' culture is being developed with the Equality Sub-committee of the PFEW to analyse decisions from Employment Tribunals in discrimination claims supported by the PFEW. \nIndirect routes to impact have been important in which participants' and beneficiaries' knowledge and understanding of workload and wellbeing has developed. Through debate and discussion, long hours and difficulties in managing them are increasingly seen as a common and shared problem giving Inspectors the confidence to confide in colleagues and to challenge management requests to overwork. One of the key findings of Time for Justice was the under-recording of concerns over long working hours. In subsequent surveys, both our own (follow-up survey in South Yorkshire in March 2013 and reported in Force Report) and those of others (see Hogget et al 2014), a greater proportion are reporting hours' related ill-health and reporting it within the organisation. \nChange in policy and culture requires getting the attention of Chief Constables. Using evidence uncovered at the KEO workshops, the ICC established a direct dialogue with Chief Constables over hours recording under the WTR, the use of Daily Management Meetings (DMMs) and the long hours culture in policing. Following the first workshop (14th April 2013), the ICC presentation to the Chief Constables Council (23rd April 2013) covered hours of work, recording hours of work, the Working Time Regulation and potential breaches by Forces (revealed in FOI request responses). Each Chief Constable was presented with concrete (visual) evidence of the failings of the Duty Management System (DMS) alongside the nature and extent of long hours worked by its Inspectors. This was followed up with a letter to Sir Hugh Orde (26th June 2013), President of ACPO, requesting a response and a dialogue. https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/working_time_regulations_and_ins?unfold=1#incoming-394029. A letter from the General Secretary of the ICC (9th December 2013) was sent to Chief Constables describing DMMs as a time-consuming and stressful job task with very uncertain operational benefits. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police recently acknowledged a long hours' culture in his Force (Police Oracle 9.13.13) and the Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police has encouraged officers to seek help when they feel stressed at work (Police Oracle 28.11.13). \nOverworking and poor monitoring of hours are not confined to the police service. the project developed a mobile phone App which easily and accurately records hours of work whenever and wherever they are undertaken. This App is available to anyone with a smart phone and can be downloaded from the PFEW website. It was advertised at the Cardiff University Research Fair May 2014 and in a Cardiff University wellbeing blog in November 2014. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
