{"id":"54B4DE81-9527-477B-AA7D-DF78B211AC97","title":"Controlled long-range coherent coupling of solid-state qubits","abstractText":"Information technology has gained importance over the last 20 years due to the improving user-friendliness, capability and affordability of the related hardware and software. Today, the internet is the dominant information source for a majority of society, and is likely to be the dominant way of communication within the next decade. This has revolutionised the way society works, improving efficiency and personal choice. The underlying technology is based on classical computing, which faces fundamental limits of its power consumption dictated by the thermodynamics of the implemented classical algorithms. Quantum computing is seen as the next generation technology to augment classical computing, enabling new types of algorithms for more efficient and rapid processing. \nThis proposal is underpinning this next generation technology. It aims to develop and characterise controlled coherent and incoherent long-range coupling between qubits. The experimental realisation in a quantum dot - optical cavity system integrated with semiconductor technology is one of the promising routes for the implementation of quantum information technology. The physical mechanisms of the coherent coupling researched in this project have however a wide range of importance across physics and biosciences, beyond the specific material system and application investigated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020479/1","grantId":"EP/M020479/1","fundValue":"863236","fundStart":"2015-04-14","fundEnd":"2019-04-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolfgang  Langbein","coPersons":["Egor  Muljarov"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
