To do this, we need to understand what happens when people age, what the major diseases are which affect them and which lead to disability and what we can do to prevent disease and promote good health and function in later life. EPIC-Norfolk is a study of 25,639 men and women aged 40-79 years when it started in 1993 who have contributed detailed information on lifestyle, particularly diet, physical activity, psychosocial factors, and health and who have been followed up to the present. We have already learnt much about how small differences in these factors can influence disease risk and longevity. We wish to continue to follow up this population now aged 55-94 years, to see how their health changes over time. We will be able to examine what characterises individuals who develop conditions such as heart disease, cancers, diabetes, arthritis, lung and bowel diseases and Parkinsons. We will also conduct re-examinations to measure physical, mental, visual and hearing function to identify those who are ageing well and relate these to earlier lifestyles and biological measures. Results will inform the development and testing of interventions, for example, changing physical activity or dietary patterns, that may prevent disease and improve physical or mental function in older people. The detailed biological information from blood samples available in the participants including genetic profiling willl also help us understand the underlying biological mechanisms of disease which may lead to new treatments. This work will help us understand the processes involved in healthy ageing and to understand what we can to promote health and well being in middle and later life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000143","grantId":"G1000143","fundValue":"2127570","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kay-Tee  Khaw","coPersons":["Nicholas John Wareham"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
