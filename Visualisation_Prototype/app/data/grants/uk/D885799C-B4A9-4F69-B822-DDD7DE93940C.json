{"id":"D885799C-B4A9-4F69-B822-DDD7DE93940C","title":"Gait Trainer","abstractText":"The system design carried out by ETB requires information about the needs of the user, and the role of BIME in this is to provide expert guidance about the needs of elderly people in particular. In order to design effective feedback systems the design team need to have information about how different feedback techniques are received by users. This will be explored through compiling a list of possibilities in conjunction with ETB. (A clear contender is the use of modified mobile phones.) The most promising of these wil be constructed in a form that allows testing with users to ascertain their responses. The feedback systems will not be fully working devices, they will just be representations of the user-interface aspects so that these difficult-to-define aspects can be more clearly specified for the ETB designers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G002177/1","grantId":"TS/G002177/1","fundValue":"27003","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Orpwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
