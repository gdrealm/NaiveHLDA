So we use mice in our research, because their immune defences are well defined and fairly similar to ours. \nBy modelling human diseases in laboratory mice, we are gaining important insights into how to harness the potential of our natural resources to fight infections and cancer. \nFor example, we have identified a single gene that regulates the killer cellâ€™s action and protects against viral infections and blood-born cancer. We are now trying to discover how NK cells attack a type of skin cancer known as melanoma. \nBy learning more about how our natural defences work, we will be able to think of more effective cures against infection and cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501150","grantId":"G0501150","fundValue":"312247","fundStart":"2006-07-19","fundEnd":"2009-07-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesco  Colucci","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
