It registers the widespread international reporting of theatrical representations of riotous crowds as specific plays and staging methods were celebrated, banned, and adapted to local conditions in their trans-European migrations. Leading managers in both mainstream and avant garde theatres developed such sophistication in staging methods that 'realistic' crowd scenes became a signature feature of achieved illusionist staging. As the realist enterprise fractured under pressure of economic necessity; the competing medium of cinema, and ideas about the form and function of theatre, new conceptions of the crowd and its staging developed. \nThis is the first study to investigate in detail how crowds were actually represented; the insights their staging allows in to shifting theatre aesthetics, and the ways in which theatre practice reflected or challenged contemporary perception of crowd behaviour. \nArticles, conference papers and a 'gallery', already produced, and the monograph to follow, illustrated from my extensive image-archive, will impact on work in cultural history and the visual arts as well as studies of drama and theatre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112964/1","grantId":"112964/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-28","fundEnd":"2006-07-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean  Chothia","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
