{"id":"D01F6FC4-507B-412B-BF4F-4720EB599B57","title":"Creating a 'Forced Labour Monitoring Group'","abstractText":"The UK has a Low Pay Commission that is responsible for monitoring, and advising on, National Minimum Wage policy. In November 2008 a Fair Employment Enforcement Board was set up to look at issues of workplace exploitation and abuse beyond non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage. However, the Board met for the final time in May 2010 and nothing has replaced it. It is our view that this reflects a failure to monitor, support and protect the UK's most vulnerable - largely temporary and migrant - workers rather than an absence of exploitation and abuse per se. We propose using ESRC follow-on funding to effectively re-gain the impetus that led to the Fair Employment Enforcement Board getting established and, specifically, to set up an independent and multi-stakeholder 'Forced Labour Monitoring Group'. This group would draw together government inspection agencies, policy makers, academics, and representatives from business, the unions and the wider voluntary and community sector. It would also be both virtual (via a website) and face-to-face (via a series of five workshops). We focus on 'forced labour' because it has a basis in UK law. It was made a stand-alone criminal offence under Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) in 2009 and Section 47 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act (Scotland) in 2010. In other words, the Forced Labour Monitoring Group will be directed towards identifying and seeking to prevent specific forms of workplace abuse and exploitation that are now illegal under UK law. Examples of outlawed forced labour practices include: physical or sexual violence (threat of and/or actual harm); restriction on movement; bonded labour; withholding of wages; retention of passports and identity documents; and threat of denunciation to the authorities (ILO, 2005: 20-21). The Forced Labour Monitoring Group would also directly intervene in current policy debates around, amongst other things: the link between immigration policy and forced labour; the future of the different UK government inspection bodies; the future of Legal Aid; and, the future of the Employment Tribunal system. Furthermore, we see the FLMG as a 12-month pilot for a potentially permanent network that could be independent and/ or embedded within government (along the lines of either the Fair Employment Enforcement Board or an All-Party Parliamentary Group).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020567/2","grantId":"ES/J020567/2","fundValue":"25261","fundStart":"2013-09-03","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sam  ScottGary  Craig","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
