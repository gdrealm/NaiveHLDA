In Great Britain over 95% of flocks have approximately 10% of sheep lame at any one time and 80% of this lameness is caused by footrot. There are approximately 1.6 million lame sheep in GB at any time. Footrot is estimated to cost the UK industry &pound;31 million per year and is a huge worry to sheep farmers who do not feel that advice to manage this disease is successful. Footrot is an infectious disease caused by invasion of the skin between the claws of the foot with a bacterium called Dichelobacter nodosus. Surprisingly little is known about how this bacterium causes disease and how it survives (on the sheep or in the environment) when it is not causing disease. Over the past 7 years we have studied practical aspects of control of footrot. The key results were that farmers who treated lame sheep promptly with injectable antibiotics had low levels of lame sheep in their flocks (4% versus 12%) and also that trimming feet (traditionally used to control footrot) was associated with high levels of disease. These facts suggest that the bacteria may be much more widely spread in the environment than previously suspected from research in Australia. We know that the environment plays a role in disease occurrence. D. nodosus survives better in warm wet weather. We also know that there are several strains of the bacterium that can affect the severity of disease. However, we do not know which aspects of the environment or the bacterial strains are important in determining disease severity and persistence on farms. The bacteria may survive in pasture, in the gut or on feet of the non-diseased sheep. During our work we collected a large store of D. nodosus from swabs of sheep with and without disease and also stored bacterial DNA from the feet of sheep. We also have two years data from approximately 800 ewes and their lambs. Every occurrence of lameness has been recorded and investigated and samples taken to investigate whether D. nodosus as present. From these data we can form mathematical models that describe when a sheep became lame, how long she was lame for and factors that influenced the speed with which she recovered and, unfortunately for some, became lame again. The plan of work we propose is to analyse the data above as described and to add in new findings about D. nodosus from laboratory studies into the ability of strains to cause disease and their survival in the environment. Using results from these studies and our models we will be able to work out which strains of D. nodosus cause most disease and how important the environment and host are in their survival. The ultimate aim is to provide better advice on control of footrot and so lower the occurrence of this disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E01870X/1","grantId":"BB/E01870X/1","fundValue":"901721","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Treatment of lame sheep - promotion of better treatment of lame sheep has been widely distributed through England and Wales as part of KE with EBLEX and HCC.\n\nPolicy - the research was used by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee in an Opinion on Lameness in Sheep and target reductions in lameness were set\n\nSociety and education - Results have been used to fund two further studentships Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Laura Elizabeth Green","coPersons":["Elizabeth Margaret Wellington","Graham Francis Medley"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" 1. Hoof horn of sheep grows and wears away in synchrony with the changes in climate. In addition footrot spread between sheep in warmer, wetter weather in the UK but persisted all year, even when temperatures fell to -10 degrees C.\n2. Hoof horn becomes long in sheep after they become lame rather than before as was believed\n3. Prompt treatment of lame sheep reduces variability in hoof horn length\n4. Treating sheep lame with footrot with antibiotics rather than trimming horn led to faster recovery, improved foot conformation and reduced risk of becoming lame again.\n5. Interdigital dermatitis and footrot are two clinical presentations that cause lameness in sheep. Our research demonstrated that both are caused by the one bacteria, Dichelobacter nodosus. By counting the numbers of bacteria (using qPCR) we demonstrated that the numbers increased before each of the disease presentations occurred, indicating that this bacteria caused both disease presentations. A second bacteria, Fusobacterium necrophorum increased in number once footrot had occurred, suggesting that it has a secondary role in disease. \n6. A genetic typing scheme was developed and samples of D. nodosus sent from India, Australia, Scandinavia and the UK were typed. The results suggest that the strains of D. nodosus in the UK and Australia overlap but strains in Scandinavia are more similar to UK strains and strains in India are more similar to Australian strains, suggesting spread of D. nodosus from these two sources.\n7. A metagenomic study of the bacteria on the feet of sheep from three farms was done. The species of bacteria on the feet varied with the disease state of the feet rather than the farm, suggesting that a change in bacterial species occurs as a result of D. nodosus infection and disease.\n8. A gene in D. nodosus linked to causing footrot was investigated and found to vary in its genetic code across strains of footrot. At a global level this variability correlated with the ability of the D. nodosus strain to cause disease. Working closely with EBLEX, HCC and other farmer groups we have produced literature, talks and training for farmers and vets. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
