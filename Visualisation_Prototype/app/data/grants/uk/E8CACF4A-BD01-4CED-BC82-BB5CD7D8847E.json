One way to cure (or kill) an organism is to slow down or stop an enzyme by using a small molecule called an enzyme inhibitor. Enzyme inhibitors have to be very selective (so they only affect the target enzyme) and they have to bind very tightly to that enzyme, so that they are not pushed off by the enzyme's normal substrate. By understanding how to inhibit an enzyme we can often learn something about how the enzyme works. The design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitors is also central to the pharmaceutical industry. Many medicines are enzyme inhibitors e.g. penicillin, pills for high blood pressure etc. So it is not surprising that ways to discover new enzyme inhibitors are very important. In the last ten years the main approach industry has used to find new enzyme inhibitors is to test millions of compounds very quickly to see if promising compounds can be found. These are then modified to be more potent and have the properties they need to be a medicine. However there is now growing interest in a completely different approach to discovering enzyme inhibitors. This involves finding a quite small molecule (called a fragment) that binds to the enzyme, and then using this as an anchor point to build up bigger more potent inhibitors. These 'fragment-based' approaches depend on methods of finding fragments. There are several ways to this, and we propose to use a number of these, some of which are well established and others which are more novel. The methods use techniques including NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. All rely on some way of showing the fragment binds to the enzyme, with the exception of virtual screening, where computational approaches are used to try and identify fragments that look like they should bind to the enzyme. Once we have identified fragments that bind to our target enzymes we will try and grow them into bigger molecules. One general way to do this is to mix a lot of fragments and let them react with each other in every possible combination (called dynamic combinatorial chemistry), and let the enzyme select out the one that binds to it most efficiently. It may be that the enzyme acts as a template to bring together two fragments that bind to it separately. If a lot of enzyme is used, it may lead to more of the key compound that binds to it being formed, allowing this compound to be identified as the major product. A more elegant way to identify the best binding compound, which uses less of the valuable enzyme, is to form the mixture of compounds in the presence of a crystal of the enzyme. If a compound binds to the enzyme, its identity can be deduced by solving the crystal structure of the enzyme with the molecule bound to it. We will devlop these ideas by trying to make inhibitors of two enzymes involved in making vitamin B5 (pantothenate). There is evidence to suggest that inhibitors of these enzymes may be useful against tuberculosis. Another reason to target these enzymes is that they bind molecules called NADPH and ATP, which are also used by other enzymes, so we might learn some useful general information about how to inhibit these other enzymes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D006104/1","grantId":"BB/D006104/1","fundValue":"216625","fundStart":"2006-02-06","fundEnd":"2009-11-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Contribution to knowledge.\nInformed approaches to fragment based drug discovery Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Cultural","person":"Chris  Abell","coPersons":["Alison Gail Smith","Tom  Blundell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" In this project we have used the fragment approach to develop potent inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate synthetase. Initially, NMR spectrosopic screens were used to identify a weakly binding (mM) fragment that bound in the adenine pocket of the active site. This molecule was iteratively grown out to make successively more potent compounds. Subsequent fragment screens identified a second fragment (mM) that bound at a non-overlapping site to the first. Several different linking strategies were explored to give increasingly potent inhibitors. \n\n\n\nThe resultant inhibitors have been shown to inhibit growth of M. tuberculosis (collaboration with NIH, USA) in a target specific manner. In a separate approach have also used dynamic combinatorial approaches using mixed disulfides to identify another family of inhibitors of panthothenate synthase. This approach used thioadenosine as an anchor point, and may be generally applicable to study other ATP-dependent enzymes. \n\n\n\nWe have also initiated a study to using the interligand Overhauser effect to detect simultaneous binding of fragments to pantothenate synthetase by NMR spectroscopy. We have used a variation on the fragment approach to understand the binding of NADPH to ketopantoate reductase. By fragmenting the cofactor and characterising the binding of the resulting fragments we were able to identify and quantify the key binding interactions.\n\n\n\nAll of our studies have involved close synergy between synthetic organic chemistry and structural biology. The research is fundamental science related to fragment based drug discovery. The research is of general interest to the agrochemical, biotech and pharmaceutical industries, and of specific interest to pharma companies targeting reductases. We have established methodology to dissect the interactions between proteins and small molecule ligands, and used this methodology to develop some very promising enzyme inhibitors. This approach is generic and has broad application in studies of macromolecule-ligand interactions Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
