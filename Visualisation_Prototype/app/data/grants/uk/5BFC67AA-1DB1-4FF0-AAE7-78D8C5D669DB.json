The report of these discussions is on the Evidence Network website at <a href=\"http://www.evidencenetwork.org/documents/wp24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.evidencenetwork.org/documents/wp24.pdf</a>. From that work we have synthesised ten draft Principles of Evidence. In the next phase of the research, we are setting up empirical tests of the draft principles, in partnership with UK audit, inspection and scrutiny bodies. The ultimate aim is to enable wider development and application of principles of evidence for accountability in practical and theoretical contexts. We are working with high-level people on the design and development of the demonstration projects. With them we aim to develop their own internal brokers, and to encourage diverse modes of communication for knowledge exchange and transfer, and organisational learning.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0004","grantId":"RES-172-25-0004","fundValue":"14365","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2006-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  Humphrey","coPersons":["Tom  Ling","Ruth  Levitt","W  Solesbury"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
