{"id":"A4E86EC8-B8B9-479E-8A60-6D72DE5284AC","title":"Investigating the role of DNA methylation in human growth disorders","abstractText":"In all our cells our genes which are made up of DNA control normal development into adulthood. The control of these genes affects how well a baby grows in the womb. If a baby is born very small, they can have brain damage and the knock on effects of this poor growth can often affect their health in later life. We have found that modifications called ?epigenetic? changes to the DNA on growth genes can result in poor growth in the womb. Using DNA samples from rare human syndromes with severe growth defects and normal DNA samples from small babies we will study these modifications to their DNA. To do this we will use new and sophisticated technology that can tell us exactly how these ?epigenetic? changes effect growth gene expression. Once we have identified these epigenetic marks we will be able to design biomarkers and diagnostic tests for treatment of the health problems associated with severe fetal growth problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001689","grantId":"G1001689","fundValue":"600480","fundStart":"2011-05-16","fundEnd":"2014-11-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca Jane Oakey","coPersons":["Gudrun  Moore","Reiner  Schulz"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
