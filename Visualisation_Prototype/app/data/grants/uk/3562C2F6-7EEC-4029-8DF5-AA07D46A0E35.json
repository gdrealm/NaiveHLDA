The present project provides a novel solution by using insights from those with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, who are known to excessively monitor (eg, &quot;Did I turn the oven off?&quot;), and apply this to those who don’t monitor their finances.</p>\n\n<p>The research will examine which cognitive factors explain why debtors fail to adequately monitor their debt. Then examine debtors’ attentional biases with debt-related stimuli and how this relates to how they monitor their finances. This information will be used to modify how debtors interact with debt-related stimuli, and quantify its influence on financial behaviours. Finally, this will be applied to the design of a Manage Your Debt Application System (MYDAS) mobile phone intervention which aims to improve how debtors monitor their debt.</p>\n\n<p>This research will have the following implications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li><strong>Science:</strong> By providing an empirical understanding of the thought process of debtors and an intervention to change those thought processes key to debt.</li>\n\n <li><strong>Society:</strong> By providing new tools to identify problem debtors and interventions (MYDAS) the research will benefit debtors (reduce debt), creditors (repayment) and debt agencies.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008986/1","grantId":"ES/K008986/1","fundValue":"230267","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben  Harkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
