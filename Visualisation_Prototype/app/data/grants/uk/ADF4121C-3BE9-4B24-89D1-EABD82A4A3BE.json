Education Policy & public services","person":"Edward Curzon Hall","coPersons":["Nina Jane Morris"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The beneficiaries of these advanced training events for human geography postgraduates in Scotland included, primarily, the students who participated in the event (at the beginning of years 2 and 3 of their PhD), the staff from the university geography units who took part, and the wider policy and other sectors which engaged with the events.\nThe events addressed the discipline-specific needs of postgraduate human geographers, building on the generic and discipline-specific training offered by individual geography units. Indeed, the real strength of the events was that they drew upon the diverse expertise within the six geography units, and so were able to provide a high quality, advanced set of research methods and transferable skills learning beyond what could be offered by one unit. The events provided a range of sessions to develop skills covering the three key elements of the research process - theoretical and conceptual frameworks, matters of methodology, and application and impacts of research - delivered using a set of imaginative and flexible teaching approaches (with an emphasis on interaction and discussion), which were evaluated and revised each year to suit the needs of the particular cohort. The different needs of the two year groups were also taken into consideration in designing the event, with some sessions (e.g. 'role play' of the viva voce, and career options) specifically for those at the beginning of year 3 of PhD, and other sessions (e.g. 'managing your supervisor') targeted at those at beginning of year 2.\nThere was a strong emphasis in the events on developing awareness and skills amongst the postgraduate students attending to reflect on the wider significance of their research, and the ways in which their research outputs can be applied to exert impact on policy and practice within the academic, private, public and voluntary sectors (and more broadly within the general public). This was achieved in a number of ways: first, the attendance of external academic speakers at the events - high-profile UK and international academics (from geography and other disciplines); second, the attendance of speakers from policy and voluntary sectors to talk to and discuss with students ways in which academic research can be effectively applied in 'real world' situations to exert impact on policy and practice; third, sessions on skills to write up and disseminate academic research within a range of contexts, including policy and the public sphere; fourth, sessions on the wider contexts of the funding, dissemination and impact of research. The involvement of speakers (who stayed for a large part of the event) from outside the academic community established strong connections between the students and these organisations. The longer term impact of this is evidenced by the positions gained by past participants (the event is now well enough established for a first, and indeed second, generation of participants to have successfully taken these research skills into the labour market). As well as holding academic positions (e.g. lectureships and research positions), previous beneficiaries of the event are now in non-academic research related positions within a range of organisations (e.g. Scottish Government). \nIn addition, staff attending the event from the six geography units gained an opportunity to meet and network, to discuss and review postgraduate training provision (within individual units and across Scotland), and in many cases forged new research initiatives (e.g. the development of research grant bids, and the delivery of papers at the six universities). In this way, the event formed a central element of the ESRC recognised Consortium (to which 5 PhD Quota Award Studentships were allocated 2008-10) and the wider postgraduate student and staff network of human geographers in Scotland. Further, staff had the opportunity to meet and engage with the visiting UK and international academics, again providing an opportunity to build research links and access new methods of training and learning, and with contributors from the non-academic organisations, providing a mechanism for engagement on research and policy issues and further cementing productive relationships between academia and policy and practice communities. \nThe event now forms a core element of the Human Geography Pathway in the Scottish Doctoral Training Centre.\nIn addition, at the event in 2007, student attendees proposed that a postgraduate network should be established to maintain and build the contacts made at the event, facilitated through email. Further, students suggested that an additional annual one day event should be set up, titled 'Mini-Kindrogan', to bolster the student network. The event is organised and run by students, with a programme of activities, talks, a guest speaker and a social event. This has without doubt strengthened the human geography postgraduate network in Scotland. The Human Geography Pathway (formerly the Scottish Human Geography Postgraduate Consortium) is a model of effective, progressive and innovative (e.g. we had joint supervision arrangements several years before they were considered by the DTC) collaboration between five (formerly six) Geography departments/HEIs. Other DTCs could learn much from how we developed and maintain this collaboration. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
