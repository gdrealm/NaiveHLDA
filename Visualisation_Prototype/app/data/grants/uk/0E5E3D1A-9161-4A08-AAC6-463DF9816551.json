Preventing young people’s substance misuse can be done by improving their knowledge, attitudes and skills, and those of their peers. However, research suggests such approaches are not on their own very effective. Research shows that schools with a more inclusive ethos (i.e. a culture where students feel included and where teachers and students get on well) have lower rates of drug, drink and tobacco use among students. This is not merely a consequence of these schools having different sorts of students in the first place. Studies conducted in other countries indicate that working with schools to improve their ethos can reduce rates of substance misuse among students. We are a team of researchers, with expertise in health and education, collaborating with consultants, with experience running schools. We are trying out such an approach in this country. We want to make sure that this is possible and get an approximate idea of impact in a small-scale project before we move on to attempting a bigger project that would more rigorously look at impact. Our intervention involves consultants going into schools to support them to improve their ethos. Actions in each school are being led by a team of staff and students who use information about what students and staff do and don’t like about the school to inform what actions they take. We will assess whether the intervention seems practical and acceptable by asking the views of staff and students at the school. We will get an initial idea about its impact by surveying year-7 pupils on their views on and use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco before and after the work is done. We will compare their answers to answers from students in similar schools that aren’t involved in the work to improve ethos.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601637","grantId":"G0601637","fundValue":"255379","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Philip Bonell","coPersons":["Ann  Oakley","Vicki  Strange","Tim  Rhodes","Adam  Fletcher"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
