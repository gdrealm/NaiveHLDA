Jane kissed Peter silly.\\n b. Jane ran her Nikes threadbare.\\n(2) a. Jane looked nice.\\n b. Jane seemed nice.\\n(3) a. Jane made the poltergeist destroy the room.\\nb. Jane saw the poltergeist destroy the room.\\n(4) a. Peter tried to be nice.\\n b. Peter seemed to be nice.\\n\\nThe underlined word or phrase is the subject of the italicized word or phrase. The (a) variants are all examples where the underlined element is in a semantic relationship with the main verb, whereas the (b) variants are examples where the underlined word/phrase is not in a direct semantic relationship with the main verb. In the case of (4a) and (4b), this is known as the raising/control distinction.\\n The raising/control distinction is central to a substantial area of grammatical theorising. It raises the question of whether it is possible for the (a) and (b) examples to have the same syntax. Are the non-finite clauses' subjects represented in the same way, or are they treated as different classes of object? In one tradition, it is assumed that in (4a), Peter is co-referential with an unrealized pronoun (PRO) which is the actual subject of to go whereas in (4b) Peter is both the subject of to go and the object of expected. In this account, these differences of analysis are intended to maintain isomorphic relations between syntax and semantics. In an alternative tradition, there is a single syntactic structure, which is mismatched with semantics.\\n The first of these traditions is associated with Principles and Parameters theory, whereas the second tradition is associated with constraint-based theories such as Lexical-Function Grammar and Word Grammar. Recent work (Hornstein, 1999) in the Principles and Parameters tradition has also argued that control involves movement; essentially reducing the differences between (4a) and (4b) to the semantics of their verbs. Although they agree that the differences between (4a) and (4b) are semantic, Jackendoff and Culicover (2003) have argued that there is no movement in these constructions, and that the differences between them fall out of the semantics of the matrix verb.\\n In my project, I also assume that the differences are semantic. But I move beyond a simple semantic account and show that the semantic differences fall out of how semantic relations are linked to syntactic relations such as subject and object; this move establishes semantic similarity across the constructions in (1)-(4), because the same set of semantic relations is shown to be implicated in a range of different construals. This is an advance: existing theories find it hard to establish what (2b) &amp; (4b) have in common. They find it harder yet to see semantic similarities across the full range of patterns in (1-4). My objectives are directed related to the model I am adopting.\\n Construction grammar is a theory or family of theories which assumes that the grammar includes regular, or semi-regular, patterns of association: the units of grammar are not just words, combined by rule into phrases, but are meaningful units of combination at different levels of regularity. That it allows me to explain the meanings of the verbs in terms of their argument-linking behaviour, which permits a simple explanation of the semantic similarities between the different verbs. As a symbolic theory of grammar, it permits a theory where in grammaticalization not only words and classes of words undergo grammaticalization, but also the symbolic associations between them (constructions) may. That is to say, the very adoption of construction grammar constitutes a kind of hypothesis / does the model enable new generalizations that cannot be made in different models? I contend that it does: it allows us to explore both the syntactic and semantic similarities between these different kinds of predicative construction, as well as grammatical change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F004931/1","grantId":"AH/F004931/1","fundValue":"24827","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nikolas  Gisborne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" This project was an investigation into English verbs which take non-finite clausal complements and their history.
