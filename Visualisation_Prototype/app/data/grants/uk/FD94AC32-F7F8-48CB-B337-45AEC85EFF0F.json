{"id":"FD94AC32-F7F8-48CB-B337-45AEC85EFF0F","title":"NETWORK: Semantics of Quantum Computation","abstractText":"Quantum computation (more generally, quantum information processing) hasbecome established as an exciting interdisciplinary research field at theintersection of physics, computer science and mathematics. Computing devicesbased on the laws of quantum physics have the potential to hugely increase ourcapabilities in both algorithmics and cryptography. The former concerns thedesign of efficient techniques for solving computational problems; it ispossible that quantum computers will enable the solution of previouslyintractable problems. The latter is important for secure electroniccommunication; by harnessing quantum effects it is possible to deviseabsolutely secure cryptosystems, unbreakable even by quantum computers.Theoretical computer scientists have recently found several new and excitingways to apply their distinctive techniques to quantum computing; the emphasisis different from previous work on cryptography and algorithm design. Thisactivity includes the design and study of quantum programming languages, tosupport the development of reliable software for quantum computers; thedevelopment of quantum logics to support verification of quantum programs;semantic studies of the foundations of quantum mechanics; semantics-basedanalysis of information flow in quantum protocols; formal specification andverification of quantum cryptographic systems. A substantial portion of thisresearch is taking place in the UK. The purpose of this network is to build onthe existing activity to establish a cohesive community that can develop intoa UK-led international research community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E006833/2","grantId":"EP/E006833/2","fundValue":"31689","fundStart":"2007-11-14","fundEnd":"2010-02-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Mackie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
