{"id":"B76C76B9-5CA3-4FF4-802E-DBA3630BE0C6","title":"Characterisation of the Near-Field Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull Volcanic Plume and its Long-range Influence","abstractText":"The volcanic plume from the Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull eruption has caused significant disruption to air transport across Europe. The regulatory response, ensuring aviation safety, depends on dispersion models. The accuracy of the dispersion predictions depend on the intensity of the eruption, on the model representation of the plume dynamics and the physical properties of the ash and gases in the plume. Better characterisation of these processes and properties will require improved understanding of the near-source plume region. This project will bring to bear observations and modelling in order to achieve more accurate and validated dispersion predictions. The investigation will seek to integrate the volcanological and atmospheric science methods in order to initiate a complete system model of the near-field atmospheric processes. This study will integrate new modelling and insights into the dynamics of the volcanic plume and its gravitational equilibration in the stratified atmosphere, effects of meteorological conditions, physical and chemical behaviour of ash particles and gases, physical and chemical in situ measurements, ground-based remote sensing and satellite remote sensing of the plume with very high resolution numerical computational modelling. When integrated with characterisations of the emissions themselves, the research will lead to enhanced predictive capability. The Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull eruption has now paused. However, all three previous historical eruptions of Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull were followed by eruptions of the much larger Katla volcano. At least two other volcanic systems in Iceland are 'primed' ready to erupt. This project will ensure that the science and organisational lessons learned from the April/May 2010 response to Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull are translated fully into preparedness for a further eruption of any other volcano over the coming years. Overall, the project will (a) complete the analysis of atmospheric data from the April/May eruption, (b) prepaor future observations and forecasting and (c) make additional observations if there is another eruption during within the forthcoming few years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I015604/1","grantId":"NE/I015604/1","fundValue":"444781","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings of this research were used by the Met Office to provide an in situ comparison of ash mass during the Eyafyallajokull ash cloud event and compared very favorably with ground based remote sensing methods. The latter verified Met Office forecasts of the ash clouds.\nSubsequently, the Met Office has been tasked by the Department of Transport to set up a response aircraft in the event of another ash cloud in UK airspace. The work done on the probe verification during this grant has allowed the Met Office to invest in the probe on its response aircraft in the knowledge that similar data inversions can be performed reliably in the future.

We were able to assess the volume of the ash particles from these measurements and, using typically densities of the ash collected from the surface, derive a mass loading from our in situ measurements of the ash cloud during the 2010 Icelandic eruption.\nWe went on to show that these measurements compared well with electron microscope measurements of ash size and hence mass. see impact Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
