We will construct artificial molecular machines in order to study the mechanisms and functions of molecular motors, to understand their physical principles, and to develop new technologies for nanoscale molecular systems. The project is based on techniques for molecular-scale construction using DNA. DNA is a wonderful material with which to build: by exploiting the base-pairing interactions that hold together the DNA double helix, it is possible to control the way in which short, synthetic strands of DNA assemble to form complex three-dimensional objects. It is even possible to make these structures move. We will create all-synthetic molecular motors from DNA, using design principles based on the mechanisms of motor proteins. We will also create hybrid machines consisting of natural motor proteins linked to artificial DNA templates. We will use these structures to perform functions that are inspired by the molecular machinery of the cell and to explore the ways in which motors and their tracks can be designed to interact to create complex structures and movements. This project we will provide career development opportunities and interdisciplinary training in research at the physics / life sciences interface for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G037930/1","grantId":"EP/G037930/1","fundValue":"864318","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our work on the development of dynamic DNA devices and molecular machinery has contributed to a huge growth in the international research community that studies DNA self-assembly. Practical applications of this revolutionary new technology are still just around the corner, but promising directions include molecular manufacture and molecular electronics, drug discovery, drug delivery and structural biology.

We have also created hybrid machines consisting of natural motor proteins linked to artificial DNA templates which can be controlled by molecular signals encoded in short strands of DNA. We are using these structures to perform functions that are inspired by the molecular machinery of the cell and to explore the ways in which motors and their tracks can be designed to interact to create complex structures and movements. We and others are using systems based on synthetic molecular motors as molecular factories that can be programmed to link reactive molecules in defined sequences to create polymers. These have potential for the development of new drugs by selection from large combinatorial libraries. Dynamic DNA devices are also being devloped as 'smart' drug delivery vehicles, capable of carrying cargoes into cells and controlling their release. There is a wide range of exciting research into the construction of functional biomimetic devices and systems, i.e., synthetic biology from the bottom up; molecular motors are the key to the creation of multiscale systems in which molecular components govern structure and function at the micrometre scale and beyond.
