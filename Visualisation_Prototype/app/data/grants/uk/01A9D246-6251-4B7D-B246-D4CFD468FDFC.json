We also know that the process of recovering from depression is often accompanied by greater involvement with family, friends, and wider social groups. In this project, we will use a variety of techniques including functional brain imaging, pharmacology and game-theory to examine the brain mechanisms that allow people to establish stable patterns of reciprocally cooperative behaviour with a variety of social partners. We will investigate the role of a brain chemical called serotonin (which is important in depression) in learning socially supportive relationships. We will also test whether individuals who are at risk for recurring depression show problems in these forms of social learning. The results will help us link biological mechanisms underlying depression to the problems in social function that increase peoples risk of developing the disorder.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700410","grantId":"G0700410","fundValue":"578409","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert David Rogers","coPersons":["Guy  Goodwin","Philip John Cowen"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
