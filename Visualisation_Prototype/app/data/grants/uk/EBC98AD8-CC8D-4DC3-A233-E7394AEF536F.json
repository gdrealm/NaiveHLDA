{"id":"EBC98AD8-CC8D-4DC3-A233-E7394AEF536F","title":"PLATFORM: New directions for intelligent sensors","abstractText":"The present rapid developments in computation, sensor and communication technologies have revolutionised the way in which electronic hardware is now considered. We are living in an era where mass-produced, commercially available components often represent the state-of-the-art. This is in marked contrast to the approach adopted several years ago, where the state-of-the-art was represented almost exclusively in government or military applications. This research programme will tackle four areas of ubiquitous, intelligent sensor systems. The first is aimed at developing human-powered, wearable sensors that are capable of wireless data transmission. The second theme adresses the issue of intelligent prosthetic finger tips, which are capable of imitating the behaviour of those on a human hand. The third area aims to improve the security of automated teller machines through the inclusion of intelligent keypads, which are capable of identifying the validity of the card holder. Finally, we will address wireless sensor networks that are capable of modifying their behaviour to sustain network connectivity by managing localised power sources and message priorities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D042917/1","grantId":"EP/D042917/1","fundValue":"416869","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Perpetuum Ltd. use the work on kinetic energy harvesting and wireless sensor networks in its products.
