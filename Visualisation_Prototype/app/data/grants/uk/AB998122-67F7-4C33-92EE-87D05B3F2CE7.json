A related aim is to explore questions in psycholinguistics that are relevant to dialogue and communication. An important feature of real-world dialogue is that listeners do not have control over how material is presented to them, and they must coordinate the demands of listening and speaking.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0475","grantId":"RES-062-23-0475","fundValue":"337226","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Fernanda  Ferreira","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
