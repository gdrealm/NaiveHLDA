Commitments made\nby the UK government and others to tackle climate change require an expansion in development and deployment of\nrenewable technologies and it is widely recognised that ocean wave energy will play an important role in meeting future\ntargets for the reduction of carbon emissions. Whilst significant advances have been made over the last 35 years in\ndeveloping new ideas aimed towards producing robust and economically viable wave energy converters (WECs) there\nremains no clear consensus on future direction of design and operation of WECs. In addition to supporting existing\nconcepts, it is important that promising new ideas for wave energy conversion continue to be explored. It is widely\naccepted that there are two key elements to a successful WEC design.\nFirst, the design should be driven by fundamental theoretical principles of wave energy absorption as these ultimately\ndetermine the capacity for power conversion. Second, prospective designs must take account of the significant\nengineering challenges that arise when operating in harsh marine environments.\nIn a recent paper &quot;A submerged cylinder wave energy converter&quot; Crowley, Porter &amp; Evans, Journal of Fluid Mechanics,\n2013, vol 716, (hereafter CPE) advocated a WEC design which sought to address these two demands. In particular, the\ndesign was assumed to use an internal power take-off system consisting of a pendulum rotating on a horizontal axis whose\nrotation was damped to produce power.\nSuch a design benefits by its isolation from the marine environment, mechanically robust by relying on few moving parts\nand free from end-stop problems associated with over-excitation of the device. A combination of theoretical and numerical\nresults demonstrated that the device of CPE extracts significant power over a broad range of energy-dense wave periods.\nIndeed, a mean capture factor more than double any existing WEC of its type was predicted.\nThe WITT developed by WITT Limited under whom this TSB grant is being led is closely related to the device conceived in\nthe work of CPE. Instead of a linear device working in surge/pitch modes of motion enclosed within a long cylinder, the\nWITT is a device designed for use in buoys. It not only converts power in surge and pitch modes but also in sway and roll.\nThe WITT has been developed by specialists in gear transmission systems and has been shown to have high efficiency in\nconversion of kinetic to electric power. It is scalable and robust. The project being led by WITT includes partners\nspecialising in mooring systems and marine deployment, power take-off design and manufacture and experimental\nmethods including wave tank testing. In Bristol, the project will develop a theoretical model for the operation of the WITT\nWEC device as a spherical buoy either floating or submerged, to include effect of the mooring lines, the device and its\ninteraction with a model sea state and the internal power take-off system. The work will be based on the earlier work of\nCPE, with changes implemented to account for the revised converter geometry, mooring line configuration and power take-off system.\nAfter verification tests have been completed, an optimisation method will be applied to determine parameters for optimal\npower conversion for WITT WEC devices over a range of physical scales. The work will develop in tandem with other\npartners on the project, in particular in developing the optimal mooring system and through the validation of theoretical\npredictions by the experimental work performed in Southampton. The successful completion of this project will result in a\nset of experimentally-validated theoretical results for a WEC design with the potential to be developed a larger scale and\neventually to full scale commercialisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508652/1","grantId":"EP/N508652/1","fundValue":"48177","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Alan Wilson","coPersons":["Dominic John Taunton","Stuart  Stripling"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
