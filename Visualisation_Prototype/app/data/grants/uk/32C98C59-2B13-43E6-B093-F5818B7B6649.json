The problem of determining the desired correct behaviour for a given input is called the Oracle Problem. Since manual testing is expensive and time consuming there has been a great deal of work on automation and part automation of Software Testing. Unfortunately, it is often impossible to fully automate the process of determining whether the system behaves correctly. This must be performed by a human, and the cost of the effort expended is referred to as the Human Oracle Cost.RE-COST will develop Search-Based Optimisation techniques to attack the Human Oracle Cost problem quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative approach will develop methods and algorithms to both reduce the number of test cases and the evaluation effort per test case. The qualitative approach will develop methods and algorithms that will reduce test case cognition time.The RE-COST project seeks to transform the way that researchers and practitioners think about the problem of Software Test Data Generation. This has the potential to provide a breakthrough in Software Testing, dramatically increasing real world industrial uptake of automated techniques for Software Test Data Generation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010165/1","grantId":"EP/I010165/1","fundValue":"353915","fundStart":"2011-01-03","fundEnd":"2014-01-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project was concerned with the Oracle problem: how do we know what the correct output should be for a program, when it comes to testing the program?\n\nWe demonstrated that spectrum based fault localisation techniques can have no supreme localiser; this means that there can be no ideal approach to fault localisation, that is guaranteed to outperform others. We anticipate this finding will have important ramifications for the field, since many other researchers seek to try and create just such a one size fits all supreme fault localisation equation.

We back this up with a repository of all publications on this topic, which contains over 500 entries.\n\nWe also have results on fourth localisation, which are described under the &quot;narrative impact&quot; section.\n\nWe develop several prototype tools for extraction of realistic test cases, to reduce the human Oracle problem. Work has been picked up and developed by other researchers. The anticipated results on fault localisation will have a profound impact on the demand of this field. \n\nWe believe that the approach we introduced to realistic testing, based on extraction of real test cases from web-based services, will receive significant follow-on attention.\n\nFinally, we also anticipate that the survey paper which is about to appear, will form a foundation for work the development approaches to tackle the Oracle. \n\nThe project only recently completed, and as further evidence of impact emerges, it will be updated and reported upon here.\n\nDue to the foundational nature of this work, it could impact any and all of the sectors listed below, so I have simply ticked &quot;other&quot;.
