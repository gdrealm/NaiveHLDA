Increased life expectancy has not been accompanied by increased healthy lifespan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One way to address the wellbeing of older adults is to communicate the outcomes of relevant research effectively and promptly and engage them with the research process, with the aim of empowering them to maximise their own wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will address this through two activities: an 'AgeWell' conference day about 'Wellbeing in Later Life' for older adults and key end-users, such as charities.&nbsp; This will consist of short presentations about the research methods and relevant project findings from social scientists and health researchers working in later life wellbeing, followed by a seminar on how to find relevant research and evaluate it.&nbsp; Armed with this knowledge about research, older adults will then engage in two-way interaction workshops with researchers planning/conducting ageing research.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The research presented will be from cutting-edge UK researchers on wellbeing research in older adults, and will also include elements of research with ethnic minorities.&nbsp; The conference will be videoed and made available via Internet, and followed by a postal 'AgeWell' newsletter for older adults in the West Midlands area.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H043772/1","grantId":"ES/H043772/1","fundValue":"7422","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  o The conference in particular provided an opportunity for older adults, and end user organisations to become more actively engaged with research findings, and to disseminate new and ongoing research into ageing. It also provided networking opportunities for researchers and research end users to set up longer lasting links for participant involvement in future research design and practice.\no Feedback from the conference from elders showed that it was successful in meeting these goals, and some of the feedback was written into the newsletter. \no Further, a final session of the conference with feedback from the researchers showed that they had found the two-way discussion session very useful in terms of user input to their research, and some went on to change their research protocols for current and future studies on this basis.\no The newsletter provided written feedback and details of relevant research for those unable to attend the conference due to health/disability or transport/location difficulties, thus widening the impact of the conference and of ageing research findings. \no The video was placed on the AgeWell website and provides another feedback opportunity. \no We are continuing to use the newsletters and video to disseminate the research presented at the conference.\no Following the overwhelmingly positive feedback from attendees we have secured funding for AgeWell days annually from 2011 to cover more research relevant to elders and allow for more two-way communication between researchers and participants.

They also provide very valuable input to projects from the participant point of view. We now annually run AgeWell workshops for older adults and would recommend any Ageing research centre to make this valuable connection with their research participants. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
