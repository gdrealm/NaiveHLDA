{"id":"C19400DC-3AFF-4F2B-8F48-A39F1AD7F3D8","title":"Identifying novel pathways and mechanisms that synchronize circadian clocks with the environment","abstractText":"Light and temperature conditions change rhythmically over the course of the day. To improve chances of survival organisms need to know about these changes in advance. Like a wristwatch that enables humans to organize their day, organisms have evolved internal clocks that enable them to tell what time of day it is and to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Circadian clocks are somewhat inaccurate and naturally tend to tick slightly faster or slower compared to the 24-hour rhythm of the day. Therefore, without adjustment circadian clocks will soon be out of synchrony with the environment and indicate the wrong time of day. In the natural world, however, the 24-hour rhythms in light and temperature conditions speed up or slow down the circadian clockwork to exactly 24 hours, such that circadian clocks can remain accurate timers. Although a great deal is now known about the molecules that built the circadian clockwork, our picture of how the circadian clock is synchronized to the real world is still patchy. We propose to identify the molecules and mechanisms that help clocks to synchronize their rhtyhm to that of the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D00988X/1","grantId":"BB/D00988X/1","fundValue":"247462","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this study have not been used outside academia yet but have the potential to do so in the near future due to the recent introduction of VVD in optogenetic applications. Optogenetic tools are increasingly used in basic science but also in biotechnology for the generation of production of biopharmaceuticals. Thus, a detailed understanding of the regulation and activities of these photoreceptors will be necessary to better control synthetic circuits.

The ability to predict these changes with the help of endogenous biological clocks is of advantage to organisms as it helps species to maxmise their chances for survival by adjusting their physiology and behaviour to best suit the time of day. The natural period of circadian clocks is slightly longer or shorter than a 24-hour day so circadian clocks need to adjust their periods to stay in tune with the 24-hour day. Daily rhythms in light and temperature are the main factors that tune circadian clocks to the environment. In this project we discovered that the photosensing molecule VIVID that we previously identified as important for synchronising the Neurospora circadian clock to light-dark cycles, also plays a role in maintaining accurate time in different ambient temperatures. Understanding the activity of molecules involved in light and/or temperature sensing, such as VIVID, can be exploited in the development of light and temperature-regulated switches that can be used to control genetic pathways. Moreover, an understanding of how genetic pathways are buffered against changes in ambient temperature may help to design synthetic pathways that are operative in a wide range of temperatures. The ability to control biological pathways by light and to make them temperature-insensitive will provide a valuable research tool in the dissection of gene function and has potential uses in biotechnology where it can help in pathway control and optimization of yields of biopharmaceuticals, for example.
