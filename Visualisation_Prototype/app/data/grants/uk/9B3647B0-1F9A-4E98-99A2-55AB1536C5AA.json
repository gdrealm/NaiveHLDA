It is the main precursor to the atmospheric oxidants which initiate the degradation of most reactive gases emitted to the atmosphere, and is an important greenhouse gas in its own right. As a consequence of this central role in atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, the capacity to understand, predict and manage tropospheric ozone levels is a key goal for atmospheric science research. This goal is hard to achieve, as ozone is a secondary pollutant, formed in the atmosphere from the complex oxidation of VOCs in the presence of NOx and sunlight, and a combination of in situ chemical processes, deposition and transport govern ozone levels. Uncertainties in all of these factors affect the accuracy of numerical models used to predict current and future ozone levels, and so hinder development of optimal air quality policies to mitigate ozone exposure. The timescale of ozone chemistry leads to it being a transboundary pollutant, requiring international collaboration for both scientific understanding and the development of effective ozone pollution mitigation policies.\n\nThrough ongoing NERC funding, we have developed a novel approach for the direct measurement of local chemical ozone production rates - a capability which avoids limitations inherent in emissions inventories and chemical mechanisms, and which explicitly distinguishes between the chemical and dynamical factors controlling local ozone production. \n\nWithin this IOF project, we will develop a new collaboration with researchers from Mines Douai, Lille - the only other group in Europe with direct ozone production rate measurement capability - in support of exchanging expertise, leading to a formal intercomparison of the two instruments, in order to identify any &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; affecting the measurements differently, and permit an independent evaluation of the measurement accuracy and precision.\n\nWe will then link with leading researchers in the US to perform a novel proof-of-concept demonstration of the application of multiple ozone production rate measurement instruments from different groups together. Within this pump-priming project, we will apply this approach to understand how ozone production varies in different forest types (different tree populations have different emission profiles for volatile organic compounds, which in turn affect ozone chemistry). We will use two locations at the University of Michigan Biological Station, one which reflects the contemporary (primarily deciduous) aspen woodland of the region, and one in which interventions have accelerated the forest succession towards a larger coniferous population (reflecting the anticipated evolution of forest population in this area). By performing simultaneous parallel ozone production rate measurements in these two locations, with all other factors (e.g. background air composition, meteorology) constant, the change in ozone chemistry anticipated from shifting forest tree population may be directly ascertained. \n\nThis concept (combined simultaneous direct ozone production measurements) has scope for application in other scenarios, for example investigating the evolution in ozone chemistry downwind of an emission source (such as a major city), or in a UK context the changing ozone production as polluted European airmasses are advected over the British Isles - events such as the 2003 photochemical smog episode, which are predicted to occur with greater frequency in the future. The final component of this pump-priming project is to initiate a network between researchers with direct ozone production rate measurement capability internationally, in order to facilitate collaborations to apply this concept in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M00581X/1","grantId":"NE/M00581X/1","fundValue":"38145","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-11-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"William  Bloss","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
