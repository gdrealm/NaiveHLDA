The only time when such systems are unavailable to the general public is when they develop a 'pea-green soup' appearance, due to the presence of toxic cyanobacterial mats. These organisms are photosynthetic bacteria which come in many shapes, forms and degrees of toxicity. The ones we are concerned with are those which are non-toxic, but they perform an essential role in freshwater systems, as primary producers, i.e. they convert inorganic carbon (CO2) into organic carbon which is utilised by the rest of the food web. Organic carbon can be excreted by these cyanobacteria as simple sugars, i.e. dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which is utilised by organisms such as bacteria, but they also produce particulate organic carbon (POC), as cellular biomass, which is only available to organisms that predate upon them. To date, the major predators of cyanobacteria have thought to have been the single-celled protozoa, e.g. amoebae, but research in our laboratory has shown that although these protozoa efficiently ingest the cyanobacteria they are not digested and are excreted in a viable form. So the POC within the cyanobacteria are not being transferred along the foodweb, unless something else predates on these photosynthetic organisms. Attention has now turned to the potential role of viruses as the predators of these cyanobacteria, the only trouble is, no viruses have ever been isolated which infect them. Many workers have tried to isolate such viruses, but their attempts have been unsuccessful, but we have recently been successful. However, a painstaking programme of purifying and characterising the viruses must now take place, to provide details (for the first time worldwide) on the most likely predators of these cyanobacteria in situ.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D007372/1","grantId":"NE/D007372/1","fundValue":"34596","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jacqueline Dawn Parry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
