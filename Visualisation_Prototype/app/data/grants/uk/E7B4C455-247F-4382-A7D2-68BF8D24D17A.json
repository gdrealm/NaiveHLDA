There is a worldwide effort to increase the supply or organs, so that more patients can benefit, but this has inevitably involved using some organs that previously were deemed medically unsuitable and these organs have suboptimal function. At the same time, transplanted organs don?t last forever. Instead, many suffer an insidious decline in function. In the case of kidney transplantation, most patients with this ?chronic rejection? eventually return to dialysis. This proposal will investigate whether blood-clotting proteins are involved in the inflammatory processes that cause poor performance and premature failure. There is good reason to think that some members of this family will be involved, because of their roles in other types of inflammation. The work being proposed will be entirely in mice, for three main reasons. First, much is already known about the mechanisms of transplant dysfunction in mice and there are many similarities with the same mechanisms in humans. Second, the use of genetically modified strains will greatly simplify the interpretation of many of the results. Third, we have the necessary expertise and knowledge to perform these experiments in rodents. We believe that this work will show the fundamental roles that members of this family of proteins have in determining how well transplanted organs work and how long they last. Although there are many systemic anticoagulants that inhibit the function of these clotting proteins, current therapies can have severe side effects, including a risk of life-threatening bleeding. Therefore, working out a safe way to inhibit the function of these proteins will be vital if the knowledge gained in this project is to be turned into a therapeutic strategy. Our method, which we?ll be able to test in this work, involves targeting the anticoagulants to exactly the cells or tissues where they are needed, thereby avoiding the potentially dangerous side effects. This might be on the transplanted organ, or might be on recipient cells. Either way, we anticipate that once we?ve established the basis for this strategy, new cell-targeted, protein-based treatments could be made and tested almost immediately, using current technology, for pre-clinical testing. Enhancing the early performance of transplanted organs and preventing premature organ failure will have a significant, immediate and lasting impact on the lives of many thousands of patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401591","grantId":"G0401591","fundValue":"590999","fundStart":"2005-10-03","fundEnd":"2008-10-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Dorling","coPersons":["Robert  Lechler"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
