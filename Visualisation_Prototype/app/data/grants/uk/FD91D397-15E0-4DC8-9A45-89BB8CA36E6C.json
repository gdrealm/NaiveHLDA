{"id":"FD91D397-15E0-4DC8-9A45-89BB8CA36E6C","title":"The circadian clock as a therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis","abstractText":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common, chronic inflammatory disease affecting over 0.6 million people in the UK. At present, there is no cure for RA and an urgent requirement for improved therapeutic options. Inflammation of the joints causes pain and loss of movement, eventually leading to disability. Patients suffering with RA report daily rhythms in symptom severity, with joint pain and stiffness more severe in the morning. Clinical studies have demonstrated that this day-night variation is accompanied by corresponding fluctuations in levels of inflammatory markers detected in the blood. Taken together, this indicates that inflammatory pathways underlying this debilitating condition are more active at specific times of the day. I now show that rhythmic circadian (circa 24h) oscillations in inflammatory markers and joint swelling are robustly replicated in a mouse model of chronic inflammatory arthritis. These observations advocate the involvement of the circadian clock in disease expression, suggesting an exciting new approach to target pathogenic mechanisms. Indeed, I have recently shown that small, drug-like molecules targeting the core clockwork have unexpected anti-inflammatory efficacy in vitro. I now seek to exploit these discoveries with the explicit goal of early clinical translation.\n\nSpecifically, I will address the hypothesis that the circadian clock within the immune system controls disease expression and treatment responsiveness of inflammatory arthritis, and is a valid novel therapeutic target. I will use a well-established pre-clinical mouse model of inflammatory arthritis to track temporal changes in the inflammatory environment within affected joints. Parameters assessed will include: cytokine levels; expression of adhesion molecules; and numbers and activation states of infiltrating leukocytes. This will provide for the first time a complete understanding of how, and to what extent, the clock controls localised immune processes underlying inflammatory arthritis.\n\nSubsequent studies will employ previously validated transgenic mice which lack a functional clock in subsets of immune cells critical to the development of RA (CD4+ T lymphocytes or macrophages). This will provide unique insight into the role of individual cellular timers on disease rhythmicity and disease progression. These studies will define the relative significance of each cell type on the generation of rhythmic inflammatory signals. Further, it is predicted that this work will reveal the critical importance of robust localised clocks in the repressive control of processes underlying inflammatory arthritis, thereby supporting the concept that the clock is a valid target for treatment of this disease. \n\nFinally, I will test the potential of novel clock-acting compounds for the management of inflammatory arthritis. These studies will expand on my prior work, which demonstrated effective anti-inflammatory action of clock activators in joint-derived cells. Ex vivo approaches will be taken to explore compound efficacy and mechanism of action on target cells. In vivo experiments will test efficacy in a pre-clinical model of RA, measuring effects on inflammatory markers, limb swelling and joint histology. Subsequently I will translate my findings to human disease through the application of these compounds to inflammatory cells derived from arthritic patients. These studies will provide proof-of-principle data to support drug targeting of the clock as a new therapeutic avenue for the management of inflammatory arthritis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L018640/1","grantId":"MR/L018640/1","fundValue":"470591","fundStart":"2015-04-06","fundEnd":"2018-09-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie Elizabeth Gibbs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
