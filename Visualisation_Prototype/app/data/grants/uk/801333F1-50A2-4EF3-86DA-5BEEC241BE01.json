{"id":"801333F1-50A2-4EF3-86DA-5BEEC241BE01","title":"Global scale impacts of climate change: a multi-sectoral analysis","abstractText":"Climate policy should be informed by robust and credible information on the impacts of climate change across the global domain; a global perspective also places local and regional impacts in context, and helps identify potential 'hotspots' for further scientific investigation. The project assesses the global-scale impact of climate change using a range of linked impact modules and impact indicators, representing impacts on water resources, flood risk, food production, biodiversity and human health and well-being on land, at the coast, and at sea. The project will synthesise and aggregrate across sectors and regions, using a variety of approaches, and allow the identification of the risks of specific impacts occurring at different rates of climate change. The methodology and results of the project also provide a framework for the assessment of the impacts of defined climate policies. First, it allows detailed geographically-explicit assessments of specific climate scenarios or climate policies, using the suite of linked models. Second, it allows the more rapid assessment of a very large number of climate outcomes (based for example on a probabilistic assessment of the climate effects of an emissions policy) using regionalised functions relating climate impact to indices of climate forcing. The project will be undertaken by a consortium of twelve lead partners, all with international reputations in the field of climate impact assessment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E001874/1","grantId":"NE/E001874/1","fundValue":"102960","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Arnell","coPersons":["Sari  Kovats"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
