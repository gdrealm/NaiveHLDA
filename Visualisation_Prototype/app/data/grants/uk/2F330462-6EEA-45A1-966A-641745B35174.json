In order to understand rates of environmental and climatic change, and compare findings from different sedimentary sources accurate dating of these sequences is fundametal. Currently most lake sediment sequences are dated by radiocarbon. These dates can be subject to relatively large errors and dating different material can give different ages. Thus these uncertainties are carried forward into interpretation of the environmental reconstructions. We aim to reduce these uncertainties. Radiocarbon dating most lake sediments is problematic due to old carbon entering the lake from surrounding soils. We therefore need to find a method whereby this is minimised or eliminated entirely. One potential method which gets round this problem is to radiocarbon date chironomid (non-biting midge) larval head capsules. Chironomid larvae are often the dominant bottom living invertebrates (after oligochaetes) present in freshwater ecosystems. The head capsules are made from a robust polymer called chitin, and are preserved in lake sediments. Two previous studies have shown that by radiocarbon dating chironomid head capsules, and comparing this to dating the organic lake mud, younger dates are produced by the chironomids. This suggests that the organic mud contains old carbon, and therefore that the chironomid dates are more accurate. However, as yet no tests have been undertaken on this hypothesis. We aim to radiocarbon date samples of chironomid head capsules from a range of recent Icelandic lake sediments of known age including both a chitosan extract (recently developed) from head capsules and the whole head capsules (bulk chitin) themselves. We will then assess the radiocarbon concentrations of the samples, and attempt to match them to known atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations from the recent past, a period with a very clear radiocarbon 'spike' due to bomb testing. This will allow us to test the accuracy of using chironomids as a dating tool, i.e. how well their radiocarbon concentration (age) matches when they died and became incorporated into the lake sediment. If this accuracy can be demonstrated then it means by dating the chironomids we can tell excactly when changes indicated by other material in the lake sediments were taking place. The results from these analyses will allow us to examine (1) Whether either the chitosan extract or bulk chitin samples provide accurate age estimates when compared to their known age; (2) Whether the chitosan extracts are always younger than the bulk extracts, highlighting (as yet unknown) dating errors arising from reliance on bulk chitin samples; (3) The likely value of chironomid dating against other forms of radiocarbon dating for lake sediments. It is hypothesised that careful dating using these new protocols will provide an important innovative approach to deriving chronologies from a wide range of sedimentary archives, many of which are at present difficult to date.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D007828/1","grantId":"NE/D007828/1","fundValue":"34449","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Langdon","coPersons":["Christopher John Caseldine","Thomas  Higham"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" We found that dating of chironomid head capsules can provide accurate C-14 dates, but equally, on our Icelandic test sites, they can also provide clearly erroneous dates. One way in which these results can be explained is through a substantial freshwater reservoir effect. Differential uptake of carbon within a food-web may explain this. Some animals may partially exchange with atmospheric CO2 while others do not, and may exchange with dissolved inorganic carbon within the lake (showing older ages). It all depends where organisms feed in the food-web and on what. Crucially, chironomids have a variety of feeding mechanisms from filter feeders to scrapers and predators. In order to test this theory we will aim to date a range of modern organisms (plants and animals) from the lakes, including chironomids with different feeding strategies. This should help us determine whether our explanation is correct or not. This work is ongoing.
