This conference focuses on networked sensing systems and their use in building human-centric smart surroundings and context aware systems (www.eurossc.org). This conference is a key annual European event, held in the UK for the first time. The first EuroSSC conference in 2006 attracted over 100 participants from academia, industry and government organisations, with a similar number expected this year. Building on the success of the previous conference, EuroSSC 2007 will include a highly selective single-track program of technical papers, accompanied by posters, demonstrations, and invited speakers. With the help of this EPSRC workshop grant we will attract renowned international keynote speakers and support UK-based EPSRC-funded PhD students who are keen to contribute to the conference but lack the financial resources to attend. By supporting this conference it will be ensured that the UK is playing a key-role in the development of this research area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F034156/1","grantId":"EP/F034156/1","fundValue":"6269","fundStart":"2007-10-23","fundEnd":"2007-12-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerd  Kortuem","coPersons":["Utz  Roedig","Joseph  Finney"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
