{"id":"6D43F0B6-9E60-4CB8-AC26-D55BC5FF0E30","title":"An International Collaboratory on Critical Methods in Security Studies","abstractText":"<p>We live in times of great insecurity, not necessarily in the sense that our lives are under greater threat but in the sense that security language and technology has become a central part of everyday life and politics. To understand the significance of these changes, security studies have developed innovative concepts and theories that analyse the social and political processes of constructing insecurities and its consequences. Nonetheless, these critical approaches to security have been quite weak on turning their conceptual and theoretical innovations into methodological inquiry that would consider how particular methods impact upon the object of research.</p>\n\n<p>The Network addresses such lacunae by developing an international collaborative capacity in critical methods for security studies. The network is organiSed in five clusters:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>visuality</li>\n\n <li>mapping</li>\n\n <li>discourses and materialities</li>\n\n <li>situated knowledge</li>\n\n <li>genealogies, histories, time.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Network combines workshops and conference panels with a virtual Collaboratory - http://www8.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/iccm/ - using interactive web-based tools such as blogs, wikis, forums and virtual meetings. The Collaboratory is not just a laboratory on methods, but also a method of collaboration. The Network emphasises the importance of collaborative ways of working in response to the dominantly individualised working practices in social sciences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-810-21-0072","grantId":"RES-810-21-0072","fundValue":"31974","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jef  Huysmans","coPersons":["Claudia Elena Aradau","Andrew William Neal","Nadine  Voelkner","Stefan  Elbe"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
