{"id":"AE870F37-2717-4CE0-850E-F34986ADCD8E","title":"Coupling of Real-World Data and Fast Response Algorithms to Improve Simulation Correlations and Optimise Construction","abstractText":"The project will develop and deploy MODSUITE within the Caterpillar UK Engines Company Ltd. (CAT). MODSUITE is a\nnovel data analysis and optimisation tool and will be applied to analyse engine and machine test data against predictive\nphysics-based models of the processes occurring within the engine. The tool will apply novel optimisation and fastresponse\nalgorithms to systematically refine and quantify the uncertainty within the models. This will enable CAT to use the\nmake more effective use of the data and use the models to help optimise engine performance, including gaseous and\nparticulate (soot) emissions.\nThe project is split between four main partners. The Computational Modelling (CoMo) Group at the University of Cambridge\nwill perform the fundamental research and development required to apply MODSUITE to the applications presented by\nCAT. Cambridge Computational Modelling Ltd. (CMCL), an engineering software and services company, will focus on\ndeveloping a user interface and testing the application of the software. CAT and BorgWarner Ltd. (see\nwww.borgwarner.com) will provide experimental data and models for real applications to support the software testing.\nFederal Mogul Ltd. (see www.federalmogul.com) will act as a subcontractor to CAT for some of the model development.\nThe software will be developed and tested using three demonstration applications, at increasing levels of system\ncomplexity. The initial phase of the project will be performed at CMCL facilities in Cambridge. Following successful\ncompletion of the initial testing, the software will be deployed at CAT via an internet based user interface. This will enable\nthe software to be run at CMCL whilst it is still in development, whereas the application models will be run at CAT using\ndistributed computing technology, allowing CAT to harness the large computing resource at their disposal and maintain\ncontrol over the models and data. The web-based interface and distributed computing design offer a simple, but powerful\nsolution.\nThe CoMo Group will initially contribute to the project by investigating optimisation methods that are not currently\nimplemented within MODSUITE. The ones that are most relevant to the applications presented by CAT will be identified\nand added. The group will extend MODSUITE so that it can automatically read and process the large quantities of\nexperimental data made available by CAT, facilitating the creation of data driven models. A wider range of different\nresponse surface methods and an automated response generation and selection method will be investigated and\nimplemented. This will increase the versatility of the tool such that suitable response surfaces can be generated for each\nspecific test application. These improvements will facilitate the ability to generate suitable data driven models as well as\nfast surrogate models. Advanced optimisation methods will be developed with a focus on self-calibration and robustness to\nprovide consistent and reliable results without the need for expert knowledge of the specific algorithms. These advanced\nalgorithms will be combined with uncertainty propagation and analysis tools to quantify the uncertainties in the model. The\nMODSUITE code will be adapted to allow it to run over a distributed computing system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J501736/1","grantId":"EP/J501736/1","fundValue":"231101","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  All of the developed and published algorithms have been taken up by a spin-off company which has implemented them into their commercial product.
