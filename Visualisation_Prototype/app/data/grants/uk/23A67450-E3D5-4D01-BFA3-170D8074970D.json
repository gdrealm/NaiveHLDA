Whilst seizures in most patients with epilepsy are well controlled with antiepileptic drugs, for about 30% of patients, these drugs fail to control seizures. Even for patients whose seizures are controlled with drugs, the drugs do not control all the problems of epilepsy and have side effects. New, rational treatments are required. Rational therapies demand better understanding of the causes and consequences of epilepsy and seizures. Some animal models can provide important information, but no animal model exactly mirrors human epilepsies.\nThe epilepsies are brain diseases: better understanding requires study of the brain. Some patients with epilepsy unresponsive to drugs have brain surgery as treatment: the part of the brain causing seizures is removed surgically. Usually, this stops seizures. It also provides an opportunity to examine the part of the brain causing seizures, using microscopy and sophisticated molecular tests. However, only one part of the brain can be studied, and it is usually impossible to say whether abnormalities found are the cause or the consequence of the epilepsy. Worse still, the part removed often is incomplete. Only brain tissue from some epilepsies can be studied, as only certain patients have surgery. So although we need to study brain tissue, most available tissue has some limitations in its usefulness ? though it has undoubtedly contributed to current understanding.\nBefore MRI and surgery became widespread, study of brain tissue from patients with epilepsy obtained after their death was the main source of information. Though unfashionable, post-mortem study offers major advantages: all of the brain can be studied, permitting comparisons in the same brain between parts causing epilepsy and those that do not; parts of the brain involved in epilepsy but unavailable from surgery can be studied; causes of epilepsy for which surgery is not undertaken can be studied. These, and other factors, mean that important questions can be answered using post-mortem tissue that cannot be answered in humans in any other way. \nWe have a large collection of post-mortem brains from patients with epilepsy, all consented for research, either in advance by the patients, or after death by next-of-kin. In each case, next-of-kin were consulted for permission. This tissue is invaluable in what it could reveal to us about epilepsy. We will use modern neuropathological methods to examine this precious resource and improve understanding of epilepsy for the benefit of patients with epilepsy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600934","grantId":"G0600934","fundValue":"483818","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sanjay  Sisodiya","coPersons":["Maria  Thom","David  Goldstein","Peter B Crino"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
