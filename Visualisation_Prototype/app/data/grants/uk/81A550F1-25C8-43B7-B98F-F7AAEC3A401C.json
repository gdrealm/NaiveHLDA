Worldwide, there is a huge research and development investment in these materials and companies involved in their use and production have a turnover of billions of pounds in total. They are being used in a variety of products such as cosmetics, weather proofing, computers and remediation of contaminated land. Great concern is being shown over their potential human and environmental health effects although our knowledge is very limited. This project will allow the formation of a network of people and institutions with relevant expertise and knowlegde to disseminate and transfer current knowledge and best practice between academia, regulatory agencies and industry and between experts and early stage researchers and to identify current and future research needs and facilitate future interdisciplinary research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E002889/1","grantId":"NE/E002889/1","fundValue":"128947","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2010-09-23","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Lead","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
