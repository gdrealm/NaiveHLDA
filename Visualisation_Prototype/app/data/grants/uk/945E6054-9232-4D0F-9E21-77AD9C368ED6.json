Over the forthcoming Census Programme period (2006-2011), the aim is to transform CIDS into a Centre for Interaction Data Estimation and Research (CIDER). This will involve continuation of the provision of a high quality service that delivers census-based interaction data to the academic user community but it will also involve updating, improving and developing the WICID system and user interface given the increasing number of data sets and geographies that the system contains. As well as the work that will be carried out on the estimation of further UK census based data sets and their inclusion in WICID, a new system prototype will be created that will include a number of important UK non-census-based data sets. The CIDER team will continue its ongoing provision of training and research, upgrading of system documentation and dissemination of information through papers and presentations. CIDER will support preparations for the 2011 Census and prepare for incorporating the 2011 interaction data sets into WICID.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-348-25-0005","grantId":"RES-348-25-0005","fundValue":"521138","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Development of a web-based interface to census interaction data (WICID).
