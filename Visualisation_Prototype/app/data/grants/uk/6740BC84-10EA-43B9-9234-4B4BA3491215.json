{"id":"6740BC84-10EA-43B9-9234-4B4BA3491215","title":"A Rolling Programme in Space and Planetary Physics","abstractText":"The work to be carried out in this rolling programme will be carried out in 3 separate and related areas. The first two areas cover gaining an understanding the physics of the variety of plasmas in our solar system. The third area consists of space instrumentation which designs and builds the instruments which make the measurements in space which enables us to interpret and understand these environments. Observing plasma processes out in space provides us with a way to study the fundamental processes that occur in both laboratory plasmas and astrophysical ones which are not as easy to measure. We wish to understand how the sun affects the Earth, what the origins and properties of the energetic particles are which reach the Earth, how the Sun influences the variety of bodies in our solar system, their atmospheres and their nearby plasma environments and how those bodies in turn affect the environment around them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001076/1","grantId":"PP/E001076/1","fundValue":"3449330","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michele K Dougherty","coPersons":["Ingo  Mueller-Wodarg","Robert Janis  Forsyth","Timothy Simon Horbury","Elizabeth  Lucek","Christopher Michael Carr","Peter  Cargill","Marina  Galand","Steven J Schwartz"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
