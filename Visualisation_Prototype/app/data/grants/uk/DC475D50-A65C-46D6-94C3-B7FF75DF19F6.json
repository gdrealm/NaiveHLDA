Myelin is a fatty substance that wraps around long projections (axons) of nerves to allow rapid conduction of nerve signals and also plays a protective role for axons. Myelination, the process of sheathing axons with myelin, is a very active process early in life but continues well into later life. Remyelination is a natural regenerative process that replaces damaged myelin but ageing impairs the efficiency of remyelination in the CNS which can lead to neurological impairment with age. Thus, it is imperative that we understand this process of CNS repair in detail. \n\nTraditionally it was thought that the CNS was immune-privileged and that immune cells usually only entered the CNS during disease. However, in the past 5-10 years we have learned a great deal about how the immune system supports a wide range of basic functions of the CNS. In particular, a subset of immune cells called T cells have been shown to support neurological functions such as learning, memory and CNS repair. Other immune cells have also been shown to support remyelination, however, little is known about the role of T cells in this process. Interestingly, T cell function also declines with age and results in increased susceptibility to infection, cancer and decreased responses to vaccines. There has been one study that showed that deficiency of T cells impairs remyelination. However, T cells comprise a wide range of different subsets, each of which exert different, and often opposing, effects. We hypothesise that these different T cell subsets differentially influence CNS remyelination and that ageing of the T cells impairs remyelination in older individuals. \n\nTo test this hypothesis we have established a new 3-D model of CNS remyelination in thin slices of brain tissue in a dish. In the first part of the study we will generate four different T cell subsets and add each population to a set of remyelinating brain slices to test what impact each subset has on CNS remyelination. T cells will be added to the solution the brain slice is cultured in and also directly onto the slice so that T cells can migrate into the CNS tissue. In this manner we can test if the effect of T cells on remyelination requires close contact with the area being remyelinated. In the next part of the study we will compare the effect of young and old T cells on remyelination to determine if ageing impacts the influence of T cells on remyelination. In the final part of the study we will introduce other types of immune cells to the remyelinating brain slice at the same time as the T cells to identify if T cells utilise other immune cells to influence remyelination in the CNS.\n\nThe outcomes of this study will include new knowledge of how the immune system, and T cells in particular, influence remyelination in the CNS. We will also learn a great about how ageing affects the ability of T cells to access the CNS and participate in CNS functions. Given the profound neurological impairments that can accompany ageing, and our growing aged population, is it imperative that we understand how normal CNS functions become impaired with age. This project will address a fundamental question of how the impairment of the immune system with age can have consequential negative effects on normal neurological function. Another outcome of this study will be further development of our new model of immune cell- neural cell communication which can be adopted by a multitude of scientists study a range of topics in neuroscience and immunology. Knowledge from this project may be taken forward to identify strategies to preserve remyelination, and thus neurological function, during ageing and as such, this project holds potential to impact a very large proportion of society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J01026X/1","grantId":"BB/J01026X/1","fundValue":"424591","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Denise  Fitzgerald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
