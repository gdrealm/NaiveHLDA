A multidisciplinary team spanning Engineering, Science and Medical Faculties in Nottingham, in collaboration with 4 leading international groups has combined to realise the vision of materials discovery in 3D. Without this leap beyond 2D screening methodologies we will miss new advanced materials because they omit architecture and often poorly represent the in vivo environment. The aim is to allow us to move beyond the existing limited range of generic bioresorbable polymeric drug and cell delivery agents currently licensed for use in man and medical device polymers, to bespoke materials identified to function optimally for specific applications. \n\nWe know that defining chemistry, stiffness, topography and shape can control the response of cells to materials. This programme will focus on producing and testing large libraries of these attributes in the form of patterned surfaces, particles and more complex architectures. New materials will be identified for application in the areas of targeted drug delivery, regenerative medicine and advanced materials for next generation medical devices. \n\nThe 3D screening methods will define a new landscape in biomaterials discovery and create the platforms through which more effective advanced materials will be discovered. Our three ambitious application focussed areas provide high impact examples in which our biomaterials leads are developed towards exploitation in the clinic. These downstream projects will be carried out in both academic and commercial research programmes funded through partnering, licensing and formation of spin-outs as appropriate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N006615/1","grantId":"EP/N006615/1","fundValue":"5365960","fundStart":"2015-11-09","fundEnd":"2020-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Morgan Russell Alexander","coPersons":["Anna Maria  Grabowska","Martyn  Davies","Chris  Denning","Ricky Darren Wildman","Derek John Irvine","Paul  Williams","Kevin  Shakesheff","Richard James Mackenzie Hague","Amir Mehrdad Ghaemmaghami","Cameron  Alexander"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
