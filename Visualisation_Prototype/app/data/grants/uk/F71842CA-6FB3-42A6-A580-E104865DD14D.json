A particularly fascinating prospect is the achievement of an optical analogue of the electronic transistor, which forms the building block of our computers. Our approach involves a nanoscale version of a radiowave antenna, the plasmonic nanoantenna. Plasmonic antennas are designed to overcome the diffraction limit of light and to focus light into a nanometer-sized antenna 'feed' gap. \n\nIn our first studies supported by EPSRC we have proposed a variety of devices exploiting hybrid interactions of a nanoantenna with an active substrate. Here, we aim to launch a full-scale investigation of such hybrid antenna devices including various geometries and metal oxide substrates, where the plasmonic antenna will be exploited as a nanoscale sensitizer for the active substrate. Integration of a nanoantenna switches with a nanoelectronic transistor will yield a new class of optoelectronic devices: the nanoantenna MOSFET.\n\nThe proposed optically and electrically controlled nanoantenna devices are of enormous interest as a bridge for on-chip control of electrical and optical information. In addition, ultrafast active control of local fields and antenna radiation patterns will enable new applications in nonlinear optics, Raman sensors, and optical quantum information technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J011797/1","grantId":"EP/J011797/1","fundValue":"485881","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Impact has been generated through training of postgraduate researchers and associated undergraduate research projects.

Plasmons are basically collective electron oscillations that are excited (or &quot;driven&quot;) by light of a certain frequency. These plasmon resonances are widely tunable depending on the size, shape and material of the nanoparticles that are used. \n\nIn 2011, we were first able to explain the hybrid response of a gold nanoantenna consisting of two closely coupled nanorods positioned on an ITO substrate by suggesting a mechanism of hot electron injection from the antennas into the surrounding medium up to approx. 100 nm, which then lead to an increase in mobility of the electrons there and further migration of carriers.\n\nIn this project, we have designed plasmonic devices where we can take advantage of this mechanism with the additional benefit of separating heat generated in the system and the purely ultrafast response. We have demonstrated picosecond optical control in antenna arrays, mediated by the local enhancements of electromagnetic fields in the nanostructure.\n\nIn addition, we are developing routes toward electrical switching of plasmonic devices, using field-effect transistors commonly found in silicon electronic chips. Progress is being made toward on-chip ultracompact devices for controlling light, which will find use in next generation light-based information technologies. Important next steps include further optimization of device efficiency, including reduction of scattering and absorption losses, modulation contrast, and integration with silicon (CMOS) technology.
