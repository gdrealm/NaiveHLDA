{"id":"AA7239B8-29FF-476D-A5F8-8CB9995D7230","title":"Holistic Frameworks &amp; Tools for Sustainable Energy Efficiency in Networked Home Appliances","abstractText":"The project aims to formulate an open framework with an integrated approach (e.g. aggregated views on energy usage, cost, efficiency and environmental impact for domestic appliances) to provide ambient active support to operate networked home appliances &amp; other home systems (e.g. heating) in the most energy-efficient way via an Ambient Intelligent control network. The drivers in mind being choice and mass customisation for creating an Ambient &amp; Proactive integrated domestic energy management system (DEMS) to maximise and sustain energy conservation in the home environment, it will also provide the right level of energy information for householders to influence their attitude towards energy usage. The innovation of the project is in devising an holistic approach to the use and integration of ICT with emerging technologies, to facilitate the realisation of an integrated DEMS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010733/1","grantId":"DT/E010733/1","fundValue":"295404","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chi Biu Wong","coPersons":["Philip Ronald Moore"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
