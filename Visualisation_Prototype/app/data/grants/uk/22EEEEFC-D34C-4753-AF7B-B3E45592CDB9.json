{"id":"22EEEEFC-D34C-4753-AF7B-B3E45592CDB9","title":"A tissue engineering approach to reduce animal use in renal development and renal organ replacement technology","abstractText":"Kidney disease is a major cause of suffering worldwide and treating it is a great drain on the resources of healthcare systems such as the NHS. This is because kidneys are not capable of repairing many types of defect. There is therefore a great deal of research, in the UK, USA and Europe, aimed at finding ways to repair damaged kidneys or to grow new ones. It is clear, though, that we have to understand more about how kidneys form in the first place, when a human is still in the womb, before we know enough to build or rebuild them in the lab or the clinic. Research into how kidneys grow currently uses animals, either in fully animal-based experiments or in test-tube experiments that use the kidneys of freshly-killed animal embryos. The test-tube technique is useful, but still quite limited. This project aims to produce cells that can be grown in the lab indefinitely, and combined together to produce emrbyo kidneys in the test tube without any animals being needed. It will not only greatly reduce the use of animals in this type of research, which is the main point - it will also provide a system in which doing experiments is much quicker, easier and cheaper,. It will therefore speed along the pace of discovery in this area of research so important to human medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700480/1","grantId":"G0700480/1","fundValue":"364036","fundStart":"2008-03-10","fundEnd":"2011-09-09","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
