It has been estimated that around 2% of the human genome is dedicated to glyco-active enzymes (up to 6% in plants) and that over 70% of all proteins in man are glycosylated. In turn this has led to a need for analysis of larger numbers of glycan structures, and their cognate binding proteins, which has provided the impetus for the development of new technologies with high-throughput potential. Latterly, glycoscientists have identified carbohydrate microarrays (glycoarrays) as a key tool for the high-throughput studies that are necessary to understand this complex area of biology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate new methods with which to analyse carbohydrate-active enzymes based on integrated, chip-based surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy-mass spectrometry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024685/1","grantId":"BB/G024685/1","fundValue":"4594","fundStart":"2009-11-26","fundEnd":"2010-06-25","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabine  Flitsch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
