Appearance of protein in the urine can be an early sign of kidney disease and has also been found to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Normally, two specialised types of kidney cell prevent leakage of protein into the urine. Previously it has been difficult to study these cells in the laboratory because human cells could only be obtained in small numbers and were difficult to keep alive. Therefore, most previous work on this subject has relied on animal experiments. We have developed a way of keeping the relevant human cells alive in the laboratory. We will use these cells to study the ways in which leakage of protein is prevented in the healthy sitation, what goes wrong in disease, and the ways in which this can be reversed or prevented. Our ultimate aim is to develop ways of detecting and treating early kidney and heart disease. These conditions are extremely costly to treat and currently they are often not detected until advanced damage has occurred. Prevention is better than cure!","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500053","grantId":"G0500053","fundValue":"585340","fundStart":"2005-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Mathieson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
