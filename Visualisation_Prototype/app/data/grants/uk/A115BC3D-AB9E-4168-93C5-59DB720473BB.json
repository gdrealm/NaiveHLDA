{"id":"A115BC3D-AB9E-4168-93C5-59DB720473BB","title":"Buddhist Death Rituals of Southeast Asia and China","abstractText":"Summary\\n\\nIndividual scholars connected with the Centre for Buddhist Studies in Bristol have shown an interest in death related topics in the various Buddhist traditions (Tibetan, Sri Lankan and Chinese). This research has raised particular questions which the project will address in two independent but complementary studies: a postdoctoral research project on Buddhist death rituals in Southeast Asia and a doctoral research project on Chinese Buddhist death rituals. The three main areas of research within the study will be:\\n\\n1. Common Core of Theravada Buddhist Rituals\\nDo the Theravada countries of S and SE Asia have more in common than the use of a sacred language (Pali) and reliance on Pali canonical texts? Is there a shared set of death rituals?\\n\\n2. Relationship of Monks and Laymen\\nWhat is the nature of the interaction between monks and laity in the context of death? What is the impact of issues, such as financial costs and the fact that monks act as mediators between the living and the dead on this relationship.\\n\\n3. Interdependence of Text and Ritual\\nThe texts commonly recited in the context of death rituals are composed in Pali, an ancient language which is not generally understood by those participating in the rituals. Does that mean that the content is lost on the listeners? What function do the recitations have? What is the relationship between ritual practice and Theravada doctrine?\\n\\nWhile a certain amount of research has been completed, particularly by French scholars such as Bizot, Gabaude, etc. most of this is either dated or deals with death rituals only in passing. Moreover, these studies are either characterised by a particular approach (ethnographic, textual, etc.) or focus on a particular country (either Sri Lanka or Thailand, etc.). Our project will take a much broader view, bringing together a range of perspectives from different academic disciplines and from different Buddhist countries.\\nOur research methods, too, are multidisciplinary and combine field work methods (participant observation, interviews, etc.) with textual study. The latter will be employed in defining and interpreting the nature and use of Pali texts in SE Asia and Sri Lanka.\\nThe project management combines scholars of different background and expertise: Prof. Paul Williams, Director of the CBS and Prime Investigator and project leader, is an established Buddhist scholar with a broad knowledge of various Buddhist traditions and editing experience. He will oversee the study and bring together the different strands of research. Dr. John Kieschnick (Co-Investigator) has published on the impact of Buddhism on Chinese culture. He will assist the PI and supervise the PhD student. Dr. Rita Langer, a trained Indologist with philological expertise and field work experience, has published in the area of Buddhist death rituals. She will be the Research Assistant for the area of Southeast Asian Buddhist rituals. Finally, a PhD student working on Chinese Buddhist death rites would complement the study of Southeast Asian ritual.\\nThe plans for dissemination of the project findings are varied. Firstly, the material will be presented at two academic conferences and published as a collection of articles in the form of an edited book. And secondly, an exhibition will reach out to a wider audience and the chosen media (images and video films) will make the material easily accessible.\\nIn conclusion it should be added that the project is conceived of as a collaborative venture for the CBS. Colleagues, research fellows and PhD students are working together to contribute from their various fields of expertise to an in-depth and multi-faceted understanding of the dynamics of Buddhist death rites. The network of international connections which the CBS has over the past years built up will maximize efficiency while limiting the costs in the field. We are confident that the project will be a success and represent value for money.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D001455/1","grantId":"AH/D001455/1","fundValue":"300413","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project exhibition, Ancestors and Hungry Ghosts, attracted a large non-academic audience during its three week showing in a Bristol gallery. The film screenings in Bristol and in Hamburg were attended by many members of the public as well as academics from those institutions. It has therefore already been demonstrated that these research outcomes have an appeal and value for people outside academia. In addition, we were approached by a Thai Buddhist temple group in the Midlands who wanted to show material from the project at an event they were holding at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Although outside the project dates, this offered an opportunity to show one of the documentary films and a digital version of the photography exhibition and suggests a potential market for future uses of the research material.\nThe project website also presents material for the general public as well as for other academics and teachers.

This material is now available to other researchers in a variety of forms and we have already been approached by a Korean researcher who is intending to work on a similar topic. His awareness of the work produced as part of this project suggests we have established an international reputation in this academic subject area. Findings from the research have already been utilised in teaching undergraduate students at the University of Bristol and this has contributed to our growing status as an institutional centre of knowledge on the topic of death within Buddhism. The project has produced information and materials for future research in a number of disciplines including Buddhist studies, material culture studies, and anthropology. The Understanding Buddhist Death Project has used contemporary research to create resources for chaplains, teachers and students. Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
