For instance, the Tyne Estuary in the North of England is heavily polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and recent studies demonstrated ecotoxicological effects in fish, e.g. flounder and eels. The EU water framework directive lists PAHs as priority substances in the field of water policy because of their carcinogenic potency.Natural processes such as the microbial break-down and the strong adsorption of pollutants like PAHs to certain sediment constituents (e.g. carbonaceous particles) can reduce the ecotoxicity of polluted sediment significantly. However, the limited availability of nutrients and oxygen, the formation of ecotoxic products from microbial break-down, a limited number of strong sorption sites in natural sediment, and slow mass transfer of pollutants from weak sorbents to microorganisms or strong sorbents may impede a natural recovery. It is thus proposed to devise a low-cost engineering system in which natural processes leading to a sediment recovery can be enhanced in a controlled setting.Tidal energy will be exploited to agitate the sediment and replenish it with nutrients and oxygen. This will accelerate the microbial break-down of the degradable portion of the pollution. The labile, but non-degradable portion of the pollution and eventual break-down products will be removed from the sediment by infiltrating the effluent from the system across a bed with an adsorbent. The residual pollution in the sediment will be sequestered by adding a dose of a strong, preferably natural sorbent (e.g. coal) to the sediment at the end of the treatment. Presumably this will result in a substantially reduced sediment ecotoxicity and longterm stabilization of the residual pollution.By exploiting tidal energy and natural processes the costs for this treatment can be kept low. The scheme could be implemented in situ to avoid the removal of sediment or ex situ, possibly within existing structures such as abandoned dry docks, to treat sediment from routine dredging operations. The in situ emplacement or ocean disposal of treated, stabilized sediment would implicate less risks than disposal of the untreated sediment, or the treated, stabilized sediment may become an acceptable material for use on shore, e.g. as a filling material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D079055/1","grantId":"EP/D079055/1","fundValue":"204820","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The use of activated carbon for the in-situ restoration of contaminated sediments has rapidly progressed from laboratory trials to the first full-scale application in November 2013 to restore Mirror Lake in the State of Delaware in the United States.

Movement of sediment porewater accelerates the treatment substantially. A model can predict the performance of sediment remediation with activated carbon under field conditions, when the sediment-sorbent contact regime is less ideal than in well mixed laboratory remediation trials. The remediation design model and microbiologial characterization methods developed in this project form the basis for collaboration with industrial partners, including analytical laboratories, waste management and oil companies. The project developed a clear understanding of the mass transfer of pollutants from sediment particles to added activated carbon particles and the factors controlling this mass transfer and hence the treatment benefits. These insights are the basis of a numerical model which enables rational sediment treatment designs. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
