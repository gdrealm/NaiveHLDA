Despite the devastating impact of depression on individuals and society, we know very little about what happens in the brain when a person becomes clinically depressed, or how antidepressant medications work. \n\nWe do know that serotonin, one of the brain?s chemical messengers, is important in controlling our mood (how happy or sad we are) and most of the drugs used to treat depression act on serotonin. What we do not know is why it can take many weeks for a person to feel better once they start taking an antidepressant, or why some people respond very well to treatment while others respond poorly or not at all. \n\nThe principal aim of the current research proposal is to better understand what antidepressants do in the brain and how we can make them more effective. We have shown that a very small and largely ignored part of the brain called the habenula is very important in controlling the levels of serotonin in the brain, especially when people first start to take antidepressants. Part of our research will look at this control pathway using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (a technique that allows us to ?see? where the brain is active) to investigate if drugs that act in a particular way on the serotonin system also change the way this pathway functions. If we can ?switch off? this control pathway we may be able to make antidepressant drugs that work more quickly. \n\nThe habenula is also involved in motivation and reward, and some depressed patients lack drive and often show reduced or blunted responses to rewarding events (psychiatrists call this anhedonia). These anhedonic patients are also sometimes the most difficult to treat. Dopamine, another of the brain?s chemical messengers, is very important for reward processing and we think that the habenula may control the release of dopamine through interactions with serotonin. Another part of our research will look at these dopamine/serotonin interactions with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. If we can understand how the habenula interacts with dopamine, we may be able to better help those depressed patients who have very high levels of anhedonia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002025","grantId":"G1002025","fundValue":"118177","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Raymond  Norbury","coPersons":["Trevor  Sharp","Philip John Cowen"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
