Like many proteins in the body, it is glycosylated, that is, it is decorated with sugar molecules. The function of these is not clear, although there is evidence that they assist in lining up the collagen molecules to form the strong network that is needed for the structural integrity of a tissue. Over a lifetime, the body's collagen accumulates more sugar molecules and these can and do undergo various chemical reactions that result in permanent cross links between collagen molecules - so-called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). These stiffen the collagen matrix and are, at least in part, responsible for hardening of the arteries (which in turn causes high blood pressure and various other vascular issues). They are also important in ageing of skin and other tissues and they accumulate much faster if a person's blood sugar level tends to be higher than normal, i.e. in diabetic patients, where they are responsible for many of the chronic issues that diabetics suffer, such as reduced kidney function. \n\nLittle is known about the early stages of sugar accumulation in collagen and the effects it may have on the health of a tissue. Not only is it likely to affect the material strength and integrity of the tissue, it is likely to affect how the cells that live and grow in the tissue behave, so that for instance, the cells may act to cause chronic inflammation in the tissue. Thus while the current focus is on drugs to reverse the cross linking process, there is significant evidence that removing the cross links does not of itself restore the tissue's health. Although the AGE cross links undoubtedly do damage in tissues, it is not clear how much of the damage is caused by the AGEs themselves and how much by the initial sugar binding, and the sugar which remains bound even after AGEs have formed. \n\nThis project will use state-of-the-art methods to determine how the sugar that initially binds to collagen is actually bound to the collagen and the effect it has on the tissue strength and the behaviour of cells. We will use a form of spectroscopy known as solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine detailed structures of the collagen and collagen-bound sugar and electron microscopy to determine how the sugar affects the way collagen molecules align themselves together. We will use similar techniques to find out if the sugar binding affects the way that bone mineralises, which is relevant to diseases such as osteoporosis or whether it might encourage calcification of arteries, a process that causes very significant hardening of the arteries and all the health implications that that has.\n\nDetermining the effect of the early stages of sugar binding on collagen will eventually translate into early detection methods for those at risk, such as diabetic patients, and will allow us to determine how important it is to find methods to prevent or reverse this early stage sugar binding as well as the endstages. Part of the project will involve developing cell cultures which mimic the sugar binding process that happens in the body and these can be used to assess potential therapies for preventing or reversing the sugar binding.\n\nThe results of this project will particularly benefit diabetic patients, in eventually allowing therapies which will prevent or alleviate the debilitating chronic effects of the disease, but will also assist in devising healthy ageing strategies for all.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J007692/1","grantId":"MR/J007692/1","fundValue":"283034","fundStart":"2013-03-08","fundEnd":"2014-09-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Melinda  Duer","coPersons":["Serena  Best","Roger Audley Brooks","Cathy  Shanahan","Jeremy Neil  Skepper","Michael  Sutcliffe"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
