It represents a unique combination of manufacturing research skills and resource that will address key aspects of the UK's future manufacturing needs. The research is multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral and is designed to promote knowledge transfer between sectors. To realise this vision the Cranfield IMRC has two interdependent strategic aims which will be pursued simultaneously:1.To produce world/beating process and product technologies in the areas of precision engineering and materials processing.2.To enable the creation and exploitation of these technologies within the context of service/based competitive strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001874/1","grantId":"EP/E001874/1","fundValue":"9770800","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Stephenson","coPersons":["Denyse Marie Julien","Ip-Shing  Fan","Charles Edward Wainwright","Tan  Jin","Paul  Shore","David  Tranfield","Richard  Greenough","Tim  Baines","Andrew Robert Mills","Ivana Katherine Partridge","James Xiaoyu Gao","Alan  Harrison","David  Allen","David  Stephenson","Rajkumar  Roy","Denis Daniel Cartie","Andy  Neely"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
