These issues are relevant to PPARC's remit because they are crucial for e.g. rapidly developing field of MHD coronal seismology, which is presently being actively studied by plasma physics community in the UK and overseas. Besides, more diverse than MHD, kinetic description is relatively new to the solar coronal physics. Therefore, to maintain world-leading position of UK science in this field PPARC's support is essential to continue work in this direction. Better understanding of physical processes in solar and space plasmas will ultimately enable us to predict space weather and coronal mass ejections which cause damage to space satellites and terrestrial power grids. Hence, practical and socio-economic benefits of the proposed work are significant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001838/1","grantId":"PP/D001838/1","fundValue":"145047","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Tsiklauri","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
