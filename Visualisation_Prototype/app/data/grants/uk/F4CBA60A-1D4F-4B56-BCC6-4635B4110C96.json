However, there is evidence to suggest that the diet of a pregnant woman is particularly important as it has major long-term implications on the health of her offspring - so, in some ways 'we also are what our mothers ate during pregnancy'. Normal term babies born from mothers with poor nutrition during pregnancy usually have a low weight. It has been shown that individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing various common diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in adulthood. The underlying causes of the relationship between poor early growth and disease in adulthood are not known, but we believe that the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy is critically important. Many of our attempts to decipher mechanisms of human diseases both rely and benefit from studying animal models. We have shown in a rodent model that if pregnant animals have too little protein during pregnancy their babies are small at birth and develop diabetes in adulthood. We have identified important genes in the pancreas that are expressed at low levels in the offspring of protein-restricted mothers compared to control animals. We now plan to study further these animals to understand how a restricted diet is able to perturb expression of key genes involved in pathogenesis of diabetes. We are particularly interested in studying epigenetic mechanisms - that is mechanisms able to change activity of a gene without altering its DNA sequence - that could be triggered by nutritional changes during pregnancy. We also want to know more precisely at which time/s during pregnancy the quality of the mother's diet is most important for giving birth to healthy babies. This will enable us to both identify at risk individuals and to develop intervention strategies to improve the health of both the pregnant women and their offspring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D007909/1","grantId":"BB/D007909/1","fundValue":"209129","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Ozanne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The diet of an individual has important health issues at any stage of life - &quot;we are what we eat&quot; after all. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that the diet of a pregnant woman is particularly important as it has major long-term implications for the health of her offspring - so, in some ways &quot;we also are what our mothers ate during pregnancy&quot;. Normal term babies born from mothers with poor nutrition during pregnancy often have a low weight. It has been shown that individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing various common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease in adulthood. The underlying causes of the relationship between poor early growth and disease in adulthood are not known, but the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy is thought to be critically important. Many of our attempts to decipher mechanisms of human diseases both rely and benefit from studying animal models. We have shown in a rodent model that if pregnant animals have too little protein during pregnancy their babies are small at birth and then develop type 2 diabetes in late adulthood. During the current project we have studied pancreatic islets (the cells in the body that produce insulin) from these animals before they get diabetes to work out why this happens. We identified a number of important genes that were not expressed properly in islets from the offspring of protein-restricted mothers compared to the islets from offspring of normally-fed (control) offspring. These genes are known to be important in determining how much insulin the islets can produce. We showed that as the animals get older expression of these genes in islets changes. This may explain why type 2 diabetes develops with age. The changes in gene expression with age were greater in the islets from offspring of the mothers who had a low protein diet during pregnancy suggesting that these animals were ageing faster. We also studied the DNA from the pancreatic islets to identify epigenetic changes that may explain why these islet genes are not expressed properly in the offspring of mothers who had a poor diet during pregnancy and why expression of these genes changes with age. Epigenetic modifications affect how much RNA and protein is made from a gene without altering the sequence of its DNA. The most common epigenetic modifications known to affect gene expression are DNA methylation and acetylation/methylation of histones (proteins that bind to DNA and affect activity of the gene). Using DNA from pancreatic islets in combination with studies using insulin secreting cell lines we identified alterations in these epigenetic marks that could explain why gene expression changed with age. We also identified changes in epigenetic marks that mediated the effect of poor nutrition during pregnancy on gene expression. These changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications occurred before the development of type 2 diabetes therefore may represent markers of disease risk. These results will help us to identify individuals at risk of developing age-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes and to develop new medicines to improve the health of both pregnant women and their offspring.
