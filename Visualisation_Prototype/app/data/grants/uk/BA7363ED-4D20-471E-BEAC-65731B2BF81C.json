Finite W-algebras occur in the study of infinite dimensionalrepresentations of complex semisimple Lie algebras and also in mathematical physics. Further, the representation theory of finite W-algebras has connections to the representation theory of quantum groups and cyclotomic Hecke algebras. We intend to define Verma modules for finite W-algebras, which have simple heads and such that each finite dimensional simple module occurs as one of these heads.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004273/1","grantId":"EP/F004273/1","fundValue":"10741","fundStart":"2007-06-07","fundEnd":"2007-10-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research was published in a leading international journal and has been cited many times in other research.
