{"id":"A8DBCFBC-AA61-4449-8C0B-EA9C96050373","title":"eEDM:Measurement of the electron electric dipole moment","abstractText":"The Standard Model of elementary particle physics predicts that the electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM) is far too small to measure. However, modern extensions to the standard model - e.g. supersymmetric theories or other theories with additional particles or fields - predict values in the range accessible to experiment. Hence, the eEDM measurement is a search for physics beyond the standard model. Since a permanent electron EDM violates time-reversal symmetry, it is also deeply connected to the important issue of CP violation and the apparent asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. We are now in the middle of making the most sensitive eEDM measurement to date, a measurement that tests theories of new physics. Our method uses laser manipulation of cold polar molecules, which will eventually be trapped at ultra-low temperature. This approach has the promise of improving on the precision of the eEDM search by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with the current best measurement. In this rolling-grant proposal, we are seeking support for an ongoing programme of development that will allow us to realise this promise. This offers the exciting prospect of either detecting a non-zero eEDM or excluding a large fraction of the models for new physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000436/1","grantId":"PP/E000436/1","fundValue":"671895","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Hinds","coPersons":["Ben  Sauer"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
