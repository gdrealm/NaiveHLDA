Currently yield potential (i.e. growth and milk) is hindered by the high incidence and prevalence of metabolic and infectious disease. The proposed solution will utilise animal-mounted and remote sensors to identify appropriate biological indicators or &quot;early warning&quot; bio-markers of the subsequent clinical disease condition. Accelerometers (neck collars) will be used to determine behavioural signatures associated with feeding behaviour (eating and rumination) and lameness (gait detection). Thermal imaging will be used to detect elevated temperature associated with local inflammation and early pyrexia (fever) indicative of infectious disease. Breath and in-line milk sensors will be used to measure, in real-time, ketones. The concentration of milk ketones correlates with a wide range of other health conditions. A ketotic state indicated by elevated plasma and milk ketones can impair immune function and thereby affect disease susceptibility","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028275/1","grantId":"BB/M028275/1","fundValue":"307745","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Ross","coPersons":["Malcolm Andrew  Mitchell","Richard James Dewhurst","Carol-Anne  Duthie","Mizeck  Chagunda"],"organisation":"SRUC","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
