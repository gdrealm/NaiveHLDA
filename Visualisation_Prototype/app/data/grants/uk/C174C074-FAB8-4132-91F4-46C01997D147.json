This possibility has led to great interest in using stem cells for therapeutic applications to treat disorders caused by loss of cells of a particular type. For example, blindness due to loss of retinal cells could in principle be treated by taking a sample of skin cells from the patient, re-programme the skin cells to make unspecialized pluripotent stem cells and then programme the resulting stem cells to give retinal cell progenitors that can be grafted into the patient's eye to give rise to retinal cells. One of the difficult problems in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells is to track the cells as they change into specialized cells and then to purify the desired specialized cells. This can be done relatively easily for mouse pluripotent stem cells by inserting genes that make reporter molecules tagged with a fluorescent that makes the cells glow under suitable conditions, but the method is very inefficient in human pluripotent stem cells. A new cutting edge technology now offers a potential solution. Zinc finger nucleases are artificially created scissors that can be designed to specifically cut both strands of DNA molecules at just one specific location. These nucleases create a gap in the DNA structure which activates the cell's response for DNA repair. Upon presence of a short DNA stretch which shows similarity to the region containing the excision but also harbouring the reporter gene, it is possible to introduce the reporter gene into the gene of interest in human pluripotent stem cells. This technology is very recent and has only been applied twice in human pluripotent stem cells; however the efficiency has been much higher than other reported methods and as such the potential applications are immense. In this proposal we seek to implement this technology to create labelled human pluripotent stem cells lines that will be used as tools to optimise cell transplantation into the degenerate retina. The retina has a very complex structure consisting of several layers of neurons that are interconnected with each other. The two main cell types that are directly sensitive to light are the rod and cone photoreceptors cells. Our group has shown that it is possible to produce human cells that have the characteristics of cones and rods from human pluripotent stem cells. Despite this progress, we are not able to select these cells amongst other cell types that arise during differentiation process. Normally cell selection is achieved using a technique called fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The different cells of the body have specific proteins on their surface to which antibodies tagged with coloured or fluorescent molecules can bind, allowing us to identify and sort them using FACS, however, there are few such markers that can be used for isolating cones and rods. We intend to introduce a reporter into an important retinal gene that marks their differentiation to cone and rods. The presence of the fluorescent reporter will allow us to use the cell selection strategy mentioned above to purify these cells. We can then ask the question of whether these cells exhibit the properties associated with rods and cones using a variety of in vitro stem cell assays and electrophysiological analysis. If successful, this approach will allow us to prospectively isolate rod and cone cells, define their molecular phenotype and test their ability to restore vision in animal models of retinal disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I02333X/1","grantId":"BB/I02333X/1","fundValue":"119572","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Majlinda  Lako","coPersons":["Lyle  Armstrong"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" There are three significant achievements obtained from work performed in this grant as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Generation of CRX-GFP marked human embryonic stem (hESC) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPSC) lines using the Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology which enables introduction of the GFP reporter into the endogenous CRX locus. We have generated 82 and 75 hESC and hiPSC CRX-GFP lines respectively and have fully characterised six of those which we are aiming to distribute to other researchers in the field on collaborative basis and deposit at the UK Stem Cell Bank. We also intend to deposit the CRX specific ZFNs and donor targeting construct to Addgene to enable wider distribution to the scientific community.\n\n\n\n2. Full characterisation of CRX-GFP marked hESC and hiPSC lines and confirmation that GFP reporter accurately mimics the endogenous CRX expression.\n\n\n\n3. Proof that CRX expressing cells arising during the differentiation of hESC and hiPSC have the ability to differentiate into cone and rod photoreceptors. These genetically manipulated human ESC lines will be also of interest to the pharma companies. At the moment, the Newcastle University Research and Development Office is assessing these opportunities. These genetically manipulated lines will be submitted to the UK Stem Cell Bank to enable wider dissemination to the scientific community.
