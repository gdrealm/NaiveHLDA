The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. The material and other costs covered by this application are central to the program of research proposed for the fellowship.\\n\\nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro eki or boiling colour solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\\n\\nIrogane alloys are produced primarily on a small scale by skilled craftsmen with many years experience. In order to realise the potential of these alloys it is necessary to study the metallurgy of the alloys and the variations that result from the use of traditional and modern casting techniques. An understanding of the structure and behaviour of the cast alloys may also lead to improvements in the alloys, their processing, and the quality and consistency of the finished products. We will also look at the optimisation of the alloys for practical studio work through the use of micro alloys to control mechanical properties such as hardness and ductility.\\n\\nThis project will look specifically at the reliable production of shakudo (gold/copper), shibuichi (copper/silver), and kuromido (copper/arsenic) alloys. An initial list of alloy compositions to study will include Cu-99% Au-1%, Cu97% Au-3% and Cu-70% Ag-30%. Subject to health and safety considerations a Cu-99% As-1% is also a candidate material.\\n\\nThe research will ask:\\n\\n1. What are the fundamental metallurgical properties of the irogane alloys?\\n\\n2. How do the alloys respond to small workshop and industrial production methods? Do they differ and in what way?\\n\\n3. How will the metallurgical properties of the alloys change during processing and practical studio work?\\n\\n4. How can we optimise the materials for practical studio work through the use of microalloys?\\n\\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC) and the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI). There is a strong team of highly experienced and internationally recognised Metalwork and Jewellery staff at ADRC to support the research. MERI has the background of precious metals research, and the extensive equipment and materials characterisation techniques essential to support this research. \\n\\nPapers will be submitted to scientific, design and craft related journals. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers, exhibited works etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\\n\\nThe research program will allow me to significantly advance knowledge of technical issues relating to irogane alloys. This project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as high quality alloys will be necessary for the study of the niiro patination technique and the production of my studio work. The proposed research will build on traditional craft knowledge and on contemporary technical research. This research will be a great contribution to the understanding of Japanese metalsmithing techniques, providing information and solutions to the problems faced by contemporary metalsmiths working with these materials, while also widening the area of possible applications and expression. This research will be of interest to metalsmiths, product designers, the metal finishing industry, and the materials science community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F012101/1","grantId":"AH/F012101/1","fundValue":"16080","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Coilin  O'Dubhghaill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":" Irogane alloys are produced primarily on a small scale by skilled craftsmen with many years experience. In order to realise the potential of these alloys it is necessary to study the metallurgy of the alloys and the variations that result from the use of traditional and modern casting techniques. Through our study of the alloys we have improved our understanding of the structure and behaviour of the cast alloys and their processing, and the quality and consistency of the milled sheet.\n\n\n\nThe alloy production research focused on 3 main alloys 50/50 Cu/Ag, 75/25 Cu/Ag and 98/2 Cu/Au. These are representative of shibuichi (au/ag alloys) and shakudo (cu/au) alloys. The alloys were produced using industrial protective atmosphere casting methods and traditional non-protective atmosphere workshop casting methods. The workshop alloys were cast into both traditional water moulds (yudokobuki) and steel moulds. We produced rolled materials from each alloy in the as-rolled and annealed conditions. This sheet was produced under industrial conditions using controlled atmosphere annealing and large rolling mills and under workshop conditions using torch annealing and hammer forging/ small rolling mills. This produced more than 100 samples for characterisation.\n\n\n\nThe most important aspects in terms of characterising these alloys are; (i) as-cast quality in terms of inclusions/porosity etc. (ii) micro-structure and how it changes with rolling/annealing, and (iii) mechanical behaviour (e.g. hardness, strength, ductility and annealing behaviour).\n\n\n\nThe study has revealed information that will aid us in both the successful production of the alloys and their patination:\n\n\n\nSurface enrichment of one of the two phases of the structure in Ag/Cu alloys can be exploited for decorative effect during surface patination.\n\n\n\nVariation in the grain size and in the microstructures of the eutectic phase depending upon the cooling rate of each casting method influences behaviour during rolling/hammering and surface patination.\n\n\n\nVariations in porosity depending on casting methods. For steel moulds the porosity was large and concentrated in the areas that were last to solidify, i.e. in the centre of the section and towards the top of the ingot. For the water cast materials the porosity was smaller but more numerous and distributed more evenly throughout the cross-section. Virtually no porosity was observed in the sections through the continuous cast ingots. Porosity levels have a significant effect on the material quality, especially after rolling. \n\n\n\nIn addition to this research in alloy production we have prepared samples of 34 traditional alloy combinations- cu/au, cu/ag and cu/au/ag which will be used to assess the range of alloy colours achievable during our research into Niiro patination.\n\n\n\nThrough this study of irogane alloys, their casting and processing methods, we have developed our understanding of their metallurgical properties and an indication of the quality parameters of the various casting methods. It is clear that continuous casting under protective atmosphere is superior to the traditional studio methods. However, it has been very useful to clarify the quality and properties of studio cast alloys as this method is still commonly used by craftspeople and for the production of alloy samples.
