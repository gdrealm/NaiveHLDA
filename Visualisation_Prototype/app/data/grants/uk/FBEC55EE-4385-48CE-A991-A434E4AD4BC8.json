{"id":"FBEC55EE-4385-48CE-A991-A434E4AD4BC8","title":"Beyond the BRICs: The Emerging Middle and Global Poverty Reduction","abstractText":"Recently the growing political and socioeconomic power of middle-income countries has obtained widespread attention. This research project seeks to understand how middle-income countries will impact on the institutions of global governance and affect global wellbeing and equity. It moves beyond the usual focus on Brazil, Russia, India and China (the so-called BRICs) and\nidentifies other emerging powers that are likely to play a major role in global policy-making. It has two principal goals:\n\nFirst, this research seeks to evaluate different analytical tools and theoretical approaches for offering more fine-grained conceptions of the rise of regional powers and economic powerhouses beyond the BRICs. A starting point is Goldman Sachs' idea of the ‘Next Eleven’ countries, which combine high growth potential and large populations. However, the research will not be\nrestricted to this concept but will critically assess its usefulness.\n\nThe second major goal of the research is to assess how the emergence of new regional powers affects global development and global poverty reduction. This will examine (among other issues) the role of the emerging middle in shaping the poverty-reduction initiatives of the World Bank, their influence in the World Trade Organisation, their aid-giving practices and role in the UN.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-075-25-0018","grantId":"RES-075-25-0018","fundValue":"60271","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hulme","coPersons":["Matthias  Vom Hau","James  Scott"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
