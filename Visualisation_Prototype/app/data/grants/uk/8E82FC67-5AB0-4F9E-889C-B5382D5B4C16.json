The major objectives are:(1) To investigate the performance of the mop fan with respect to the removal of particles, ammonia and additional water soluble gas contaminants by adapting the design of the mop fan to the application of cleaning of product gases from biomass fluidized bed gasifiers(2) To investigate the sensitivity of an electrofilter with respect to separation of different tar components from the product gas and to improve the design and possibly reduce investment costs of electrofilter.(3) To explore the combination of mop fan and electrofilter for better product gas cleaning.(4) To optimise the designs of mop fan and electrofilter so that they can be used to produce clean product gas suitable for direct application in internal combustion engines etc.(5) To design and test high-efficiency compact heat exchangers with structured surface tubes for gas cooling to increase the overall efficiency of the gas cleaning concept.The proposed project has the following innovative features:(1) For the first time the concept of the mop fan will be applied to the cleaning of gasification product gas.(2) For the first time characterisation of an electrofilter in terms of sensitivity of tar separation for different tar components is to be experimentally investigated.(3) The combination of mop fan and electrofilter is a totally new concept of product gas cleaning technology and has great potentials in removing fine particles, tars and chemical contaminants.(4) The high-efficiency compact heat exchangers with structured surface tubes are used for cooling of product gas for the first time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F038070/1","grantId":"EP/F038070/1","fundValue":"174695","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hao  LIU","coPersons":["Saffa  Riffat"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
