In both cases the rate of increase of data production is growing faster than\nthe resources to analyse them with standard CPU based computers. New computer models based on GPUs that were\ndeveloped for gaming primarily by NVidia and Xeon-phi systems from Intel add co-processor capabilities to computers that\nallow much more rapid data processing using the hundreds of dedicated processors on each board.\nUsing the new computing models provided by these hardware developments means providing a way to use the computers\nwith these co-processor cards in clusters. By demonstrating the code changes required and requirements for host and coprocessor\nresources allows a cluster scheduler to use these computers as part of a mixed cluster. With this scheduler in\nplace it will be simple to extend existing clusters to use predominately co-processor based systems if the problem is one\nthat they do accelerate. This will allow scientists and businesses looking to process very large data sets to optimise the\ncosts of the computing resources they must buy to achieve this.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001458/1","grantId":"ST/M001458/1","fundValue":"28417","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hutchcroft","coPersons":["Simon  Maskell","Themistocles  Bowcock","Kurt  Rinnert"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
