{"id":"6A46ACF8-0FCD-4166-8DCB-5375A8C58DB6","title":"Commercialisation of a high speed, digital confocal microscope","abstractText":"We have developed a high speed digital confocal microscope that uses a digital micro-mirror device developed originally by Texas Instruments for projectors and televisions. The microscope allows optical sectioning of fluorescent specimens leading to acquisition of high quality images at faster speeds. We have identified several aspects of the current configuration that need to be improved before going to market. In collaboration with Prior Scientific Ltd., we will contract a professional optical engineer to scrutinise our design and then work collaboratively with Prior to implement and evaluate changes. We will improve the coupling efficiency of the light source, remove unwanted stray light and optimise the configuration of optical components. This will improve the image quality, reduce cost and simplify manufacture. Our aim is to develop a device that can be bolted on to existing imaging systems to produce a high quality, high speed but low cost device for use in biological research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019046/1","grantId":"BB/J019046/1","fundValue":"48501","fundStart":"2012-07-11","fundEnd":"2014-01-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have published a paper that describes the work that lead to the development of this microscope and a patent that protects the IP behind it.

We worked with a company called Prior Scientific. Although progress has been slow, and much of the work has taken place after the grant officially ended, we are now in negotiations to licence the technology and we hope that they will develop a prototype in the next few months. if this is succesful, we may end up with a commercial product that will be of use to the general imaging community As part of this grant, we developed a method that allows the use of digital micromirrors in imaging. This is patented and although our own use is to develop a digital form of microscope, the patent scope is broad enough to impact on other areas of imaging.
