{"id":"E24FE508-9891-4E1F-B89B-938342D43004","title":"Options for Britain II","abstractText":"This project replicates and extends the book &quot;Options for Britain: a strategic policy review&quot; (1995-6). Much of the analysis in Options has become accepted wisdom, and many of the policy proposals have become reality. But governments always find it difficult to refresh themselves in power, as the legacy of their own decisions build up; and oppositions do not have the research capacity to do so.\n<br />\n<br />In many ways, policy environment is richer and better informed than that in 1995. The incoming government was keen on evidence-based policy. It created its own internal evidence-based think-tank (the Performance and Innovation Unit, which later became the Prime Ministerâ€™s Strategy Unit - PMSU); encouraged policy research across Departments; built a measurement- and target-based approach to policy delivery; and substantially increased the funding and independence of National Statistics.\n<br />\n<br />This project starts with the PMSU policy reviews overseen by the Chief Analyst at PMSU, who is the lead consultant, on leave from the Civil Service. It will get expert teams to analyse policy options in each main domain. The project staff and consultant will collate and edit these into publications aimed to brief an incoming government and to summarise the best evidence.\n<br />\n<br />The project is part of the Public Services Programme.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F015259/1","grantId":"ES/F015259/1","fundValue":"141604","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  McLean","coPersons":["Stewart  Wood"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
