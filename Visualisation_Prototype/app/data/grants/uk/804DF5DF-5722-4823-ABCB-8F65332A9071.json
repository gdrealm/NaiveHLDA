Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an important arable crop in the UK. The disease phoma stem canker, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, poses an increasing threat to sustainable production of this crop. In the UK, phoma stem canker cause losses of &gt; &pound;100M p.a., despite use of fungicides. These losses will increase if the most effective fungicides are no longer permitted by EU legislation. Furthermore, it is predicted that global warming will continue to increase the range and severity of phoma stem canker epidemics. There is thus a challenge to produce cultivars with effective resistance in a changing climate to contribute to national food security. This project aims to decrease future risk of severe phoma stem canker on oilseed rape by developing a scheme for effective use of host resistance and by improving understanding of operation of host resistance against the pathogen to guide resistance breeding. The two types of resistance to L. maculans identified in B. napus are major resistance (R) gene mediated qualitative resistance that operates in cotyledons and leaves in autumn and quantitative resistance that operates in leaf stalk and stem tissues, after initial leaf infection until harvest in summer. R gene mediated resistance to L. maculans is single-gene race-specific resistance that is effective in protecting plants only if the corresponding avirulent allele is predominant in the local L. maculans population. R gene resistance often loses its effectiveness in 2 to 3 years after widespread use in commercial cultivars because of changes in L. maculans populations. To maintain the effectiveness of R gene resistance and decrease the risk that it will become ineffective, races in L. maculans populations in different regions will be determined. The L. maculans race information will be used to develop a scheme for deployment of cultivars with differen R genes in space and time. Previous work at Rothamsted showed that temperature influences the effectiveness of both R gene resistance and quantitative resistance against L. maculans. To identify effective resistance in oilseed rape that will operate against L. maculans in a changing climate, this project will assess effectiveness of different types of resistance in both in controlled environments and natural conditions. Cultivars with only R genes, only quantitative resistance or combinations of R gene &amp; quantitative resistance will be tested in different environments. From the results, we can assess which R gene or which combination of resistance is more effective. This information can be used to improve breeding strategies. To understand how temperature influences the effectiveness of host resistance, this project will focus on the three R genes which show a differential response to temperature; two of them map in the same region on chromosome A10 at distinct loci. To investigate mechanisms of operation of R gene and quantitative resistance against L. maculans, sets of materials with these R genes in the same background or the same R gene in different backgrounds will be used. These materials will enable us to investigate whether the difference in temperature response between these three R genes is due to the resistance loci or host background. Results from this project will help to minimise the risk of severe epidemics on oilseed rape so that yields are maintained to contribute to national food security and avoid unnecessary fungicide use. Breeders will benefit from improved strategies for breeding cultivars with effective disease resistance. The environment will also benefit from reduced greenhouse gas emissions through improved disease control in oilseed rape.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I017585/2","grantId":"BB/I017585/2","fundValue":"486573","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bruce David Fitt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
