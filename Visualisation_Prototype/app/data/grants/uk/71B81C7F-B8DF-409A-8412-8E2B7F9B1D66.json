They are a critical influence on the habitable planet through a plethora of factors; Natural hazards (earthquakes,volcanoes and associated tsunamis and landslides), Economic resources (ore deposits, geothermal energy), climate (volatile fluxes to the atmosphere from volcanoes and fluxes to the deep Earth through subduction itself) and the production, through time, of the continental crust itself. While subduction zones have been studied extensively we argue that, given they are interconnected and complex systems, they demand a systematic, multidisciplinary and coordinated approach. We propose to develop a program of work which will provide this and will integrate approaches to allow us to understand subduction zone systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J020648/1","grantId":"NE/J020648/1","fundValue":"35896","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Davidson","coPersons":["Jennifer  Barclay","Blanche Marjorie Wilson","Jamie John Wilkinson","Jeroen  Van Hunen","Colin Grant Macpherson","Jonathan David Blundy","Andreas  Rietbrock"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" Project was to develop a theme action proposal.
