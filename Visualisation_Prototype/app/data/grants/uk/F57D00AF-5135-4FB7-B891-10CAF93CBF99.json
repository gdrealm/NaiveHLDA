{"id":"F57D00AF-5135-4FB7-B891-10CAF93CBF99","title":"Better Methods for Assessing Dietary Intake","abstractText":"Healthy food is thought to be important in preventing many diseases of adult life, including cancer and heart disease. However, few definite links have been established due to the difficulties of measuring usual diet so that this can be linked to the development or protection from such diseases in later life. We propose to model underlying methods for an easy to use but accurate system of measuring diet which can be used in studies assessing the relationship between the food we eat and susceptibility to these diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800603","grantId":"G0800603","fundValue":"234865","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kay-Tee  Khaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
