We have a good understanding of isolated protein domains, and we can see the overall organisation of cell structure with light and electron microscopy. The resolution obtained with techniques in molecular microscopy bridges the gap between the high resolution information on isolated domains, and the lower resolution overview given by light microscopy and the conventional electron microscopy techniques. It is at the intermediate scale that the molecules are directly involved in regulating cellular processes. Biological macromolecular complexes are often molecular machines in that they consist of many parts with distinct functions, and movements or conformation changes are integral to their function and operation. Through observation of these complexes in their different states we could gain significantly improved understanding and insight on how these complexes work and function in the cell. Many fundamental cellular processes, such as DNA transcription, translation and repair; or protein synthesis, chaperoning, transport and degradation, are mediated by such large multi-component macromolecular complexes. With recent advances in electron microscopy instrumentation and analysis techniques we can examine the structures of these complexes in three dimensions at sub nanometre resolution. However the presence of mixed conformations can be a major limiting factor for this technique, as usually the assumption that all the molecules or particles are identical is applied. If a mixture of conformations or structures is present, and these are not detected and separated, then they will be averaged and the obtainable resolution will be limited. The challenge is that if the conformation species could be separated then invaluable information on function, dynamics, and mechanism could be obtained In this project we will develop a technique that will allow all the discrete states in the molecular population to be analysed, making the presence of heterogeneity an advantage, as the observation of multiple states reveals much about the function and mechanism in macromolecular complexes. The novel method provides an objective analysis of a mixed population of particles, from electron micrographs. It enables images of the states to be separated, so that each homogeneous class can be processed by the standard methods. Until now sample heterogeneity has been the biggest limiting factor for single particle analysis, but once this problem is solved it will become an advantage. Understanding the molecules involved in cellular processes enhances our knowledge of the mechanism of life, and provides a rational basis for the treatment of diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H02414X/1","grantId":"BB/H02414X/1","fundValue":"119381","fundStart":"2011-02-21","fundEnd":"2012-07-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  By my own group.\n\nPublication: Ashley Seepujak, Tomas Adomavicius, Sergey Dolgobrodov, Emmanouil Moschidis, Xin Chen, Anthony Maxwell, Susan M.
