{"id":"C4D48FB2-99DD-4C49-8894-F386D6BDAA40","title":"Development of integrated approaches towards runaway prediction and assessment.","abstractText":"In order to control reactivity and prevent runaway reactions it is necessary to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of reactions, the sensitivity of reactivity to process variables and the rates that energy can be released to the environment. Knowledge of the mechanisms of runaway reactions can help identify measures or conditions that temper or control the reaction. A detailed kinetic model based on elementary reactions is required to scale-up experimental data to industrial conditions and predict runaway behaviour. To our knowledge there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the chemistry of runaway reactions and their behaviour is deducted using entirely empirical approaches. The objective of this proposal is to enable initiation of a long term collaborative research between Chemical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK and the group of Professor M. Sam Mannan, Director of Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center, Chemical Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University, USA, in the field of safety of runaway reactions. The proposed collaborative research which will target the development of an integrated experimental and theoretical protocol for the fundamental understanding of runaway reactions and the reliable prediction of their macroscopic behaviour will also further promote the International profile of Leeds University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D036186/1","grantId":"EP/D036186/1","fundValue":"10050","fundStart":"2006-06-25","fundEnd":"2006-11-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Papadaki","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
