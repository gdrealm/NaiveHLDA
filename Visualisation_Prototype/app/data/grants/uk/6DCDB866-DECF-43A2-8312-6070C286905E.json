{"id":"6DCDB866-DECF-43A2-8312-6070C286905E","title":"Wakeham efficiency reductions","abstractText":"The successful interpretation of data from modern high energy physics experiments is a complex process. It involves not only the actual measurement of data points but also the input of a variety of theoretical or phenomenological models and processes which invariably rely heavily on numerous other data measurements for their tuning and refinement. New theoretical ideas lead to predictions that can be tested experimentally, and new experimental findings challenge theorists to produce better ideas. The HEPDATA project at the centre of this proposal serves to facilitate the data input provision to this process. At the same time, the Institute of Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) in Durham, with its wide-ranging expertise in phenomenology and a strong base in particle theory, is ideally suited to be the host of this project.\n\nThe Data Curation aspect of the HEPDATA project will continue to compile HEP experimental scattering data and associated bibliographic information from particle physics experiments around the world. All the content on HEPDATA is freely available and easily accessible to the entire physics community, thereby promoting the data to a wide audience. In addition HEPDATA will continue its links with the SLAC/SPIRES database project, hosting its UK mirror and engaging with its replacement database Inspire, providing mirroring facilities in the long-term. The Berkeley Particle Data Group UK mirror web pages will also continue to be hosted by the project. HEPDATA will also continue to provide a server for Parton Distribution Function (PDF) codes and continue to develop and maintain the LHAPDF library of PDF functions which are used in a large part of present and future analyses including at the LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000586/1","grantId":"ST/K000586/1","fundValue":"1463","fundStart":"2012-04-04","fundEnd":"2012-06-03","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Edward William Glover","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
