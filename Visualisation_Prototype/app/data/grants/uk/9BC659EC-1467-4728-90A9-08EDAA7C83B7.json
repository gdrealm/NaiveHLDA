{"id":"9BC659EC-1467-4728-90A9-08EDAA7C83B7","title":"A data curation and simulation facility for particle physics","abstractText":"The successful interpretation of data from modern high energy particle physics experiments is a complex process involving not only the actual measurement of data points themselves but also the input of a variety of theoretical or phenomenological models and processes. The Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) in Durham, with its strong phenomenological base is ideally suited to address this need and the projects proposed in this grant application serve to do this in two related ways: (1) Data Curation. The HEPDATA project will continue to compile HEP Experimental scattering data and associated bibliographic information from particle physics experiments around the world and make these freely available to the entire physics community, thereby making data easily accessible and promoting the data to a wide audience. It will also continue to host the UK mirror of the SLAC/SPIRES databases and the Berkeley PDG web pages which are heavily used by the HEP research program. HEPDATA will also continue to provide a server for Parton Distribution Function (PDF) codes and develop and maintain LHAPDF the new library of PDF funtions for use in future analyses, including the LHC. (2) Data Simulation. Herwig++ is one of the key event generators which will be used in the LHC analyses. A large fraction of the worldwide expertise in Herwig++ is now based at Durham. We will continue to develop Herwig++ and provide the essential support and development needed in the longer term to make Herwig++ a core analysis tool for the experimental progamme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H000771/1","grantId":"ST/H000771/1","fundValue":"182295","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Edward William Glover","coPersons":["Frank Martin Krauss","Peter  Richardson"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
