{"id":"368605FB-6153-4A95-A7E9-ABBEBAF7B0F2","title":"Strengthening Resilience in Volcanic Areas (STREVA)","abstractText":"STREVA cuts across traditional scientific fields and all those involved will benefit from closer interaction with new disciplines, which will be achieved through a series of workshops and collaboration in work packages 5 and 6 of the project. These take a start-to-end interdisciplinary approach to risk analysis, scenario planning, communication and knowledge sharing. STREVA will generate a pool of scientists, both in the UK and abroad, including eight post-doctoral researchers, with an appreciation of the broad range of components that contribute to building resilience in volcanic regions. Principal Investigators are involved in other initiatives that provide the opportunity for STREVA to leverage resources and have a wider influence. Examples include: \nVOLDIES, an ERC Advanced Grant on volcanic risk \nVUELCO, an EU FP7 project that aims to improve the understanding of the processes behind volcanic unrest and the ability to forecast its outcome.\nGVM, an international network providing a platform for information on local to global scale volcanic hazards and risk.\nCASAVA, a French project that addresses volcanic risk in French territories in the eastern Caribbean. \nNEMOH, a European training network in volcanology \nCDKH, a UK/Dutch project to provide research and technical assistance to developing country governments on issues that span climate and development. \nVhub, an NSF initiative to enhance and develop collaboration and knowledge sharing in volcanic research and risk mitigation. \nEVOSS, the EU funded European Volcano Observatory Space Services\nSTREVA will interact closely with the successful IRNH earthquake consortium and the knowledge exchange fellows within IRNH. We will also act to broker new synergistic research that will augment the development of the risk assessment framework and methods for its application produced by STREVA during the project. It is anticipated this will involve other members of the UK volcanological community and researchers from other disciplines, including those working in health and engineering and on media and cultural aspects of risk communication, whose work would be enriched by and provide additional input to the risk assessment framework.\nSTREVA has strong links with research institutions in the study region resulting from long-term collaborations and recent visits during the Caribrisk scoping study. These are the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (SRC) and Disaster Risk Reduction Centre (DRRC); the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO), the Servicio Geologica Colombiano (Ingeominas), the Observatorio Sismologico del Suroccidente (OSSO), and the Instituto Geofisco of the Escuela Politecnica Nacional de Ecuador (IGEPN). Each institute is responsible for monitoring several active volcanoes, assessment of hazards and risks, provision of advice to authorities, governments and citizens during volcanic emergencies, and for long term planning and policy development. They face a high workload to maintain monitoring networks and respond to crises. STREVA provides them with the opportunity to participate in the development and implementation of state-of-the-art monitoring techniques, and benefit from the analysis of archived datasets through workshops and risk assessments in the study region. STREVA will interact with local authorities, NGOs, insurance companies and regional and national development agencies; partnerships that are critical to building closer links with the scientific community and observatories, delivering research to end users, and ultimately ensuring progress in increasing resilience in volcanic regions. The relevance of SRTEVA's research is not however restricted to the individual hazards under consideration. There are commonalities in the physical processes, operation of monitoring systems and the causes of vulnerability across hazards. We anticipate results being applicable to a wider range of hazards including flooding, hurricanes and landslide","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J020087/1","grantId":"NE/J020087/1","fundValue":"249720","fundStart":"2012-07-02","fundEnd":"2017-07-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Clare Loughlin","coPersons":["Brian  Baptie"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
