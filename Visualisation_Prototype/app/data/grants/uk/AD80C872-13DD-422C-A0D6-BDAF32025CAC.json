{"id":"AD80C872-13DD-422C-A0D6-BDAF32025CAC","title":"Biomedical Catalyst â€“ A novel platform for targeted sequence enrichment prior to clinical NGS","abstractText":"Oxford Gene Technology, in collaboration with Professor Mike Griffiths at the University of Birmingham, will develop novel strategies to help implement next generation sequencing (NGS) into routine clinical practice. NGS offers significant benefits in delivery of improved and earlier diagnosis, informed therapeutic selection, and monitoring of disease progression and remission. Current technology platforms are not ideal for clinical practice, in terms of cost and/or performance. OGT has extensive experience in genomic technology and service provision. As a UK based life sciences company, OGT will focus its expertise to address some of the limitations of current NGS targeted sequencing technology, and in the process, will drive further investment in R&amp;D and life sciences in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_14091","grantId":"MC_PC_14091","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Griffiths","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
