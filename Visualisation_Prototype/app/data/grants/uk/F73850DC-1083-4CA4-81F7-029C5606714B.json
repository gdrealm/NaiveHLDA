{"id":"F73850DC-1083-4CA4-81F7-029C5606714B","title":"Incorporating gene pathway information in genetic association studies","abstractText":"The focus of much current research in the field of human genetics is on the search for genetic variation between individuals that may explain the variability in susceptibility to certain diseases observed in the population. The major difficulty encountered is the fact that the influence of genetic variants on diseases are very small. This project will investigate whether these signals can be reinforced by incorporating known information on how gene functions are related when searching for such variants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802318","grantId":"G0802318","fundValue":"310660","fundStart":"2010-04-07","fundEnd":"2013-04-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudio John Verzilli","coPersons":["Liam  Smeeth","John  Whittaker","Meena  Kumari","Juan P  Casas","Aroon Dinesh Hingorani","Mika  Kivimaki"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
