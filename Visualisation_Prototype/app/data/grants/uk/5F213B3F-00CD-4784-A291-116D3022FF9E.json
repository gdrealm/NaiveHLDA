We will address the Atlantic, UK shelf and slope waters, and selected locations in the Southern Ocean, using data from time series stations and volunteer observing ships (VOS), measuring three parameters of the marine carbonate system. The programme will be integrated with the efforts of colleagues in other European countries, (enablng better and longer-term coverage, and of of a wider area). It will be co-ordinated with the Surface ocean carbon atlas project (SOCAT) which aims to produce the most comprehensive and up to date data base to access all the quality data relevant to ocean carbon uptake, and from which pH trends can be derived. Estimation of decadal trends change will be set against the background of intra- and inter-annual variation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H017046/2","grantId":"NE/H017046/2","fundValue":"116578","fundStart":"2013-07-16","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Watson","coPersons":["Dorothee  Bakker"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
