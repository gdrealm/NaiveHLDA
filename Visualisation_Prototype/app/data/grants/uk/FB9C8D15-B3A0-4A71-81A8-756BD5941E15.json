The purpose of our network is to develop a research model to improve and support mental capital, mental health and wellbeing in later life through collaboration between academics, policy-makers, practitioners and older people. We want to understand the interactions between individual characteristics and environmental factors that improve and maintain mental health and wellbeing in later life, and also how this could be translated into policy and practice. We intend to do this by collaborating and exchanging knowledge between stakeholders from research, policy, practice and older people, reviewing existing knowledge across disciplines about mental capital and mental wellbeing in later life, and by developing high-quality research based on current evidence and models of ageing and mental health. \n\nOur network brings together research, policy and practice across a wide range of disciplines, institutions, sectors, geographical areas and older people. It builds on an existing collaborative network of researchers. The network benefits from active involvement of several partners, e.g. voluntary organisations, local authorities, health services and older people themselves. The ten month programme will consist of three stages, framed by three main meetings and a series of consultative workshops with strategic partners and older people. A model for mental capital, mental health and wellbeing research will be developed drawing on, for example, literature reviews, consultations with older people and other experts and the consultative workshops in three geographical areas. Older people will be involved as partners at two levels. In each geographical area an Older People?s Involvement Group will be established from existing partnerships. These groups will meet independently to discuss older people?s perspectives on the suggested questions. In addition, group members will be involved in the consultative workshops. The long-term aim is to involve older people as trained peer researchers and commentators in the research developed through the network.\n\nEach stage will generate outputs, which will be of interest and relevance to the general public. Contacts will be maintained with the media to disseminate findings of general interest and value quickly. A network website will also be established. Presentations will be made to stakeholder groups and articles written for academic, older people?s and professional journals. The activities developed through the proposed model for research will benefit older people, policy and practice by improving our understanding of the positive influences on older people?s mental health and wellbeing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900011","grantId":"G0900011","fundValue":"49964","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mima  Cattan","coPersons":["Kevin  Thomas","Steve  Robertson","Suzanne  Moffatt","Mary  Godfrey","Jim  McKenna","Jill  Manthorpe","Gregory Richard Marsden","Gillian  Windle","Stephen Roger Iliffe","Katherine  Walters","Gianfranco  Giuntoli"],"organisation":"Leeds Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
