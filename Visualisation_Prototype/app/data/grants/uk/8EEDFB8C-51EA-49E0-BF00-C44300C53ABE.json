{"id":"8EEDFB8C-51EA-49E0-BF00-C44300C53ABE","title":"Development Viability Appraisal: Theory, Application and Evaluation","abstractText":"<p>Development viability modelling has become central to the UK planning system.&nbsp; It is an increasingly important component of policy formation at the local planning level and for the delivery of affordable and market housing. However there has been little evaluation of the performance of development appraisal models in these areas.&nbsp; <br /><br />The aim of the research project is to improve theoretical and empirical understanding of development viability appraisal modelling. More specifically, the research project seeks to investigate the extent to which existing development viability models vary in terms of composition, internal coherence, input requirements, methods and output metrics.&nbsp; <br /><br />The research project will focus on the nature of uncertainty in the modelling inputs and outputs. To address the research objectives, both qualitative and quantitative research methods will be used. <br /><br />The first objective will be addressed by referring to the body of literature on the topic to develop a peer review of current models. Drawing upon published appraisals and interviews with market participants, the research project will also include an empirical investigation of how development appraisals are implemented in practice. In order to assess uncertainty, a number of approaches will be used to provide a quantitative comparison of model results against observations. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I001123/1","grantId":"ES/I001123/1","fundValue":"80462","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  McAllister","coPersons":["Peter  Wyatt"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
