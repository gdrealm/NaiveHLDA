This has included submissions to the Home Office, providing a policy briefing to the National Assembly for Wales, and hosting a workshop with representatives from 'think tanks' and government departments. Additionally, we engaged with a variety of civil society/advocacy groups and published commentary (including by invitation) on this area of public policy. Our research has highlighted the negative experiences of a range of ethnic minority citizens, as well as demonstrating the merits of using evidence based research in a highly political and sensitive arena.

To date, however, very little research has been conducted on how ordinary people think about counter-terrorism policy broadly, and, more specifically, how counter-terrorist measures impact on public perceptions and experiences of security. \nOur project addresses these lacunae through the use of community-based focus groups across the United Kingdom. In so doing, it aims to shed light on three important questions:\n1. To what extent do significant differences exist in attitudes to anti-terrorism measures based on an individual's geography or ethnicity? \n2. What implications do these attitudes - and differences therein - pose for citizenship within the UK? \n3. How specifically do 'ordinary' people understand the term 'security' in the context of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and, indeed, beyond?\nOur initial findings suggest that whilst differences between ethnic groups in terms of attitudes to anti-terrorism policies (support for them or otherwise) are slight, there are pronounced differences in the impact of such measures (perceived and experienced) upon distinct citizens and communities. Such differences point to genuine concerns surrounding the universality of citizenship within the UK, and the rights, responsibilities and opportunities for political participation associated with this status. Moreover, our research also suggests that security is understood in a broad and varied fashion across the UK, and we offer a conceptual typography of five discrete security imaginaries articulated to us by members of the public. These link security to survival, contentment, hospitality, equality and freedom respectively. Findings will continue to be of use to politicians and policymakers in the counter terrorism area, as they give an indication of how different sections of the public respond to counter terrorism measures Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
