This can directly guide clinical research and advance the development of novel therapeutic treatments.\n\nMotor Neurone Diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, are fatal neurological disorders characterized by the loss of muscle innervation. There is currently no treatment for these diseases and little is known about the causes.\n\nRecently, the TDP-43 protein was identified as the major component of abnormal aggregates found in affected nerve cells of Motor Neurone Disease patients. However, the function of TDP-43 in the nervous system is not known, nor is it clear whether these aggregates play a direct role in disease formation.\n\nThe fruitfly Drosophila is an ideal model system to study neurological disorders such as Motor Neuron Disease. Although the fly has a less complex central nervous system than humans, the major building blocks are comparable, especially motor neurons and muscle innervation.\n\nDrosophila encodes a TDP-43 protein that is similar to the human protein affected in Motor Neuron Disease. By studying the function of TDP-43 in the fruitfly, we can learn about the role of TDP-43 in motor neurons, muscle innervation, and disease formation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701498","grantId":"G0701498","fundValue":"349087","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Hirth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
