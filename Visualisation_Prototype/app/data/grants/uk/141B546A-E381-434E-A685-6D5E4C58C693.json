These advances have come from a convergence of several different methodologies: brain imaging, studies of patients with specific kinds of brain damage, and physiological studies of animals. A.D. Milner and M.A. Goodale have summarized these developments in a recent book (Sight Unseen , Oxford University Press, 2003). The present application is directed at combining two of these investigative methods, by not only studying the behaviour and perceptual abilities of certain patients with specific brain damage, but also studying which parts of their brains are active during such tests by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI). This should help us understand better the functions of the two visual streams, as well as how the brain can adjust to severe damage to one of the two streams.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401090","grantId":"G0401090","fundValue":"245737","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Arthur David  Milner","coPersons":["Charles  Heywood","Robert William  Kentridge","Thomas  Schenk"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
