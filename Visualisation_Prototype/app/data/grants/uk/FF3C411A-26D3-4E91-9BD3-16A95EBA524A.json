The way in which informaton in DNA is accessed relies on one such machine, called RNA polymerase. Although we know the shape and form of RNA polymerase, quite how its parts work together is far less clear. We will be using a program of research to work out how one part-called the Bridge Helix -contributes to RNA polymerase being able to productively interact with DNA. Because RNA polymerases are conserved from man to bacteria, the work is of fundamental importance, and especialy for a knowledge based approach needed for the management of some harmful bacteria.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000975/1","grantId":"BB/E000975/1","fundValue":"357344","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Buck","coPersons":["Sivaramesh  Wigneshweraraj","Robert O.J.
