{"id":"A7383307-57A0-4992-BAFE-7627B8BBAD7C","title":"Whole Body Hypothermia for the Treatment of Perinatal Asphyxial Encephalopathy (TOBY)","abstractText":"Although major advances have been made in the care of mothers and babies, approximately 2 out of every 1000 newborn infants suffer from a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) around the time of birth that may cause death or injury to the brain. Currently there are no specific treatments that reduce the risk of death or brain injury following asphyxia. However, many possible treatments have been suggested as a result of experimental work. Of these, mild body cooling (hypothermia) has most consistently shown benefit, and preliminary small studies in babies have been promising. \n\nThis proposed randomized trial aims to find out whether mild cooling of babies suffering moderate and severe asphyxia prevents babies from dying or developing later disability (which will be measured when the children are 18 moths of age). To do this, babies who are thought to have suffered asphyxia will be assessed within 6 hours of birth and babies with moderate or severe asphyxia will be randomly selected so that in half the rectal temperature is kept at a normal level (37oC) and in the other half the temperature is kept at 33.5-34 oC for 72 hours, after which it will slowly be returned to normal. All other care in the two groups will be according to current clinical practice. In order to demonstrate a 30% reduction in death and disability with cooling treatment, 236 babies will need to be enrolled into the trial. Information will be collected from the babies at the time of the trial entry, during the first 80 hours after trial entry, when they are discharged from the neonatal unit (or die) and when they are aged 18 months.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100126","grantId":"G0100126","fundValue":"720421","fundStart":"2002-09-02","fundEnd":"2009-01-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis V Azzopardi","coPersons":["Andrew  Whitelaw","Malcolm Irvin Levene","David  Edwards","Peter  Brocklehurst","Marianne  Thoresen","Henry  Halliday"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
