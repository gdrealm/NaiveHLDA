One of my PhD students conducted related research on perspectives of clinical utility of psychiatric genetic tests, and his research also educated practitioners. We have been awarded residency fellowships that I can't find a place to fit, by the Brocher Foundation in Geneva Switzerland, to spend a month in their facility writing a book Genetics Goes Online: New Genetics and New Media, for which we have been promised a contract from Routledge. We envision this book to have multiple audiences including governance of internet based sales of genetic tests, as well as public participation in life science.

We contributed significantly to this literature by focusing on innovative ways of identifying and accessing users, and analysing forms of relationship entailed in the DTC industry, and representation of the science behind DTC products. We examined how: users participate in genetic research, illness and genetic science is represented online, the DTC genetic testing industry is leading to new roles for some healthcare providers, and the roles and expectations of consumers are overlapping with roles and expectations of patients and research participants in the DTC genetic testing industry. These findings are presented in 7 journal articles and 17 conference or workshop papers, listed individually at the RCUK Research Output System (ROS); additionally two papers and a book proposal are under review. We identified that trust is a key component of how personal genomics meets the internet, and is tied into a complex system of interactions involving interpersonal, discursive, physical and technological elements. Claims made by DTC genetic testing companies of patient and consumer empowerment from DTC access to personal genetic health information involve such complex and fragile relationships. They also overlook the ways in which users adopt sometimes conflicting relationships to their own genetic data and who and how it is consumed. Understanding these relationships is important to how personal genomics and personalised medicine are being integrated into healthcare, particularly where patients are encouraged to participate in research and data is meaningful both to individual health and to wider research activities and interests. \nSpecifically:\n\no We identified a new form of &quot;illness narrative&quot; expressive of these complex relationships, enabled by social media technologies, the 'autobiology'. \n\no We identified new relationships between health care providers and consumers/patients, particularly in our examination of how genetic counsellors are being positioned/positioning themselves within the DTC genetic testing industry.\n\no Kelly concurrently supervised ESRC-funded doctoral research on health professionals' views of psychiatric genetics (Dr Chris Elphick, completed 17/05/13, which found a strong belief amongst professionals that although the tests may have limited clinical utility they may strengthen the scientific basis of psychiatry, and improve perceptions of the legitimacy of the discipline. \n\no We have made a number of contributions to social science scholarship concerning digital platforms and relationships, including to user studies, research use of materials 'found' online, and the role of the internet in controversy.\n\no While some users deliberately access personal genetic information relating to psychiatric conditions, many are receiving such information incidentally in the context of broad genome sequencing. In user interviews, availability of these tests online is approached with scepticism regarding company motives and the personal utility of such information. Our findings about the role of the internet platform and how users engage with biology online are being used by academic scholars in science and technology studies, internet studies, ethics and social studies of the life sciences. Our findings might potentially be useful to policy makers and we will continue to engage with policy debates as relevant.
