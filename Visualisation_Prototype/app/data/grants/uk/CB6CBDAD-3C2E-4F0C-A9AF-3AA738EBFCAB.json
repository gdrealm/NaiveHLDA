The failure of these nerves to regenerate, as in the case of spinal cord injuries, frequently results in paralysis and the loss of sensation which can have devastating effects on the patients? lives. The major contributing factors to the failure of injured nerves to regrow are the lack of trophic support and the inhibitory environment generated at the site of injury. Current therapeutic approaches include promoting regeneration via delivery of neurotrophic factors or cell transplantation as well as preventing the generation of the inhibitory environment after injury. While these strategies have had some success in animal models, few have been translated to the clinic and therefore there is a need to find new strategies for stimulating nerve repair. We have discovered that a new class of small RNA molecules may be important in regulating the regenerative responses of the damaged nerves. Research into the mechanisms by which these molecules promote nerve regrowth will lead to the identification of new targets that can be developed into innovative therapies to promote repair of injured nerves.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700986","grantId":"G0700986","fundValue":"349812","fundStart":"2008-04-19","fundEnd":"2012-04-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Liang-Fong  Wong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
