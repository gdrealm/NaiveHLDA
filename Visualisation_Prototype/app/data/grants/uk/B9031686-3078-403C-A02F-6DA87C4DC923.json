In recent years there has been much interest in using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), unspecialised cells which can be coaxed using molecules that are found normally in the developing body to produce any cell type. Such stem cells can therefore be used to produce particular repair tissues for patients with different diseases that are so far incurable or for damaged tissues following injury. In order for this to be possible in a manner affordable to our healthcare systems, we need to generate banks of stem cells of different human background which have different immunological tissue types. These can then be used to make desired specialised cells tailored to the patient. However at the moment we do not have reliable ways to grow the cells in large numbers without damaging them, or changing their properties so that they cannot make healthy tissues. In this proposal we will develop the conditions for generating healthy stem cells in large numbers while protecting them from damaging influences. We will generate a system that will be suitable for an automated cell factory so that the cells can be monitored and maintained in pristine stress-free conditions and expanded in a stable way enabling them to in turn generate healthy tissues for the clinic. Such a system has been developed by a company, Tokyo Electron, which now has a base in the UK. We will evaluate a whole series of different properties of these hPSCs and work out which attributes of the cells predict their health and retention of the ability to make more stem cells and form specialised cells. These properies will be compared against commercial and other alternative hPSC test systems and, in the second phase, fed back to further improve culture conditions. In this subsequent second phase we will trial the improved culture conditions with continued cell monitoring for 'good' and 'bad' cell markers in the automated cell factory. The established validated properties will be made available to other researchers so that they can use them to improve their expansion of PSCs and subsequently generate different specialised cell types for different patient needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M017354/1","grantId":"MR/M017354/1","fundValue":"1289420","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Jane Kimber","coPersons":["Glyn  Stacey","Lorraine Elizabeth Young","Ludovic  Vallier","Daniel  Gaffney","Chris  Denning","Royston  Goodacre","Daniel R Brison"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
