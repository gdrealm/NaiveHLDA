To provide enough food for the growing world population requires that areas of food production that still have the capacity to grow, like aquaculture, will be exploited more rigorously in the future but also that losses due to diseases need to be reduced. Our aim is to understand early host pathogen interactions of oomycete parasites that heavily impact food production. Oomycetes are fungal-like organisms that cause diseases on plants and animals. For example different Saprolegnia species infects fish (Saprolegniosis) at different development levels. In order to cause disease these parasites need to deliver molecules into their host cells to manipulate the host in such a way that it can infect and propagate successfully. One group of such molecules are the so called effectors. These molecules do not only target specific host molecules but some also seem to highjack host transport mechanisms in order to enter the cells. We will characterise the molecular mechanisms that effector proteins use to translocate into host cells, since a detailed understanding of these processes will help us to develop methods/substances that can block the infection process. This will allow fish to fight off their oomycete attackers more efficiently. In addition, we would like to use the 'effector entering system' to develop an immersion vaccine whereby fish do not need to be handled and injected anymore. Such a vaccine would reduce stress in fish and the occurrence of vaccination associated diseases, which includes Saprolegniosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J018333/1","grantId":"BB/J018333/1","fundValue":"361065","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pieter  Van West","coPersons":["Chris  Secombes"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" The project is still ongoing, but we have been working on the mechanism of effector translocation in Saprolegnia and found some interesting facts that have not yet been published\n\nWe have discovered that snails can be infected by Saprolegnia once an antimicrobial gene is silenced.\n\nWe have functionally characterised a tyrosinase of Saprolegnia via gene silencing.
