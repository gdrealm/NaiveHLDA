{"id":"C72D03DA-1536-4F62-8B54-3B5DF7ACA569","title":"The Politics of Pierre Bourdieu","abstractText":"In the last decade of his career, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu became involved in a series of high-profile political interventions, defending the cause of striking students and workers, speaking out in the name of illegal immigrants, the homeless and the unemployed, challenging the incursion of the market into the field of artistic and intellectual production. My research project will analyse these political interventions, setting them in their national and historical context, before relating them to Bourdieu's more fully developed social theory to offer a detailed study of the political implications of his wide varied output.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111780/1","grantId":"111780/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-30","fundEnd":"2006-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Lane","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
