Despite impovements in medical care the mortality of this disease has remained largely unchanged over the last ten years (overal 5 year survival reamins 40%). However colorectal cancer is a disease where survival can be improved by early detection of adenomatous polyps and early cacners before they become smyptomatic. A significant reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer has been identified in five randomised trials, the largest of which is the Nottingham study.\nDetection and removal of adenomatous polyps at colonoscopy should lead to a reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. This has so far only been shown in one trial and occurred after 18 years of follow up. Unfortunately in this trial 40% trial population had been colonoscoped and it is therefore uncertain how much of the incidence reduction was due to screening by FOB testing and how much by colonoscopy. The Nottingham Screening Study provides an unrivalled opportunity to addres this important issue but as yet our data are not mature ( roll out of a national colorectal screening programme using FOB testing seems likely).Our current funding will cease at a median follow up of 14 years. The data so far show that the mortality reduction from colorectal cancer first reproted in 1997 is sustained, and that incidence of colorectal cancer may just be diverging in the screened and control groups. \nWe therefore seek a further five years funding to get to 19 years follow up.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9826520","grantId":"G9826520","fundValue":"406950","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Scholefield","coPersons":["David  Whynes","S  Moss"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
