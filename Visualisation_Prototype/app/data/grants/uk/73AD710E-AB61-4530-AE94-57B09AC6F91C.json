{"id":"73AD710E-AB61-4530-AE94-57B09AC6F91C","title":"Devolution Monitoring Reports 2005-2008","abstractText":"<p>The Devolution Monitoring Programme 2005-08 managed by the Constitution Unit at UCL consists of a network of five research teams: Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the English Regions and Devolution and the Centre. Each team produces three reports per year – in January, May and September – covering all significant developments relating to devolution in the preceding four-month ‘monitoring period’. The programme is a continuation of a similar monitoring programme that ran from 1999 to 2005.</p> \n<p>Each set of reports is sub-divided into a series of standard headings. For instance, the Scotland and Wales reports have sections on the devolved legislature and executive, public opinion, public policy, the media, political parties, and relations with other tiers of government. The Northern Ireland reports are similar but also provide updates on the peace process. The English Regions reports focus on developments in the different sub-national government bodies (including regional chambers, regional development agencies, government offices). The Centre reports discuss devolution-related activity at Westminster and Whitehall.</p> \n<p>The methodology of the reports is non-theoretical. The reports are a form of contemporary history that allow researchers to track over time how devolution across the UK is developing in terms of policy, institutions, party politics and public opinion.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-219-25-2006","grantId":"RES-219-25-2006","fundValue":"111550","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Hazell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
