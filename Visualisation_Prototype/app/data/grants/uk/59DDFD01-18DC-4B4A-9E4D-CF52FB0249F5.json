{"id":"59DDFD01-18DC-4B4A-9E4D-CF52FB0249F5","title":"Circulating Enlightenment: The Negotiations of Andrew Millar (1705-68)","abstractText":"Andrew Millar (1705-68) was born near Glasgow, apprenticed to a bookseller in Edinburgh, and settled in London. By 1730, a distinguished circle of Scottish poets, novelists, and philosophers had joined him there--and within a decade, Millar was the most important and trusted agent for Scottish and English literary interests in the newly-established British capital. This project will document and display the degree to which the Enlightenment was made financially possible, and indeed quite lucrative, through Millar's negotiations with readers in London, throughout England, and across the expanding Empire. Millar was an energetic promoter and fierce defender of his copyrights. For legal scholars, Millar's name is synonymous with arguments for private ownership of intellectual property that endure to this day. His social negotiations and the positions these spawned remain relevant three centuries later.\n\nReaders normally associate the Enlightenment with purely intellectual developments. But its cultural flourishing was made possible through social and business interests negotiated by Millar. This project will draw on archival, technical, e-learning expertise to collect, edit, interpret, and showcase these negotiations for scholars, students, and non-specialists. The results will enable fresh thinking about the creation of historical documents, the interpretation of the past through new media, and learning about history through reflection on its social, financial, and legal conditions.\n\nThis project has three objectives: First, the completion of a book, titled &quot;Creating Enlightenment: The Negotiations of Andrew Millar&quot; (under contract with Oxford UP). Second, using an award-winning online platform run by Edina, the JISC-designated information service, we will create an interactive exhibition that will enable non-specialists to explore and understand the importance of social networks for promoting intellectual and artistic developments. These modules will also instruct users on how to identify and contextualize the archival sources that can now be found find online. Third, the project will host an international colloquium on the social and financial history of the Enlightenment in Britain, here at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nA considerable proportion of preliminary research has been completed. In the first year, the PI will consult contextual materials and prepare editorial notes and the volume's Introduction. From Months 13-18, the research assistant will transcribe textual material and compile the bibliography. Also during Months 13-18, the e-learning team at Edina will develop the online modules. The School's Research Office will organise an international colloquium, &quot;Negotiating Enlightenment: Sources and Legacies.&quot; This major event will be hosted in the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology at Edinburgh, with contributions from our graduate students and colleagues, and funding support from external agencies. This colloquium will be held during the project's final month, which will mark the occasion for launching the project's interactive website, and submission of the book-manuscripts to Oxford UP. \n\nThe University of Edinburgh is a world-leading centre for research in the intellectual, commercial, and material history of Enlightenment culture. It is home to the AHRC-funded SCRIPT centre for research in law, technology, and intellectual property, and the AHRC- and RSE-funded Centre for the History of the Book; with the National Library of Scotland nearby, this project team will benefit from outstanding local resources. Beneficiaries of the project will include a cross-disciplinary range of scholars and students, as well as teachers and non-specialists worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013544/1","grantId":"AH/J013544/1","fundValue":"160806","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  I have been invited to give presentations, on my research, to the Antiquarian Booksellers Association (UK), at Stationers Hall, London, on 16 Nov 2014.

I have made use of this research by providing four full-days of educational programming for local primary-level students (ages 8-9) in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. The students learned to examine and interpret visual and material depictions of important historical figures and their associated objects from the eighteenth century. These programmes in the NPG linked directly to the educational curriculum that their teachers (and their assistants), who also attended, are developing in their classrooms. The teachers and their assistants were able to attend and record parts of my on-site programming, and they will be using this material in their classrooms, and on future on-site visits, with their further school cohorts.
