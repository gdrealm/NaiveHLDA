Climate change scenarios indicate that water shortage and shortening of the effective growing season will be increasingly likely in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia increasing the need for short-duration cereals such as pearl millet with enhanced drought tolerance. Although pearl millet is better adapted to water stress compared to other cereals, drought remains one of the most important factors in reducing yield and yield stability of this staple food grain crop of the world's poorest people. Improving pearl millet's tolerance to drought offers a sustainable route to alleviate poverty and food insecurity of pearl millet farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Efficient breeding for drought-prone environments, however, requires selection strategies that are sufficiently independent of the variation inherent in the natural environment to permit identification and use of true genetic differences. Molecular markers linked closely to traits such as pearl millet grain and stover yield during drought will provide increased reliability for selecting and breeding of these traits. The proposed research will conduct targeted genetic mapping of a genomic region on linkage group 2 known to be associated with a major drought tolerance QTL in pearl millet, in combination with precision phenotyping. A large population that is segregating only for the target drought tolerance QTL will be studied with the aim to delimit this QTL and identify closely-spaced markers. In addition, a large and diverse pearl millet germplasm panel will be used to identify additional favourable alleles/haplotypes associated with this QTL, using association genetic analysis. This association mapping is complementary to the targeted mapping approach and will identify more generic gene-based markers within the QTL. These markers would then be available for use in the transfer of this important drought tolerance QTL into a number of elite genetic backgrounds adapted to locations in Africa and Asia, using marker assisted back crossing, in collaboration with participating NARS scientists. Such material would be available as pre-breeding lines for future variety development in different parts of Africa and Asia, and involvement of NARS scientists in the process of this research, will ensure both training as well as the technology transfer. We will also explore potential physiological drought tolerance traits in near isogenic line pairs with and without the LG2 QTL to determine which traits relate to the field drought tolerance in this material. Such physiological information will help design new ideotypes of pearl millet (and other cereals) for drought-prone environments and enhance the understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying this QTL. The direct beneficiaries of this project will be resource poor subsistence farmers in areas of Africa and Asia where pearl millet is the staple cereal and for whom food security is a very big issue. Marker-assisted breeding methods have the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of breeding pearl millet hybrids that have improved drought tolerance together with local adaptation requirements combined with locally-preferred grain quality and improved yield attributes. The output of the proposed project will also provide a ground for map based cloning of drought tolerance gene(s) in future studies. While immediately applicable to pearl millet, generic knowledge and methodologies developed in this project will contribute to the global pool of knowledge in the important research area of drought tolerance and facilitate increased and sustainable crop production in water-limited environments globally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F004133/1","grantId":"BB/F004133/1","fundValue":"630070","fundStart":"2008-06-16","fundEnd":"2012-12-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings of my project are now routinely being used in developing pearl millet varieties for farmers in India and in sub Saharan Africa.

Of these, 18 markers mapped in the DT-QTL region. In addition to LG2, other linkage groups have also been saturated with gene-based markers (Sehgal et al. 2012) \n_ The DT-QTL has been fine mapped to a 3 cM interval and shows 24.3, 15.2, 9.0, 18.9, 24.9, 11.9, 9.5 and 3.6% increased grain yield (GY), panicle harvest \n\n- Pearl millet inbred germplasm association panel (PMiGAP)) that is now a permanent resource to identify genetic variations of pearl millet traits by scientists across the globe.

The reserach outcomes are explioted through links with ICRISAT and Indian pearl millet resreach programmes who are using genetic materials, crosses and linked mlecular markers in their breeding programmes. All genetic materials, crosses, and linked markers developed during the project have been transferred to them and are avalbale with them for use in their programmes.\n\nThe project findings have enabled winning of a new project at Aberystwyth University funded by the Innovate UK (previously known by name Technology Strategy Board; TSB) and industrial partners Unilever and Hindustan Lever Ltd.
