In 2013, Dr Vasanti Jadva was invited to write an article for a special issue on 'surrogacy and children's rights' by the International Reference Centre for the Rights of Children Deprived of their Family, which is a division of the International Social Service, a long-established international NGO (www.iss-ssi.org). In October 2014, UK surrogacy law was debated in Parliament and copies of the published academic papers arising from this study were submitted to the parliamentary committee following the debate. Surrogacy is also currently being debated in New York. The research findings were presented at a conference on surrogacy in New York targeting professionals and policy makers and copies of the published papers were also submitted to the review committee. Findings have also been presented to the Centre for Surrogate Parenting in Los Angeles and at a presentation to the Wellcome Trust.\nDr Vasanti Jadva was invited as key note speaker to Surrogacy Australia's annual conference in April 2013 targeting patient groups and professionals working in the field of surrogacy. She was also invited to speak at a conference on surrogacy in Spain in October 2013. Attendance at these conferences has led to a number of opportunities to network with professionals involved in surrogacy and develop further research projects. This includes a research project currently underway examining the psychological wellbeing and experiences of surrogates in India and a study of post-donation experiences of egg donors in India. \nSusan Imrie, the research assistant employed on the project, is currently carrying out her PhD research at the Centre for Family Research on parenting and child development in families using egg donation and IVF under the supervision of Professor Susan Golombok.\nFinally, findings from this project have been disseminated in a number of ways including two journal articles targeting professionals working in the area of infertility. A podcast of the study's findings has attracted visitors from over 20 countries and the study has been reported in the Herald Scotland and discussed on ABC radio, Australia. In addition, reports of the results were sent to participants and surrogacy organisations in the UK and elsewhere. Research findings focusing on surrogates' perceptions of relatedness have appeared in a book entitled 'Relatedness in assisted reproduction: families, origins and identities' which is part of a series published by Cambridge University Press. A second chapter on how legislation can impact those involved in surrogacy is to be published in the final book of the same series on regulation and reproduction.

Furthermore, no studies had evaluated how the children of surrogates are affected by their mother's decision to be a surrogate. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were administered to 34 surrogates, 11 of their partners and 36 of their children.\n\nThis study found that overall, the long-term health of surrogate mothers was good and they were not experiencing psychological problems. Those surrogates who were in a cohabiting relationship scored average or above average for relationship quality. The majority of surrogates recalled positive experiences of their surrogacy arrangement and most continued to stay in contact with the couples and the resulting child. The frequency of contact varied, with some surrogates maintaining very frequent contact and others not seeing the family at all. Most were happy with the level of contact they had with the family they helped create; it was only when their expectations of contact were not met that surrogates reported feeling disappointment. All surrogates who had no contact with the child were happy for the child to contact them in the future.\n\nWe found a high proportion of surrogates had carried out surrogacy a number of times, the average being 3. This did not appear to impact their psychological health. Reasons for carrying out further surrogacy arrangements included wanting to complete a family, (i.e. by providing a sibling for a child whom they had also gestated), and wanting to help other childless couples to have a child. \n\nNo differences were found between surrogates who had used their own egg for the surrogacy and those that had used the couple's gametes. Contrary to previous studies which have found surrogates undergo either traditional (where the surrogate uses her own egg) or gestational surrogacy (where the surrogate does not use her own egg), this study found that a quarter of women had carried out both types of surrogacy, and their reasons for doing so appeared to be based on their circumstances and those of the couple they wished to help.\n\nSurrogates' partners and their children were generally very supportive of the surrogate's involvement in surrogacy. The vast majority of the surrogates' children viewed surrogacy in a positive light and some mentioned how proud they were of their mother. \n\nOverall, contact between the surrogate and her family, and the parents and child created by surrogacy, was determined by the strength of the relationship between the different parties involved rather than the gestational and genetic connection between them. The findings from this study will inform further research into the experiences of surrogacy for surrogates and intended parents. The research findings will be of benefit to surrogates and their families in the United Kingdom and elsewhere as well as to intended parents thinking of surrogacy as a route to family building. The results of this study are also of importance to professionals involved in surrogacy by informing them of the issues that are of relevance to surrogates and their families. The research findings have been disseminated in a number of ways. The results have been published in peer reviewed journals and in book chapters in the UK and abroad and have been presented at a number of scientific meetings targeting medical professionals, counsellors and other professionals involved in surrogacy and infertility. Furthermore, the results have been presented at academic conferences to interdisciplinary audiences. The research findings have been made available through a number of different formats including podcasts, reports and articles. A project report was compiled which was sent to all participants of the study and data were presented to surrogacy organisations targeting surrogates and intended parents. We plan to continue to disseminate findings in the months ahead. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
