It affects approximately 150,000-200,000 in the UK and that represents a significant burden in terms of reduced quality of life of patient and carer. \n\nThe cause of Parkinson's disease is not yet completely understood, but there are many insights into causes of familial Parkinson's disease which have provided valuable insight into those mechanisms that may result in the disease affecting the majority of people. \n\nThe genetic causes of Parkinson's disease include abnormalities of the PINKl gene. PINKl has been found to be involved in energy production within the cell, there is also response for other important processes such as the generation of free radicals. \n\nThis grant involves four laboratories in the world from the UK, Germany, Italy and Canada. All of which have a major focus of interest on PINKl function. They have come together to collaborate in their research to identify how PINKl deficiency makes individuals susceptible to the development of Parkinson's disease and how this deficiency might also interact with other genetic abnormalities that cause Parkinson's disease. \n\nThe focus is on identifying the sequence of molecular events, the results from PINKl deficiency to identify potential targets that may be suitable for drug intervention to slow or prevent progression of the PINKl related cell abnormalities. These targets will then be assessed in other models of Parkinson's disease and particularly for their suitability to be studied in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J009660/1","grantId":"MR/J009660/1","fundValue":"166357","fundStart":"2012-10-08","fundEnd":"2014-10-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Henry Schapira","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
