These conditions significantly decrease life expectancy and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. We believe that increased steroid (cortisol) production within liver and fat tissue is an important cause of these conditions. Studies using newly developed drugs given to rats and mice with diabetes dramatically improve the condition and lower blood glucose levels to those seen in non-diabetic animals. In addition these drugs appear to reduce blood cholesterol levels and decrease weight. In collaboration with Pfizer inc. we now propose to test the efficacy of these drugs in the first human studies. Using a varriety of techniques we will be able to show that these drugs not only inhibit cortisol production form liver and fat, but that they improve blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and decrease circulating cholesterol levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502165","grantId":"G0502165","fundValue":"298509","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Stewart","coPersons":["Jeremy William Tomlinson"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
