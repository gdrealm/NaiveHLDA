These will be compared with those of 18th -20th -century Ulster Scots in North America and Australia. Monuments are family-commissioned public statements, set within a physical setting of memorials to others of the same and different traditions. \nThe importance given to Scottish or Ulster Scottish textual references, symbols or styles of burial monument can identify remembering; assimilation to local traditions suggests forgetting. A publicly accessible web site will disseminate results.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119562/1","grantId":"119562/1","fundValue":"9190","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2007-01-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Harold Clive Mytum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
