{"id":"97742E81-DA0D-4942-B25E-BB21CC5CB03B","title":"The North East Regional e-Science Centre","abstractText":"The North East Regional e-Science Centre was created in 2001 to advance work on e-science and grid computing in the North East of England. It has developed a particular focus on the design and exploitation of middleware for virtual organisations, and data-intensive e-science. This approach has been successful, and has resulted in the award of over 11M of e-science-related research funding.This proposal is to allow the Centre to continue and develop its work. This would allow it to continue to carry out high-quality research, both in the core computer science that underpins e-science infrastructure, and also in the application of this infrastructure to advance application science. It would also allow it continue to operate as focus for e-science in the North East, providing advice and guidance to both industry and academics working in the area. This includes the deployment of a persistent grid infrastructure to support their work. Finally, it would allow NEReSC to continue to contribute to and influence national &amp; international community activities in e-science and grid computing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D056349/1","grantId":"EP/D056349/1","fundValue":"208384","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Watson","coPersons":["Allen Richard  Wright","Peter  Andras","Anil  Wipat","Santosh  Shrivastava","Aad  Van Moorsel","Darren James Wilkinson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
