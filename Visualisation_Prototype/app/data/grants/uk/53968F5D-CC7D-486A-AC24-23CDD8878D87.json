But the mechanisms by which adults and children\ndevelop the skills to perform such arithmetical tasks remain poorly\nunderstood. Recently researchers have demonstrated robust evidence that\nhumans have an inbuilt 'number sense' which supports approximate\nnumerical operations. But, to date, the role that this system plays in\nthe development of formal symbolic mathematical skills has been\nunclear.\nThe project looks at the role of number sense in adults' arithmetic and\nmathematical performance. In particular the research seeks to determine\nhow number sense interacts with symbolic or verbal representations of\nnumber by examining evidence for two competing models of the\ninteraction. Performance on tasks specifically testing number sense\nskills will be related to performance on more general mathematics tests\nto reveal the role that number sense has in developing mathematics\nperformance more generally. Furthermore, by using a variety of\nexperiments involving adult participants performing a range of symbolic\nand nonsymbolic arithmetic tasks, the researchers will investigate the\ncauses for particular characteristics of number sense that are revealed\nwhen adults solve arithmetic problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G007454/1","grantId":"ES/G007454/1","fundValue":"71843","fundStart":"2009-04-21","fundEnd":"2010-04-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Camilla Kate Gilmore","coPersons":["Matthew  Inglis"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
