Within cells a special template called messenger RNA acts as a blueprint for making proteins. mRNA is produced in a special structure inside the cell called the nucleus, which is encapsulated by a membrane with special holes in it called nuclear pores. The messenger RNA is transported from the nucleus, through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm of a cell which surrounds the nucleus. In the cytoplasm the messenger RNA is decoded to make proteins and this process is essential for cell survival. A special complex of proteins called TREX determines when a messenger RNA is fully processed and ready to leave the nucleus and then helps transport it to the cytoplasm. The TREX complex has many subunits, some of which we have only just discovered. We do not understand what all the subunits of TREX do nor how they all come together to make the complex and transport the messenger RNA. In this proposal we aim to establish how the TREX complex assembles and examine what each subunit within the complex does. Recent work from other scientists has shown that the TREX complex may play other important functions in the cell such as producing special small RNA molecules called short interfering RNAs which interfere with the synthesis of proteins. Therefore our studies on how the TREX complex assembles and works is likely to help us considerably advance our understanding of how proteins are synthesised in cells. Since the TREX complex is conserved from yeast through to man, our studies are likely to have a broad impact in many areas which affect society including food production and understanding what keeps humans healthy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015067/1","grantId":"BB/J015067/1","fundValue":"426391","fundStart":"2012-07-05","fundEnd":"2015-11-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart A Wilson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
