A random distribution of grains is dispersed across the hard drive surface: the media itself is featureless and the write head defines the bit locations. These magnetic particles (grains) cannot continue to decrease in size indefinitely as the thermal energy will become sufficient to flip the magnetisation of the magnetic domain, leading to data loss. Therefore, it is imperative that new magnetic materials are developed. If the bit size is to decrease further towards a few nanometres, we move into the realm of magnetic molecules, which are easy to synthesise, cheap and are monodisperse, allowing for self-assembly of an array of molecular bits on a surface. However, current synthetic approaches to these magnetic molecules rely heavily upon the random assembly of transition metal ions from a reaction mixture containing organic ligands. This method affords little synthetic control over the reaction product and hence, little control over the resultant magnetic properties of the molecule. Therefore, these magnetic molecules display their interesting properties only at very low temperatures. To increase the so-called blocking temperature, we need much greater control over their synthesis.We will use a step-by-step self-assembly synthetic approach to prepare improved molecular nanomagnets (single-molecule magnets or SMMs). We will track the assembly of these molecules in solution, from their carefully designed precursors, using mass spectrometry. This technique will allow us to control the synthesis of heterometallic complexes, which will contain between two and four different types of magnetic ions. We will be able to control exactly where each type of ion resides within the magnetic molecule, e.g. producing core-shell structures. This level of synthetic control will allow us to control both the magnetic exchange coupling and the magnetic anisotropy. This incredible level of control over the key magnetic properties will allow us to synthesise single-molecule magnets with unprecedented structures and blocking temperatures that surpass the current world record.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I027203/1","grantId":"EP/I027203/1","fundValue":"348476","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Murrie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" A new building-block approach for the preparation of core-shell heterometallic complexes with unprecedented structures, where the single molecule magnet properties can be designed at the molecular level using two different metal ions. We have shown how quantum tunneling, which destroys the magnetic properties, of lanthanide ions can be controlled by coupling the lanthanide ion to copper ions. This research contributes to the design and understanding of new high-technology materials, which have potential long term applications in diverse areas such as molecular spintronics, low temperature refrigeration or ultra-high-density information storage. Our directed assembly synthetic methodology is adaptable and hence, will have wide appeal within the fields of not only molecular magnetism, but also coordination / inorganic / supramolecular / materials chemistry and crystal engineering.
