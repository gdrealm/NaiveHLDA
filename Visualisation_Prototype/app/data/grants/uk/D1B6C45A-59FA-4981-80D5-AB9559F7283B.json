These phenomena (temperature, mass transport) can be directly measured and quantified in electrochemical experiments employing nanoelectrodes. At very small electrodes turbulence can be suppressed and unusually fast convective flow can be achieved (driven by microwave induced thermal gradients) giving high currents and beneficial effects e.g. kinetic resolution in analytical applications (sulphide, thiol, arsenite, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.). More importantly, the adsorption of microwaves into the double layer of interfaces with sufficiently fast RC time constant (e.g. at nanoelectrodes) has never been reported and may again lead to novel chemical phenomena (e.g. for processes involving H2, CO2, or CO adsorbates on Pt, Pd, or Au). These kinds of processes (which occur only at nanoelectrodes or nanoparticles) could be important for sensor and fuel cell processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F025726/1","grantId":"EP/F025726/1","fundValue":"263901","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Marken","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
