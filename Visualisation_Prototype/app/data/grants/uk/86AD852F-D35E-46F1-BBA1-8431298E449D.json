{"id":"86AD852F-D35E-46F1-BBA1-8431298E449D","title":"Neurobiology of resilience to depression","abstractText":"Depression is the most common mental health problem, affecting as many as 1 in 5 people during their lives. It is a significant economic and social burden as well as causing distress to affected individuals and their families. Although a number of factors are involved in causing depression, we know that experiencing stressful life events triggers many depressive episodes. By contrast, there are individuals who can experience large amounts of life stress without becoming depressed, a trait called resilience. We know very little about the reasons why some people are more resilient than others. This research will use modern techniques to investigate whether there is an identifiable brain basis for resilience. If a distinct profile associated with resilience exists, this has potential implications for developing therapeutic approaches that could help prevent people with major life stress from developing depression.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900593","grantId":"G0900593","fundValue":"536852","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Elliott","coPersons":["Ian  Anderson","Gabriella  Juhasz","Bill  Deakin","Barbara Jacquelyn Sahakian"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
