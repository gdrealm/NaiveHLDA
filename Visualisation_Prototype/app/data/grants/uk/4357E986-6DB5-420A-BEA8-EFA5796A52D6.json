To develop treatments for these, the ability to control of neurons on surfaces and an understanding of the processes involved is imperative. We are exploring the use of techniques borrowed from the microelectronics industry to make shaped surfaces which we hope, in combination with controlled surface chemistry, will encourage neurons to grow in straight lines and form connections. It is hoped that this will provide useful information on regeneration processes and may in the future even be developed into a therapy to help peripheral nerve regeneration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701849","grantId":"G0701849","fundValue":"105393","fundStart":"2008-11-10","fundEnd":"2009-11-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Morgan Russell Alexander","coPersons":["Jing  Yang","Terence Leonard Parker"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
