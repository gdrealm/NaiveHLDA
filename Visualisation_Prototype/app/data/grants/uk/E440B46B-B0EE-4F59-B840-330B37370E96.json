Currently more than 1,000 organisms have been completely sequenced and nearly 10 million protein sequences determined. In 2000 the human genome was completed and the latest estimates say it contains between 23,000 and 25,000 protein-coding genes. It is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to determine the functional properties of all these proteins and for many organisms, including human, fewer than 15% of the proteins have been directly experimentally characterised to determine their function. Therefore, a major activity and challenge for bioinformatics groups has been the need to devise computational methods for inferring the functions of proteins. Most predictive methods exploit the premise that proteins in different species are related to each other (homologues) as they have evolved from a common ancestral protein. These homologous proteins frequently share similar functional properties, conserved during evolution. Therefore, many methods search for similarities in the sequences of proteins, indicative of an evolutionary relationship, which then allows functional information to be inherited. In other words, a protein that has been experimentally characterised in fly, for example, can be used to assign functional properties to an evolutionary related protein identified in human. The main challenge faced by these approaches is the fact that gene duplication occurs in all organisms throughout evolution. Therefore, as well as the original copy of a protein, derived from an ancestral protein, there can be additional copies which may have evolved slightly modified functions to expand the functional repertoire of the organism, thereby enhancing its survival. We have developed a resource (CATH-Gene3D) which groups proteins into evolutionary families on the basis of similarities in their 3D structures (where available) and their sequences. Currently, more than 2,200 families are classified in CATH-Gene3D accounting for the majority of protein domain sequences. Some of these families contain very many sequences as the proteins have been highly duplicated in organisms. These families pose a challenge to function prediction methods as the functions of the relatives have frequently diverged. We have designed a new method (GeMMA) which uses a sophisticated approach for comparing sets of evolutionary sequences to group them into subfamilies of proteins, which are very likely to share functional properties. Whilst GeMMA has been shown to be accurate in transferring functional information between relatives it can take a long time to run for the very large families in CATH-Gene3D. Therefore, to speed it up, this project will modify the GeMMA protocol so that we can run it on a wide range of publicly available HPC resources. We will also develop highly intuitive web pages to make the information provided by the GeMMA subfamilies very accessible for the biology community. This web site will also allow biologists to submit a query protein of unknown function which will then be searched against the GeMMA subfamilies to predict a putative function. CATH-Gene3D is already widely used by biologists and this new functional sub-classification will make the resource even more valuable to these researchers by providing more precise functional annotations for the novel proteins they are studying.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H02364X/1","grantId":"BB/H02364X/1","fundValue":"108971","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Functional families derived by DFX have been used by two structural genomics consortia in the States to select uncharacterised relatives from protein domain families for structure determination:\n- Midwest Centre for Structural Genomics to target important functional subfamilies found in bacterial organisms in the human gut microbiome\n- Centre for Structural Genomics in Infectious Diseases to target functional sub-families likely to be associated with virulence or drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria.\n\nDFX functional families have also been used to predict which proteins are likely to be interacting/associating in signalling networks implicated in neuropathic pain - this was performed by inheriting protein interactions across functional families.

Therefore computational methods which exploit the conservation of protein functions in evolutionary families of proteins are valuable for suggesting putative functions for uncharacterised proteins, which can then be tested experimentally. Although 2,700 domain structure families have been identified in our in-house CATH-Gene3D resource, some of these are very diverse in their structures and functions. Whilst these diverse families account for less than 10% of families, they comprise nearly 70% of all known sequences. Therefore, it is important to know how function has diverged within these families in order to improve the inheritance of functional properties to uncharacterised relatives assigned to them.\n \nThis project developed a novel algorithm (DFX) for protein function prediction based on functional sub-classification of superfamilies in the CATH database. The method involved a computationally expensive clustering protocol that grouped relatives according to similarities in their sequences. In order to run this method on all the large, diverse families a new computational platform was developed that allowed the method to be run on the Amazon Cloud and on a large, computer farm (Legion) at UCL. The method was independently validated in an international function prediction competition and came 7th out 56 methods for prediction of molecular function. It was also found to perform well in predicting residue sites likely to be involved in the function of the protein. The DFX method has improved the functional classification of relatives in CATH and will be used for regularly updating this data. CATH functional information is widely used by the biological community - the CATH resource receives more than 2 million web page accesses per month from more than 10,000 unique visitors. \n\nCATH is a member database in the widely accessed InterPro resource hosted at the EBI, which has more than 5 million webpage accesses per month. Sequence profiles generated by DFX are being used by InterPro to provide more accurate functional annotations for protein domain regions. \n\nFunctional families derived by DFX can be used for assigning functions to metagenome sequences and will therefore be valuable for researchers interpreting this data.
