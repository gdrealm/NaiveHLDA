By analysing the impact of ethnicity on patterns of recorded crime and on decision-making at every point in the criminal justice system during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, this project aims to provide this vital comparative perspective. It will focus primarily on London, with its growing black and Irish population, and will ask - Were these ethnic groups over-represented among those accused of property crime, violent crime etc? and were they were more likely to be found guilty and to receive harsher punishments? It will also look at the experiences of ethnic groups as prosecutors and victims. Was there, for example, more sympathy for black victims than for Irish ones, or was there a fairly systematic bias against almost all migrant groups? Were they subjected to particular types of ethnically motivated crimes? More generally, by looking both at patterns of decision-making, and at the language used when ethnic minorities appeared in court as prosecutors, victims or accused, the aim will be to gain a deeper understanding of attitudes towards and discourses about race and ethnicity in this period.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034253/1","grantId":"ES/F034253/1","fundValue":"79577","fundStart":"2008-03-17","fundEnd":"2009-03-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John King","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
