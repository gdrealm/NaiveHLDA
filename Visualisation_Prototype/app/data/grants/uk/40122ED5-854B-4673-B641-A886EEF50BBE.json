This technology allows us to mutate RNA virus genomes through DNA copies (cDNA) of the RNA genome. The new genome cDNA can then be used to obtain the mutated form of the virus. In these studies we will use an existing vaccine for peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), as a vector to deliver antigens from other economically important viruses. PPRV causes a devastating plague in small ruminants and has a severe impact on animal welfare and the economies of many countries in Africa and Asia. In previous studies using this technology with a related virus, rinderpest virus (RPV), we were able to express foreign proteins efficiently in infected cells and to produce effective marker vaccines for RPV as well as identify some of the molecular factors which determine differences in virulence between virus strains. Recently it has been shown that the genome of measles virus (MV), a closely related virus, can be artificially segmented and that cDNAs of these segments can be used in a similar way to the full-length nonsegmented cDNA to rescue viable virus. The segmentation and rescue of PPRV will provide a new way to deliver immunogens from other small ruminant viral pathogens. Work with other nonsegmented negative strand (NNS) viruses has shown that there is a limit to the amount of extra genetic material that can be added to NNS virus genomes before a reduction in virus viability is seen. Segmentation of NNS genome can effectively overcome this limit, as evidenced by the ability of the segmented MV to encode at up to six foreign proteins efficiently. If this is applicable to related viruses then it would increase their coding capacity and enable us to produce multivalent vaccines to simultaneously protect against several economically important diseases of ruminants and increase their cost-effectiveness. Whilst RPV has been virtually eliminated from the globe as a result of a concerted vaccination campaign over the past 20 years, PPRV is a disease emerging in new regions of the world and is now causing great economic losses across much of the developing world as well as on the borders of the European Union. The current live-attenuated vaccines developed for PPRV are safe and highly effective and are, therefore, ideal candidates for use as vaccine vectors that can be tagged to allow differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals. We wish to explore the segmented approach using PPRV as a vector delivery system for multiple antigens from other economically significant viruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), insect borne pathogens which can infect cattle and sheep, the latter also being able to infect humans. BTV and RVFV were once considered exotic diseases although recently BTV has entered the European Union, having a devastating effect on agriculture. RVFV has the potential to also enter Europe as insect vectors that carry BTV may also competent for RVFV infection. Current use of the PPRV vaccine generates a sterilising immunity that gives lifelong protection against the virus and, for RVFV, a similar response is thought to be generated post vaccination. However, for BTV a number of distinct genetic variants exist which, although diverse, cluster across distinct geographical regions. We wish to develop vaccines that target viruses circulating within a specific areas. Both RVFV and BTV are endemic across much of Asia and Africa and effective vaccination strategies are integral to their control. The three viral diseases targeted in this proposal are in line with the BBSRC's combating diseases of the developing world strategy as well as DFID's long term commitment to improving the sustainability of agriculture in developing countries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009485/1","grantId":"BB/H009485/1","fundValue":"797291","fundStart":"2011-01-17","fundEnd":"2015-01-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley Charles Banyard","coPersons":["Andrew John Easton","Anthony Richard Fooks","Satya  Parida"],"organisation":"Animal Health & Veterinary Lab Agency","findingsText":" This grant has enabled the first recovery of peste des petts ruminants virus from a DNA copy of its genome.
