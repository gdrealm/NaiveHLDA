Although Bluetooth and wired hand-free kits are popular, a vast majority of voice calls are made with the phone held at the side of the head by the hand. The maximum levels of radio frequency radiation transmitted from mobile phones are carefully regulated because some of that energy is absorbed in the body, mainly in the head and hand. Mobile phones are tested to strict standards to ensure the radiation absorbed in the head is below international guidelines. Although the hand plays an important role in most real-life voice calls, the testing procedures do not include the hand. This is because some researchers in the past have shown that the hand reduces the energy absorbed in the head and so excluding the hand from the measurement was thought to provide a conservative estimate. With recent developments in phone technologies such as smaller handsets, internal antennas and higher operating frequencies, researchers have shown that the hand can significantly increase the radiation into the head. However, these findings have yet to be fully investigated and understood. This research proposal will carry out a comprehensive volunteer-based investigation looking at how the hand influences the energy absorbed inside the head. By recruiting hundreds of volunteers, we will attempt to link the radiation absorbed inside the head to factors such as hand size and volume, phone grip style and finger positions, skin conductivity etc. Energy absorption rates are measured during the experiments by using a highly sophisticated model of a head that contains hundreds of miniature electrical sensors. By performing detailed statistical analysis on the gathered data, we will be able to determine what proportion of the mobile phone using public is likely to experience an increase in the energy absorbed. In parallel studies, we aim to uncover how the hand influences the battery life of mobile phones and if the radiated energy from mobile phones change due to wear and tear over time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I032231/1","grantId":"EP/I032231/1","fundValue":"99822","fundStart":"2011-07-11","fundEnd":"2013-10-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The biggest impact to date has been on the +450 people, of which a significant proportion are children, who took part in the study. Considerably more people spoke to us about mobile phones and their use. We estimate the audience has been close to 1500. Participants were required to complete a questionnaire. The results show that many have not thought about the safety implications of prolonged mobile phone use. Polls taken at the end of each presentation showed that there was a considerable shift in opinion towards limiting mobile phone use.

A gap of 3 to 4cm between the palm and the back of the phone has the biggest effect. In some users, the energy absorbed in the head was doubled. In rare cases, the power levels in the head exceeded those set by international standards. For a majority of cases, when the phone was held in a natural grip, the power absorbed in the head was reduced. The material produced for this study along with the equipment purchased can be used in future public (especially children), engagement activities, such as open days, school visits. It increases awareness of mobile phone radiation and a general interest in Engineering. Some of these activities are already taking place.\nThe next stage is to disseminate the data more widely and take part in focused discussions on how the Phone radiation (SAR) measurement standards can be improved to take into account the findings.
