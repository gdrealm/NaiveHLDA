This molecule is called TACC3 and appears to be particularly active in so called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumours that represent the most aggressive form of brain cancer. Patients presenting with this disease have a median survival time of only approximately 12-24 months, which is due to resistance of GBM to currently available treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. GBM tumours are diffuse and invade the normal brain tissue, which makes it impossible to completely remove the cancer via surgery. Tumour residues after surgery often lead to quick relapse due to re-growth of the tumour. Importantly, this recurrent tumour growth has been recently attributed to a specific fraction of cells within the tumor mass that are able to evade standard therapies. These so called brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) are at the root of an organ-like tumour organization feeding tumour growth during the whole course of the disease. Therefore, specific treatments targeting BTSCs are expected to improve the efficiency of brain cancer therapy and a better understanding of BTSC biology, including appropriate 'drugable' target molecules, is urgently needed. Our focus is on the molecule TACC3 because previous studies and preliminary work link TACC3 function to BTSC and we aim to inhibit TACC3 with specific gene silencing and our drug-like small molecule that inhibits TACC3. Utilizing these research tools, we will reveal which role TACC3 plays in BTSCs and how it promotes their malignant behaviour in cell cultures of GBM-derived BTSCs and in valid in vivo models of BTSC-driven brain tumour development. Our recent work has also implicated TACC3 in the biology of normal brain stem cells that exist in distinct brain areas and that can become a source of brain cancer due to abnormal gene modifications. Strikingly, TACC3 is abnormally elevated in GBM and in GBM-derived BTSCs and we aim to investigate whether and how TACC3 can transform non-cancerous brain stem cells into BTSCs, and how the regulation of genes is differently controlled by TACC3 in BTSCs compared with normal brain stem cells. Overall, our proposed study will provide new insights into the mechanisms that maintain the malignant program of BTSCs and into TACC3 as a candidate driver of GBM development and a potential anti-tumour drug target. Ultimately, our goal is to accelerate the development of more effective treatment strategies against malignant brain cancers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J001171/1","grantId":"MR/J001171/1","fundValue":"437685","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2015-12-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Heiko  Wurdak","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
