For example, ice-sheet melting in West Antarctica contributes ~11% to the present global sea-level rise of ~1.8 mm per year. A complete melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is likely to take several hundreds or thousands of years, would raise global sea level by ~5 m. This project aims to study the part of the WAIS that is currently showing the most dramatic indications for ice-sheet melting: the Amundsen Sea sector. Global sea level would rise by additional ~1.4 m, if the ice located in the Amundsen Sea sector would melt completely, which is possible to occur within the next two centuries. This melting would cause devastating flooding in many low-lying cities (e.g. New Orleans, London), agricultural areas (e.g. Netherlands, Bangladesh) and atolls (e.g. Maldives), with immense social, economic and ecological consequences. Until now, however, it is unclear if the melting of the WAIS has been occurring for some time and might continue long into the future, or if it is a relatively short-lived phenomenon. It is also unclear if the present WAIS melting is the result of climate warming, which has been ongoing since the end of the last ice age (~12,000 years ago), or of the mainly man-made greenhouse effect, which has influenced global climate for the last 150 years. Therefore, it is essential to study the history of the WAIS since the last ice age, which is the main scientific objective of the proposed project. In the proposed project the history of WAIS will be reconstructed by studying the sediments that make up the sea floor on the continental shelf that surrounds West Antarctica. These sediments are collected by coring several metres down into the seabed. Work that has already been done on the cores selected for this project shows that the WAIS extended far onto the shelf during the last ice age and retreated since then. The project will attempt to determine the timescale and speed of this retreat by the reliable dating of sediments in several cores. The timing of the ice retreat from a particular core site can be determined by radiocarbon dating of the organic remains of planktonic micro-organisms in the sediments. These organisms lived in the ocean waters that flooded onto the shelf as soon as the ice retreated. When the organisms died, their remains were deposited on the seafloor. Thus, their age reveals when the sediment was formed. Scientists have previously tried to date WAIS retreat from the shelf, but many of their dates are uncertain. This is because the marine sediments contain not only the remains from organisms alive shortly before sediment formation, but also much older, fossil organic remains. These remains were eroded from old sedimentary rocks in the Antarctic hinterland by the ice sheet. Glaciers transported the fossil remains and other detritus to the coast and released them into the sea, where they were deposited together with the remains of those planktonic organisms, which just have died. The fossil organic remains increase the apparent radiocarbon age of a sediment sample. The project will use an improved radiocarbon dating technique, which will overcome this problem and provide more accurate radiocarbon ages. Additionally, the project will apply another (independent) technique for dating the sediments. The intensity of the earth's magnetic field changed in a well-known pattern throughout the last 12,000 years. The project will use sophisticated methods for determining the relative variations of the magnetic intensity of the sediments: these reflect the global magnetic intensity variations. The relative magnetic intensity variations of the sediment cores can then be used to determine their age, and thus the time of ice retreat. The results of the proposed project will aid to a much more accurate prediction of future sea-level rise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F000359/1","grantId":"NE/F000359/1","fundValue":"60988","fundStart":"2007-11-13","fundEnd":"2010-09-12","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our research will help ice-sheet modellers to validate and improve their computer models and thus improve predictions of future sea-level rise in response to polar ice-sheet melting.

The floating ice shelves hold back the ice on land. A critical issue in understanding the dynamical behaviour of polar ice sheets is to reconstruct how the ‘grounding line’, i.e. the position where the ice sitting on land (glaciers) begins to float (ice shelves), has retreated landward over time. Satellite data available for the last 20 years show that since 1992 the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, which drain the West Antarctic Ice Sheet into the Amundsen Sea, have experienced significant thinning (melting), flow acceleration and rapid landward retreat of their grounding lines, with that of Pine Island Glacier having retreated up to 25 km. It is possible that the grounding lines of these glaciers may retreat even further inland over coming decades, because the bed of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests well below sea-level on the continent and dips landward towards the interior of the continent. Such an ice-sheet configuration is thought to be vulnerable to regional climate warming and changes in ocean circulation. Our research (see paper Hillenbrand et al. 2013, Geology) offers new clues about the recent rapid ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and helps scientists make better predictions about future sea-level rise. We were able to establish a timeline for ice loss and glacier retreat from the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea since the last ice age by obtaining reliable radiocarbon dates on calcareous microfossils from marine sediment cores that were recovered from the shelf within 110 km of the modern grounding line. These dates provided the minimum age of grounded ice-sheet retreat from a particular core position. We could demonstrate that the inner continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea sector was already free of grounded ice by ca. 10,000 years before present. Moreover, the reliable deglaciation ages enabled us to calculate maximum retreat rates from the core sites to the modern grounding line of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We could demonstrate that the rapid changes observed by satellites over the last 20 years at Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers may well be exceptional and are unlikely to have happened more than three or four times in the last 10,000 years. Our study revealed that episodes of fast glacier retreat similar to that observed over recent decades can only have occurred very rarely during the previous 10,000 years. Our new findings can be used to improve the accuracy of computer models that are essential to predict future ice loss in the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its likely contribution to global sea-level rise. The direct beneficiaries of our research are ice-sheet modellers who can use our data to validate and improve their models used to predict future ice-sheet melting and resulting global sea-level rise.
