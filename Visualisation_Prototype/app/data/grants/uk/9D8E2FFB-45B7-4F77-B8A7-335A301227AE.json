It examines the processes of adjustment and change, loss of job and subsequent work trajectories, the possible loss of income, health impacts, and the potential changes of address, school and travel to work patterns affecting ex-workers and their families, as well as the wider 'ripple effect' for their neighbourhoods.</p>\n\n<p>Specific objectives are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To collate evidence related to the economic and social impacts of the closure;</li>\n\n <li>To use this evidence to evaluate the differential impact of change;</li>\n\n <li>To consider the role of community resilience through networks in minimising the impact of manufacturing decline;</li>\n\n <li>To evaluate agency intervention in dealing with the impacts of closure; and</li>\n\n <li>To contribute to the discussion of policy and practice around effective intervention and strategies for areas affected by manufacturing decline.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The research will include a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, with the main body of the research comprising a third wave survey of around 300 ex-Rover workers using the methodology and sample used by the Work Foundation in its 2006 report.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2478","grantId":"RES-000-22-2478","fundValue":"79979","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Bailey","coPersons":["Stephen George Hall","Gill  Bentley","Alex  De Ruyter","Caroline Alexandra Chapain"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
