Social networks at this intermediate level of geography are arguably the 'missing link' that can help us to understand how, when and where religious practice is (or is not) successfully maintained and transmitted.</p> \n<p>The research makes use of the International Congregational Life Survey, possibly the largest professionally organised enquiry into religious activity ever undertaken, providing detailed records on almost a million respondents in four countries: Australia, New Zealand, England and the USA.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1816","grantId":"RES-000-22-1816","fundValue":"80948","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Voas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
