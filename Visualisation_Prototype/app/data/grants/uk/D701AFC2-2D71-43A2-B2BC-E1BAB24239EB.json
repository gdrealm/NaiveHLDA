Built out of an alphabet of only 24 small molecules joined into long chains, in folded-form they constitute the structures, scaffolds, signalling pathways, transport systems, motors and cargo transporters of the tissues and cells of all living things. Since their exquisitely evolved and precise structures have been elucidated through X-ray scattering, the emphasis has been on understanding how these structures lead to function (such as binding to specific small molecules at special pockets and clefts). More recently however, it has become clear that the constant dynamical excitations of proteins, a natural consequence of a finite-temperature environment, also play a vital role in function. Data from careful thermal analysis, and also from magnetic resonance measurements, have shown how binding events at proteins can change the nature of their internal ceaseless wobbling considerably. Furthermore, recent work by the applicants has shown how mathematical and physical models of proteins can analyse these motions and identify how their changes are used to generate vital signals within protein networks. These control all aspects of cell function, so understanding them is very important in biology.The goal of this project is to build on the initial foundations of coarse-grained protein modelling and link the global models of entire protein molecules to their atomistic structure in a predictive way. The physicists and chemists will work with biologists in validating these new tools on a series of model protein systems. By making tiny changes in the proteins ( mutations ), predictions of the models can be tested by experiments. A particular goal is to use the technique to design a new protein with entirely new allostetric properties that have been engineered into the protein on the basis of the course-grained model. This will demonstrate a potential route to commercialisation of the science in biotechnology.At the end of the project, a systematic analytical tool for global protein dynamics will be available to the community, both academic and industrial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051759/1","grantId":"EP/H051759/1","fundValue":"861489","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant has just finished so there is limited use by others so far. however, we know of three research groups elsewhere in the world who have downloaded our protein dynamics modelling software, and used it to design their own experiments.\nIn addition the idea of using it for drug design is under discussion.
