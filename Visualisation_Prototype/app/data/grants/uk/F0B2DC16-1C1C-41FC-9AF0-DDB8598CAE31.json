The affected eye is unable to see sharply or to read. In the UK it occurs in about 5000 people each year and develops in both eyes in 10% of affected cases. It usually occurs in the elderly. Treatment is available in the form of surgery where a gas bubble is put into the eye and the patient is asked to posture face-downwards for up to 1 week. This posturing is at best very uncomfortable and may be impossible for many elderly patients. The operation can close the hole in most cases but the vision only returns to near normal in about one third of patients.\n\nThe reasons why a macular hole develops and why operations can be successful are unclear and this has hampered the development of macular hole surgery. Most surgeons now believe that the macular hole is a split in the retina which then enlarges due to a tightening of the retina. They believe that the operation succeeds by removing tight tissue on the surface of the retina and because physical forces then stretch the tissue back into the hole.\n\nAt the University of Leeds Professors Greig and Savage in the School of Physics and Astronomy have been studying the forces involved in closing a macular hole together with Mr Woon, Consultant Vitreo-retinal surgeon at St James?s University Hospital in Leeds. They have previously examined the role of surface tension forces at the edge of a macular hole following an operation using theoretical and simulation techniques. However, they now believe that the forces produced during the removal of the fluid from the eye may be even more important. The edge of a column of fluid being aspirated over the hole behaves like an elastic membrane bringing the edges of the hole together. The objective of the proposal is therefore to simulate such forces by experimental and analytical techniques to determine the key parameters including the level of gas fill and the design and material of the aspirating equipment. This is not a force which has been previously considered by surgeons. We believe that such a refinement of the technique should lead to a reduction in the length of posturing, making the operation accessible to a larger number of elderly patients in accordance with the Cross-Council Lifelong Health and Wellbeing Initiative.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802583","grantId":"G0802583","fundValue":"97715","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis.
