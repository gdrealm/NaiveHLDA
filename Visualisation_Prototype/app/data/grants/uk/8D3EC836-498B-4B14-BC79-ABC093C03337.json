Stem-cell based, tissue engineered laryngeal replacement.","abstractText":"Irreversible damage to the larynx (?voice-box?) can result in considerable reduction in quality of life with problems breathing, speaking and swallowing, thus preventing the normal integration of people into society. The creation of a complete replacement would require complex muscular activity which is beyond the scope of the work we propose here. However, the successful restoration of critical structural support and a new lining would restore the joys of speech, swallowing and, indeed, normal human interaction to many people. We will build on the breakthrough we achieved by regenerating the trachea (?windpipe?) of a young woman in Spain by using patients? own stem cells and mucous membrane cells, combined with a non-rejecting matrix support, to restore parts of the larynx destroyed by disease, accident or cancer. This would be a major breakthrough for surgery and the lessons learnt will help the development of regenerative cures for a host of other diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001539","grantId":"G1001539","fundValue":"1153540","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Anthony Birchall","coPersons":["Sam  Janes","Paolo  Macchiarini","Christopher  Mason","Alexander Marcus Seifalian","Mark William Lowdell"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
