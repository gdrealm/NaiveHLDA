{"id":"B973D9BA-2458-4286-A189-0886D61E4A47","title":"Integrating Quantitative Methods into the Politics Curriculum: a seminar-based approach","abstractText":"<p>While many politics departments offer an undergraduate module in quantitative methods, problems remain when it comes to integrating the study of quantitative methods into the broader curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>The project will solve this problem by providing teaching materials that will help lecturers discuss quantitative methods in their substantive modules.These materials will be based on academic journal articles using quantitative methods, but provide the necessary background materials to facilitate discussion in seminars of more substantive modules. Each set of teaching materials would consist of a small group of articles (1-3) that might normally be discussed in a seminar, plus an explication of the relevant quantitative results and a discussion guide for the seminar leader. In order to make the materials useful for staff at a number of universities, the project will create sets of materials for an introductory international relations module, a British politics module, and an American politics module. These materials will be created during a series of workshops that brings together quantitative and qualitative scholars from across the UK. These materials will be distributed via OPOSSEM, an open source portal for teaching materials on research methods in the social sciences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J01186X/1","grantId":"ES/J01186X/1","fundValue":"31615","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily  Clough","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
