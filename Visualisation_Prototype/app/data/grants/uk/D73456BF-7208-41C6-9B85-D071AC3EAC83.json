{"id":"D73456BF-7208-41C6-9B85-D071AC3EAC83","title":"Primordial black holes","abstractText":"Primordial black holes (PBHs) could have formed in the early Universe as a result of the compression associated with the Big Bang. Because they span an enormous mass range, PBHs provide a unique probe of the early Universe, gravitational collapse and high energy physics. They could also be small enough for Hawking radiation to be important. The overall goal of this proposal is to make more realistic calculations of the PBH abundance in the Universe and to better understand their cosmological consequences. The first project will focus on their abundance. In recent years there has been a dichotomy between research on the theoretical and numerical fronts but further progress requires that one combines these approaches. The main objective of this project is therefore to establish reliable links between detailed realistic hydrodynamical calculations of PBH formation and analytical evaluations of their abundance. The second project will focus on the cosmological consequences of PBHs, in particular their relevance to dark matter, dark energy and dark dimensions. This will involve a study of the interaction between black holes and the scalar fields, thought to pervade the early and current universe. It will also involve studying the possible production of black holes in accelerator experiments, this having important implications for the dimensionality of the early Universes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001874/1","grantId":"PP/E001874/1","fundValue":"98534","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Bernard  Carr","coPersons":["Alexander  Polnarev"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
