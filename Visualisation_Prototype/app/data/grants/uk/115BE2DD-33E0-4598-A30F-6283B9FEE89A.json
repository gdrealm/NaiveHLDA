The documents include correspondence, accounts, wills and inventories, partnership agreements, insurance policies and property deeds that illuminate better than most surviving sources the Jamaican end of British merchant firms engaged in West India trade when Jamaica was the wealthiest territory in Britain's Atlantic empire. The introductory analysis focuses on issues contained in the documents connected with slavery and the slave trade, capital accumulation, and the risk environment of the Caribbean.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501024/1","grantId":"AH/D501024/1","fundValue":"27110","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenneth  Morgan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
