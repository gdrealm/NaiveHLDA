{"id":"709F0F4F-7437-4ED7-BF93-7FC21CE1CBCA","title":"Kv7/KCNQ(M) potassium channels and nociception","abstractText":"Potassium channels are proteins that span the outer membrane of nerve cells. The pores open when the nerve cells are active, and allow charged potassium ions to move from inside the nerve cell to the outside. As a result, the nerve cell membrane becomes hyperpolarized and the activity of the cell is reduced. The Kv7 family of potassium channels is interesting because members of this family play an important role in regulating nerve cell activity, and also because mutations in their genes cause certain genetic diseases. In some previous work, we showed that these (Kv7) channels are present in the sensory neurons that conduct pain impulses to the central nervous system (cns), and that a drug called retigabine, which increases the activity of these channels, reduced the transmission of some forms of painful stimuli in the first pain-receiving station in the spinal cord and reduced the behavioural responses of rats to the pain associated with chronic inflammation. We now wish to find out more about the role of these potassium channels in regulating the generation and transmission of painful stimuli, and more precisely how increasing their activity reduces chronic pain. We will do this by recording the electrical discharges in sensory pain fibres from the skin and the transmission of sensory ?painful? (nociceptive) impulses in the spinal cord. We will also test what happens to the perception and transmission of painful stimuli in mice in which one copy of the gene encoding one of the Kv7 proteins has been deleted. (We have a colony of such mice.) We then want to find out to whether substances that cause pain when released from damaged cells exert some of their effect by inhibiting these channels, and whether nerve injury alters the number and distribution of these channels. Although many drugs can reduce pain, they are generally not so effective in chronic inflammatory pain (e.g., in cancer or arthritis) or neuropathic pain (i.e., due to nerve injury), whereas retigabine seems unusually effective in animal models of such forms of pain. We hope our work will show why this is so, and perhaps help toward the development of better drugs for treating chronic and neuropathic pain states. We will not be trying to develop drugs ourselves, but shall be interacting with a pharmaceutical company via a separate EU Consortium, and with the wider biomedical community through the London Pain Consortium and other avenues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500194","grantId":"G0500194","fundValue":"480351","fundStart":"2005-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Anthony Brown","coPersons":["Anthony Henry Dickenson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
