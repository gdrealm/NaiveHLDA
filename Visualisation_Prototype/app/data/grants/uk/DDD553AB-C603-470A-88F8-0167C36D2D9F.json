However, recent qualitative research suggests that although different family forms are emerging (the ‘new family’), people value moral commitment to others just as much as before, and accept these new forms as adequate means of doing so. </p> \n<p>The proposal aims to assess this claim through gathering representative national data, primarily through a British Social Attitudes Survey and supplementary census analysis The project will ask how far, and in what ways, are family moralities and practises ‘individualised’ in contemporary Britain, and to what degree are less conventional and extra-family forms accepted as adequate for partnering, parenting and caring. </p> \n<p>It will examine attitudes and practices around: </p> \n<ol> \n <li>Partnership commitment in cohabitation and marriage.</li> \n <li>Non-conventional partnerships (Living Apart Together, same sex, non-conjugal.</li> \n <li>Friendship. </li> \n <li>Divorce / separation.</li> \n <li>State intervention in family life. </li>\n</ol> \n<p>The project will also ask how these attitudes and practices are socially and geographically patterned, and what their implications are both for theorising family and for ‘family’ policy. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1329","grantId":"RES-000-23-1329","fundValue":"77982","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Duncan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
