That Anne may not, as is usually assumed, have been entirely innocent of these charges is the concluding claim of a study that also reconsiders her reputation as a supporter of religious reform and offers a fresh account of Anne's relationship with Henry VIII. Such versions, derived from questioning of fashionable interpretations, and often based on sources that have been dismissed or overlooked, will intern to a substantial reinterpretation of politics and religion in the years of Henry VIII's break with Rome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112681/1","grantId":"112681/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"George William Bernard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
