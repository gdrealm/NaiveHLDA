{"id":"58A39950-1671-4923-8DE9-968C4C089CE1","title":"Modelling Needs and Resources of Older People to 2030","abstractText":"<p>The UK population of state pension age is likely to rise by almost 40 per cent&nbsp;by 2030, and those aged over 80 will nearly double. The older populationâ€™s financial, family, social and health resources have substantial implications for the well-being of those concerned and for public policy, but consistent projections in these areas are lacking. Key issues for older people include how trends in mortality and morbidity will evolve; if the extra years of life will be lived in good health; consequences of changes in family circumstances on availability of informal care and social participation; and their ability to meet care costs. We analyse trends in these areas and how their relationship to each other changes over time.</p> \n<p>We use simulation models to project up to 2030 the numbers, family circumstances, income, pensions, savings, disability and care needs (formal and informal), the key determinants of the resources and needs of older people. Special attention will be given to the inter-relationships between care needs (and their determinants) and economic resources in later life, and to the affordability and distribution of costs and benefits between socio-economic and income groups. Long-term care and pensions policy reform options will be analysed together - including co-payment systems for long-term care.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-339-25-0002","grantId":"RES-339-25-0002","fundValue":"943353","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Joseph Murphy","coPersons":["Linda Mary Pickard","Emily M D  Grundy","Ruth  Hancock","Carol  Jagger","Adelina  Comas-Herrera","James Edward Lindesay","Raphael David Wittenberg"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
