This knowledge exchange project aimed to debate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches of external performance assessment and encourage policy transfer between countries. We have achieved this through a series of events which have been well-attended by all the key stakeholders including government departments, inspectorates and improvement agencies across the UK. \n\nWe set up an on-line network of policy-makers, academics and practitioners to exchange knowledge on benchmarking and external performance assessment. All presentations and reports from the project have been loaded onto this site. It has taken considerable effort to set up and manage this network, but it has been a good investment of time and has the potential to act as a spring-board for a future research proposal and for practitioners to draw on. Thus, for example, the materials have recently been introduced at a senior level into the Department for Business, Innovation and Science as a contribution to their interest in establishing benchmarking in the shared services area.\n\nThe research team have continued to conduct research projects in this area and to publish findings in academic journals. Members of the team conducted research on the intervention process in the Isle of Anglesey County Council and evaluated two approaches to sector-led improvement for the Local Government Association - the corporate peer challenge in local government and the fire peer challenge. There is also direct application of the outputs of the project into a three year project in Kosovo to improve a benchmarking based system of performance of public services at municipal level.\n\nThese impacts are contributions to the two major themes affecting both the UK and many other advanced and developing jurisdictions. Benchmarking is a key methodology for helping to identify better economy in public services through input and process benchmarks. It is also a tool for improved effectiveness and innovation though output and outcome benchmarks, and through the learning by comparison which is at the heart of the benchmarking methodology. Further, in devolved, decentralised and quasi-federal jurisdictions - which is the growing trend globally in terms of national governance - it has special relevance as a comparative methodology to support both equitable resource distribution and also cross learning and improvement.\n\nOur findings have been used by the UK government, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government. This can be evidenced through citations to our research and the commissioning of additional research.

While the UK has been at the forefront of developments in this area, the project revealed that there was much to learn through knowledge exchange with other countries, both within the UK and internationally. We also found that there was a large amount of untapped potential for countries to learn from each other, and for practitioners, policy makers and academics from each other.\n\nWe found that little is known about how different benchmarking and external performance assessment systems are developed, their theory of improvement, their use as an instrument of governance (particularly in federal systems) or how they fit with other improvement mechanisms. We feel, therefore, that the significant time invested in writing up reports from each of the international conferences and UK seminars and sharing them with participants and others on an on-line forum (LGA ‘Knowledge Hub’) was time well spent so that knowledge across countries can be exchanged. Practitioners clearly can make use of and apply academically generated conceptual frameworks if the communication and engagement is tuned to their needs and interests. \n\nWhile benchmarking and external performance assessment have the potential to be useful tools for government in determining whether services are being delivered effectively and efficiently, we found that all benchmarking systems face considerable challenges in creating and capturing robust and comparable indicator data. There are a number of important points to bear in mind in trying to manage these challenges. First, robustness can only be judged in relation to the purpose for which the data is to be used (fitness for purpose). Second, it is difficult to standardise models of data collection because of the variety of interests (e.g. government and citizens). Third, most benchmarking systems capture historical rather than real-time data. Fourth, benchmarking requires open collaboration and co-operation between organisations and sectors. Fifth, producing good comparative data is only one step in the benchmarking process; an equally important step is to provide analysis and interpretation of this data as this narrative is likely to influence the impact of benchmarking. Finally, what is the role of citizens and service users in benchmarking? The public are rarely involved in discussions about what the indicators should be, what they mean, or what should change due to the results of benchmarking. The design of a new benchmarking or external performance assessment framework needs to take all of these issues into account. \n\nMeeting the grant objectives: The project aimed to draw upon knowledge from research on external performance assessment and benchmarking to foster two-way dialogue between policy-makers, practitioners and academics to help improve the assessment of public services. It had six main objectives as set out below with a commentary on each:\n\n1. Enhance the impact of existing social science research on performance assessment in public services through an exchange of experiences and practices within the UK and internationally: We co-designed an ambitious programme of initiatives which included international conferences, UK seminars, dissemination exchange workshops and setting up a network of policy-makers, practitioners and researchers. We have managed to deliver all of these initiatives and the events were well attended by all the key stakeholders.\n\n2. Develop and strengthen the networks of social science researchers and non-academic stakeholders working on performance assessment. We did this through systematic engagement and co-production of the events. The involvement of users at the design stage was a key success factor for the UK seminars on external performance assessment and benchmarking. We held a number of face-to-face meetings with policy makers and practitioners in each country to scope the agenda and discuss potential invitees. Participants appreciated being part of the planning of these events which resulted in each seminar being tailored to the particular interests of each country.\n\n3. Promote the application of conceptual frameworks and practical insight from research to inform the design and implementation of performance assessment: Each event was co-designed with potential users of the research so that the content was bespoke to each country. For example, the Australian conference was co-designed with representatives from the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). They were interested in hearing about international case studies and discussing how these could provide insight for their own policy-making. A member of the project team gave a presentation at each conference outlining the aims of the project, summarising learning to date and sharing future plans. A report from each conference was produced and shared with all participants.\n\n4. Provide user communities with evidence of good practice to guide the future design and implementation of performance assessment frameworks: Feedback from the various knowledge exchange seminars has been overwhelmingly positive. For example, participants in Northern Ireland welcomed the opportunity provided by the seminar to hear about approaches elsewhere in the UK as they were ‘behind the curve’ and been ‘in our own wee bubble’. This seminar triggered the commissioning of an additional piece of work which has applied and extended our previous analysis of performance assessment and benchmarking in the UK. \n\n5. Prepare the way for co-production of future research on performance assessment by involving user communities in defining research questions, identifying data sources and securing access to key organisations and interviewees: (This is dealt with under Q.2.) \n\n6. Extend the impacts of the knowledge exchange activities to a wider audience through the production and active dissemination of a policy briefing on best practice and lessons learnt: We produced and distributed a policy briefing which included a review of the lessons learned and key themes of the project, together with 15 pieces on benchmarking from a wide range of jurisdictions and covering a wide range of services and activities. It was published through a national newspaper web site, and also distributed through key channels of local government bodies. Our research outcomes have been and will be taken forward through both academic and non-academic routes. It will be important to do so for two specific reasons:\n\n1. The strengthening trend in the UK towards a more devolved and even federal governance arrangement will increase the relevance not only of benchmarking generally, but also the relevance of experience of benchmarking public services in federal environments.\n2. The sustained and continued need for public expenditure reduction, coupled with the opportunities for service improvement and innovation which flow from the increasing application of digital technologies to both public administration back office and client facing services, make benchmarking as a method very significant for both cost comparison and for learning. In this context the conceptual development through the project of differentiating modes of benchmarking in relation to its varying purposes is likely to be of enduring value.\n\nIn terms of specific actions:\n\na) Our co-funder (Forum of Federations) continues its’ work in the area of public services benchmarking and uses the policy briefing. The policy briefing drew on ‘best practice’ examples from a number of countries including the USA, Canada, Australia, China, England, Scotland and Wales and has the potential for further impact on policy and practice given its’ range of international experiences and evidence base.\nb) We continue to liaise periodically with the network of collaborators we have built. We are considering how best to explore opportunities for further research in the area ourselves.\nc) We continue to apply the findings and themes of the work in related projects and consultancy.
