We shall use the dietary records of individuals studied for long periods of time, and whose weight, blood pressure and other risk factors for disease have been measured to assess whether how and when food is eaten, and whether or not changing the pattern of eating relates to obesity and other health measures, so that appropriate healthy eating messages are given to the public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701939","grantId":"G0701939","fundValue":"219642","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Mary Lennox","coPersons":["Pauline Marion Emmett","Rebecca Jane Hardy","George  DaveySmith"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
