Yet the links between&nbsp; agricultural productivity and non-farm employment are poorly understood. Recent debates indicate that the multipliers that can support non-farm rural employment depend not only on growth in local aggregate demand, but also on the spatial and institutional configuration of the links between farm and non-farm employment, and between near and distant markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will explore the spatial and institutional articulation of markets, human settlements and farm and non-farm livelihoods in marginalised and impoverished regions of Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It will do this by building a careful qualitative picture of the flow and distribution of money, resources, risk and opportunities in socio-economic networks, value chains and markets in rural districts.&nbsp; This qualitative picture will be combined with a detailed quantitative analysis of the livelihood outcomes for actors and role players in the network.</p>\n\n<p>The research will be undertaken by a consortium of researchers led by the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa.&nbsp; Ethical Clearance will fall under the auspices of UWC.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J009261/1","grantId":"ES/J009261/1","fundValue":"410954","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andries Bernardus Du Toit","coPersons":["Ben  Cousins","Ian  Scoones"],"organisation":"University of the Western Cape","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
