Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect over 500,000 families in the UK. While ASD is known to be heritable, the exact genes involved are not known. Similarly, despite much public concern, no environmental risk factors have been discovered. We aim to establish the largest twin study of ASD to date, within an existing study of all twins born in England and Wales in 1994-1996. We would assess twins with state-of-the-art diagnostic tools, and give tests for psychological strengths and weaknesses, as well as asking parents about possible environmental factors. Comparing identical and fraternal twins, and looking at the relationships between diagnosis, symptoms, and psychological and environmental measures, will identify possible subgroups within the autism spectrum. This work should speed the identification of genetic and environmental factors that, perhaps in interaction, predispose a child to autism. Discovering these factors is the first step in providing intervention and treatment for autism spectrum disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500870","grantId":"G0500870","fundValue":"569524","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca Gabrielle Happe","coPersons":["Patrick  Bolton"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
