{"id":"E9AE59F7-2DD0-45CC-B15D-D0D89E16568A","title":"Between Ecstasy and Truth: Problems of Value in Ancient Greek Conceptions of Poetry","abstractText":"What is poetry for? What difference can or should it make to the lives of those who hear or read it? Are its effects contained principally in the experience itself, or do they have a lasting impact on people's beliefs, attitudes and allegiances? Was Auden (whose views on poetry were demonstrably influenced in part by his familiarity with ancient Greek ideas) right to say (in poetry!) that 'poetry makes nothing happen' but is only 'a way of happening'? Such questions (questions ultimately of value) are still of great cultural interest and importance, and they continue to elicit a wide range of responses. But they are questions which were first posed, in the Western tradition, by ancient Greeks. By studying their ancient formulations, and the answers given to them in antiquity, we can reach a richer, better understanding of the problems of value and evaluation which they raise. \\n\\nAncient Greek culture produced not only an extraordinary and influential poetic tradition but also, from an early date, a highly self-conscious awareness of different ways in which the functions and values of poetry might be judged. The ideas and texts which developed from that awareness are an important object of study not only in their own right but also because they have exercised a long and continuing influence on later Western thinking about poetry (and about representational, narrative and expressive art-forms in general). \\n\\nThe American critic Harold Bloom has said that Western literary criticism 'had three separate beginnings in Aristophanes [i.e. his Frogs], Plato and Aristotle', and he said this in the context of discussing a further Greek critical text, the treatise On the Sublime attributed to Longinus (and a work which has greatly influenced Bloom himself). All four of those authors/texts will be closely examined in the present project, together with several others which contributed to shaping the remarkable evolution of Greek poetics. \\n\\nThe purpose of this project is to examine a series of major Greek texts - both poetry and prose - which between them allow us to reconstruct some of the most important ancient responses to the question of poetic value. At the heart of my enterprise is a concern with what became a central conflict in Greek arguments about poetry - a conflict between regarding poetry's value as a deeply fulfilling experience in its own right (even to the point of 'ecstasy', i.e. an intense transformation of the mind of the hearer or reader of poetry) and, on the other hand, treating poetry as a form of truth-telling communication which can help to change people's ethical, social, religious and political lives. There are many variations on the opposing sides of this conflict, and on the relationship between them. But the tensions between them are threaded right through the history of Greek thinking about poetry, and they have helped to shape later cultural debates too. When, to give a further modern example, Susan Sontag (in her well-known essay 'Against Interpretation') argued that the power of all good art lies in the 'magic' of its 'sensuous immediacy', and that what art offers cannot be translated into any other form, she was (as the details of her essay show) reformulating a position defined by the ancient debates with which my book will be concerned.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F001940/1","grantId":"AH/F001940/1","fundValue":"38417","fundStart":"2008-02-11","fundEnd":"2008-06-10","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Francis Stephen  Halliwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
