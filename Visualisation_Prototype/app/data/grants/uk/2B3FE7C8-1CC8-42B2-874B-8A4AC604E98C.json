Users of these technologies may not be aware of the many ways in which they are socially present, the cues and feedback they are giving to others, and the data that is being recorded about them. On the one hand, this suggests a comforting sense of invisibility and anonymity, whilst on the other hand, it may evoke feelings of uncertainty, ambivalence, and dilemmas of self-presentation. In those contexts in which a certain type of 'performance' is required, shy users may additionally experience feelings of exposure, vulnerability and performance anxiety or 'stage fright'. Here, we draw upon Scott's (2007) sociological theory of shyness as a situational identity that emerges out of dramaturgical stress in interaction.Focusing on three different contexts of social interaction (classrooms, social networking, and public interactive art installations), we seek to understand how and why 'shy' users experience these difficulties, and how to design infrastructure and interaction mechanisms that support all users in enjoying and benefiting from the use of pervasive computing technologies. We are particularly interested in the more ad-hoc types of social situation that are supported by mobile, ambient and ad-hoc infrastructure. The project will therefore build on past experience in computer supported co-operative work, mediating interactions due to context, managing trust and identity, and ad-hoc networks. Our work programme consists of three mini-projects, corresponding to the three aforementioned contexts of social interaction and undertaken by our three research groups (Softsys, Interact and Sociology). In each of these settings, we shall address the research questions detailed in the Case For Support (page 6), which focus on context awareness; identity, groups and relations; mediation; interaction; the experience of shyness; and ethics and understanding. More specifically, the methodology of the three mini-projects will involve quantitative and qualitative observation, questionnaires, data analysis and model design, as follows:1. Class participation: we shall observe lecture, seminar and laboratory classes at the University of Sussex, especially those involving 'ice-breaker' exercises, presentations or other types of performance by students. Initial observations will establish a baseline measure, against which we will compare the effects of the technological interventions we will make (such as introducing signalling devices). Students will be asked to report on their subjective experiences of shyness and/or confidence by means of a questionnaire.2. Social and situated group communications: we shall examine patterns of communication, networking and self-presentation amongst social groups who interact both face to face and online. This will involve observation of the social networking website, Facebook, as well as online discussion fora devoted to shyness; research conferences; and the student-centred social events of Freshers' Week. The interventions here will include introducing Bluetooth phones, 'smart' conference badges, and social network maps for students.3. Public interactive art-works: we shall study three art gallery exhibitions that involve opportunities for interactive participation by visitors. One of these will be designed and installed by our partner artist Anna Dumitriu (who provides a letter of support), and another will be hosted by the Permanent gallery in Brighton, who will commission a suitable artist. The third will incorporate our interventions, and will be displayed at the Brighton Festival . We shall initially observe visitors' behaviour in terms of shyness, reticence and embarrassment about interacting with the displays, before designing and testing interventions to mediate these effects, such as kiosks and PDAs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F064330/1","grantId":"EP/F064330/1","fundValue":"1052220","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They are informing our ongoing research and wider academic work.
