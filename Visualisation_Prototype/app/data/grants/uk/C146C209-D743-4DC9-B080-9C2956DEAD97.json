While computation is performed by neurones, they critically depend on astrocytes which control the environment in which neurones live and operate. Astrocytes regulate the supply of nutrients and supporting (trophic) factors to neurones, levels of ions around neurones and, in addition, signal to neurones in a variety of ways. Neurones cannot live without this input from astrocytes. Many of the most devastating chronic disorders of the brain have a component of neurodegeneration where some populations of neurones become dysfunctional over time or die. Examples of such diseases are Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, each being a huge medical, social and economic burden. Traditionally the approaches to treatment of such diseases assumed that the best way is via therapies directed at neurones. The clinical progress, however, has been slower than desired and anticipated. An alternative view is to search for pathways to modulate astrocytes with the aim to improve their trophic function on neurones and thus indirectly improve neuronal survival and function. \nApproximately 15 years ago scientists found in the brain a receptor for an unknown signalling molecule. It was called GPR37 (G-protein coupled receptor 37) and immediately attracted attention because of it is high concentration in the brain. However, without knowing which molecular messenger activates GPR37, understanding of its function has been painfully slow although, indirectly, it was possible to link it to neurodegeneration. In parallel, another line of research investigated prosaposin, a protein present in the brain. It was established without any doubt that prosaposin is very important for the survival of brain neurones. Various hypotheses have been put forward about its mechanism of action but none of them became commonly accepted. A recent discovery brought these two lines of scientific enquiry together. It was found that prosaposin activates GPR37 and thus it is most likely that the prosaposin-GPR37 pathway is of major importance for the health of the brain.\nWhile analysing gene expression in astrocytes we have by serendipity noticed that GPR37 is present in astrocytes at extraordinary high levels. Careful analysis of previously published literature demonstrates that earlier studies also had evidence consistent with the idea that the prosaposin-GPR37 pathway is a predominantly astrocytic signalling mechanism. Our key hypothesis is that prosaposin (or shorter proteins derived from it) stimulate GPR37 on astrocytes and change their function in some way to improve their communication with neurones and engage their trophic functions. Based on the previous literature we hypothesise that this mechanism could be particularly important for survival of a specific subset of neurones which release chemicals known as catecholamines, including neurones which are known to be damaged in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Before we can engage in more complex experiments and drug design we want to test this idea using well established in vitro methods in experiments on cultured brain explants. Our approach is through a combination of molecular, electrochemical and imaging techniques some of which we have developed ourselves.\nIf our hypothesis is correct, this may lead to a new family of drugs with completely novel properties, possibly offer a new strategy for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders, and hopefully improve prognosis and the quality of life of numerous patients. Given the overwhelming economic burden of these diseases, even a small improvement in their therapy will save billions of pounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L020661/1","grantId":"MR/L020661/1","fundValue":"338887","fundStart":"2014-07-15","fundEnd":"2017-07-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sergey  Kasparov","coPersons":["Anja Gabriele  Teschemacher"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
