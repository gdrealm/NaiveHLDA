However, there is a glaring disparity in the amount of UK based theoretical work on the development and analysis of cell signalling models. Now is the time to take up the challenge of developing a body of theoretical work that can complement and enhance this area of UK research excellence. We propose to hold a one day workshop that will bring together predominantly UK based researchers who are working to understand the dynamics of cellular calcium signals. This will be complemented by the invitation of other mainland European and US experts, and the timely arrival in the UK of one the worlds leading mathematical biologists, Prof Jim Keener (Utah). The mathematical tools to be discussed will include the traditional tools of mathematical biology (such as nonlinear dynamical systems theory) but also powerful new techniques from non-equilibrium statistical physics, which are needed to address the inherently stochastic nature of calcium release from cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D065542/1","grantId":"EP/D065542/1","fundValue":"3581","fundStart":"2006-04-30","fundEnd":"2006-08-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A one-day workshop on the mathematical modelling of cellular calcium signals organised by Dr Stephen Coombes was held at the University of Nottingham on 28 April 2006.
