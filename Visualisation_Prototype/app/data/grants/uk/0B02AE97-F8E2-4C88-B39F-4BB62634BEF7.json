{"id":"0B02AE97-F8E2-4C88-B39F-4BB62634BEF7","title":"Towards a Global Answer to Emergent Issues in Seaweed Aquaculture","abstractText":"Worldwide, seaweed aquaculture has been developing at an unabated exponential pace over the last six decades. China, Japan, and Korea lead the world in terms of quantities produced. Other Asiatic countries, South America and East Africa have an increasingly significant contribution to the sector. On the other hand, Europe and North America have a long tradition of excellent research in phycology, yet hardly any experience in industrial seaweed cultivation. The Blue Growth economy agenda creates a strong driver to introduce seaweed aquaculture in the UK.\nGlobalSeaweed:\n- furthers NERC-funded research via novel collaborations with world-leading scientists; \n- imports know-how on seaweed cultivation and breeding into the UK; \n- develops training programs to fill a widening UK knowledge gap;\n- structures the seaweed sector to streamline the transfer of research results to the seaweed industry and policy makers at a global scale; \n- creates feedback mechanisms for identifying emergent issues in seaweed cultivation.\n\nThis ambitious project will work towards three strands of deliverables: Knowledge creation, Knowledge Exchange and Training. Each of these strands will have specific impact on key beneficiary groups, each of which are required to empower the development of a strong UK seaweed cultivation industry. A multi-pronged research, training and financial sustainability roadmap is presented to achieve long-term global impact thanks to NERC's pump-priming contribution. The overarching legacy will be the creation of a well-connected global seaweed network which, through close collaboration with the United Nations University, will underpin the creation of a Seaweed International Project Office (post-completion of the IOF award).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L013223/1","grantId":"NE/L013223/1","fundValue":"331627","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This networking grant on seaweed aquaculture is currently in its initiation phase.

The seaweed market has been developing exponentially over the last six decades, but there is a sharp East-West asymmetry in production methods. Most of the worldâ€™s cultivated algae come from Asia, whereas European countries are almost entirely reliant on harvesting natural sea beds, which are at risk of over-exploitation. Therefore, the growth of the EU seaweed industry necessitates introducing seaweed cultivation in Europe. There would be a huge benefit not only to import know-how on seaweed aquaculture from outside Europe, but also to identify, analyse and learn from issues that recurrently emerge in seaweed-cultivating countries. These issues include in particular pests that impact on production yields or on neighbouring native stocks. They affect the sustainability of supply for this multi-billion dollar global industry and food security, as well as the protection of native seaweed biodiversity and integrated coastal management. It is paramount therefore that as the industry expands both in the UK and globally that appropriate disease control methods and environmental policies are developed, to avoid both economic loss and irreversible environmental damage. This requires international cooperation and the development of a global and proactive research strategy. \nGlobalSeaweed connects disparate pockets of excellence in seaweed research around the globe and facilitate the transfer of industrial algal cultivation knowledge from East to West, through mutually beneficial pure phycological research. This two-way flow of knowledge and skills will facilitate industry development in the UK, creating significant opportunities for jobs and growth, and secure UK leadership in phycological research globally. The project works towards three strands of deliverables: Knowledge creation, Knowledge Exchange and Training. Each strand will have specific impact on key beneficiary groups, namely researcher, academics, the private sector and policy makers, each of which are required to empower the development of a strong UK seaweed cultivation industry. The key overall impact will be the creation of a well-connected global seaweed network which, through close collaboration with the United Nations University, will become sustainable through the creation of an International Project Office (post-IOF), ensuring a lasting legacy of impact of this project. Many project supporters have committed their support to make practical use of the research outputs, and also expressed in their respective letter their enthusiasm in participating or funding GlobalSeaweed-related activities.
