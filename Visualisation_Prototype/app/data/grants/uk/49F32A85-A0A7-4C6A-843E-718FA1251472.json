It is used increasingly within the social sciences. QCA reflects Ragin's assumption that much theorising in the social sciences concerns sets of cases, especially the causal properties of their characteristics, considered singly and in combination. Cases are treated as combinations of characteristics, with the latter described using sets. QCA has a form employing crisp sets where a case is either simply in or out of some set and a form employing fuzzy sets where a case can have partial membership in a set.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, compared to more established methods, QCA is still in its early stages of development, there are various unresolved problems that need to be addressed. This project areas addresses these under three headings: sampling, technical problems (especially those arising when fuzzy set are employed) and the interpretation of QCA results. The project will undertake some mathematical-logical work, but also exploratory work with existing datasets.The latter work will serve as a test bed for the more abstract arguments developed, providing illustrative and educative case studies of the use of QCA.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002570/1","grantId":"ES/K002570/1","fundValue":"351527","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Glaesser","coPersons":["Barry  Cooper"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
