CIT in the 21st century faces an ever-increasing number of rapid challenges and revolutionary developments. It is therefore important to ensure that the UK strength in CIT is maintained and enhanced. The 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT-2010) is one of the most prestigious international events which spans the entire range of computer science and information technologies and provides a key international forum to inspire advances in information and communications technology. The University of Bradford is privileged to host this reputable international event (CIT-2010) during 29 June - 1 July, 2010. The conference is being organised for the first time in the UK. This proposal aims to seek EPSRC sponsorship and funding to support four world renowned scientists to deliver keynote addresses at the conference in order to boost the quality of attendance and establish the importance of the key research themes in the area of CIT. The invited keynote speeches will be delivered by the world's leading scientists from academia and industry, covering the important research topics: Communication Networks, Bioinformatics, Networks and Economics, and Information Security. Hosting such a prestigious international event in the UK coupled with these distinguished keynote addresses will help to keep up with the latest research results and developments of information and communications technology, identify the frontier of the future research, raise the UK research profile in general, facilitate the opportunities of technology transfer and research collaboration, and ensure the vitality of research on information and communications technology in the country.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I011676/1","grantId":"EP/I011676/1","fundValue":"4480","fundStart":"2010-06-29","fundEnd":"2010-09-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The funding was used to support four world renowned scientists from academia and industry to deliver keynote addresses at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT-2010) held in the University of Bradford, 29 June - 1 July, 2010.
