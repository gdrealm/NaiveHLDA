The neurodegenerative diseases represent a major class of diseases predicted to benefit from emerging stem cell-based therapies. Huntington?s disease (HD) is one such disorder, that in many ways represents a model disorder for the development of cell-based therapies. HD has a defined genetic basis and primarily affects a focal group of cells in the forebrain. It is anticipated that developing technologies and clinical expertise to treat HD will have wider ramifications for the potential treatment of more complex and common neurodegenrative disorders, perhaps including Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease and Stroke.\nSignificant basic research has already been conducted to study the biology and potential of hESCs to generate functional neurons, but while the progress to date rightly generates considerable optimism, many technical and regulatory issues need to be addressed before this research can be considered for clinical trials. This proposal aims to take the first vital step in translating protocols from a research towards a clinical-grade platform. Specifically, we will adapt our protocols that derive neurons from hESCs that are of value to HD, to generate cells with sufficient yield and to meet regulatory standards of safety and reproducibility (i.e. to develop protocols compatible with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)), and most importantly cells will be tested for functional efficacy in animal models of HD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701499","grantId":"G0701499","fundValue":"692327","fundStart":"2008-12-15","fundEnd":"2012-05-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Denby Allen","coPersons":["Stephen B.
