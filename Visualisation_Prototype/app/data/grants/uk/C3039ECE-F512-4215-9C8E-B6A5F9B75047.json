Taste and smell are examples where external chemical stimuli are detected by the tongue and nose respectively. Within the body there are other chemical detection systems, for example, in the brain chemical messengers termed neurotransmitters are released and detected and brain function depends on this. The detection of these chemical stimuli depends on the binding of the chemicals to detector proteins termed receptors. The detection process has some similarities to the interaction of a lock and key, the key being the chemical stimulus and the lock being the receptor. These receptors are clearly of critical importance for the normal function of the body but they have a second very important role, in that they are also the sites of action of nearly half the drugs prescribed by doctors. For example, drugs used to treat conditions such as asthma act by binding to these receptors and switching them on whereas drugs used to treat schizophrenia bind to the receptors and switch them off. These receptors have been extensively studied by scientists, and it has recently become apparent that these receptors exist as pairs or larger groups. A group of receptors would be expected to possess different properties as compared to a single receptor. A useful analogy here might be to compare the behaviour of groups of people with the behaviour of an individual person. The relevance of this receptor grouping to the effects of drugs has, however, not been studied very much. In this project, therefore, we intend to study this grouping of receptors and how it affects the ability of drugs to switch receptors on. We intend to look at how the drugs bind to the receptors and how the switching on process is achieved. We also hope to set up ways of predicting the behaviour of the groups of receptors. The idea of receptor grouping has been well established and now is a good time to study the effects of this grouping on drug action. Overall the work will provide new information on how these receptors work and provide new information on these important sites of drug action. The work, therefore, has immense practical importance for understanding the function of these receptors and drug action in general.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D016886/1","grantId":"BB/D016886/1","fundValue":"287355","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-10-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Gordon  Strange","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
