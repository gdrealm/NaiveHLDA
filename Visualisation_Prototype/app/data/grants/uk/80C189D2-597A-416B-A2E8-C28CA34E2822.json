We will explore how susceptible consumers within particular clusters are to the range of “biases” influencing food choice (eg, tolerance of risk, conformity to social norms, discount rates, impulsivity etc). We will use a questionnaire-based survey to explore the range of social and cognitive factors that explain the susceptibility to biases influencing food choice.</p>\n\n<p>The third part of the study will use our insights to develop and test manipulations targeted at some of the key sub-groups based on their susceptibility to behavioural biases and associated food preference patterns. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010166/1","grantId":"ES/K010166/1","fundValue":"519430","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-03-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Tiffin","coPersons":["Chittur Subramanian Srinivasan","Rachel Ann McCloy"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
