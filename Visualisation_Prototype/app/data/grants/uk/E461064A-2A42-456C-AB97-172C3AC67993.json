This will determine whether these materials can support cellular functions leading to bone formation and whether there is active cellular removal of the material. This work also aims to understand the mechanisms behind the biological response to these materials. Selected nano-composites will be assessed by implantation and measurement of their ability to support bone formation. The mechanical strength of their interaction with bone and their subsequent rate of degradation will be measured. The results will allow the suitability of these materials for particular functions, for example as rods and plates for fracture fixation or as screws for holding damaged bone together, to be assessed and indicate advantages over current materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E006469/1","grantId":"DT/E006469/1","fundValue":"310423","fundStart":"2007-05-31","fundEnd":"2010-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Rushton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
