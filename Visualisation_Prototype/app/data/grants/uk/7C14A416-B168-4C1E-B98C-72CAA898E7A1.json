Higher plant dispersal units - diaspores, here: fruits and seeds - support the distribution and early life history of the progeny. Our project will use a comparative approach to understand the dimorphic diaspore (fruit/seed) syndromes produced on the same plant of annual Aethionema species (sister of all core Brassicaceae, cabbage family) and provide distinct adaptations as a dormancy bet-hedging strategy. The availibility of the Aethionema arabicum genome will facilitate our comparative investigation of the epigenomes, hormonomes and transcriptomes in relation to abiotic stress during sensitive developmental processes. We propose that investigating the regulatory basis of fruit, seed, and seedling trait diversity is ideal for integrating new technologies and complementary expertise in order to study a field with utmost importance in ecology, evolution, seed industry and crop breeding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00192X/1","grantId":"BB/M00192X/1","fundValue":"454617","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerhard  Leubner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":" We at RHUL discovered what the temperature requirements for the germination of the two types of seeds are and established all the methods required for the research project in the second half-year. Our consortium project meeting will be at the end of November and then we will also know the details of the findings in the 6 partner labs in Europe.
