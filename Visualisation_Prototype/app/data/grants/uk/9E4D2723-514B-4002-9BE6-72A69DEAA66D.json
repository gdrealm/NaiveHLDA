{"id":"9E4D2723-514B-4002-9BE6-72A69DEAA66D","title":"Sussex EPP 2012 Consolidated Grant Supplement","abstractText":"The Sussex Experimental Particle Physics group is involved in three strands of Particle Physics: the ATLAS experiment at\nCERN's Large Hadron Collider; the SNO+ neutrino experiment at SNOLAB in Canada; and the nEDM experiment at ILL in\nGrenoble, France. All three experiments probe some of the most fundamental properties of Nature and seek to find\nevidence for new physics phenomena.\nSussex makes leading contributions to the analysis of ATLAS data, searching for evidence of supersymmetry in protonproton\ninteractions where electrons, muons or taus are produced in the final state. The discovery of supersymmetry would\nprovide evidence for new physics as well as possibly a link between particle physics and cosmology, by uncovering the\nnature of the elusive Dark Matter in our universe. Sussex also makes important contribution to the ATLAS trigger system\n(which acts like the experiment's &quot;brain&quot;) -- through participation in trigger operations and in the development and\nmaintenance core software for the trigger system. The group is also involved in preparations for future upgrades of the\nATLAS trigger system.\nSussex provides substantial intellectual leadership in the ongoing search for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the\nneutron. Finding an EDM would represent unambiguous evidence for physics beyond the SM; conversely, the absence of\nany EDM, at the sensitivity for which we are aiming, would provide extremely severe constraints on models of new physics.\nThis work also provides a link to cosmology, since the size of any neutron EDM is determined by the same CP-violating\nmechanism that underlies the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe.\nSussex plays a crucial role in the SNO+ experiment, where it leads the calibration and the dataflow activities. The group is\nalso becoming involved in the crucial neutrinoless double-beta decay analysis, which could both determine the mass of the\nneutrino and answer the long-standing question of whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle.\nGroup members are also becoming involved, at a smaller level, in new experiments for direct Dark Matter searches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000753/1","grantId":"ST/M000753/1","fundValue":"9461","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Engagement with general public.
