The project aims to: \n(i) Identify the unique flood risk management problems facing the Taihu Basin; \n(ii) Explore how the risk of flooding might change in the Taihu Basin, during the next 50 years; and \n(iii) Identify options for Government and other stakeholders responsible for responding to the future challenges.\n\nThis knowledge will help to inform strategic planning of structural and non-structural flood protection measures and provide tools and techniques for a new Management Decision Support Framework for flood risk management in the Taihu Basin referred to as the TBFRAS (Taihu Basin Flood Risk Assessment System).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E523248/1","grantId":"NE/E523248/1","fundValue":"100000","fundStart":"2006-11-06","fundEnd":"2006-12-05","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Colin Reginald Thorne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
