The UK has one of the highest prevalences of asthma in young adults in Europe and the numbers of children reporting asthma symptoms has risen six fold over the last 30 years. Asthma costs the NHS an average of #889m per year and it is estimated that at least 12.7 million working days are lost due to asthma each year. This health and economic burden on the nation emphasizes the importance of research that tries to understand the diseases. The current proposal for a Centre brings together a group of doctors and scientists to discover new teatments and a cure for allergy and asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400503","grantId":"G0400503","fundValue":"2240400","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tak  Lee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
