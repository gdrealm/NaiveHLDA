It is effectively a computer with impressive quantities of RAM (512Gb per node) and is open to people in the Faculty of Life Sciences and more widely within the University. The basis of the bid was reconstructing genomes from complex metagenomic sequence datasets, however, the equipment is available for other problems which would benefit from this sort of high powered computational facility. The computational facility is available to users in the Faculty of Life Sciences and more widely in manchester.
