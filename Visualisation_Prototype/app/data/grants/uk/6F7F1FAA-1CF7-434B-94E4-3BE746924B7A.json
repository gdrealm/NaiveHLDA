Some species are pathogenic for human and plants, some cause food and industrial spoilage problems while others are beneficial and promote plant growth and can be used for biodegradation of hydrocarbons and plastics. This project will focus mainly on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen which is a common cause of infections in hospital patients and a major problem in individuals with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa produces an armoury of virulence factors and is resistant to many conventional antibiotics and so infections with this organism can be difficult to treat and it is almost impossible to eradicate from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Bacteria such as P. aeruginosa use small chemical signal molecules to co-ordinate the activities of the individual cells within the bacterial population. This bacterial cell-to-cell communication device is called quorum sensing (QS). P. aeruginosa uses at least two chemically distinct classes of QS signal molecules, the N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and the 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (AQs) to control production of virulence factors which enable the organism to combat the immune system and cause tissue damage and disease. Inactivation of QS by mutating the genes responsible for the production and action of the AQ (and AHL) signal molecules renders the organism incapable of causing infections. QS systems are therefore potential targets for new antibacterial agents. Understanding how AQ-signalling works at a molecular level will allow us to develop new strategies for controlling pathogenic bacteria such as P. aeruginosa. In this project we propose to build on our previous work to understand in more detail how P. aeruginosa synthesizes AQ signal molecules, how AQs control virulence factor production, how AQ-signalling is affected by a lack of oxygen and to discover the role of AQs in scavenging for iron (an essential bacterial nutrient) and in stimulating the death of a proportion of the bacterial population under stressful conditions for the benefit of the bacterial population as a whole. We also plan to extend these studies to two Burkholderia species, Burkholderia plantarii and Burkholderia glumae which can cause infections in humans but which are primarily pathogens of rice. From our understanding of the molecular basis of AQ-signalling, we will also explore the potential of AQ-degrading enzymes for controlling Pseudomonas and Burkholderia infections and synthesize a series of analogues of AQs and AQ-precursors which will be screened as possible new antibacterial agents. Thus this research will be of benefit by providing useful scientific tools, by contributing to the understanding of fundamental biological systems and by designing and screening novel antibacterial agents for the prevention and treatment of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia infections","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014392/1","grantId":"BB/F014392/1","fundValue":"638844","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Williams","coPersons":["Miguel  Camara","Stephen  Diggle"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Bacterial cells talk with each other by producing and detecting small signal molecules. This cell-to-cell communication enables a population of bacteria to act as a group rather than as individuals. This phenomenon is called quorum sensing (QS) and the mechanism through which QS signals act is by activating gene expression upon interaction with a receptor protein. In many bacteria, QS controls the expression of virulence genes, the products of which cause damage to host tissues and the immune system. Consequently QS systems are potential targets for new antimicrobial drugs which do not kill bacteria but instead block their ability to cause disease. \n\n\n\nThis research project has focused on the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is commonly found in water, soil and on the surfaces of plants and animals. It causes a wide range of infections particularly in hospital patients and in individuals with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa\n\nproduces an armoury of virulence factors and is resistant to many conventional antibiotics and so infections with this organism are difficult to treat and it is almost impossible to eradicate P. aeruginosa from the lungs of cystic fibrosis sufferers. P.aeruginosa co-ordinates virulence and biofilm development through QS. Consequently, inhibition of QS renders the organism incapable of causing infections and makes pseudomonas biofilms more susceptible to conventional antibiotics and host defences. \n\n\n\nThis project was designed to help us gain new molecular insights into how P.aeruginosa uses alkyl-quinolone (AQ) QS signal molecules to control virulence so that we can develop new therapeutic agents for controlling P. aeruginosa infections. The first task was to understand how P. aeruginosa makes the AQs and how they control the expression of specific virulence and biofilm genes. We then focused on developing two different strategies for blocking AQ-dependent QS. The first involved the identification and purification of an enzyme (Hod) which could degrade AQs. When added to cultures of P. aeruginosa, the Hod protein was able to block the expression of virulence genes and reduce virulence in a plant infection model. Our second strategy was to solve the 3D structure of the AQ receptor (called PqsR) by crystallization so that we could visualize the shape of the AQ-binding site and design molecules which could block the access of the AQs to the receptor. After we solved the PqsR structure with and without the AQs bound, we undertook the targetted synthesis of a library of compounds which resemble the AQs. These compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit AQ signaling and through a process of iteration, we discovered some potent inhibitors. These compounds were demonstrated to bind to the same site on PqsR by co-crystallization experiments. The inhibitors were finally tested biologically on P.aeruginosa cultures and shown to inhibit virulence gene expression and biofilm development. Further refinement of these QS inhibitor compounds should create additional opportunities for their development as novel antibacterial agents. Quorum Sensing Inhibitor UK Patent Application GB1018597.3 (filed in November 2010). We have filed a patent on the structure of the PqsR ligand binding domain co-crystallized with both the native ligand and two novel quinazinolones\n\nwhich emerged as potent inhibitors of alkyl-quinolone-dependent signalling from the library of alkylquinolone anlogues we synthesized and screened during the project. \n\n\n\nWe have also initiated a collaboration with Greenpharma (Orleans, France) via an MTA agreement where we have supplied\n\nthe crystal structure co-ordinates for the PqsR co-inducer binding domain so that they can undertake in silico screening\n\nfor putative inhibitors. These will then be screened in Nottingham for biological activity. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
