To achieve this it will extend the remit of the internet panel elements of the British Election Study to provide panel data in the period leading up to and after the Scottish referendum including, but not limited to, a boosted sample size for Scotland and Wales.</p>\n\n<p>This proposal seeks to provide mutual benefits to the Future of Scotland/UK initiative and to the British Election Study by extending the period covered, the content and the size of the Internet panel study in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>\n\n<p>The survey would include a full panel (including a substantial Scottish boost) in January 2014, June 2014 and September 2014 (post referendum) and would continue to include relevant follow up questions to the sample in the 2015 pre/campaign/post-election waves and then in 2016 (local elections and Scottish Elections) and finally in 2017. The proposal will link to the Future of the UK and Scotland initiative, but does not extend to Northern Ireland, as this is outside the remit of the original British Election Study award.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005166/1","grantId":"ES/L005166/1","fundValue":"498491","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As a resource many of impacts are through indirect impact of users. As data has only recently been released it is too early to chart this. However, impact from the BES has been instrumental, conceptual and capacity building by contributing to the understanding of the Scottish independence referendum by evaluating British attitudes in the referendum debate. Findings using BESIP Wave 1 and Wave 2 data have been used in blog posts publicised on the BES website specifically on the Scottish referendum, Consultations (e.g the ESRC Future of UK and Scotland event on the Scottish Independence Referendum in London June 2014; PSA media briefing on the Scottish Independence Referendum in London June 2014 where Professor Fieldhouse argued it would be promises of further devolution that would sway the referendum in favour of 'No'; and a BES Consultation on shifting voting preferences in the lead up to the Scottish Independence Referendum in Edinburgh July 2014), the press (BES findings on Scottish Independence findings from wave 1 data featured in: The Herald, The Daily Record, The Scotsman June 2014, BES findings on Scottish Independence changes in voting preferences form wave 1 and wave 2 data featured in: The Financial Times, The Herald Scotland, The Scotsman, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, Daily Record, Scottish Daily Star, The Express Scotland, The Scottish Daily Mail, The Times Scotland July 2014) and tv/radio (BBC Breakfast: Scottish Independence Referendum polls, BBC Essex, BBC Shropshire, BBC Lancashire). The findings from wave 1 and wave 2 data have featured and have been used to explain various aspects of the Scottish Independence referendum since the data was publically realised on May 7th and 2nd September respectively. Therefore BES data has been used from May-present in blog posts, consultations, academic work in progress research papers and by/in the media. BES 2015 panel data has also already been widely used as academics as evidenced by a number of presentations at EPOP 2014 and blogs from other Universities of Nottingham, LSE etc. It is too early for us to have performed a systematic review of usage and its impact.

However we have begun to demonstrate via our own analysis on www.britishelectionstudy.com/ various interesting political developments including the Scottish referendum (e.g. we predicted in June that promises of further devolution would save the union) We are very confident that the data will be widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we are putitng into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage (eg.the BES data Playground) Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
