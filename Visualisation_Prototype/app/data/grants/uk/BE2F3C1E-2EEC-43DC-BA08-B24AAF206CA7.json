Simplistic experiments show that top-down processes used to complete one task can persist to a second task despite being inappropriate for this second task. If such an effect can occur in more real-world situations, such as driving, it may have safety implications. For instance the visual search strategy required for reading information from a satellite navigation system may persist once attention is shifted back to the driving task, resulting in inappropriate eye movements that may increase accident liability. </p>\n\n<p>Over four experiments we will assess how the requirements of a visual search task influence the allocation of attention to still and dynamic driving stimuli. Eye movements will be recorded and different driver groups will be compared. The research will explore whether the allocation of attention given to a preceding task can interfere with the visual search strategies used in the driving task. This will benefit the academic literature by expanding our understanding of such carry-over effects, and will inform the applied transport research community of any potential safety issues.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3178","grantId":"RES-000-22-3178","fundValue":"76893","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Crundall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" We demonstrated that prior search tasks which constrain eye movements to a specific area of the visual scene can influence where one looks in a subsequent hazard perception test.
