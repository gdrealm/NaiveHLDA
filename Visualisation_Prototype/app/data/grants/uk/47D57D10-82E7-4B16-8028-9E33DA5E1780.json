Cell movement is driven by the cytoskeleton, principally by filaments made of actin molecules. Part of cell movement involves contractile forces, which are generated by myosin filaments moving along actin filaments. Similar interactions between myosin and actin filaments generate muscle contraction. The ability of myosin filaments to move along actin filaments is increased by a protein called ROCK-I. Several human diseases could be treated by chemicals that inhibit ROCK-I, including heart disease, Alzheimers' disease and some cancers. We have identified a protein in cells, called RhoE, that binds to and inhibits ROCK-I, and thus reduces the interaction of myosin filaments with actin filaments. We want to understand more about how RhoE inhibits ROCK-I, and predict that this will help in the design of new chemicals to inhibit ROCK-I.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004083/1","grantId":"BB/E004083/1","fundValue":"280880","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Ridley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" We have shown that the serine/threonine kinases ROCK and PKC phosphorylate Rnd3, and identified the residues phosphorylated by a combination of mutagenesis and mass spectrometry. We have also shown that Rnd1 and Rnd2 can be phosphorylated in cells. We have found that phosphorylated Rnd3 binds to 14-3-3 proteins, and that this binding inhibits Rnd3 activity by translocating it from membranes to the cytosol. This involves phosphorylation of 2 residues on Rnd3 by ROCK and 1 residue by PKC. \n\n When Rnd3 is bound to its target p190RhoGAP, it is not phosphorylated, indicating that it exists in two separate complexes: an active complex with p190RhoGAP, and an inactive complex with 14-3-3.\n\n\n\nRnd3 is also post-translationally modified by addition of a lipid farnesyl group at the C-terminus. We have shown that farnesylation as well as phosphorylation is required for Rnd3 to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. In collaboration with Neil McDonald, we have solved the crystal structure of Rnd3 with 14-3-3 proteins. ROCK inhibitors are already in use clinically in Japan. PKC inhibitors are being considered for clinical use. This information on Rnd3, ROCK and PKC, is relevant to the interpretation of clinical results. Rnd3 regulates cell migration and cell contractility and thus methods to incrrease its activity, for example by inhibiting its phosphorylation, could be used to promote cell migration and/or cell contractility. This information on Rnd3 regulation will be relevant to the design and use of ROCK or PKC inhibitors in pre-clinical or clinical settings.\n\nIn addition, our novel results on farnesyl involvement in the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins will be useful for the academic community studying a wide variety of other prenylated proteins.
