Complicating the debates about the 'sexualisation of culture'","abstractText":"<p>Set against claims about the ‘pornification’ of culture, this seminar series was designed to investigate the nature of changes relating to ‘sexualised’ (re)presentation and practices. These questions have become matters of&nbsp; policy and public discussion, yet responses are polarised in unhelpful ways, impeding progress. There is also lack of agreement over the very definition of ‘sexualisation’.</p>\n\n<p>We aimed to move beyond polarised positions, to establish dialogues between academics, activists, NGOs and policy-makers, developing a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities of ‘sexualised’ culture.</p>\n\n<p>We held 5 seminars, in three different geographical locations, aiming for diversity and giving space to artists, activists and policy makers as well as to a range of different bodies of expertise within academia. We also held a public art exhibition, and concluded with a large international conference, the first of its kind to focus on ‘sexualisation’, with&nbsp; plenary panel speakers working at the cutting edge of the interdisciplinary area of ‘sexualisation’. The “Pornified” Conference&nbsp; included over 100 leading interdisciplinary, international scholars.</p>\n\n<p>The series has had major impacts: generating&nbsp; publications, a bespoke website, and leading to further research. It has also fed into the development of a number of networks. Feedback has been very positive.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H002294/1","grantId":"ES/H002294/1","fundValue":"18336","fundStart":"2010-02-05","fundEnd":"2012-02-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rosalind  Gill","coPersons":["Meg  Barker","Emma  Renold","Jessica Lenore Ringrose"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
