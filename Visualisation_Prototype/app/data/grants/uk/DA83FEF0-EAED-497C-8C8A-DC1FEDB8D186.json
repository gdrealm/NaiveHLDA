Better understanding of how genetic risk of hypertension interacts with environmental factors such as dietary sodium is important if members of the public are to be persuaded to alter lifestyle. We have already had experience of the interest that the lay public has in this area through the high level of participation in the Bright Study. The development of the UK Biobank programme over the next few years will offer an important DNA resource that will allow any key candidate genes that might have an important environmental interaction for a common disease to be studied in greater detail, and we propose to ensure that our links with the Biobank proposal through local and national collaborations are exploited in due course.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400874","grantId":"G0400874","fundValue":"788565","fundStart":"2005-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Connell","coPersons":["Eleanor  Davies"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
