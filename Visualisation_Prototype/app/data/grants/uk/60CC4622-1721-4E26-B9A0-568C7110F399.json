We are trying to understand the causes of type 2 diabetes which usually involve a combination of the failure of insulinâ€™s ability to work in tissues such as muscle, liver and fat together with a failure to produce enough insulin in the pancreatic beta cells. We have previously shown that defects in beta cell insulin signalling reduce beta cell mass and impair insulin secretion leading to type 2 diabetes. Despite these observations little is known of the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin signalling upon beta cell function. This programme of research will define the signalling pathways downstream of insulin receptor substrate proteins, key mediators of insulin action in the beta cell. Using a combination of mouse genetic approaches, gene expression analysis and experiments in isolated beta cells we aim to further investigate the involvement of insulin signalling in beta cell function and the role of beta cell insulin resistance in diabetes. These studies will give insights into both the causes of type 2 diabetes and also suggest strategies for the treatment of this condition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600866","grantId":"G0600866","fundValue":"416544","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic  Withers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
