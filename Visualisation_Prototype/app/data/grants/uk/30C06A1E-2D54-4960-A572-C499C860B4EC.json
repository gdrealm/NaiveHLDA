Two-phase flow in microreactors is usually established as Taylor flow (one phase continuous, the second phase dispersed in slugs/bubbles), where the mass transfer is highly connected to secondary flow structures. Advancing to the milli-scale, the phase distribution varies and highly depends on the design of the employed flow reactor. Therefore, to scale-up the mass transfer characteristics to the milli-scale the promotion of constant merging and breakup of bubbles/slugs has a major impact on mass transfer, through the constant change in shape and size of the interfacial area and the renewed boundary layers.\nThe uncovering of the physical mechanisms of these effects and their connection to the fluid-structure interaction will allow for more efficient design of chemical flow systems, and is thus an important step in process intensification.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K035061/1","grantId":"EP/K035061/1","fundValue":"99217","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Asterios  GavriilidisSimon  Kuhn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
