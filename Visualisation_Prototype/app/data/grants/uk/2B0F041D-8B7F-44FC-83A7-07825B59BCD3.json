However, increased aging populations pose new challenges and emphasize the need for novel approaches to aid and repair tissue lost through damage or disease. By 2020 approximately 20% of the UK population will be over 65 and the numbers of hip fractures worldwide will increase from 1.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2050. Thus, there is now an urgent need to understand how to maintain stem cells and then how to direct them into cell types we want such as bone and cartilage to enhance bone repair and improve quality of life for the patient. \n\nHowever, despite intensive research interest there is limited information on how to reproducibly maintain the bone stem cells (known as skeletal or mesenchymal stem cells); or indeed how to tell a bone stem cell to make bone or cartilage. Fortunately, human bone marrow contains these special skeletal stem cells. These stem cells can easily be obtained from these tissues and have the potential to form a variety of tissue types such as cartilage, bone, muscle, tendon, ligament and fat (for this reason, skeletal stem cells are currently one of the most exciting and promising areas for tissue engineering and reparative medicine and in the future this will allow stem cell-based therapies to be developed to treat or cure diseases).\n\nWe are particularly interested in understanding how to maintain stem cells and to switch (differentiate) these bone stem cells to new bone and cartilage fat for regenerative medicine. For this approach to be successful, it is crucial to understand the way in which these skeletal stem cells change to become mature bone or retain their stem characteristics. Unlocking the molecular signals is the key to developing understanding and being able to undertake these studies in the absence of chemical cues is critical (to avoid confusing signals due to the chemicals used); we have powerful early data showing small nucleotides called microRNAs are key.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs), are very small (only 18-25 nucleotides) non-protein-coding single-stranded RNAs that have the ability to regulate gene transcription. They have important and varied roles in many biological and disease related processes. There is new and exciting data to suggest i) a number of miRNAs are specifically expressed in stem cells, ii) they can control stem cell self-renewal, and, iii) they can control the ability of stem cells to form different tissue types. In addition we have data on nanotopographical surfaces (surfaces that can change or maintain our stem cells without any chemical cues) indicating the key role of microRNAs in keeping or changing bone stem cells. We will look at how these microRNAs affect cell behaviour and cytoskeleton (proteins involved in cell adhesion, spreading, metabolism and signalling), cell growth and differentiation.\n\nThe results of this proposed project will open the way to modulate bone stem cells and thus drive the stems cells towards the desired cell type and provides exciting healthcare opportunities that will benefit many.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L021072/1","grantId":"BB/L021072/1","fundValue":"388913","fundStart":"2014-08-25","fundEnd":"2017-08-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Oreffo","coPersons":["Benjamin Daniel MacArthur","Tilman  Sanchez-Elsner"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" Too early - grant only commenced August 2014 Grant commenced August 2014 - too early to detail Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
