Our network challenged a range of assumptions: that Viking populations were small and local. We looked at 'ethnic' versus 'cultural' identities and of the key outcome is that we build a network of researchers across the Irish sea which is still active. Dr Swift gained follow-up funding from the Irish Research council for a study of surnames and DNA in Limerick, where we had included the local museum. Members of the team have become part of a large grant on 'Routs the British' at Leicester.\n\nAnother outcome is a new MA module on the Irish Sea region which is now offered at the University of Nottingham ('Virtual Viking') and which continues to include partners in Ireland, thus extending the life span of the project to a new generation. Most important is out public webpage which continues to grow.\n\nThis has been used by schools, interested member of the public and has spawned a range of public papers in both England and Ireland.
