The discussions will pay particular attention to how the senses and emotional perceptions are evoked in urban environments and to how they can be understood and researched from different disciplinary perspectives such as history, sociology, geography, or museum studies as well as from different professional perspectives such as urban planning, urban marketing or museum curation. By doing so we hope to show how research on the senses helps to understand the relationship between history, personal experiences and feelings of attachments in a multicultural European context. \n\nWe will organise four meetings (three workshops and one international conference) in three European cities: London, Cologne and Barcelona to compare urban experience and connect European scholars and urban professionals from diverse fields such as city museum curators, urban planners and urban marketing specialists. There will be a core steering group of academics and urban professionals which will help to identify key areas to discuss and we will invite a range of local and European participants to each of these workshops. The aim of the workshops is to bring together a diversity of experts working on the city and to explore together, existing and new methods to research and represent the sensory emotional realm in cities. To do so the workshops will have an 'active research day' component during which participants will have to trial different methods to research the sensory realm in a particular street in each city. From the discussions in the workshops an online 'toolkit' will be created on a website that both professionals and the general public will be able to access on their mobile phones as they walk around the city. This toolkit will provide resources and pilot case studies for each city that illustrate some of the sensory methods discussed and developed throughout the workshops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M006379/1","grantId":"AH/M006379/1","fundValue":"36198","fundStart":"2015-04-10","fundEnd":"2017-04-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Monica  Degen","coPersons":["Astrid  Swenson"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
