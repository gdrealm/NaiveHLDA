A Collaborative Project to Evaluate and Rethink Internet-based Rating and Ranking Schemes","abstractText":"<p>Over the past decade, internet-based rating and ranking schemes have become increasingly popular. Following eBay's buyer feedback and Amazon's product reviews, a variety of people, products and services are now subject to public assessment by users, consumers and citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Recent targets include lawyers, teachers, websites, hotels, restaurants and computer games, but also public services like health care or policing. While some have welcomed this development as an innovative way of fostering transparency, accountability and public engagement, others have criticised the forced exposure and alleged lack of accuracy and legitimacy, pointing to the potentially devastating consequences of negative evaluations for businesses, services and individuals. </p>\n\n<p>The project will tackle these issues by turning the idea of public assessment on its head. By involving key stakeholders and users in the collaborative design and evaluation of a website that will aggregate and disseminate feedback about internet-based rating and ranking schemes, it will not only engage academic and non-academic experts in a discussion about the utility and ethics of these schemes, but also provide an opportunity for users to share their experience and learn about the implications of these increasingly important technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The project is led by Malte Ziewitz and Steve Woolgar, Oxford University, in collaboration with James Munro, Patient Opinion.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H043500/1","grantId":"ES/H043500/1","fundValue":"7162","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Woolgar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
