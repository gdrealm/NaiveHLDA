Recent animal health crises have heightened awareness of the need for effective regulatory practices and techniques to control the spread of animal diseases. Policy makers have been keen to harness the power of local vets in the regulation of animal health. Vets are seen as trusted and effective advisors by policy makers and the agricultural industry alike.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this importance, there is little social science research examining their role in the statutory regulation of animal health. Drawing on approaches from the sociology of health and environmental regulation, this project will investigate the importance of acting as regulators to veterinary practices; the social interactions between vets and farmers during regulation; the difficulties vets encounter when delivering regulation in challenging environments, the contribution regulation makes to job satisfaction and the coping strategies they adopt; and the wider animal health benefits that arise from regulation.</p>\n\n<p>The research examines the role of Local Veterinary Inspectors in testing cattle for bovine tuberculosis&nbsp;- a major animal disease affecting cattle in England and Wales. The project will use an in-depth ethnographic approach of veterinary practices located in England and Wales, state vets working in Animal Health, and interviews with policy makers.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028741/1","grantId":"ES/F028741/1","fundValue":"78898","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings have been communicated to key policy makers and officials responsible for the management of veterinary surveillance Other Policy & public services","person":"Gareth Paul Enticott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" Vets do not test for bovine Tuberculosis according to official guidelines due to the way regulations are organised by Government.
