{"id":"DCF436ED-F2FD-4B2A-874B-0D0E9332FFB9","title":"The Importance of Accounting for Composition Effects When Studying Changes in Wage Inequality","abstractText":"<p>The central empirical question of this project is the following: how do changes in quality affect the trend in inequality, in particular the trend in the college premium, and what is their magnitude? The question arises because the college premium is usually measured by taking the difference between the average wages of college and high school graduates in each year. If the average quality of the individuals in each group is changing over time then the college premium cannot be compared across different periods, because it refers to different populations. Understanding the role that changes in quality affect the college premium is central not only to the study of inequality, but also to a number of heavily debated policy issues, such as: the impact of increases in schooling on economic growth; the usefulness of expanding access to education (eg, through a tuition subsidy) for pulling low-income families out of the cycle of poverty; or the discussion on the inadequateness of a &quot;college-for-all&quot; policy. The econometric methods and empirical strategies used in this project are useful for many other fields in economics and public policy, namely the evaluation of distributional effects of social programmes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2542","grantId":"RES-000-22-2542","fundValue":"86000","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pedro  Carneiro","coPersons":["Sokbae  Lee"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
