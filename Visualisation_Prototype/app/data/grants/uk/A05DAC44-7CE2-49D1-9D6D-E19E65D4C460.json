{"id":"A05DAC44-7CE2-49D1-9D6D-E19E65D4C460","title":"A whole genome association study of unipolar depression","abstractText":"Depression is a very common disorder and is a major public health problem in the UK and throughout the world. There is good evidence from studies looking at families and twins that there is a substantial genetic contribution to depression, particularly recurrent disorder. Almost certainly the genetic component of depression results from many genes of small effect and there is also a complicated interplay with environmental factors such as distressing events. As yet we know little about which genes are involved in depression and the study aims to find at least to some of them. We will utilise a new technology that enables a search throughout the genome using approximately half a million markers. Finding genes involved in depression has great potential benefits for clinical practice, first in better understanding the biology of depression and thereafter in discovering better, safer medications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600204","grantId":"G0600204","fundValue":"629888","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  McGuffin","coPersons":["Pak  Sham","Anne  Farmer","Ian  Craig"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
