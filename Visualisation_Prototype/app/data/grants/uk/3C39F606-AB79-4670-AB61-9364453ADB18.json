Importantly, levels of adult neurogenesis decrease with aging. In fact, there is a strong correlation between levels of neurogenesis and memory performance in animals (as levels of adult neurogenesis decrease, memory performance also decreases), leading to the suggestion that a decrease in the number of new neurons may make a significant contribution to age-associated memory impairment. This population of adult-born neurons represents a potential therapeutic target because exercise, environmental enrichment, and certain drugs can all increase adult neurogenesis.\n\nHowever, to understand the importance of these adult-born neurons for age-related memory loss, we first need to understand their contribution to memory in young adults. Despite intensive study over 15 years or so, we still don't understand their contribution to hippocampus-dependent memory. A key step is to understand how these new, adult-born neurons influence the activity of populations of neurons in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal subfields (cells which are respectively either one or two synapses downstream from the dentate gyrus granule cells). Surprisingly, to our knowledge, nobody has assessed the effects of destroying or silencing these new granule cells on the population activity of CA3 and CA1 neurons. In this series of experiments we will determine how new, adult-born granule cells shape the neuronal network activity of downstream hippocampal subfields, and how they contribute to hippocampus-dependent memory.\n\nHippocampal neurons characteristically fire action potentials when the animal is at a particular spatial location in an environment (the place field). The combined activity of many of these place cells provides a place map of the environment. However, these place maps are flexible and various experimental manipulations (e.g. changing environmental stimuli, introduction of salient non-spatial cues, changes in behavioural task demands) can lead to changes in the firing characteristics of neurons, a process known as remapping. It has been suggested that remapping provides a mechanism by which the hippocampus can differentiate between similar environments, or between similar or overlapping memories. We will implant arrays of microelectrodes into the hippocampus to record simultaneously the electrical activity of many neurons in different hippocampal subfields. We will alter the environment in different ways to cause remapping. We will investigate how new, adult-born granule cells affect remapping in downstream populations of hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo temporarily and reversibly silence this population of new, adult-born granule cells we will use optogenetics. We will use a virus which contains DNA that encodes for a microbial protein that is sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. The virus will be injected into the dentate gyrus of genetically modified mice which are specially chosen so that only new, adult-born granule cells that are transfected with the virus will express the light-sensitive microbial protein on their neuronal membranes. When light is shone onto these neurons, the microbial protein is activated. This reduces the excitability of neuronal membranes in cells expressing the protein, and thus we can selectively silence the newborn neurons.\n\nWe will use this optogenetic approach to determine the importance of new, adult born granule cells for selecting between overlapping memories. By selectively silencing the newborn neurons, either at the point of learning, or during the memory recall test session, we will ascertain when newborn cells are important (i.e. encoding vs. retrieval). This will greatly enhance our understanding of how new, adult-born granule cells contribute to hippocampus-dependent memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N002547/1","grantId":"BB/N002547/1","fundValue":"734587","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David MacKenzie Bannerman","coPersons":["David  Dupret"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
