However, theory development has been restricted because gender issues are easily confounded with the ideological meaning(s) of ‘marriage’. In other words, is it being a ‘wife’ or ‘husband’ that produces such asymmetries, rather than gender per se? The proposed project aims to disentangle this conflation of ‘gender’ with ‘marriage’ by focusing on money management in non-traditional (ie unmarried cohabiting or non-cohabiting) heterosexual couples, The research will be in two phases: (1) in-depth qualitative interviews with individual partners in 15 non-traditional heterosexual (NTH) couples, including some that have specifically rejected the notion of marriage on ideological grounds, and (2) a larger scale survey of 300 NTH couples. Our main aims are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Provide a detailed analysis of how NTH couples organise their finances and compare this with existing data on married couples;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Develop theories of household financial management that are grounded in a more inclusive definition of ‘household’ or ‘family’;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Explore NTH couples’ understandings of their financial rights and responsibilities and consider the implications of their financial management practices for the proposed law reform governing financial provision on cohabitation breakdown.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1471","grantId":"RES-000-22-1471","fundValue":"41403","fundStart":"2006-03-13","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carole Bourne Burgoyne","coPersons":["Anne Elizabeth Barlow","Stefanie Joy Sonnenberg"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
