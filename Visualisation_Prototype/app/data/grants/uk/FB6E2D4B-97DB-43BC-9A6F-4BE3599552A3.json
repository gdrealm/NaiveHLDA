{"id":"FB6E2D4B-97DB-43BC-9A6F-4BE3599552A3","title":"An advanced diffractometer for resonant soft x-ray scattering, diffraction and reflectivity","abstractText":"Soft x-ray diffraction and scattering is a relatively new technique relying on huge resonant enhancements at elemental absorption edges. Studies on thin films and single crystals have demonstrated the advantages of soft x-ray diffraction for studies of both charge and magnetic scattering as well as direct observation of orbital ordering. To date world leading research has been conducted at Daresbury using a simple two-circle diffractometer modified with a nitrogen cooling stage. The current diffractometer has a number of limitations and cannot be upgraded. We propose to build a new dedicated in-vacuum soft x-ray diffractometer with enhanced cryogenic capabilities, multiaxis capability and equipped with a number of new detectors including a high resolution CCD. The diffractometer will also be equipped with a high field magnet for reflectivity studies at ambient temperature. The new diffractometer will be designed at Daresbury to be used on a branchline of the soft x-ray Nanoscience beamline (I06) at Diamond and eventually on the polarized beamline for magnetism (I10) after 2010. The new diffractometer will provide a migration route for an existing wide community of users for fundamental studies and device applications of technologically important materials who currently use 1.1 and 5U1 at the SRS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=CC/D000092/2","grantId":"CC/D000092/2","fundValue":"77588","fundStart":"2008-10-20","fundEnd":"2010-04-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  To design and build a dedicated diffractometer for resonant soft x-ray diffraction and scattering.
