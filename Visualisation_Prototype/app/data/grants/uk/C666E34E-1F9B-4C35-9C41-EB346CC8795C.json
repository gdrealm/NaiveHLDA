{"id":"C666E34E-1F9B-4C35-9C41-EB346CC8795C","title":"The e-Science Institute: 2006 To 2011","abstractText":"E-Science has been described as the science, engineering and medicine that is made posssible by the development of powerful computers and high-speed networks. It represents a new way of doing research in which complex systems, which are not solvable by pen and paper, can be explored. It can investigate phenomena, such as the collision of black holes, that cannot be explored by experiment. It is about global collaboration and the next generation of computing infrastructure that will enable it. It is a method of research that is now understood to extend beyond the sciences, and includes all areas of research which will benefit from computationally or data intensive techniques. The e-Science Institute (eSI) is the national UK centre and the meeting place for e-researchers. The Institute runs a programme of workshops, lectures, conferences and tutorials with hands-on training. There, e-researchers can share knowledge and ideas about their particular research projects, forge new interdisciplinary activities, investigate ways in which distributed computing can advance their research. They recognise new challenges and invent new research strategies to address them. The eSI runs a visitor programme, in which researchers can focus on their research with like-minded experts and enthusiasts. International visitors bring research expertise to the UK community and take home an impression of the UK's strength in e-Science. The eSI will run three Summer Schools a year, intended to seed the UK with highly motivated young researchers with well advanced e-Science research skills. Much of the work will be based on themes in which a series of visitors, meetings and schools focus on a few related topics. The eSI also responds to current issues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D056314/1","grantId":"EP/D056314/1","fundValue":"2736940","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  During its final 5 years of operation, the National e-Science Centre (NeSC) and its sister organisation the e-Science Institute (eSI), organised between them more than 250 meetings attended by over 6400 delegates, with the former focussing on support for infrastructure development and the latter on research and support for research. Attendees encompassed both the e-Science and HPC communities, included both national and international representatives, from industry and academia, and covered the full range of academic disciplines. \n\nOne significant outcome was the next to final NeSC meeting which was directed at laying the foundations of the future UK e-Research Strategy and involved 34 senior members of the UK e-Science and HPC communities. This became the final research theme at eSI. Led by Prof Peter Coveney of UCL, the collaborative effort resulted in the document &quot;Strategy for the UK Research Computing Ecosystem&quot; presented to BIS on 21st September 2011. Prof Coveney had accepted an invitation to join the Editorial Board being assembled by UK Government Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills to prepare a Report at the behest of the Right Honourable David Willetts MP, Minister for Science &amp; Universities. This report was intended to lay out a grand strategy for e-infrastructure across the whole of UK academe, industry and commerce with the aim of influencing UK government policy and thinking from the autumn onward. The Board was chaired by Dominic Tlildesley, VP for the Discover Platform at Unilever. The report led to the announcement by BIS on 3rd October 2011of a ?145 million investment to boost Britain's e-infrastructure. \n\nhttp://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/-163-145-million-investment-in-e-infrastructure-66e4c.aspx  ","person":"Malcolm Phillip Atkinson","coPersons":["Peter  Clarke","Ewan Hamilton Klein","Arthur Stewart Trew"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The role of the eSI was not to conduct research but to help others initiate and pursue research goals. For example, the 18 research themes led to significant achievements. Their outputs include 43 refereed conference papers, 36 journal papers, 9 books and 24 other publications, though this is probably significantly under reporting their publication output as that data was gleaned from final reports, and many papers are written later. The total value of their follow on grants, with the same potential for underreporting, amounts to 29 million pounds sterling.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
