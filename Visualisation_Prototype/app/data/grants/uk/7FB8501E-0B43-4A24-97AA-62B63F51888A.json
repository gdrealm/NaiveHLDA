Cell migration is fundamental for the development of organisms, wound healing, and the immune respose in the body. All these physiological processes are regulated by the interaction of the cell with its environment. The major group of molecules controlling these interactions are cell surface proteins called integrins. Integrins span the cell membrane and are able to attach with their extracellular part to proteins located in the outside surrounding of the cell (extracellular matrix). With their intracellular part, integrins associate with proteins that link them to the cells' highly flexible and dynamic skeleton (actin cytoskeleton). The interaction of integrins with the cytoskeleton is indirect. One of the key molecules, which control the link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton, is named 'vinculin'. Mice lacking this protein die early during development, and cells deficient in vinculin are highly metastatic. Vinculin is able to interact with 11 other proteins, which have the potential to exert important signals regulating the cell communication with its environment. My aim is to understand how vinculin coordinates the numerous signals and thus modulates the communications between the cell and its outside surroundings. We will explore the function of vinculin by visualizing and monitoring its dynamic behaviour and interactions with other proteins in live cells using advanced imaging techniques. We will genetically modify vinculin and its ability to interact with its potential binding partners and thus test how vinculin controls a network of signals that is important for coordinated cell migration. For coordinated cell movements, the cell needs to exert pulling forces on the extracellular environment. Our recent discoveries suggest that vinculin interactions with the contractile skeleton in the cell are essential for the transmission of forces to the integrins that bind with its extracellular part to the extracellular matrix. Using highly developed nanotechnological devices, we will determine how vinculin signals contribute to such force transmission from the interior to the outside of the cell. Using devices that will mimic forces in the cells outer environment (such as pressure, stretching and shear forces in the body), we will be able to test how vinculin transfers signals from the outside of the cell to the inside cytoskeleton. The outcome of this study will provide us with important information for the better understanding of how cell motility is regulated in health and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G004552/1","grantId":"BB/G004552/1","fundValue":"403067","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2012-01-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings attracted:\n(1) Health care sector: the company &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Smith and Nephews&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; had contacted us to examine how the molecular mechanism we revealed are implicated in Ultrasound mediated wound healing.

Our lab also hosts selected highly gifted pupils from high school. Both events are coordinated by Ceri Harrop in the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research of which the our group is member of.\n\n(3) Society: We participate in arts exhibitions where we provide images to reveal the microscopic beauty of life on one hand and on the other hand important aspects in health and disease.

Sensing their environment enables cells to react to mechanical and biochemical signals. Our data demonstrate that vinculin, a protein localised to interaction sites of cells with their extracellular environment, controls the link between adhesion receptors (integrins) and the cells' intracellular (actin) cytoskeleton. \nOur data indicate that vinculin\n(1) regulates coupling and uncoupling events between integrins and the cytoskeleton,\n(2) activity coordinates the recruitment and release of protein associated with the adhesion complex;\n(3) is key for force induced cellular rearrangements.\nOverall, our data present vinculin coordinates cell adhesion and motility by acting as a link between adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskelton. Academically:\nWe revealed key aspects of how cells sense their environments and respond to extracellular mechanical and biochemical signals. These signals determine whether a cell migrates, stays in a resting phase or proliferates. \n\n We now build on our discoveries by exploring further molecular details that will enable us understand:\n1) how the sensing machinery is regulating neuronal behaviour and their sensing of mechanical properties of their extracellular environment (grant submitted).
