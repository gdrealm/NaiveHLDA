This combined approach has the potential to identify, evaluate and contribute towards the analysis of the social norms and processes that relate to the management of diversities within the Prison Service.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3441","grantId":"RES-000-22-3441","fundValue":"74800","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Cowburn","coPersons":["Victoria Jane Lavis"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
