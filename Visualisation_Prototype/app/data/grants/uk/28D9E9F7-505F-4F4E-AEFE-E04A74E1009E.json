The growth of organisms is controlled by cell proliferation, and in mammals cells are know to have a limited proliferative lifespan (the limit is about 50 cell division cycles) before they irreversibly withdraw for proliferation into a cell state of senescence. Senescent cells retain the ability to perform essential tissue function, but at this stage of cell development are much less effective in performing key functions than younger cells. Hence as organisms age tissues gradually acquire a higher content of senescent cells and reduced functionality. The process of cell ageing is complex and because of this overall biological ageing can differ from one person to the next. This arises because of cell-to-cell heterogeneity (variability) in biological processes. Notably, as cells age the heterogeneity in their metabolic processes also increases and this results in declining efficiency. In simple terms, this declining efficiency defines the process of ageing.\n\nSPECIFIC FOCUS OF PROJECT: This project plans to develop tools to explore how the efficiency of a fundamental biological process - DNA synthesis - varies from one cell to the next. Eventually these tools will allow us to make clear statements about changes in metabolic heterogeneity as cells age. Our aim is to develop small molecule biosensors that will allow us to define with a high level of accuracy the concentration of the DNA precursors within individual cells. The DNA replication precursors are called deoxyribonuceoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and 4 are required during synthesis. Complex pathways regulate the concentration of these precursors in cells, and as cells age the efficiency with which this pools are replenished declines. Imbalance in the pools in ageing cells is known to contribute to genetic changes in DNA and also accelerates changes that drive cell senescence. We propose that by understanding how the pools of precursors change from cell-to-cell, within cell populations, we will be able to develop new thinking about the metabolic heterogeneity linked to cell ageing and begin to understand how/if heterogeneity contributes to differences in the rate that individuals age. This could provide an index of biological ageing, which when combined with lifestyle and environmental factors might provide more reliable predictions of an individuals likely lifespan.\n\nPROJECT PLAN: Accurate measurement of small molecules within individual human cells is extremely difficult and to date synthetic precursors such as dNTP have never been measured in single cells - normal many millions of cells are extracted and precursors in this cell population measured. Recently, a group in US published an elegant approach for measuring small molecules in single cells based on a synthetic RNA molecule called an aptamer. Aptamers are synthesised in the lab and complex mixtures of aptamers can be generated and screened for their ability to interact specifically with a small molecule target. Hence, using a selected dNTPs as targets, specific and selective aptamers can be generated that will interact only with the designated dNTP in the cell. Hence, a single aptamer molecule is introduced into the human cells and when it interacts with the target dNTP a conformational change in the aptamer allows binding of a molecule that emits light. The amount of light emitted is directly related to the concentration of the precursor, based on the biophysical properties of the binding of the target. Our project will develop for the first time the aptamer-based biosensor system in mammalian cells and use this as a reporter for DNA synthesis precursor pools, which we can alter experimentally within cells. Changes in the pools during DNA replication result in DNA damage and this will be monitored for genetic defects by tracking cells through the cell cycle to see how defects in synthesis correlate with subsequent defects in cell division.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L017601/1","grantId":"BB/L017601/1","fundValue":"151474","fundStart":"2014-07-14","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project was activated on 14th July 2014 when the RA (Dr Amro Ahmed-Ebbiary) started work in Manchester.
