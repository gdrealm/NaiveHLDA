{"id":"2ABD2863-7DC7-4372-AAE6-F0256420BA7F","title":"UCL/MSSL involvement in studies for Cross-Scale (Cosmic Visions)","abstractText":"Cross-Scale is a mission concept to study the non-linear coupling of electron, ion and fluid scale processes which control the key plasma phenomena of shocks, reconnection and turbulence. The mission would comprise up to 12 spacecraft flying in formation in Earth orbit, with separations from 10's of km to more than an Earth radius. Cross-Scale is the international space plasma community's top priority for the future, and has been selected as a contender for the first M-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. The mission is UK-led and has had strong UK involvement during the mission definition and proposal stages. UCL/MSSL is interested in participating in the thermal particle analysers on Cross-Scale. There are a number of different configurations which potentially could be deployed around our high-heritage design concept to measure, for example, electrons, ions and/or electrons and ions. Our proposed instruments will be based on the prototype Improved Plasma Analyser (IPA) developed at MSSL under the rolling grant and on concepts proposed for NASA's MMS mission. However, these sensors need to have their performance tuned to address requirements on each scale. Thus, a number of studies are required to adapt the IPA to meet the requirements of the Cross-Scale mission and validate its suitability for the mission. The full programme of work was detailed in the associated proposal (STFC Reference ST/G001332/1). During the bridging period we will kick-off all of the work packages in order that the UK and UCL/MSSL can maintain the technical initiative and lead the development of the international consortia preparing to respond to any ESA AO for Cross Scale in 2010.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001336/1","grantId":"ST/H001336/1","fundValue":"64802","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This funded a study of the electron instruments on the proposed Cross-Scale spaceflight mission.
