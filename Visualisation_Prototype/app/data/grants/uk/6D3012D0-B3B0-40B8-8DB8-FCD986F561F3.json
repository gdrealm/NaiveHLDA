{"id":"6D3012D0-B3B0-40B8-8DB8-FCD986F561F3","title":"The Collected Letters of Robert Southey (Parts 1-4: 1791-1815)","abstractText":"Research context:\\nRobert Southey (1774-1843), poet, essayist, historian, biographer, translator and polemicist, was one of the most controversial of all Romantic period writers. He was a central figure in late C18th and early C19th British culture, a time of imperial expansion that saw Britain beset by war abroad and political, social and industrial change at home. Although Southey was a prolific correspondent, his letters have never been published in full. At present, the published letters are available only in out-of-print C19th and C20th selections, the former edited according to C19th conventions, with texts censored and cut. In addition, c.1500 letters have never been published at all. \\n\\nAims and objectives:\\nThe Collected Letters will revolutionize this situation, making these important documents available in one place, many for the first time. \\nThe 3200+ letters will be transcribed from original manuscripts, freshly edited and annotated to the very highest standards. c.1500 will be published for the first time, thus providing readers with a vast amount of new information about Southey's life, works and relationships with contemporaries. \\n\\nThe edition will thus fill a huge gap in Southey's writings. It will, furthermore, provide its intended audience of literary scholars and historians with the textual resources essential to future work on his life, works and intersections with his peers - writers, politicians, campaigners and scientists.\\n\\nEdited by a team of experienced, interdisciplinary scholars, the Collected Letters is an electronic edition and will be published from 2008-12 by the long-established, peer-reviewed specialists Romantic Circles [http://www.rc.umd.edu]. Romantic Circles' involvement is testimony to the project's internationally recognized significance. The technical expertise and financial support provided by Romantic Circles will ensure that the Collected Letters will incorporate the very highest electronic production values and be made available to the widest possible audience on a free-access web-site. \\n \\nThe co-applicants have already carried out a great deal of preliminary research. This application is for funding to allow them to complete the first half of the Collected Letters (Parts 1-4, scheduled for publication 2007-9) and to lay the foundations for the second half. In addition, the project RA will produce supplementary bibliographical databases, making these available on a free-access web-site. They will thus provide a set of unique research tools essential for completion of the Collected Letters and of great value to scholars working on Southey and British Romanticism.\\n\\nApplications and benefits:\\nThe Collected Letters appears at a time when interest in Southey is increasing rapidly, a situation testified to by the appearance in 2004 of the first major critical edition of his early-mid career poetry (Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793-1810, eds. Pratt, Fulford and Roberts, 5 vols: Pickering and Chatto) and in 2006 by the publication of a new biography (W. A. Speck, Robert Southey: Man of Letters, Yale UP) and the first ever collection of essays devoted to his impact upon Romantic-period culture (Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism, ed. Lynda Pratt, Ashgate). The Collected Letters will build upon these achievements, advancing critical understanding of Southey as a major writer central to a re-historicised, public Romanticism. \\n\\nThe edition will be published serially (2007-2012) and at all stages will fill acknowledged gaps both in knowledge of Southey's life and works and in understanding of his relationships with his contemporaries. It will be consulted by scholars from a range of disciplines: literary critics and historians. It will also become the standard scholarly resource for generations of researchers to come, taking its place alongside the collected editions of the correspondence of his peers, Coleridge and Wordsworth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D00148X/1","grantId":"AH/D00148X/1","fundValue":"363394","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Collected Letters is published on a free access website and has been used by a wide range of interest groups (as demonstrated by e-mail and phone enquiries to Pratt and requests for assistance): eg. auction houses, libraries, the BBC, booksellers, local media agencies, and members of the general public. Findings have informed a pamphlet by a member of the general public aimed at raising interest in Southey in the Lake District; a bibliography, by a bookseller specialising in naval history, of editions of Southey's Life of Nelson; a BBC iPM programme on Southey and Brazil; a BBC Great British Railways programme on Nottingham; information in auction sales catalogues; the British Library's decision to purchase MSS letters by Southey. In addition, the edition has encouraged and inspired members of the public to engage with the project team and in their own research: eg. someone sent in information from his family archives about a descendant who appeared in the edition's footnotes. It has also led to a request from the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery to work with them to publicise and extend the public's use of their Southey collection.

CL is the first scholarly edition of the surviving letters written between 1791-1815 by one of the most contentious figures in British culture in the late C18th and early C19th. We have located, newly transcribed (from the original MS if it survives), edited and annotated a total of 2691 letters covering 1791-1815. We have redated letters undated or misdated by Southey (or previous editors), identified the recipients of letters where the recipient was formerly unknown, pieced together letters where fragments survive in different archives. Where possible, we have located replies (most unpublished) to Southey's letters and used these to inform our annotation: eg. 498 MS Rickman letters (Huntington). Our edition makes available for the first time, in one place, newly edited, freshly annotated texts of the 2691 letters written by Southey between 1791-1815. It publishes 1228 letters that have never before been published and provides accurate texts of 538 letters only previously available in censored or inaccurate versions in out-of-print C19th editions. We have written extensive bibliographical and biographical resources as part of CL's critical apparatus, including: bibliographical data on previous editions; biographies of correspondents; lists of letters and correspondents. We have written newly researched biographies for the 134 individuals Southey wrote to from 1791-1815, thus correcting previous inaccuracies (eg. refining birth dates, career/ family histories) and making it possible to get a fuller sense of Southey's participation in a variety of social networks: eg. his connection to Unitarian circles in Bristol and the S. West (via Danvers and Smith) emerges for the first time, thus allowing for a more nuanced understanding of his religious views. We have XML coded Pts 1-4, so that the edition could be mounted by Romantic Circles on a peer-reviewed, free access web-site and thus be accessible to the widest possible audience from academia and beyond. By completing the above, we have filled acknowledged gaps in current knowledge of Southey's life and works and interactions with his contemporaries: eg. CL makes it possible to map his links with writers (eg. Byron, Hays, Kirke White, Montgomery, Wollstonecraft), scientists (eg. Beddoes, Davy), campaigners (eg. Clarkson, Wilberforce), politicians (eg. Fox, Wellington), publishers (eg. Longman, Murray). CL makes available a vast amount of new information on, amongst other subjects: Southey's life and writings, culture, history, politics, religion, science, Hispanism, book history, professionalism, domestic life, the Lake District, empire, war and society, landscape. It thus provides primary materials to facilitate new research in a range of areas now recognised as central to understanding of Romanticism: eg. Southey's letters on Burrington Combe published in CL Pt 1 have led to new research on late C18th writing on pre-history (see Proceedings of Univ. Bristol Spelaeological Society, 25 (2010)). CL consists of 2691 letters written in a wide range of styles: eg. formal, informal, verse, prose, humorous, polemical, public (in journals), confidential. It thus provides evidence of the varied nature of letter-writing and contributes to on-going debates and facilitates future research on the letter's role in culture in the Romantic period and beyond. Moreover, as a large-scale electronic edition, CL contributes to debates about digital editing: eg. methodologies; annotation; how digital texts are read and used. The AHRC funded research for Pts 1-4 laid the foundations for the rest of the project (Pts 5-8: 1816-39), thus aiding its completion: eg. we completed an archival trawl, located and collected a total of c.7000 MS letters by Southey in 215 archives, and completed a database of letters for 1816-39. The AHRC funded research also brought to light several important new caches of Southey manuscripts - including the medical records of his first wife (who was treated at the pioneering The Retreat, York) and an important early notebook - and these will feed into future projects. Reviews acknowledge the significance of the Southey Collected Letters for future scholarship: 'monumental ... points the way for future electronic projects' (YWES), 'an invaluable resource' (Romanticism). CL makes it possible for the first time for scholars to see Southey in the round and thus to chart accurately his career, development of his strongly-held opinions on literature, politics and religion, and relationships with contemporaries.
