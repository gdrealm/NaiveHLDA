{"id":"0F52A645-279A-4782-A6FF-409BED204253","title":"High-field NMR Spectroscopy for Biomolecular Research","abstractText":"NMR spectroscopy is the most information-rich analytical technique available to molecular research, but requires a high level of instrumentation to maximise the benefits of such analyses. In particular, its' application to materials of biological interest requires high quality instrumentation, with powerful superconducting magnets for signal resolution (500MHz or greater) and maximum sensitivity for proton nuclei. The Bristol NMR Facility currently supports a substantial number of researchers in the Biomolecular field and current NMR hardware is no longer sufficient to fulfil the demands of the cutting edge research projects conducted - which covers areas such as biosynthesis, protein structure and dynamics, potential disease treatments (Alzheimers and Cystic Fybrosis), bionanotechnology and membrane protein-ligand interactions. To this end, a modern 500MHz automated NMR spectrometer is required enabling these research fields to take advantage of the latest hardware and experimental developments required to achieve their aims.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011539/1","grantId":"BB/F011539/1","fundValue":"243954","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Craig Philip Butts","coPersons":["Matthew  Crump","Thomas James Simpson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
