{"id":"B3910B52-2EAA-43F5-B9C4-C1C51EB61F55","title":"University of Leeds-Equipment Account","abstractText":"This application seeks an EPSRC Capital Grant of &pound;1,079,600 towards the shortfall of &pound;2,372,600 required to install a world leading aberration-corrected &amp; monochromated dedicated scanning transmission electron microscope (SuperSTEM3) at the EPSRC National Facility for Scanning Transmission Electron-Microscopy (STEM) (EPSRC Reference: RE-10-0005-EPSRC-STEM). The EPSRC award will be matched by contributions from elsewhere totalling &pound;1,293,000. As part of the National Facility, SuperSTEM3 will support many users from the UK and elsewhere and have a high utilisation factor.\nThe National Facility is run by a consortium of five Universities (Leeds, Oxford, Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool) and is led by Prof Rik Brydson of Leeds. It is based around the SuperSTEM facility at STFC Daresbury Laboratories (www.superstem.org) but also provides access to complementary advanced instrumentation at Consortium University sites and Partner sites (currently Cambridge, Sheffield, Warwick and York). The last EPSRC review panel (2005) rated the SuperSTEM facility 'internationally outstanding'. Highlights of research impact since this review include:\n- a total of 104 journal publications with users (9 Nature group/PRL)\n- 32 invited talks and 23 conference contributions since 2007\n- the first demonstration of atomically resolved EELS mapping \n- a significant contribution to 2010 Nobel prize winning work on graphene\n The National Facility was awarded &pound;4.5M by EPSRC in the recent round of tenders for mid-range user facilities. The requirements of the tender for this facility were determined by a Statement of Need from the user community and a subsequent Town Meeting. The combination of equipment at SuperSTEM and the Consortium/Partner Universities is able to meet many, but not all, of the tender requirements. The cap &pound;4.5M on the tender budget combined with the requirements on staffing levels meant that the capital budget was insufficient to purchase SuperSTEM3. As a fack position, &pound;1,103,000 of the budget was allocated to upgrading SuperSTEM2, the more modern of the current SuperSTEM instruments. As detailed below, this is far from a satisfactory option.\n The new instrument, SuperSTEM3, will be housed in a new purpose-built &quot;pod&quot; at the SuperSTEM Lab. and will ensure the National Facility, its users and hence the UK remains at the forefront of aberration corrected STEM research and development. The combined monochromator/Cc corrector in a fully integrated state-of-the-art instrument will open up new areas for study. It will allow the full benefits of improved spatial resolution for STEM imaging and atomic resolution spectroscopy down to the low accelerating voltages necessary to study many nanomaterials. The improved energy resolution for electron spectrometry will open up new areas of study including the potential for vibrational spectroscopy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J021156/1","grantId":"EP/J021156/1","fundValue":"5597800","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2022-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  3D LS Spectrometer Pro\nA 3D-photon correlation spectroscopy facility has been established in Leeds.

This light scattering technique is used for the study of a wide range of soft matter systems where turbidity and thus multiple scattering of photons is a problem. This experimental technique makes it possible to perform full angular dependent light scattering investigations even in highly turbid media. The technique is being used on concentrated microgel suspension to study their structure and dynamics as well as in polymer gels, biological aggregating systems and a wide range of concentrated colloidal or polymeric systems both of fundamental and applied and/or industrial importance.\n\nSQUID-VSM Magnetometer \nA new superconducting quantum interference device - vibrating sample magnetometer (SQUID-VSM) was installed in Leeds in May 2013.
