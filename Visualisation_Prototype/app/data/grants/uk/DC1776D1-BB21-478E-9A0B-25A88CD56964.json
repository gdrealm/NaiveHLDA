It will do this by supporting the development of networks of knowledge exchange and cooperation between stakeholders including land managers, statutory agencies, local government, businesses, and lay people. </p>\n\n<p>The area to be studied lies on the English-Scottish border, covering sub-catchments of the river Tweed. The landscape includes moorland, forestry, upland livestock grazing and arable farming. The region suffered severe flooding in 2008 and 09 and climate change projections suggest more severe weather in future. There is thus a strong need to increase flood resilience. In addition to the administrative difficulties of managing a river across a border the area is subject to complex environmental designations and rural development regimes that make integrated management difficult. </p>\n\n<p>The project will work with the Tweed Forum, a charitable organisation committed to sustainable catchment management that brings together stakeholders across the border. An important part of the project is to understand how different stakeholders learn as new knowledge becomes available, both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H03725X/1","grantId":"ES/H03725X/1","fundValue":"139870","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Oughton","coPersons":["Louise  Bracken","Steve  Cinderby","David  Passmore","John  Forrester","Andrew  Donaldson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
