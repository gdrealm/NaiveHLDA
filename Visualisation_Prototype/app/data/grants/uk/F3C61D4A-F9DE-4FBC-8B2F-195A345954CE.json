Unfortunately, achieving and maintaining a bulk, superconducting device operating temperature of less than 65 K is difficult from a practical point of view and not particularly cost-effective. It is necessary, therefore, to develop materials with improved flux pinning (and hence field trapping) properties that can be fabricated economically for deployment in industrial applications based either on cryo-cooler technology, or on systems that use liquid nitrogen as a cryogen (boiling point, 77 K). Large single grains can be incorporated directly into existing sustainable engineering applications such as flywheels, magnetic bearings, permanent magnets for MRI/NMR, non-contact magnetic stirrers for high purity biological solutions and magnetic separators provided they can trap at least 2.0 T at 77 K. The closer the operating temperature to the transition temperature of the large single grain (typically ~ 90 K), however, the greater the requirement for effective artificial flux pinning centres in the large grain microstructure that prevent the motion of magnetic flux within the sample. The optimum size of such pinning centres is typically around a few nano-metres at 77 K. The most common method of introducing pinning centres into large YBCO grains involves engineering the size of Y2BaCuO5 (Y-211) phase inclusions in the bulk microstructure, which are produced as part of the Y-123 peritectic decomposition process during melt processing. The technique is limited fundamentally, however, by the tendency of Y-211 particles to ripen at elevated temperature, which conflicts directly with attempts to refine their size to the nano-scale. This results inevitably in a significant reduction in control of the melt process, and hence to limitations in sample performance. The PI has been involved in two important recent developments of the processing of large grain (RE)BCO superconductors. These are the development of a suitable non-211 phase that forms effective nano-scale artificial flux pinning centres, and in the development of an entirely new type of seed crystal that enables every member of the (RE)BCO class of materials to be grown in the form of large single grains by a practical techniques for the first time. The primary objective of this highly challenging project, therefore, is to fabricate mechanically stable, large, state of the art samples of single grain YBCO and other (RE)BCO melt processed superconductors than has been possible previously that contain novel (i.e. non Y-211-based), effective nano-scale artificial flux pinning centres by a practical processing technique. This will enable for the first time the cost-effective application of bulk superconductors in sustainable engineering devices that operate at, or around, 77 K. Additional objectives of this challenging proposal are to fabricate complex-shaped, new nano-phase composites for be-spoke applications for the first time using a novel multi-seeding technique, also underdevelopment at Cambridge by the PI, and to establish for the first time an effective recycling process for multi-grain samples. The project will involve extensive collaboration with four Cambridge science departments (Engineering, Materials Science, Physics and Chemistry) and with three international institutions (ATI Vienna, ICMAB Barcelona and the Boeing Company Seattle).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H049657/1","grantId":"EP/H049657/1","fundValue":"449873","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  None to report in this academic year  ","person":"David Anthony Cardwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" o A new route to synthesise powders (Y123 and Y211) used for fabricating superconducting single grains has been developed. Carbon nano-tubes have been used as templates in fabricating Y123 and Y211 precursor powders in solution for the first time. The trapped field of an YBCO single grain, 16 mm in diameter, fabricated using nano Y211 powder was a world record.\n\no A new arrangement of seeds in a novel multi-seeding process has been developed to increase the current flow across the grain boundaries. 0?-0? and 45?-45? oriented bridge seeds of different lengths have been employed to multi-seed YBCO grains. The superconducting properties were measured and the sample microstructures were analysed using SEM and optical microscopy. The results show that the 45?-45? seeds arrangement is superior to that of 0?-0? in the multi-seeding process.\n\no A world record of trapped field in bulk MgB2 of &gt;3 T, at 20 K has been achieved. The MgB2 sample was hot-pressed using optimized parameters.\n\no Simple methods to recycle YBCO and GdBCO-Ag grains have been developed. Failed GdBCO-Ag samples can now be recycled using a capping pellet of the same composition as the starting powder. The trapped field of the recycled single grain can be as high as 80% of that fabricated using the original precursors.\n\no Hardness tests have been performed to determine the mechanical properties of (RE)BCO single grains used for high field applications. Systematic tests have been carried out on single grains of YBCO, YBCO-Ag, GdBCO, GdBCO-10%Ag and GdBCO-15%Ag at room temperature and 77 K, respectively. The results show that hardness can be used as a easy and quick method to assess the mechanical properties of superconducting single grains used in high field. \n\no Single grains containing novel 2411(M) pinning centres have been fabricated. The addition of the Y-2411(M) phase to the precursor composition complicates the melt-processing of single grains. We investigated and compared the growth rate of single YBCO grains containing Y-2411(Bi) phase inclusions and Y2O3. The superconducting properties of these large single grains have been measured specifically to investigate the effect of Y2O3 on broadening the growth window of these materials (which is important for the continued development of a practical melt process).\n\no A comprehensive modelling framework has been developed to simulate various magnetisation processes of bulk HTS, including pulsed field magnetisation (PFM) techniques. With this tool, magnetisation using a novel split-coil arrangement, developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, can be studied thoroughly. The geometrical conditions for designing an effective split-coil arrangement have been established, and the mechanisms of a split-coil magnetisation process, which consist of two distinct regimes of flux penetration, are now understood. Bulk superconductor demonstration kits primarily for schools and a levitation platform have been developed as part of the project.
