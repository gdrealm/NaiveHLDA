{"id":"9683F035-4337-4BE7-A1F9-E14C808AE4DC","title":"Plasma mediated degradation of endocrine disrupting chemicals in water","abstractText":"A great number of chemicals used in everyday manufacturing processes have been identified as being capable of disrupting the normal function of the hormonal system in both humans and wildlife; collectively these are known as Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC's). The catastrophic damage caused by the release of EDC's in to the aquatic environment is well documented and a clear casual link has been established between the release of EDC's and an alarming reduction in the population of molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and amphibians both in the UK and elsewhere. Strict legislation is in place to ensure that significant amounts of EDC's do not reach the aquatic environment; this however, places a great financial burden on wastewater producers. Conventional wastewater treatment facilitates are ill designed to cope with such chemicals hence there is a real need to develop new technologies capable of rapidly and efficiently degrading EDC's in water.\nRecent interest has focused on the use of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP's) to degrade EDC's in water. Methods such as the Fenton reaction and Photocatalysis are effective; however, the need to provide external oxidising agents greatly reduces their cost-effectiveness. This study considers plasma, the fourth state of matter, generated directly in-contact with liquid to produce an abundance of highly oxidising species at the point of need. Cutting edge electrical and optical diagnostics in combination with innovative engineering techniques are used to explore the interaction between the highly non-equilibrium plasma phase and the liquid phase. The relationship between plasma excitation mechanism, electrical efficiency, reactor design and EDC degradation efficiency will be established and compared directly with other AOP's reported in the literature. \n\nBy developing this transformative technology there is a real opportunity to addresses a pressing environmental challenge, whilst simultaneously delivering scientifically excellent, industrially relevant research. This adventurous, multidisciplinary research project lies at the interface between physical and environmental sciences and aims to bridge the gap between the EPSRC signposted area of 'Matter far from equilibrium' and the 'Living with environmental change' priority research area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J005894/1","grantId":"EP/J005894/1","fundValue":"92245","fundStart":"2012-01-20","fundEnd":"2014-01-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The fundamental principals of plasma interacting with humid gases uncovered on the grant were later applied to a plasma system used for treating fresh-fruit to extend shelf-life.

It was found that degradation efficiency for pulse modulated cases, i.e. those with duty cycles of less than 100 %, was significantly higher than cases in which continuous sinusoidal excitation was employed. It was demonstrated that degradation efficiency can be more than doubled when using a pulse modulation duty cycle of 25 % compared to continuously generated plasma. The period of the pulse modulated signal was determined to not have a significant impact on degradation efficiency or gas phase ozone production. \n\nMeasurements of ozone evolution in the reactor show that in every case the concentration of ozone reaches a peak shortly after plasma ignition, followed by a period of decay; with the rate of decay being linked to an increase in plasma temperature and elevated NO production. Although the peak ozone concentration was found to be lower in the pulse modulated cases, the decay rate of ozone in the reactor was also found to be lower than that observed in continuous cases, with the 25 % duty case showing only a very slight reduction over the duration of the test. \n\nImprovements in the degradation efficiency when using pulsed modulation can be attributed to: (1) The sample having a longer residence time in the reactor thus allowing for more absorption of long-lived reactive species from the gas phase, (2) the reduction of gas heating leading to an increase in O3 production rate coupled with reduced thermal decomposition of O3 and (3) the reduced production of NO and subsequent poisoning of the Ozone formation process. Pulse modulation period did not have a significant effect on the degradation efficiency, suggesting that the plasma species in the reactor have already reached equilibrium within 2 ms (the lowest period considered). \n\nThe pulse modulated test cases also produced a markedly reduced concentration of nitrites, nitrates and other ionic compounds when compared with continuous-wave tests as determined by ion chromatographic analysis, pH and conductivity measurements. With the concentration of nitrate in water being up to 22 times lower when exposed to pulse modulated plasma compared to continuously generated plasma. Conductivity and pH measurements confirmed that the low duty cycle cases produced a smaller concentration of ionic compounds compared to the continuous cases. From the results of this study it is clear that manipulation of the electrical excitation, specifically via pulse modulation, is a highly effective means to significantly enhance the efficiency of plasma mediated breakdown of organic contamination in water whilst simultaneously improving the quality of water such that it is suitable for discharge without further processing. Funds have already been secured from an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Scheme to develope the fundamental science uncovered on the grant towards industrial application.
