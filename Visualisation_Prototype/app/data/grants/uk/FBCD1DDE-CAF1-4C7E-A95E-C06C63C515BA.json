{"id":"FBCD1DDE-CAF1-4C7E-A95E-C06C63C515BA","title":"Development and characterisation of a novel leguminous ingredient and assessment of its suitability for use in functional food products","abstractText":"Pulses are an affordable source of starch, protein and fibre and have slow-release properties of potential benefit to glycaemic control and lower-bowel health, but are underutilised in the UK. With the increasing prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases, there is an emerging market for functional food; however, few products exist which exploit the naturally beneficial properties of pulses. This project builds on new research showing that a novel method of processing pulses results in a versatile food ingredient with enhanced nutritional properties. The focus of this project is to develop a pilot-scale process for the industrial manufacture of this unique ingredient, and subsequently evaluating the feasibility and capacity to incorporate this ingredient into a range of food products. Ultimately, this project could lead to the development of a new generation of functional foods, suitable for the general public, but specifically designed to deliver slow-release energy and prebiotic effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M021076/1","grantId":"BB/M021076/1","fundValue":"162635","fundStart":"2015-05-05","fundEnd":"2016-05-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Rory Ellis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
