Peer pressure is often cited as a key factor explaining adolescents? uptake of risk behaviours, yet there has been surprisingly little scrutiny of the process by which this occurs. It is most obviously exerted through overt pressure to experiment with tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs, and interventions aim to develop adolescents? skills to resist peer pressure. Peer influence also operates more subtly, through the development of normative beliefs, in which, for example, adolescents believe that the majority of the population smoke, and that it is a normal part of teenage life to take up smoking. Adolescents are keen to fit in with their peer group, and model their own behaviour on those around them. However, there are other mechanisms at play, including peer selection, in which those with similar behaviours develop friendships. Adolescents wishing to become friends with other smokers, may take up smoking as a gateway to joining that friendship group. The combination of peer influence and peer selection leads to the development of friendship groups in which the prevalence of smoking and other risk behaviours is high. These processes contribute to marked differences between schools in smoking prevalence.\n\nThis project will use an existing dataset, collected from a recent MRC funded study of 10,000 students in 59 schools in South Wales and the Bristol area. Students were asked on three occasions to name their six best friends, and about their friendship. Using new statistical methods, these data will allow the research team to disentangle the relative importance of peer influence and peer selection. Those non-smokers most at risk of smoking uptake will be identified, in terms of their own characteristics, parental influence, and their current friendship groups. The stability of these patterns across schools will be identified. In the study, reported smoking was validated through the collection of saliva samples, and combined with the friendship data, this will allow the accuracy of students? reports of their friends? smoking to be assessed. The results of this work will have important implications for the design of future efforts to reduce adolescent uptake of smoking and other risk behaviours. There is immense public and media concern on this issue, and the study team will be sure to produce press releases of the work, as well as featuring the study and its results on the Cardiff University website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501806","grantId":"G0501806","fundValue":"316629","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurence Anthony Moore","coPersons":["Simon MARK Murphy","Rona  Campbell","Thomas Augustinus Snijders","Joanne Claire Holliday"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
