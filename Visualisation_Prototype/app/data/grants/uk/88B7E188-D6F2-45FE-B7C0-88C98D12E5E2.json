{"id":"88B7E188-D6F2-45FE-B7C0-88C98D12E5E2","title":"Regulators of WIP function and podosome activity","abstractText":"Following infection, the normal immune response in humans begins with the capture of foreign particles by the surveillance cells of the immune system called dendritic cells and tissue macrophages. Dendritic cells will subsequently migrate from the tissues in which they reside towards lymph nodes where they can interact with lymphocytes and inform them of the nature of the foreign particles they have encountered. Lymphocytes will then mount the antibody response to the infectious agent.\nObviously, if dendritic cells or macrophages fail to migrate properly, a malfunction in the immune response to infetion is likely. The work to be carried out in this study will investigate the molecular basis of normal myeloid cell migration as well as examine why it goes wrong in some genetic abnormalities of humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100041","grantId":"G1100041","fundValue":"363617","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth E  Jones","coPersons":["Ines Maria Anton"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
