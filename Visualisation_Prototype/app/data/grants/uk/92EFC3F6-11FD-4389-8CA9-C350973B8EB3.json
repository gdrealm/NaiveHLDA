{"id":"92EFC3F6-11FD-4389-8CA9-C350973B8EB3","title":"The Active Patient: Energy, Desire and Active Recoveries","abstractText":"<p>The focus of this interdisciplinary research project is the ‘active patient’ and the role of energy and activity in health and illness. Throughout history, ideas about the healthy self as an active self have varied, yet contemporarily, such notions have acquired unprecedented currency: for example, active aging, active recovery, campaigns such as the ‘Active Five a Day’, or the shifting conceptualisation of patients as active partners in healthcare. Two aspects of such discourse are&nbsp;energy&nbsp;and&nbsp;desire&nbsp;(wanting to get better and working hard to do so). Yet such discourses present paradoxes: how might active recoveries be imagined in conditions in which depletions to energy or desire are at the forefront of illness experience? What are the paradoxes of needing to want recovery when lack of desire is the condition itself?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Through rigorous historical-philosophical analysis and on-the-ground participatory research with individuals living with energy-related health conditions, this project will address the nuances of human energy, taking the conditions depression and chronic fatigue as examples. The project will constitute the first sustained study of human energy in illness and recovery with the aim of providing a uniquely multivocal and critically informed understanding of contemporary active agendas in health and social policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008595/1","grantId":"ES/K008595/1","fundValue":"171354","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Laws","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
