The research focuses on two common effective procedures - elective total hip replacements and revascularisations - which are often cited as examples of socio-economic inequality in health care.&nbsp; The project constructs indices of hospital competition and GP fundholding, and also allows for geographical variations in population size, age, sex, need, supply, waiting time and other factors that influence use of care.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0055","grantId":"RES-166-25-0055","fundValue":"8570","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  I filled this in and saved!
