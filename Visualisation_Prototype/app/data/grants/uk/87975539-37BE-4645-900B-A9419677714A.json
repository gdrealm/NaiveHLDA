However, on occasion, these viruses infect domesticated poultry and undergo genetic changes that sometimes result in the emergence of novel viruses with unforeseen biological and pathological characteristics. In recent years, a number of novel AI viruses including H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N8 have emerged in poultry. H5N1 and H9N2 strains have, within a short space of time, spread to many countries globally, inflicting enormous economic losses together with zoonotic infections of humans with fatal outcomes. \n\nIn 2013, a novel H7N9 AI virus strain emerged in poultry in China and caused a localized epidemic in humans. The virus is characterised as having a low pathogenicity phenotype and causes subclinical disease and no mortality in chickens. However, human contact with infected birds has led to sporadic severe disease in humans and over 180 fatalities. The virus is now enzootic in poultry in China and possibly other neighboring regions. In order to reduce its zoonotic impacts, large scale culling of infected and potential contact poultry flocks is being carried out in China, with losses so far amounting to over $6.5 billion and predicted to increase substantially. These pre-emptive control measures have become less effective as the spread of the virus in birds widens. The virus continues to evolve and new reassortant genotypes are emerging, carrying genes of other co-circulating poultry influenza virus strains. This exceptionally rapid evolution may potentially drive further increases in virus infectivity, transmissibility and virulence for both poultry and humans; posing great threats to global food security, animal and public health, socioeconomic wellbeing and the environment.\n\nConsidering the emerging and potentially global consequences of this novel H7N9 virus, there is an urgent need to bring this virus under control, reduce its prevalence in the environment and halt its spread to humans. Developing such control measures requires a comprehensive knowledge base about the nature of infecting virus, such as the viral factors that allow cross-species infection, the rates and mechanism of transmission between birds and from birds to humans and the genetic determinants of virulence in mammalian species compared to birds. \n\nThe proposed research aims to gain insight into the viral factors that are contributing to the emergence and spread of novel H7N9 virus within poultry, and its transmission to and pathogenicity in humans (using a well-characterised ferret model for human infection). We will also assess the potential threat presented by virus strains that could emerge by similar reassortment events in the future. This project will investigate: (i) how does the internal H9N2 gene cassette change the virological properties of H7N9 influenza virus?; (ii) how do internal gene cassettes from diversified clades of H9N2 viruses impact on H7N9 virus pathogenesis and transmission in avian and mammalian species?; and (iii) how do the H7N9 viruses transmits from poultry to humans?\n\nThe linking of identified genetic signatures associated with cross-species transmission and virulence with publically available virus genetic data will ultimately help to better predict potential immediate threats. The knowledge gained during this study will enable the design and development of improved tailor-made tools including vaccines, diagnostic reagents and antivirals allowing better control and management of AI infections. Improved control measures together with offering direct benefits may also provide substantial indirect economic, public health, environmental and social benefits to wider communities on both the national and global scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N002571/1","grantId":"BB/N002571/1","fundValue":"668314","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Munir  Iqbal","coPersons":["John William McCauley","Holly  Shelton","Simon  Gubbins"],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
