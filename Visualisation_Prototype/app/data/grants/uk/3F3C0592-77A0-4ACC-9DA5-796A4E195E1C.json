{"id":"3F3C0592-77A0-4ACC-9DA5-796A4E195E1C","title":"THE HEARING BODY: How auditory perception influences body representation","abstractText":"<p>The mental representation we have of our body is essential for successful interaction with the environment. This representation is not fixed, but is continuously updated in response to the available sensory information. While previous studies have highlighted the role of vision, touch and proprioception in constructing the body-representation in the brain, the role of auditory information remains largely unknown. Interestingly, the sounds that accompany almost every bodily movement are highly rich in information about the body and the space immediately surrounding it. For instance, the sounds produced when tapping on a surface inform us about the length and strength of our arm.</p>\n\n<p>This project will investigate how auditory information generated by our bodies updates our body-representation. A series of psychological experiments will explore how altering self-produced sounds in real-time changes different body-representations, including the representation of the space surrounding the body, the potential actions that we can perform and the emotional states linked to our body capabilities. This multidisciplinary and innovative research project will provide novel insights into the nature of body-representations and, ultimately, guide the design of audio-based applications that can improve body-image, self-esteem, movement patterns and social interactions to support wellbeing and rehabilitation for people with movement impairments. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001477/1","grantId":"ES/K001477/1","fundValue":"169625","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ana  Tajadura-Jimenez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
