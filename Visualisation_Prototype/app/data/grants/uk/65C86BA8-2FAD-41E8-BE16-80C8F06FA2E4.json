{"id":"65C86BA8-2FAD-41E8-BE16-80C8F06FA2E4","title":"CEA@Cass Seminar Series in Financial Econometrics","abstractText":"<p>The research seminar series in Financial Econometrics focused on modelling treasure and corporate yields and the risk sources associated with the movements of the term structure of interest rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Modelling the dynamics of interest rates is vital in trading fixed income securities that are sensitive to movements in interest rates. The main interest for both practitioners and academics is to fit the interest rates data within a framework that is able to capture the future evolution of the term structure of interest rates. This is important for the valuation of securities such as interest rate derivatives. Understanding the process governing the interest rate movements is additionally crucial for the analysis and alteration of risk exposures at a given point of time.</p>\n\n<p>The research seminar series brought together research into term structure models, factor analyses of term structure of interest rates, and factor structure stability of interest rates. The objective is to create a forum for the presentation and exchange of theoretical results and practical applications on the most recent developments in this area of financial econometrics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The series of seminars is of interest to econometrics scholars, the banking sector, monetary authorities and policy makers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0533","grantId":"RES-451-26-0533","fundValue":"18564","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Giovanni  Urga","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
