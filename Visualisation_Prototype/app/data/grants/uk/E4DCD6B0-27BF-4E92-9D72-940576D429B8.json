{"id":"E4DCD6B0-27BF-4E92-9D72-940576D429B8","title":"Case for Support: Building Capacity in Complex Systems and Complexity Theory","abstractText":"The terms complex systems and complexity are used very broadly across an ever expanding set of social sciences, ranging from economics, management, sociology and education. In the last few years, robust and well-proven quantitative methods and models have been developed to describe and analyse complex systems. However, these methods are often not known in any depth to social scientists intending to study complex systems. This is a serious limitation, which may prevent the researcher from reaching beyond a purely quantitative description and analysis. We therefore propose, as part of a two year project, a two-level course aimed at building capacity in complex systems and complexity theory within the social science community. This course will be build upon York Centre for Complex Systems Analysisâ€™ (YCCSA) established research, consultancy and teaching. Courses will be offered at two levels. The level-one course will target researchers inside and outside academia from a broad spectrum of social science disciplines who are new to the area of complexity, while the level-two course will take the form of a Masterclass (train-the-trainers), and is targeted at experienced researchers in need of intermediate level complex systems methods training.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-035-25-0064","grantId":"RES-035-25-0064","fundValue":"80692","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kiran Jude Fernandes","coPersons":["Susan  Stepney","Jon  Timmis"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
