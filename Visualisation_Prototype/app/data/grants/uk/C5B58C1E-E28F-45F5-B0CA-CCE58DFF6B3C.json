Humans can read what people are thinking by watching other s gaze and this ability develops over the course of childhood. However, some atypical children may be impaired in reading other people s gaze and this could affect their ability to know what others are thinking. Here we investigate a video-based technique to explore this possibility as previous research had tended to use static images which do not give this crucial timing information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700419","grantId":"G0700419","fundValue":"432468","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bruce MacFarlane Hood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
