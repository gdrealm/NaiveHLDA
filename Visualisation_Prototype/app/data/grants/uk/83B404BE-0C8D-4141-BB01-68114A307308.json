Environmental stressors such as limitations for food or other resources determine individual birth and death rates and ultimately make populations decline or recover. Population ecologists have been studying the interactions between climatic conditions and population density as surrogates for resource limitation. Studies with model species for which the life history response can be linked to predictable changes in resource availability serve an important role in improving our ability to predict population trajectories. Predators relying on cyclic prey species provide a useful tool in this context as they usually experience dramatic variation in demographic traits according to variation in prey densities. This variation is moreover relatively easy to quantify. Here we propose a pilot study on the tawny owl population of the Kielder Forest, northern England. This nocturnal raptor is specialist predator of field voles. Our objective is to fully understand the consequences of the variation in prey densities over individual lifetimes. Paradoxically, this analysis has only been seldom conducted on species experiencing cyclic demographic variation, while it has recently been estimated that about one third of animal populations, from mites to mammals and birds, display such cyclic patterns. Life history strategy of organisms living in cyclic environment may include phenotypic plasticity in some traits such as age of first reproduction or reproductive investment, so as to allow them to deal with changing prey availability. Plasticity thus has the potential to buffer partially or completely the impact of changes in prey abundance. First, we will consider whether environmental conditions experienced at birth by owlets remain detectable throughout their entire lifetime. In other words, we will investigate whether there is a 'cohort effect' on owl survival, age of first reproduction, breeding parameters (such as clutch size or laying date) and breeding frequency. Second, we will measure the covariation between these different life-history traits as this pattern greatly influences population dynamics. Third, we are interested in determining whether phenotypically different individuals adopt different reproductive strategies to cope with vole cyclicity, a source of variation that is at least partly predictable in time. Finally, this project represents an initial step toward the global understanding of how populations are regulated under cyclic environmental regime. Such knowledge appears critical in face of the current disappearance of cyclic dynamics in rodent species throughout Europe. Those species indeed constitute key stone species in many ecosystems and food chains, and numerous predators, including species of high conservation concern, are directly and highly dependent on them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E010660/1","grantId":"NE/E010660/1","fundValue":"47135","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Managers from forest Enterprise now include owl habitat in their land use planing Environment Economic","person":"Xavier  Lambin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" Our aim was to quantify the contributions of variation in demographic parameters in predicting population dynamics in the face of changing environmental conditions. We used a unique data set on tawny owls to determine how life histories and dispersal behaviour are shaped by the environment and in turn, how life histories and dispersal behaviour influence population dynamics. \nWe elucidated processes that underpin variation in delayed reproduction and assessed the lifetime consequences of the age of first breeding in tawny owls subjected to fluctuating selection linked to cyclical variation in vole density (typically three-year cycles with low, increasing and decreasing vole densities in successive years). We found that owl cohorts suffered strikingly different juvenile survival prospects, with estimates ranging from 0.08 to 0.32 respectively for birds born in Decrease and Increase phases of the vole cycle. This resulted in a highly skewed population structure with &gt;75% of local recruits being reared during Increase years. The probability of commencing reproduction was lower at age 1 than at older ages, and especially so for females. Variation in lifetime reproductive success was driven by the phase of the vole cycle in which female owls started their breeding career, more than by age at first breeding or by conditions experienced at birth. Females who postponed reproduction to breed for the first time at age 3 during an Increase phase, produced more recruits, even when accounting for birds that may have died before reproduction. These results were published in 2010 in Journal of Animal Ecology. We also examined the interaction between natal conditions and senescence and found the former, measured in terms of vole density, explained 87% of the deviance in first-year apparent survival. We found evidence for senescence in survival for females as well as for males and an earlier decline in male than female reproductive performance. Long-lasting effects of natal environmental conditions were sex specific. Female reproductive performance was substantially related to natal conditions (difference of 0.24 fledgling per breeding event between females born in the first or third quartile of vole density) whereas male performance was not. We found no evidence for tawny owls born in years with low prey density having accelerated rates of senescence. Our results, combined with previous findings, suggest the way natal environmental conditions affect senescence varies not only across species but also within species according to gender and the demographic trait considered. These results were published in 2011 in Journal of Animal Ecology.\nWe investigated variation in tawny owl natal dispersal and recruitment. Tawny owls responded to the cyclic variation in prey abundance with a sit-and-wait strategy, implying a delayed reproduction. Variation in lifetime reproductive success matched the distribution of natal dispersal with higher fitness achieved for observed median dispersal distances. Males and females dispersed equally short distances, independently of prey abundance and age at recruitment. This resulted in a relatively high concentration of kin, with 48-55% of individuals having at least one close relative of the opposite sex alive in the breeding population. However, an emergent property of simple &quot;rules&quot; such as avoidance of recruitment in the natal territory and mate fidelity was to reduce the residual risk of inbreeding close to zero. These results will be considered for publication by Behavioural Ecology.\nWe developed an eco-evolutionary framework incorporating emigration, movement, settlement behaviour and the multiple costs involved in dispersal. Our results highlight that the joint evolution of dispersal characteristics can have major implications for spatial population dynamics and we argue that, in addition to increasing our fundamental biological understanding, a new generation of dispersal modelling, which exploits recent empirical advances, can substantially improve our ability to predict and manage the response of species to environmental change. This generic paper is published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution (2012). The framework was elaborated upon in a study focussing explicitly on cyclic prey dynamics. We found that predators are likely to have evolved to emigrate more often and become more selective over their destination patch when their prey species exhibit spatio-temporally complex dynamics. We additionally demonstrate that the cost of dispersal can vary substantially across space and time. Perhaps as a consequence of current environmental change, many key prey species are currently exhibiting major shifts in their spatio-temporal dynamics. By exploring similar shifts in silico, we predict that predator populations will be most vulnerable when prey dynamics shift from stable to complex. The more sophisticated dispersal rules, and greater variance therein, that evolve under complex dynamics will enable persistence across a broader range of prey dynamics than the rules which evolve under relatively stable prey conditions. These results are being considered for publication by The American Naturalist.\nWe also analysed empirically how observed season-specific changes vole dynamics alters owl dynamics. Breeding probabilities were strongly dependent upon vole density in spring while vole density in autumn explained juvenile survival. Owl populations are expected to collapse under contemporary vole dynamics unless immigration is increased. These results will be considered for publication by Global Change biology. Overall, our work has substantially progressed understanding of the relationship between environmental variability, life history traits and population dynamics Our finding influence academics studying life histories but also managers aiming to conserve raptor populations. They emphasize the role of resources which in this instance override the climatic influence Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
