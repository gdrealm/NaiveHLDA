{"id":"62580641-2014-436E-BE22-067632AF9CC3","title":"Improving Safety for Older Public Transport Users","abstractText":"Older people generally become more dependent upon public transport in later life as their ownership and use of passenger cars becomes more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary that they perceive the public transport system as safe. However, preventable injuries do occur during public transport use and this feasibility study will examine how these injuries are caused in a sample of accidents involving public transport vehicles (in the East Midlands of England), the effect that design engineering has upon them and how injuries could be prevented by engineering solutions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001863","grantId":"G1001863","fundValue":"248954","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Paul Morris","coPersons":["Casey  Quinn","Philippa Anne Logan","Denise  Kendrick","Russell  Marshall","Stephen John Summerskill","Avril  Drummond","Simon Paul Conroy"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
