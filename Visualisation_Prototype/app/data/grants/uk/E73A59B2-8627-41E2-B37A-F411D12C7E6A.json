It will be hosted and lead by the University of Manchester involving university researchers and industry. The programme will build on the deep history and track record of research excellence and expertise at Manchester on the geology and characterisation of UK Carboniferous petroleum systems and associated shale resources. NERC sponsorship has been a core part of the research programmes at the University. This platform of knowledge forms the basis for a new and focussed programme of collaboration, learning and research that has the potential to enable a step forward in knowledge and capability in the assessment of resource potential and development of UK Carboniferous shale resources. \n\nThe recent government sponsored report from BGS suggests that there is potential for considerable shale gas resources in the UK Carboniferous, specifically in the Bowland and Hodder Shales of northern England. The assessment was based upon the analysis of legacy cores and data together with a limited number of recent core and geochemical data. There is no production data to model and predict likely recoveries of these potential resources. Critical subsurface uncertainties relate to the understanding of what might be considered recoverable shale gas resource and the controls on the distribution of lower risk areas for development. There is also important learning required in new well delivery to enable safe drilling and completion planning and execution. \n \nThe aim of CASCADE is to develop deeper links between University of Manchester researchers and industry working on UK shale operations and related exploration and development. Significant NERC-funded research on shale petroleum systems and potential shale reservoirs has been undertaken at the University of Manchester. Much of this has direct bearing on the UK's Carboniferous unconventional resource and reservoir characterisation, its production and environmental impact as well as potentially wider impact on global unconventional gas and oil exploitation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M007286/1","grantId":"NE/M007286/1","fundValue":"74789","fundStart":"2015-02-28","fundEnd":"2016-02-27","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin George Taylor","coPersons":["Ernest  Rutter","Edward  Hough","Rhodri  Jerrett","Sarah Joanne Davies","Colin Neil Waters","Mike  Bowman"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
