For the past 5,000-10,000 years, the plants living on peatlands have been fixing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it as dead plant matter - 'peat'. In a future warmer, and possibly drier, climate, this stored carbon could be respired back to the atmosphere or leached into rivers. Will increased temperatures and decreased rainfall lead to rapid loss of the peatland carbon store? If so, then the extra carbon released from peatlands could enhance 'greenhouse' warming further, leading to a runaway positive feedback on global climate. Or will rapid climate change trigger a shift to peatland types that accumulate peat (and store carbon) at a faster rate than present-day peatlands? If the latter, then peatlands could buffer further climate change. In this project, we will investigate the three-way interactions between plants, decomposition of peat and environmental factors such as temperature. Although there have been many studies on decomposition of forest and grassland soils, surprisingly little is known about how peat decays. We are particularly interested in how differences in the chemistry of different types of plants (and of the peat they produce) affects how quickly the peat decomposes and how it responds to changes in temperature. Of special concern is the bog-moss, Sphagnum, which has a unique chemical composition that makes it very resistant to decomposition. Our field site is a peatland in central Sweden that shows a great variety of plant types and environmental conditions, ranging from swamp forest to fen to bog. Using the full range of variation, we will analyse in detail the chemistry of a wide variety of living plants and their recently dead remains. We will also examine changes in chemistry and rates of peat accumulation in short cores that provide a historical record of the past 300 years or so. In addition, we will track how the chemistry of new and old peat changes as it decomposes, under higher temperatures and under drier conditions. The results of these studies will help us to predict how the peatland carbon store will fare in the face of future climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E004709/1","grantId":"NE/E004709/1","fundValue":"299689","fundStart":"2007-05-07","fundEnd":"2011-01-06","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  (Note: This grant was awarded before NERC introduced 'Pathways to Impact' as part of the application process.) \nThe main users of this research are other academics, particularly those with interests in the terrestrial biogeochemistry of carbon and in turnover of soil organic matter. As such, most of the impact of the research has been academic, i.e., enhancing scientific understanding of the controls on a major carbon store; development and utilisation of innovative approaches which cross disciplinary boundaries of ecology, soil science and geochemistry; contributing towards the health of soil science as an academic discipline; training highly skilled researchers.\n\nThe principal economic and social impact has been in training of skilled people for non-academic professions.

In addition, we tracked how the chemistry of new and old peat changes as it decomposes under controlled conditions in the laboratory. \n\n\n\nWe found that Sphagnum traits vary along gradients of water- and light-availability, and these traits can be used to predict rates of litter production and decomposition. The litter of vascular plants, Sphagnum and other mosses differed substantially in chemical composition when it was newly-produced. We found four phenol derivatives specific to Sphagnum litter and, along with other phenols specific to vascular plants, these were useful biomarkers for tracking past changes in plant inputs and decomposition. In peat cores spanning about 100 years, Sphagnum components became preferentially preserved in older peat, and there was a gradual shift in geochemical composition, reflecting loss of easily-decomposed components and accumulation of more resistant components over time. These profiles allow us to test physically-based models of peat carbon dynamics, providing important process understanding and allowing robust estimation of model parameter values. The results of these studies will help us and other researchers to predict how the peatland carbon store will fare in the face of future climate change. In addition to enhancing understanding of fundamental processes, the research has uncovered key traits and geochemical biomarkers for Sphagnum, an under-studied genus that is the keystone in peatland carbon cycling.
