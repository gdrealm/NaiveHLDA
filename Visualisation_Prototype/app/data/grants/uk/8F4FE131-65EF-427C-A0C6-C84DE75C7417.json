Deer management provides jobs in rural areas and the meat industry and tourists are drawn to areas to see deer and the landscapes that they help to create. However, in some areas, high deer numbers cause overgrazing and damage to sensitive natural habitats, agricultural crops, forestry and suburban gardens. Deer are increasingly involved in road accidents.</p>\n\n<p>This project will investigate how well people involved in deer management work together and how this can be improved to minimise costs and maximise the benefits. Workshops, focus groups and in-depth interviews with policy makers, practitioners, researchers and the public across different scales and levels of complexity will be used to identify the various issues and barriers to collaboration and how they can be overcome. </p>\n\n<p>By increasing the understanding of the issues between ecologists, economists and social scientists and combining this knowledge with management objectives, to improve deer management, a framework for collaborative management of an ecological resource will be developed.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-227-25-0014","grantId":"RES-227-25-0014","fundValue":"641321","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"R Justin Irvine","coPersons":["Helen Margaret Armstrong","Douglas Craig MacMillan","Sue  O'Brien","Piran  White","Brenda Anne Mayle","Rehema  White","Rene  Van Der Wal"],"organisation":"Macaulay Institute","findingsText":" We found that economic incentives are unlikely to be effective instrument for encouraging landowners to shoot more deer for conservation objectives Encourage public engagement in deer management and land ownership\n\nPromote greater collaboration and communication between stakeholders development of policy on deer management\n\ndevelopment of policy on wild food\n\ndevelopment of policy on outdoor recreation\n\ndevelopment of policy on land reform Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
