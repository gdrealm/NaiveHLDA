{"id":"858313AC-E480-4C00-BE19-1C80ACDF2B29","title":"Structural basis of SPP1 bacteriophage infectivity","abstractText":"Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) are the most populated biological entity in the Biosphere. Most known bacteriophages have tails that serve as a pipeline at genome delivery into the host cytoplasm during infection. The main structural features of these phages are well known and include an icosahedral head (capsid) that keeps the genome (linear ds DNA) safe from a hazardous environment, a long flexible non-contractile tail attached to the capsid, and a specialised molecular adsorption apparatus located on the free end of the tail. This apparatus is essential for the phage infectivity as it detects a specific receptor in the host cell surface. Once the receptor has been recognised, the phage affixes itself to the bacterial cell wall and forms a channel through the cell membrane. The tail sticks to the cell membrane tightly so that the genome can be delivered straight into the host cell. The interaction of the phage adsorption device with the bacterial cell membrane induces a signal that is transmitted along the tail to the phage head, where the signal stimulates the opening of the connector located between the tail and the head. The connector serves as a valve to keep DNA locked in the capsid. Opening of the connector leads to the DNA release. Biochemical analysis of this process has provided information; however, it is still unclear how the signal propagates through the tail and which phage system components control structural conformational changes. Our study has demonstrated extensive structural rearrangements in the internal wall of the tail tube of SPP1 bacteriophage, however, it remains unknown what sequence of events induces DNA release. We propose that the adsorption device-receptor interaction triggers a conformational switch, which is propagated in a domino-like cascade along the 1600 &Aring;-long helical tail to reach the head-to-tail connector. This leads to opening of the connector culminating in DNA exit from the head into the host cell through th tail tube. To test this hypothesis we need to document the structural changes that occur in the tail structure after receptor binding until the genome is successfully released from the phage particle. In this type of study bacteriophage SPP1 is a unique model since the SPP1 specific receptor has been identified and purified. The process of DNA ejection from phage particles in vitro could be controlled and time dependence can be tested. Since bacteriopaghes are huge asymmetrical macromolecular systems, electron microscopy (EM) in combination with image analysis is the method of choice. Modern methods of sample preparation allow structural conformational changes in phages to be captured and, therefore electron microscopy in combination with biochemical and biophysical methods would allow us to observe the phage in different states. Analysis of two mutant tail structures will clarify a system of interactions between subunits in the tail tube and time resolving experiments will enlighten a basis of the signal propagation. A single particle asymmetrical approach and tomography will be used to localize the connector within the phage capsid before and after DNA ejection. Docking of known or predicted atomic structures of the phage components will allow understanding of structural principles behind signal propagation and function of the capsid gate. The School of Crystallography at Birkbeck College has the EM, computer facilities and software packages required for the project. In 2006 year we have obtained an equipment grant that is providing an FEI 300 keV FEG microscope (Polara), that will be installed in autumn 2007. This microscope will be equipped with the software Leginon that allows automated data collection. Larger data sets are required to improve the reliability of analysis. Statistical approaches developed in the EM groups of Dr. E. Orlova and Prof. H. Saibil allow analysis of heterogeneous data sets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F012705/1","grantId":"BB/F012705/1","fundValue":"330970","fundStart":"2008-08-04","fundEnd":"2011-08-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The funds were used to perform the fundamental structural studies of the SPP1 bacteriophage, to the structure of its tail and conformational changes after DNA ejection.

The work unravels portal protein-DNA interactions mediated by tunnel loops and concerted motions of structural elements lining the DNA traffic channel associated to presence of DNA. These interactions that hold DNA conceivably occur also during DNA translocation of the genome.\n2. We report discovery of the allosteric mechanism that drives closure of the DNA translocation channel to retain the viral genome in its interior after DNA packaging. This mechanism requires that protein gp16 interacts with two independent regions of protein gp15 for correct positioning of the gp16 subunit in the virus particle structure. This positioning allows interaction of a loop of gp16 with equivalent loops of neighbor gp16 subunits to build an intermolecular plug that closes the DNA traffic channel.\n3. The gp16 DNA plug, or stopper, opens for genome transfer to the host bacterium and then it re-closes supporting a mechanism in which its central propeller-like inter-subunit structure undergoes a diaphragm-like motion. The closed conformation is thus the system stable state whose opening is imposed by signaling for viral genome release. In the field of viral nucleoprotein machines, our work constitutes a major progress. Finally, our work has considerable inter-disciplinary implications and will be of broad interest to the many working in the mechanics of large supramolecular nucleoprotein assemblies, in the control of phage infection of bacterial populations and horizontal gene transfer, or in the rational engineering of viruses for regulated delivery of DNA to target cells.
