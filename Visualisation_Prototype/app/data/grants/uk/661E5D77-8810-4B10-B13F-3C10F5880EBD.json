{"id":"661E5D77-8810-4B10-B13F-3C10F5880EBD","title":"Obesity: Exploring the Role of the Social and Phyisical Environment","abstractText":"<p>Researchers have discovered that individual social, behavioural, psychological and biological factors are unable to fully explain the global rise in obesity prevalence. In response today's environment has been described as 'obesogenic', or one which encourages excess food consumption and discourages physical activity, through factors that are social, cultural, structural and economic in origin. </p> \n<p>Plausible environmental influences include design features of the built environment (such as walkability and connectivity), availability and quality of recreational and outside space, transport options (including walking and cycling), access to labour saving devices (such as household appliances and cars), physical aspects of food supply, such as easy access to high fat and energy dense food for consumption in and outside of the home, regulation of food supply systems and cultural changes in the consumption, marketing and advertising of unhealthy foods.</p> \n<p>This series will stimulate interdisciplinary discussion, debate and research, to address a problem that is becoming increasingly important to the UK's health, society and economy. Four seminars are planned.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Seminar 1: Food environments, food cultures and obesity</li> \n <li>Seminar 2: Physical activity, the built environment and obesity</li> \n <li>Seminar 3: Pathways to obesity: methods and measurements</li> \n <li>Seminar 4: Combating the obesogenic environment - policy solutions and priorities</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Full details can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/obesity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/obesity/</a></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4242","grantId":"RES-451-25-4242","fundValue":"10731","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven Christopher Cummins","coPersons":["Tessa  Parsons","Sharon  Friel"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
