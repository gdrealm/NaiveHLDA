Young people will play a huge part in their own learning experience. Teachers have told us that when their pupils have to make a case, they really have to understand the material, so debating becomes a valuable tool. It also takes pupils out of the world of theory to look at applications. Debating helps develop a wide range of skills - research, building coherent arguments, public speaking, listening and evaluation, and collaborative learning. It is also a fun way to explore science.\nAs well as equipping young people with debating skills, we want to help them understand how to question and weigh up evidence to make informed choices. These are skills which universities and future employers value highly, and which will increase the life opportunities of the young people who take part.\n\nThrough the STEM Ambassadors programme, and our other university contacts, pupils will have an opportunity to question scientists from industry and academia, fostering wider links and encouraging young people to consider science as a career. The project fits well with the new Scottish Curriculum for Excellence, which sees a more interdisciplinary approach to learning plus a responsibility for literacy within the science classroom; and improved professional development for STEM teachers. As explained elsewhere in this application, we will seek to engage schools in outlying areas, which may not usually (for reasons of cost and distance) be able to take part in such a science programme. \n\nThe topic area we want to address is Nuclear Energy. This was the most frequently asked for resource in the feedback from our project last year (see below). We'll look at how it sits alongside renewables as an energy source; and issues of waste and reprocessing. We hope to put practical, and applied, flesh on the bones of the work pupils will be doing on radioactivity and nuclear reactions. \nThis resource will be in the form of 'fact sheets' (printed class sets) alongside teachers' notes/lesson plan. Both will also be freely available to download from our website. \n\nThis is the extension of a project begun last year, with funding from the Scottish Government, The Robertson Trust and The MacRobert Trust. We were able to:\n- create a debates handbook for science teachers, and a website (www.speakupscotland.org.uk). Our existing topics include particle physics (CERN) and space research (eg Hubble's law); nanotechnology and renewable energy. All our materials are freely available to download. \n- run debating workshops for science teachers \n- organise scientist visits to schools (through the STEM Ambassadors programme);\n- set up a national science debating competition. \n\nWe have worked hard to make the contacts with schools and the scientific community, and we have learned a huge amount along the way, so we think we're now able to offer even better workshops and support. We know there is a big demand for the project to continue. \nLast year, over 430 science teachers in 137 schools took part in the debating workshops . These have been consistently highly rated by teachers: 97% rated them as excellent or good (excellent: 63%). What came across most in the feedback was that teachers found it useful doing the activities themselves, and they liked the range of debating formats as it enabled them to incorporate debating into their own lessons more easily. \n\nWe are now seeking funding to help us continue the project: to run a more detailed workshop programme for teachers and pupils, create new science resources and continue to encourage discussion between scientists and young people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006053/1","grantId":"ST/K006053/1","fundValue":"9860","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2014-05-06","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Suzanne Hamilton Ensom","coPersons":[],"organisation":"English-Speaking Union Scotland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
