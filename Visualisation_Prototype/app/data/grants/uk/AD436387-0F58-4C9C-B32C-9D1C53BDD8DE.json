{"id":"AD436387-0F58-4C9C-B32C-9D1C53BDD8DE","title":"Cables for Monochromatic Magnetic Transmission of Power","abstractText":"Power-transmission has for so long been associated with the conduction of electrical currents along copper/aluminium wires that few people now question whether there might be a better way. This proposal poses precisely that question and speculates with some reasoning that the answer might be yes . A key fact is that present-day transmission systems do not attempt to take any advantage of frequency-dependent behaviour of the materials used. This proposal is all about trying to develop and use materials or material configurations which have very strong frequency-dependent properties. In particular, it is argued in this proposal that we can construct a material which has a permeability (an ability to conduct magnetic flux) which is very very high at one frequency and very very low at another (with many orders of magnitude of difference between the two extreme values). If one such material had its peak permeability at, say, 10kHz while another had its trough at precisely 10kHz, we could use one as a magnetic conductor and another as a magnetic insulator and the resulting combination might be a cable which could transmit power very effectively compared with electrical transmission. People who study electromagnetic fields talk about the electric field, E, and the magnetic field , H. In the proposed magnetic transmission of power, we are turning both E and H through 90 degrees compared with their usual orientation but still achieving the same product (E x H) which accounts for power transmission.The development of these frequency-dependent materials / configurations transpires to be related to some fundamental mechanical engineering involving torsional resonant frequencies of units not unlike dumbells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D013763/1","grantId":"EP/D013763/1","fundValue":"205464","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Seamus  Garvey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
