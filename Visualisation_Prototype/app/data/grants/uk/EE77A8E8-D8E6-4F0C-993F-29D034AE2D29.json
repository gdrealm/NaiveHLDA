When irradiating tissue with light at an appropriate wavelength, many molecules absorb this excitation energy and emit new radiation called fluorescence . As these fluorescent molecules occur naturally in biological tissue, their emission is called autofluorescence. By analysing such autofluorescence signals, it is possible to detect the presence of particular kinds of molecule, e.g. providing information on the tissue structure, and also to learn about their local environment, e.g. whether they are bound to other molecules. Autofluorescence may therefore provide a means to detect the early onset of diseases that cause changes in the concentration, distribution and interaction of biological molecules. Because autofluorescence measurements do not require the addition of any chemicals, this approach is label-free and can be non-invasive, making it attractive for diagnostic applications. Biological tissue, however, often contains several kinds of fluorescent molecule in unknown quantities and strongly scatters optical radiation, making quantitative fluorescence measurements difficult. It is therefore desirable to analyse tissue autofluorescence in a way that avoids intensity artefacts and to acquire images so that variations in the autofluorescence signal can be correlated with the observed structures in the tissue. This is analogous to conventional histopathology, where diagnoses are made following biopsy using images of sections of biological tissue that have been stained with dyes to indicate the distributions of different types of molecule. In this proposed work, we will develop a novel endoscope to provide microscope-like images of biological tissue with the autofluorescence signal providing molecular contrast. To quantify the autofluorescence signal, we will exploit the fact that different molecular species radiate fluorescence at different rates and so it is possible to distinguish them by observing the fluorescence decay times (lifetimes) for each pixel in the field of view. By combining fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) with a special endoscope that provides microscope images with depth resolution, we will be able to perform optical biopsy in situ, analysing optically sectioned images with fluorescence lifetime providing the molecular contrast.We have investigated FLIM of biological tissue since 1998, demonstrating some of the first label-free lifetime contrast of ex vivo disease in tissue (e.g. cancer, osteoarthritis and atherosclerosis) and have developed a range of sophisticated laboratory-based FLIM instrumentation including proof-of-principle FLIM endoscopy. It is now vital to progress to in vivo imaging using a clinically viable endoscope-based approach. The world-leading endoscopic confocal microscope developed by Mauna Kea Technologies (MKT) provides optically sectioned imaging with subcellular resolution and has been approved for clinical use in Europe and the USA. Currently it is limited to intensity imaging at a single excitation wavelength (488 nm). We aim to develop a FLIM version of this endoscope, initially using 488 nm excitation and then expanding to shorter wavelengths in order to excite more biological molecules. This instrument will be highly suitable for optical biopsy but the inherently limited field of view of confocal endoscopy will limit its application for screening of disease. We will therefore also develop a clinically viable wide-field FLIM endoscope to provide a larger viewing area, albeit without optical sectioning. This will permit a comparison of the performance of these two approaches to endoscopy. We will also correlate endoscopic FLIM with histopathology and with existing advanced FLIM instrumentation at Imperial, which will help elucidate the molecular origins of the autofluorescence contrast we observe between normal and diseased tissue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F040202/1","grantId":"EP/F040202/1","fundValue":"1445670","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project demonstrated the feasibility of endoscopic FLIM and led to further projects including a PhD project to develop new FLIM endoscopes and two EPSRC funded projects that are still on-going.

Unfortunately, our spectral characterisation of its performance revealed that tissue autofluorescence was swamped by background fluorescence in the fibre bundle at the desired excitation wavelengths. Working with MKT we evaluated a new lower background fibre bundle and determined that 420 nm excitation maximised autofluorescence signal/fibre bundle background but could not achieve sufficient performance for clinical applications. Accordingly we changed our objectives (agreed during EPSRC review visit 03/11/09) and redeveloped this instrument for tissue imaging with exogenous probes. With St Mary’s Hospital, we are investigating its potential to image PpIX in the bladder for cancer detection and explored new excitation wavelengths optimising PpIX signal/fibre bundle background. We also collaborated with CRUK to demonstrate imaging of CFP/YFP/GFP labelled tissue ex vivo and are now working towards FLIM FRET endomicroscopy inside live mice. \n\n\n\nWe undertook extensive spectrally and lifetime resolved ex vivo studies of a range of tissue types (colon cancer, Barrett’s oesophagus, adenomas and inflammatory bowel disease). In a study of 65 specimens from 30 patients we observed statistically significant lifetime contrast between normal and dysplastic or inflammatory tissues. We also employed our SAFE probe to study ex vivo GI tissue and showed statistically significant contrast between normal colon tissue relative to polyps and polyps relative to irritable bowel disease (inflammation), which is clinically useful. Initial studies also indicate contrast between normal colon and inflammatory tissue. \n\n\n\nWe redesigned our clinical FLIM programme, also taking into account the late recruitment of our clinical research fellow (after a previous applicant withdrew at a late stage). To meet our main priority of comparing ex vivo and in vivo autofluorescence lifetime signatures of disease, we switched from the MKT system to the SAFE probe and undertook two clinical trials. The first study was of skin cancer in 25 patients and we demonstrated significant lifetime contrast for blue excitation, in agreement with ex vivo studies. The second study used the SAFE probe to measure GI tissue in 17 patients in vivo, with initial data indicating blue excitation provides contrast broadly consistent with ex vivo studies. In addition, we applied a wide-field FLIM instrument applied to freshly excised ENT tissue, which will be translated to an in vivo clinical trial using our newly designed wide-field flexible FLIM endoscope once we have the regulatory approval. \n\n\n\nWe developed a new concept for ultracompact endoscopy (patent application filed) that utilises multiphoton excitation to minimise background (fibre bundle) fluorescence and, uniquely, eliminates unwanted nonlinear optical effects by distributing the excitation power across 100’s of cores in a fibre bundle and uses adaptive optics to control the phase of the distal beams such that they can be scanned and focussed with no optical or mechanical components. This permits 3-D imaging via ultrathin (~100’s microns) endoscopes - potentially providing unprecedented access to internal tissues. We are now working towards a clinical demonstrator. As discussed above, the instrumentation we have developed could be used in further clinical trials where it is close to providing useful diagnostic information for clinical screening, e.g. in the GI tract as part of routine endoscopic investigations, and for defining tumour margins during surgery, e.g. in the throat (around vocal chords) and in the brain. It could also be used to assist Moh’s procedure. A further application is in monitoring organ viability for transplant patients and we are in discussion with the Chelsea and Westminster hospital to explore this potential for kidney transplants. \n\n\n\nThe instrumentation developed in this project could also be used for animal studies, including veterinary applications, and potentially for biotechnology including for real-time monitors of tissue engineering bioreactors. \n\n\n Our goal is to develop clinical instrumentation to provide label-free diagnosis and monitoring of disease. A key achievement for this project has been to undertake clinical trials and to confirm that the autofluorescence lifetime signatures that we see ex vivo are present in vivo. We have realised this goal to some extent but further trials are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of autofluorescence lifetime readouts and this is a key strand of our exploitation strategy. To this end we are currently conducting an ex vivo study at Northwick Park hospital exploring ENT applications using wide-field FLIM instrumentation developed during this project and are setting up an in vivo clinical trial in this area, to be conducted by an EPSRC DTG-funded PhD student who is completing the fabrication of a new wide-field flexible FLIM endoscope intended for this trial. We will work with our partners at Charing Cross, Hammersmith, Northwick Park and St Mary’s hospitals to identify and address further opportunities for clinical trials and to refine our FLIM endoscopes for maximum clinical utility. Our clinical research fellow (whose clinical PhD work within this project won two international prizes) has applied for an EPSRC Doctoral Prize award to continue this vital clinical imaging with the existing instrumentation developed under this project. Besides PhD students we will be seeking resources from NIHR and the MRC to continue this work. The single point autofluorescence endoscopic probe is also being applied to explore its potential for studying heart disease and osteoarthritis as part of an ongoing EPSRC Healthcare partnership award. We would also like to support ongoing endoscope development through an EPSRC Platform Grant, for which we are finalising a proposal. \n\n\n\nFor optically sectioning high resolution endoscopy, we are working with the CRUK London Research Institute to address in vivo studies of live disease models for research and drug discovery. For this we are preparing to conduct the first in vivo experiments for applying the MKT confocal FLIM endomicroscope in mice labelled with genetically expressed fluorescent proteins, having already demonstrated the proof of concept in ex vivo mouse tissue. This would permit FLIM readouts of signalling processes in internal organs with subcellular resolution for the first time – thereby highlighting new market opportunities for MKT, for which we will work with Imperial Innovations to exploit this commercial development. \n\n\n\nWe are also working to exploit high resolution optical sectioning endomicroscopy for clinical applications. We have two strategies to address the limiting issue of background fluorescence in fibre-bundle endomicroscopes. For the MKT system, we aim to work with exogenous fluorophores excited at longer wavelengths and have explicitly investigated the imaging of PpIX fluorescence induced by administration of ALA-5. We will work to investigate this with fresh tissue resections of bladder tissue with St Mary’s hospital, continuing our ongoing partnership. For imaging tissue autofluorescence, we are working to exploit our novel (patent application filed) endoscope concept utilising adaptive optics to realise ultracompact multiphoton endoscopes with no requirement for distal optics, mechanics or moving parts. We have applied for EPSRC Healthcare Engineering funding to translate the proof of concept demonstrated in this project to a clinical prototype. We will also look for other sources of technology transfer/follow-on funding, including from the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society. \n\n\n\nWhile our current FLIM endoscope technology is clinically deployable, their relatively high cost (&pound;50k-200k for single-point/imaging systems) can ultimately limit their clinical deployment. We therefore initiated a programme within this project to develop more compact and lower cost single point fibre-optic probe-based instruments to measure the lifetime and spectral properties of (tissue) fluorescence using modulated diode lasers and ultrafast detection implemented in programmable FPGA electronic circuitry. This has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and the size of our instrumentation. Once we have a working prototype, we would evaluate it within the scope of our EPSRC Healthcare Partnership grant and seek an industrial partner to manufacture a number of such devices for multiple parallel clinical trials across a range of diseases and clinical sites. We already have an interested SME contributing the design of the electronics and we will seek to fund this development through technology transfer and/or TSB and NIHR funding Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
