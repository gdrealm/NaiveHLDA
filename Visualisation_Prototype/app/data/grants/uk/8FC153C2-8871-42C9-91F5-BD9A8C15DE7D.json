{"id":"8FC153C2-8871-42C9-91F5-BD9A8C15DE7D","title":"Privatisation, foreign investment and firm performance in China","abstractText":"China's continuing economic growth in the last decade has been largely paralleled with its ownership reform and industrial restructuring. As one of the financing channels, FDI (Foreign direct investment) has played an increasingly important role in the very process. However, very little is known about the nature of these investments, the performance of the firms that are entering the Chinese economy in this way, or the costs and benefits to the home economy.\n<br />\n<br />The project charts China's recent rapid progress in industrial restructuring in the last decade, examines the results of ownership changes on firm performance in the context of foreign investment, and evaluates the actual gains of inward investors who took part in this process. The aspects investigated in the study include multinationalsâ€™ productivity, profitability, export performance and survival opportunity. Drawing on a comprehensive firm-level dataset compiled by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) of China for the period of 1998-2005, the project to be conducted takes into account political factors in the process of privatization, and adopts methodologies dealing with firm heterogeneity and potential reverse causality problem that is beset the analysis of privatization.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G00191X/1","grantId":"ES/G00191X/1","fundValue":"109685","fundStart":"2009-01-15","fundEnd":"2012-01-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jun  Du","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
