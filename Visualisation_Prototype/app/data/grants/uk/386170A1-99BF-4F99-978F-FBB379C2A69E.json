This research seeks to extend existing supply network configuration theories by integrating sustainability dimensions to the traditional cost, quality, and timely and dependable delivery analysis.\n\nThe design of supply networks is traditionally driven by operational drivers of cost, quality, and timely and dependable supply. However, sustainability considerations in network design are now becoming increasingly critical and this project seeks to integrate capabilities in the simulation and modelling of operations (Indian Institute of Technology Ropar and Indian Institute of Management Lucknow) and industrial supply network design (University of Cambridge Institute for Manufacturing) toward the development of a new capability in the engineering driven design of sustainable supply networks.\n\nThe key research question which the proposal tries to address is &quot;How to design more sustainable supply networks for manufacturing organisations?&quot; The project will seek to develop methodologies that support optimal usage of key resources like energy, materials, water and other inputs, while minimising the generation of waste. Methods will support trade-off analysis between sustainability practices, whilst simultaneously meeting the cost, quality and responsiveness related requirements. The unit of analysis will be specific product categories in both discrete (automotive and aerospace and process (pharmaceuticals, food processing) industries located in the UK and India.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K02888X/1","grantId":"EP/K02888X/1","fundValue":"561453","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The award only commenced this year (2014) and therefore there are no current findings.

This in ongoing research with potential outcomes undetermined until towards the end of the research period (2016) By the completion of the award it is hoped that Academic knowledge will be disseminated through publications in journals and conferences. This study's potential outcomes include approaches to and evaluation of sustainability in supply networks which will help in developing novel practices to target company specific sustainability objectives and industry specific regulations. Direct knowledge transfer to industrial collaborators, organising Industrial workshops to disseminate knowledge and practice to the wider industrial audience in India and the UK, and publication of industrial reports are key instruments which will be used to achieve the maximum industrial impact.
