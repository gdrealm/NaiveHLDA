As in other publicly funded services, reforms have been driven by concerns of efficiency: market principles have been introduced for the commissioning of legal services and principles of ‘best value’ applied to justify the reallocation of resources across sectors. This has happened despite growing concerns among legal professions, pressure groups and charities about the level of unmet need for appropriate legal services, especially for socially disadvantaged individuals and groups.</p>\n\n<p>Austerity measures have exacerbated those problems. Coalition proposals for the reform of legal aid have coincided with increased pressures on courts, tribunals and advice agencies to address problems of debt, unemployment, mental health and family crises precipitated by the economic downturn.</p>\n\n<p>Against this background, this series of five themed seminars will examine questions about “access to justice” - whether and the extent to which citizens who believe they have suffered a legal wrong are able to gain appropriate redress. Seminars will bring together a core group of forty discussants - government officials, the judiciary, the legal professions, officials tasked with providing legal advice and assistance, NGOs and academics - to discuss the future of legal services in the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0922","grantId":"RES-451-26-0922","fundValue":"15255","fundStart":"2011-05-06","fundEnd":"2013-05-05","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ellie  Palmer","coPersons":["Thomas  Cornford"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
