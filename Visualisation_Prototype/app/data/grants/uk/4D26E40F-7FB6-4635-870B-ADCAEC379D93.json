{"id":"4D26E40F-7FB6-4635-870B-ADCAEC379D93","title":"Public Engagement with MRSA","abstractText":"<p>The goal of this research is to investigate public engagement with the 'hospital superbug', namely methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. It is set within a growing social scientific literature on public engagement with emerging infectious diseases. Such engagement can range from anxious, alarmist responses to more distancing reactions in which ‘risk groups’ are invoked and the sense of invulnerability and equanimity of those not belonging to such groups maintained. The focus of this research is on members of the public’s thoughts, feelings and practices regarding MRSA. Sixty adults will be purposively sampled to encompass relevant age, socio-economic and newspaper readership demographics. Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken to explore the impact of MRSA on antibiotic use, going to the doctor and hospitalization. The interview will also ascertain social representations of the cause, spread and risk of MRSA. Interviews will be analysed using ATLAS-ti. The thematic analysis that emerges will cast light on the pattern of response to this emerging infectious disease. The study also casts light on the relationship between print media reportage of MRSA and its audiences’ thoughts, feelings and practices.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1694","grantId":"RES-000-22-1694","fundValue":"46130","fundStart":"2006-06-12","fundEnd":"2007-06-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helene  Joffe","coPersons":["Peter James Washer"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
