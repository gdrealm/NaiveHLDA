The process consists of the conversion of ammonia to nitrate by two groups of microorganisms. Ammonia oxidisers convert ammonia to nitrite and this is then converted to nitrate by nitrite oxidisers. Although beneficial to some plants, nitrification can have deleterious consequences. Ammonium can be retained in soil but, after conversion to nitrate, it is leached from soil, polluting groundwaters that may be used to supply drinking water. It also contributes to atmospheric pollution, as ammonia oxidation is accompanied by production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also contributes to destruction of stratospheric ozone. \n\nNone of the ammonia oxidisers that have been grown in the laboratory can grow at low pH, but nitrification occurs in acid soils and there is actually evidence that rates are slightly greater at low pH. Approximately 30% of the world's soils are acidic (pH less than 5.5), mainly due to microbial activity, including that of nitrifiers. They represent a wide range of natural and managed habitats including forestry, agriculture and grasslands. Acid soils are therefore of great environmental and economic importance and it is important that we understand the mechanisms leading to nitrification in these soils. \n\nSeveral explanations have been proposed to explain ammonia oxidation at low pH, but none provides a full explanation and all are difficult to demonstrate in soil. Traditionally, the most important soil ammonia oxidisers were thought to be bacteria but we now know that the thaumarchaea, another group of abundant soil organisms, can oxidise ammonia. Thaumarchaea are a group within the archaea, a domain of microbial life distinct from the bacteria. Although they resemble bacteria in many ways, they are evolutionarily distinct and were previously thought to be restricted to 'extreme' environments. \n\nWe recently obtained evidence that two groups of thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidisers are restricted to acid soils, suggesting adaptation to growth at low pH. We then obtained a culture of an organism, Nitrosotalea devanaterra, which is representative of one of the groups and showed it to be a strict, acidophilic ammonia oxidiser that grows only within the pH range 4 - 5.5. At these pH values, ammonia availability will be extremely low, because most will be ionised to ammonium. N. devanaterra must therefore possess unique mechanisms for ammonia oxidation at low pH that enable it to occupy this improbable environmental niche in acid soils. \n\nA major aim of the project will therefore be to determine the mechanism by which N. devanaterra grows at low pH. We also aim to obtain a culture of the second group of acidophilic thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidisers, identified in our earlier studies, and to determine whether both groups utilise the same mechanism. Potential mechanisms will be investigated by sequencing and analysing all of the genes in both strains and identifying which genes are expressed when they are growing at low pH. These mechanisms will then be tested in laboratory growth experiments.\n\nThe second major aim is to determine whether these organisms are actually important in nitrification in acid soils. We will use soil laboratory systems (microcosms) to determine their ability to grow in a range of acid soils and determine whether their growth is associated with ammonia oxidation. We will manipulate soil pH, to determine the influence of pH on their growth and activity, and we will also determine whether the physiological mechanisms that explain growth at low pH in laboratory culture explain growth in acid soils.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I027835/1","grantId":"NE/I027835/1","fundValue":"430811","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  At this moment in time, this research is largely of academic benefit.

In acidic soils, they are thought to be particularly important, potentially being the sole organisms responsible for this process at pH less than 5.5. A long-standing paradox has been, however, that these organisms are thought to oxidise ammonia (rather than ammonium). However, at low pH, ammonia is protonated to ammonium and its availability is minimal.\n\nOur original hypothesis was that these acidophilic ammonia oxidisers have evolved unique mechanisms for oxidising ammonia enabling them to thrive at low pH. However, from successfully sequencing the complete genome of this and further cultivated strains, we have discovered that they use the same mechanism as those found in neutral pH environments, but have adaptions towards acidophiliy (i.e acidic environments) rather than possessing a novel enzymatic repertoire for oxidising ammonia. From an evolutionary perspective, we have proposed that these adaptations indicate that it is only archaea that could have evolved to be active at low pH. This work will be of direct relevance to those concerned with inorganic nitrogen pollution (nitrate pollution from fertilizer use, eutrophication, atmospheric ammonium deposition on natural habitats, declining soil health) including regulatory and legislative organisations. The proposed research will therefore be valuable to scientists attempting to understanding the major contributors to nitrogen cycling processes.\nKey users of these results will therefore include\n• The Environment Agency, SEPA, DEFRA and devolved equivalents, regional and national government.\n• Legislators involved in water quality issues (e.g. the EU).\n• Users of both semi-natural and managed ecosystems (forestry and agriculture).\n• Academics with research areas focused on nitrogen cycling (soil scientists including modellers and those involved in nitrous oxide emissions and climate change).
