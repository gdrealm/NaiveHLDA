This research grant is to provide supercomputing resources for the continuation of this consortium (UKAAC-2). The consortium will tackle key themes identified by academic partners and industrial companies. The work programme is divided into four work packages: fixed wing aircraft aerodynamics; helicopter aerodynamics; propulsion systems; and hypersonic aerodynamics. Access to supercomputing resources will allow world leading calculations, for example: simulations of a complete helicopter; and simulations of an aircraft engine compressor.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F005954/1","grantId":"EP/F005954/1","fundValue":"24289","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Hills","coPersons":["Christian B Allen","Dimitris  Drikakis","Michael  Leschziner","G  Barakos","Jason M Reese","Gary John Page","Antonio  Filippone","Ning  Qin","Christopher Paul Thompson","Paul G.
