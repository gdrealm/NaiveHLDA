{"id":"638FE57B-42CF-4448-807C-9679F65C5AA1","title":"Workshop Domains IX","abstractText":"The Workshop Domains will be organised from 22 to 24 September 2008 at the University of Sussex.This workshop is aimed at computer scientists and mathematicians alike who share an interest in the mathematical foundations of computation. It focuses on domains, their applications and related topics. Meetings are organised at mathematics as well as computer science departments at irregular intervals. The emphasis is on the exchange of ideas between participants. Participation is open and PhD students are encouraged to attend so as to meet experienced researchers in this field.Domain Theory is highly interdisciplinary; topics of interaction for this workshop include, but are not limited to: program semantics, program logics, probabilistic computation, exact computation over the real numbers, lambda calculus, games, models of sequential computation, constructive mathematics, recursion theory, realizability, real analysis, topology, locale theory, metric spaces, category theory, topos theory, and type theory.At this year's event, it is planned to particularly address applications of the above areas to semantics and reasoning about programs, for instance the verification of properties of sequential, concurrent, and distributed software.This workshop will give a platform to international researchers in the field of Semantic Foundations of Computing, a theoretical subject in which the UK computer science community is particularly strong. The funding will provide the means to pay expenses for internationally renowned invited speakers and for participating PhD students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G016267/1","grantId":"EP/G016267/1","fundValue":"9352","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The funded activity was a workshop so the findings that have been communicated stem from other projects and it is impossible to say for the workshop organiser how they have been used (this will be reported in the participant's impact reports if research was sponsored). \nThere have also been two more Domains Workshops of a similar style in 2011 and 2014.

The purpose here was not to fund a concrete project but support the exchange of researchers and interaction between them to create new ideas. The researchers who participated have taken ideas forward into their own research. It is difficult to quantify this.
