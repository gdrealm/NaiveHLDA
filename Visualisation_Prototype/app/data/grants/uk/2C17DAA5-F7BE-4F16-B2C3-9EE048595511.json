Biologists need to know how proteins in cancer cells send signals that influence the growth characteristics of the tumours. The development of reagents to interfere with particular functions of cancer-related proteins gives us tools to look at complex cellular processes and potentially uncover new therapy targets. Our development of small protein inhibitors of cancer proteins has been used by us to focus on two proteins (called RAS and LMO2) which are important in a large number of human cancers. We will use our inhibitors to study responses in cells and find out which molecules are affected using a new technology that gives a read-out of all the molecules in a cancer cell. The outcome of this work will be the identification of proteins involved or altered in cancer and important as targets for new drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901686","grantId":"G0901686","fundValue":"736135","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Terence  Rabbitts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
