The proposed study will address the following knowledge gaps to support the feasibility assessment of a Social Media-enabled intervention to promote &quot;Care in the Sun&quot;, for the prevention of skin cancer, including: (i) would SM constitute an acceptable means for delivering such interventions in the population?; (ii) would people be willing to share across a SM platform like Twitter, personal issues (e.g. health behaviour/attitudes)?; (iii) what types of SM communication and health issues would attract the attention of the target population, e.g. would the use of certain types of visual images be acceptable/effective?; (iv) what behaviour change theories might plausibly underpin the intervention design. Twitter and Facebook are quite distinct SM platforms, the latter offering more potential to identify a user's characteristics and their expressed friendship networks. \n\nWe will develop a SM-enabled mass communication campaign designed to change attitudes and behaviours of adults related to reducing harmful Ultra Violet light exposure. This will be delivered using Twitter and in tandem we will explore the potential of Facebook for similar purposes. \n\nThe outcomes of this feasibility study will include: (i) changes in reported attitudes and behaviours related to UV exposure and skin cancer obtained from &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; population surveys; (ii) pre and post intervention usage of Twitter, social network architecture of Twitter messages, analyses of sentiments expressed within tweets towards the skin cancer prevention SM campaign and patterns of sentiment diffusion across the social network. \n\nThe study will help us learn lessons for using social media like Twitter in future public health campaigns.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026299/1","grantId":"MR/M026299/1","fundValue":"147723","fundStart":"2015-01-15","fundEnd":"2016-07-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Kee","coPersons":["Jun  Hong"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
