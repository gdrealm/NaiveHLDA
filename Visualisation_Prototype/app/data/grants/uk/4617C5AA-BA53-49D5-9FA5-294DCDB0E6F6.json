{"id":"4617C5AA-BA53-49D5-9FA5-294DCDB0E6F6","title":"The Public Leadership Challenge","abstractText":"<p>The overall aim of the seminar series is to set a public leadership challenge within the context of public sector reform. The series seeks to draw the academic research agenda together in a more collaborative way with a view to determining whether and how research can better inform the development of consistent leadership standards and support public leaders in the improvement of services through effective collaborative leadership.</p> \n<p>This will be achieved through a series of five seminars in which leading academics from across a range of public sector disciplines will discuss and contrast the extent to which the public sector landscape is changing through current reform programmes and the extent to which these reforms pose challenges for the leaders of public services and how the effectiveness of public leadership can be evaluated in a consistent way.</p> \n<p>The academics will be supported by a range of organisations from across the wider academic community and informed by key stakeholders from both government departments and public service organisations.</p> \n<p>It is intended that the outcome of the seminar series will be widely disseminated across the academic, policy and practitioner communities and ultimately lead to a public leadership research programme.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4273","grantId":"RES-451-25-4273","fundValue":"14140","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Michael Brookes","coPersons":["Ruth  Young"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
