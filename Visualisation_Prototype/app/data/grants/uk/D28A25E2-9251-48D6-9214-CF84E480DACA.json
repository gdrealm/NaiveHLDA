This initially focuses on Scotland and Wales, but is later extended to Northern Ireland and London and the South East.<br /><br /></li> \n <li>Secondly, the neglect of HEI impacts on non-host regions and on the UK economy as a whole is addressed, in part through simulation of a range of models designed to assess the impact of interregional trade and graduate migration flows.<br /><br /></li> \n <li>Thirdly, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive approach to the measurement of wider higher education impacts, including social, environmental and cultural impacts, through the application of cost-benefit analysis techniques.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The project draws throughout on new micro-econometric research that aids the specification and measurement of the supply side impacts of HEIs and exploits the inter-disciplinary strengths of the overall ESRC Impact of HEIs on regional economies initiative, using other projects to inform the wider impact analysis, as appropriate.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-171-25-0032","grantId":"RES-171-25-0032","fundValue":"458875","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  McGregor","coPersons":["John Kim Swales","Alessandra  Faggian","Ursula Mary Kelly","Stephen  Hill","Richard Ian Harris","Robert Edward Wright"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
