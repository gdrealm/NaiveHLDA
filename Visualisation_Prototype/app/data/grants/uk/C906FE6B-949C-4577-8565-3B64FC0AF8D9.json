Such themes are of considerable\nsignificance across a wide range of fields in physics, probability\ntheory, discrete mathematics and complex systems.\n\nSome of the systems studied will also serve as tools in the analysis\nof certain spatial models, which are of lively current interest due to\ntheir relationship to quantum spin systems and physical topics such as\nsuperfluidity.\n\nThe last part of the project centres on random interlacements, an\nemerging model of percolation and erosion in which long-range\ninteractions play a significant role. We will combine a range of\nprobabilistic, geometric and analytic tools to describe the discrete\nrandom structures that emerge, and to understand how their properties\ndiffer from those of traditional percolation models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019496/1","grantId":"EP/J019496/1","fundValue":"309792","fundStart":"2013-02-28","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina Anna Goldschmidt","coPersons":["James Benedict Martin","Ben  Hambly"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" Not applicable this year Not applicable this year Other","dataset":"gtr"}
