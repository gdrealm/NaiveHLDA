{"id":"8F8AF7CB-5077-4433-AF37-A0C604ADAE02","title":"Missing Migrants and Deaths at the EU's Mediterranean Border: Humanitarian Needs and State Obligations","abstractText":"The epidemic of deaths at the EU's southern shores has taken on a new urgency as the scale of the phenomenon increases. There has been an average of eight deaths a day for the last 14 years, and the problem is worsening. Yet the focus has remained on Europe, driven by references to the &quot;flood&quot; of migrants, and by a policy discussion centred almost exclusively around securing the borders of the EU. The 40,000 people believed to have died trying to enter the EU in the last 14 years remain faceless and anonymous, statistics that justify ever more draconian rhetoric in the capitals of the EU's member states. \n \nWhat remains largely undiscussed amid the data, however, is the fact that most of those who die are missing to those families, in the sense that they have no idea if loved ones who have migrated are dead or alive: the IOM estimates that more than half of the presumed deaths in the Mediterranean have not been verified. Where the bodies of migrants are found in the sea, or washed up on Europe's shores, they are often not identified. The result is that families in the migrants' countries of origin receive no information about what has happened to loved ones who have left. As with any unresolved loss, the ambiguity over the fate of the missing means mothers and wives, sons and daughters live between hope and despair, always waiting for news of their loved one, but never receiving it. The cemeteries of Europe's southern periphery contain anonymous bodies found on beaches after shipwrecks, for which serious identification efforts have not been made. \n \nIn Lebsos, the Greek island where the greatest recent rise in deaths has occurred, the local population is traumatised by these deaths, and local officials are paralysed because resources and policies from Athens concern only the management of living migrants. In contrast to the extensive regulation of migration by the Greek state, there are no regulatory provisions with regard to the identification and burial of the dead. As a result, local authorities - with capacities eviscerated by the economic crisis - improvise responses, with the possibility of identifying the dead compromised by a lack of political will, expertise and resources. A visit to the local cemetery in Mytilene, Lesbos's main city, reveals human remains lightly covered by earth, the only mark on the graves a broken stone, on which is written the (purported) nationality of the migrant, a number, and the date of death. No effort is made to collect post-mortem data that could be linked to the human remains in the ground, and thus aid identification. Local communities by and large reject the language of security in which the issue is wrapped by central governments: they see migrants continuously arriving - both living and dead - and understand that this is a humanitarian issue. While the EU and its member states devote huge resources to the control of their maritime borders, there is an acute lack of resources dedicated to addressing the humanitarian impact of unidentified migrant bodies. Data to count the number of dead have never been systematically collected by states. EU states have the capacity to create a system in which migrant bodies are dignified, with an appropriate burial, and data is collected to maximise the possibility of identifying the dead and ensuring that their families are informed. \n \nThis project seeks to generate data that can enable the authorities to prioritise a systematic approach to the collection of information from both migrant bodies found in the EU and from the families of missing migrants seeking information about missing loved ones. The project will permit such policies to be driven by an understanding of what the families of dead and missing migrants seek from such an approach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N01345X/1","grantId":"ES/N01345X/1","fundValue":"158196","fundStart":"2015-09-14","fundEnd":"2016-09-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Robins","coPersons":["Iosif  Kovras"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
