Timeframes:&nbsp; The project will compare findings from the test sample classic data with those from an existing contemporary data set, the ESRC-funded 'Resources in Parenting' study. The feasibility study will also empirically scope the multi-faceted historically situated, reflexive and practical contextual issues faced in producing such an historical comparative analysis of continuity and change in parenting practice and support in parenting.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3337","grantId":"RES-000-22-3337","fundValue":"75419","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Val  Gillies","coPersons":["Rosalind  Edwards"],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
