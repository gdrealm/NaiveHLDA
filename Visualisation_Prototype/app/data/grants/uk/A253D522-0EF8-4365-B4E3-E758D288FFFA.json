This project assesses how the status of these &Eacute;tablissements (colonies occupied but politically marginal) affects all French-language representations of India and Indian cultures in literary, historiographical and journalistic discourses.\\n\\nIts comparative, triangular methodology, questioning the colonizer versus the colonized binary which persists within colonial discourse analysis, constitutes a salutary model with which to study colonialization and colonialism, and a corrective to the still-prevalent misapprehension of much English-language postcolonial theory that India is an exclusively Anglophone space.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D001137/1","grantId":"AH/D001137/1","fundValue":"194754","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Magedera","coPersons":["Kate  Marsh"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
