AB represents a very promising hydrogen storage material (19.6 wt % hydrogen), the exploitation of which will be significantly advanced by the application of two complementary approaches, based around either stoichiometric or catalytic exploitation of metal reagents: (i) chemical modification designed to disrupt the framework of dihydrogen bonding in the solid state and thereby facilitate more facile and complete evolution of H2; and (ii) transition metal catalysis of AB dehydrogenation, focussing in particular on the elucidation of mechanistic information, thereby allowing for the rational design of more efficient catalyst systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F01595X/1","grantId":"EP/F01595X/1","fundValue":"22959","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Ian David","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
