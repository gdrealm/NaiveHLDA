This mission will consist of 2 separate spacecraft, an ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter and a NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter. This mission will allow us to better understand how the gas giant planets and their satellites formed and evolved and will shed light on the potential emergence of life in our solar system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000658/1","grantId":"ST/I000658/1","fundValue":"40000","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The experiment, JSTIM, proposed for JUICE, is now at the core of a NASA Goddard proposal for the Europa Clipper Mission.

At the time of proposal, however, there were difficulties in demonstrating that a Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) could be procured to operate with sufficient accuracy at the frequencies required and with sufficiently low power. There were also manufacturing hurdles still to overcome to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed Schottky Diodes necessary for mixing the incoming signal with the output of the QCL. As a result, the sub-mm part of the proposed design was ultimately discarded, with deep regrets, and we continued with a thermal-only design. This design was ultimately not selected by JUICE as the selection team seemed intellectually incapable of choosing instruments not on the suggested 'strawman' payload drawn up 2 years previously. Our proposed instrument, ORTIS, would have done a great job at Jupiter. It still could, given political support, on other future giant planet missions. In the meantime the thermal-only design currently forms the core of a Goddard-led proposal to NASA for the Europa Clipper mission, on which we are named as co-Investigators.
