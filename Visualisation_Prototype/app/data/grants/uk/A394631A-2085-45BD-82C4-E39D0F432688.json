Many features create the impression of 'a different accent', including how particular sounds are pronounced, where stress falls in a word, and what intonation pattern is used. There is extensive prior research on the first two of these for Arabic, but few descriptions of the intonation of individual dialects, and what is known is based on different data types so direct comparisons cannot be made.</p>\n\n<p>The Intonational Variation in Arabic project is hosted by the Department of Language and Linguistic Science at the University of York, a leading centre for sociophonetic research. Adapting methodology from earlier ESRC funded work on English (<a href=\"http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/IViE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.phon.ox.ac.uk/IViE/</a>) the project will generate a public-access corpus of Arabic speech, using a parallel set of sentences, stories and conversations, recorded with 18-24 year olds in five regions of the Arab world. Additional data from older speakers (50+) and in nearby cities will reveal changes in progress and local variation. Detailed prosodic transcription will yield intonational descriptions of individual dialects and cross-dialectal comparisons, for use by linguists, learners and teachers of Arabic and other users.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0498","grantId":"RES-061-25-0498","fundValue":"324158","fundStart":"2011-04-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Samantha  Hellmuth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" To date, the most significant achievement of the grant is the collection of a large parallel corpus of speech data, elicited for the purposes of intonational analysis, in eight dialects of Arabic. The rationale of the corpus design is set out in a recent book chapter (Hellmuth 2014).\n\nOn completion of the project these speech recordings, and accompanying transcriptions, will be made available via an online searchable database. We expect all of the remaining objectives of the grant to be achieved by its projected completion date. The eventual findings of our research will be useful to learners and teachers of Arabic, who will benefit from the availability of descriptions of the pronunciation differences between different Arabic dialects of Arabic, and from the availability of sample sound recordings to download. \n\nTo lay a foundation for this future use, we produced a position paper explaining why, in particular, a description of the intonation patterns of different dialects may be useful for learners and teachers of Arabic (Hellmuth 2014). The paper takes research-led recommendations for teaching of the pronunciation of English as a starting point and explores what the equivalent recommendations would be for Arabic, taking into account the known differences between the two languages.\n\nWe have also produced papers i) to show innovative methodology used to collect interactive data in languages such as Arabic where the written form of the language differs from the spoken form (Gargett et al 2014), and ii) to explore whether or not it is possible to detect traces of a person's mother tongue Arabic dialect when they are speaking English as a foreign language (Almbark et al 2014).
