{"id":"F65DB730-2CE1-4222-8054-80BFE1ECBBF0","title":"Agent-Based and DSGE Macroeconomic Models: A Comparative Study","abstractText":"<p>This project will compare and combine two major approaches to macroeconomic modelling: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) and Agent-Based (AB) models. The former is arguably the best structured and most widely accepted. The latter is arguably the more flexible tool for studying complex social systems with many interacting components. The two modelling approaches have different advantages and disadvantages. DSGE models may exaggerate individual rationality whereas AB models offer a more flexible approach to social interactions between individual agents. However, AB models may exaggerate errors in individual decision-making, since they usually model only simple strategies that are far from optimal choices.</p>\n\n<p>This project will, we believe, be the first to compare the two modelling approaches systematically and draw conclusions on what each can learn from the other. The general philosophy is to celebrate and exploit diversity in macroeconomic models. The research strategy is to formulate AB model counterparts of DSGE models to reveal the relative strengths and limitations of the two approaches. Agentised DSGE models will provide important insights for strengthening their foundations, while being better informed by economic theory than conventional AB models. Empirically how AB models can benefit from the estimation approaches used in DSGE models will be explored.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005154/1","grantId":"ES/K005154/1","fundValue":"499514","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Levine","coPersons":["Nigel  Gilbert","Thomas Dumitru Holden"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
