People with impairments in memory and thinking skills as a result of injury or illness affecting the brain can sometimes show changes in level of awareness. In the early stages of developing dementia, some people show reduced awareness while others remain highly aware. There is growing evidence that the level of awareness that a person with dementia shows makes a real difference to his/her own well-being and support needs, as well as to the needs of family members and carers. A better understanding of awareness is therefore required, since there are as yet few clear findings to guide practice in this area. This is partly because awareness is a very complex concept, and partly because the methods used to study awareness have not been very satisfactory. New approaches and methods have been developed in our recent research. These will be used in the present study to carry out a comprehensive exploration of awareness among people with mild to moderate dementia, to explore how it relates to perceived quality of life, and to identify the practical implications for care provision.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0371","grantId":"RES-062-23-0371","fundValue":"529286","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Scientific impact derives from provision of enhanced theoretical understanding, development of new or improved assessment methods, and communication of robust evidence that will help to shape future research in this area.

People with impairments in memory and thinking skills as a result of injury or illness affecting the brain can sometimes show changes in level of awareness. In the early stages of dementia, level of awareness varies. There is some suggestion that the level of awareness a person with dementia shows makes a difference to well-being and support needs, as well as to the needs of family carers. However, there is a lack of clear evidence to inform theory and guide practice in this area. We applied both novel and existing methods to carry out a comprehensive exploration of awareness among people with early-stage dementia, to examine how it relates to perceived quality of life, and to identify the implications for care. Our results identify the extent to which degree of awareness is influenced by aspects of psychological and social well-being, such as mood or carer stress. People with dementia may show awareness through their actions even if not explicitly acknowledging any difficulties. People showing poorer awareness in some areas reported better perceived quality of life. These findings have increased our understanding of reduced awareness and can be used to help people with dementia and carers deal with the impact of reduced awareness. We have developed and piloted information and training materials based on our findings. We have conducted workshops for people with dementia and carers, and training sessions for practitioners in health and social care. Future scientific impact will result from the publication of currently submitted papers (as outlined above) and preparation of additional papers reporting further findings, as well as additional conference presentations. We have six papers currently in preparation, and others are planned. We are currently working on the data relating to our attachment measure as part of a new grant (RES-000-22-4117). We aim to prepare further research proposals based on emerging findings, which will include consideration of intervention approaches for PwD and carers. We aim to publish information about the training sessions we developed. This will be of relevance to care workers and to PwD and carers, and we will provide reports for the Alzheimer's Society newsletter and the Journal of Dementia Care. We aim to integrate this provision within the training programme offered by the Dementia Services Development Centre Wales and will explore its uptake within the practitioner courses offered by the Bradford Dementia Group and other relevant centres. Information will be made available to PwD, carers and practitioners. In response to demand from local groups, further training sessions have been scheduled, beyond the end of the project, and will be funded from existing resources. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
