{"id":"83E86C87-140B-43FB-BF2C-26A1ADB9E575","title":"Targeted Gene Therapy For Cardiovascular Disease","abstractText":"This proposal is timely since the recent Department of Health white paper encouraged translational research in gene therapy. This is particularly relevant to this proposal since we are expanding our molecular understanding of disease and engineering novel genetic medicines. \nGene therapy is relatively high profile and public education is very important. In the light of recent events (e.g. SCID) public engagament is critical as we begin to treat patients with genetic medicines. For our proposal this is very important since target patient populations are large and education aimed at understanding gene therapy will be essential. The applicants are very active in this area through our host University and through existing funding councils. In addition, the newly formed British Society for Gene Therapy (www.bsgt.org) has in its consititution the role of BSGT in public education. AHB is a founder member and treasurer of BSGT and hence this will maximise public engagement in the technology and applications of gene therapy. Additionally, during the fundraising campaign for the British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre (BHF GCRC) AFD has been giving regular talks to lay audiences on genetics and cardiovascular disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400052","grantId":"G0400052","fundValue":"365685","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Howard Baker","coPersons":["Anna F Dominiczak","Iseabail Mhairi Macrae"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
