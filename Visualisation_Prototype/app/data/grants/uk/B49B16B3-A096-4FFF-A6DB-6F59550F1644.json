To do this we focused on charitable activities in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \nWhat we found was that charitable and philanthropic activities are more a matter of individual predilections rather than any commitment to development per se. Most charity takes the form of social protection involving direct assistance to the poor and the marginal in terms of food, medical assistance and, to a lesser extent, housing. A range of charitable organisations support orphanages and old peoples' homes, supply medical services or provide support to education. \nRelatively few charitable and philanthropic activities are concerned with transformative interventions to attack the causes of social deprivation. Rather, existing forms of charity tend to reinforce economic and social inequalities. Organisations which have adopted a more transformative approach to development face increasing problems given the decline in foreign funding and the lack of local funding.\nThe motives underlying charity, coupled with the fragmented and disorganised nature of the charitable sector, limit the developmental potential of indigenous charities. However, in the corporate sector increasing awareness of the potential of CSR is opening up new possibilities for development-relevant interventions.\nIn sum, the conclusions of our research questioned the degree to which faith could be put in indigenous charity and philanthropy in supporting the sorts of development interventions which have traditionally been supported by bilateral and international donors, both official and unofficial. In a follow-up grant (ES/L007819/1) we have sought to develop the findings of this project through providing training and developing training materials for philanthropic donors to develop more effective forms of giving. In addition we are in continuing discussions with various organisations, most significantly the Asian Development Bank, as to how our findings can be fed into developing policies for cooperation between development agencies and local charitable organisations.
