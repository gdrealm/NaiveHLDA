The e/book will include an experimental text&shy; work that will first appear as periodic posts to an online 'blog' or journal for the duration of the e/book's development. In addition, four writers/practitioners will be commissioned to research and develop original texts, which expand both conceptually and formally on the issues, concepts and themes explored in the series. Working across visual and audio culture, literature, choreography, and film, the progressive production of texts will be punctuated by formal and informal dialogues on- and off-line. In sum, the resulting outputs will comprise a limited edition artist's book, an e-book distributed as both limited edition CD-rom and unlimited PDF download, a blog, and gallery-based and online discussions. The research will thereby reach academics, artists, students, contemporary art audiences, internet users, and those with particular interests in theories, practices and interdisciplinary tactics of cultural representation, production and dissemination, in and of diaspora.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119477/1","grantId":"119477/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2007-01-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Pui San Lok","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
