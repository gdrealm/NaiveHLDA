Cells exchange information with each other through special chemicals which travel from cell to cell and instruct them how to behave, for example whether to divide or not or whether to develop a particular function. In cancer, cells can send the wrong signalsother cells or may not be able to read correctly the signals they receive from normal cells. As a result cancer cells carry out the wrong instructions, for example they may divide when they should not or migrate where they should not. The aim of this research programme is to study a particular type of cell signal and understand its chemical structure. This may lead to a better understanding of cell communication in complex organisms and lead to the possibility of engineering forms of this chemical that could correct the behaviour of cancer cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9704528","grantId":"G9704528","fundValue":"2103220","fundStart":"1997-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ermanno  Gherardi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
