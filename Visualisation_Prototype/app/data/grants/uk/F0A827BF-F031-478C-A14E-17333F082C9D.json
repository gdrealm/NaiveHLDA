This programme package (PP1) is concerned with the second element / identifying and assessing methods (technology and people) for coping with EWEs. It is an integral part of the project as it provides technical information on coping measures which is essential for research into barriers/drivers of their uptake by the community (PP2). This interaction between communities and coping measure research will also result in a tool that would assist choosing coping measures - a matrix of technologies and methods, which have been assessed and ranked for their technical performances and potentials for wide community uptake. A further interaction, with the development of EWE impact simulator (PP3), will contribute to the development of the latter.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F036442/1","grantId":"EP/F036442/1","fundValue":"105288","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Li  Shao","coPersons":["Chris Ian Goodier"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":" The emphasis on UK dwelling refurbishment to date has concentrated on reducing energy use and CO2 emissions during the heating season. However, there has been increasing evidence pointing to the need for a more holistic approach. Climate change projections show an increase in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. These include heat waves, such as the one in August 2003, which resulted in the deaths of more than 35,000 people around Europe, over 2,000 of which were in the UK. Future retrofit planning therefore needs to take account of not only winter thermal performance and associated carbon emissions, but also the need to reduce summer overheating to provide a safe and comfortable environment in a changing climate. \n\n\n\nThis research builds on previous published work by quantifying the effect of a range of single and combined adaptations during heat wave periods, using experimental testing, computer simulation and theoretical analysis. Dynamic thermal simulation was used to assess and rank the effectiveness of selected single and combined passive adaptations (interventions) in reducing overheating during a heat wave period for a range of dwelling types, building orientations and occupancy profiles. Three options were considered for providing simulation weather data: future weather data, developed using a morphing methodology as used in CIBSE TM36; European weather data, to approximate the predicted future UK climate; and real UK heat wave periods from 1976, 1995 and 2003. \n\n\n\nThe key output is an interactive retrofit advice toolkit which has been made publically available to all users (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/crew). The research provides, through the toolkit and a series of publications, systematic, quantitative and holistic guidance for retrofitting UK dwellings to (i) reduce overheating risk during heat waves, (ii) minimise winter heating energy and (iii) reduce the cost. \n\n\n\nOther key findings include: \n\n\n\n- External shutters are the single most effective adaptation for most of the house types considered, typically resulting in a 50% reduction in overheating exposure. The exception is the Victorian terraced houses with solid walls, where high albedo walls or external insulation is often more effective. External insulation consistently outperforms internal insulation, though the latter could be effective as an element of combined adaptations.\n\n\n\n- Of the dwelling types studied, 1960s top floor flats and 2006 detached houses (Tier 2) experience more than twice as much overheating as Tier 1 dwellings (end and mid-terraced houses, ground floor flats and semi-detached houses). Tier 2 dwellings are &quot;harder to treat&quot; and their overheating exposure could not be eliminated using the passive measures tested, as one could with Tier 1 dwellings. It is possible to substantially reduce overheating and winter heating energy use of Tier 1 dwellings at moderate cost. The costs for retrofitting Tier 2 dwellings could be many times higher.\n\n\n\n- Adaptation should be considered together with mitigation, both in design practice and in regulations. If existing houses (e.g. terraced) are retrofitted for energy efficiency, without considering summer use, overheating could increase dramatically. Subsequent corrective measures could be costly and energy efficiency may suffer as a result too.\n\n\n\n- Overheating exposure can be significantly greater for residents who have to stay at home during the daytime, e.g. elderly or infirm and they should not, where possible, be housed in the most vulnerable dwellings (Tier 2). The key output is an interactive retrofit advice toolkit which has been made publically available to all users (www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/crew).
