An area of the brain called the hippocampal formation (HF) is crucial to some of the most useful memories we have (those that tell us where to find the people we care about, the food we want to eat, the places that promise excitement, and where to avoid places we might be scared of); and crucial to our most treasured memories (those memories of the events of our lives, such as first kisses, weddings, births, and deaths, that give us our identity and humanity). \n\nIt turns out that the HF is crucial for a kind of spatial memory called allocentric spatial memory. Allocentric refers to large-scale or 'map-like' space, which is defined with reference to the environment as opposed to egocentric space, which is defined in relation to sensory organs like your retina and skin, and in relation to motor effectors like your limbs. Briefly, egocentric representations are crucial for behaviours such as catching a ball or picking fruit from a tree; but behaviours such as remembering the location of water-sources, and navigating long distances over natural terrain also require allocentric, map-like, representations. The hippocampal formation is also crucial for memory that relies on a representation of a context, such as episodic memory (for the events of our lives). It may be that the hippocampus provides a spatiotemporal context to which the contents of a memory (a bride, a mother, their seat locations, the chicken, bad jokes) can be bound. We know that the HF is crucial for these kinds of memories from many types of evidence, notably that patients with damaged hippocampi don't find their way about well, and can't easily form new episodic memories. \n\nOur sense of location &amp; context is likely driven by HF 'place cells', that is, neurons which fire in context-dependent, specific locations. This sense-of-place derives from: 1) self-motion cues, and; 2) external environmental cues. 'Grid cells', which fire in a very geometric tile-like way throughout all environments, represent self-motion information. Like human A-Z atlases, tiling out equal-sided squares over town streets &amp; buildings, the mammalian brain tiles out broadly-equilateral triangles over environments. The recent discovery by our research team of boundary vector cells. which fire when an environmental boundary (e.g. walls, drop-offs) is located at a specific distance &amp; allocentric direction from the subject, supplied the crucial missing piece in understanding the environmental cue contribution. So we seem to know about neurons which establish spatial location based on our own movements, and about neurons which establish our spatial location based on where we are in relation to our surroundings. What we now need is a broad, systems-level understanding of how the representation of environmental boundaries is organised in the HF, and how boundary cells interact with other spatial cells. \n\nWe go about this by recording a lot of individual neurons and also local field potentials (informing us about brain waves). To help us further manipulate particular subsets of neurons, while we record, we beam laser light at neurons that have been genetically modified to be affected (excited, inactivated) by laser light at particular frequencies. To be able to manipulate external environmental cues in a controlled way, we also employ Virtual Reality. We want to explore particular anatomical circuits in the HF, focusing on regions called the subiculum, which may be an organizing centre for boundary representations, and the entorhinal cortex and CA1, which are both strongly connected to the subiculum. We want to test our new ideas about how the subiculum is organised, and how it might provide boundary-related information to the HF. Our work is focused on spatial cognition and memory, but we hope to reveal general principles of the neural representation and organization of episodic memory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M008975/1","grantId":"BB/M008975/1","fundValue":"400662","fundStart":"2015-03-16","fundEnd":"2018-03-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Lever","coPersons":["Thomas Joseph Wills"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
