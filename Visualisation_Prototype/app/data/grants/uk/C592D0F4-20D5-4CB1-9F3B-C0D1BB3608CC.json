In such cases a witness may be asked whether he or she can pick out the voice heard during the crime from a ‘voice parade’, a line-up of recordings which includes the suspect's voice and a number of carefully selected foil voices. In some crimes the perpetrator is heard over the telephone, for example threatening phonecalls, ransom demands, stalking, blackmail, and extortion. This potentially makes voice identification more difficult. The telephone only carries part of the acoustic information in the voice, and it is not clear whether a voice parade can be safely employed in such cases. In this project the ability of listeners to recognise voices heard over the telephone is explored through two studies. The first investigates whether telephone transmission makes speakers of the same general type sound more similar to each other than they would otherwise; and the second examines whether listeners’ performance in an experimentally simulated voice parade is adversely affected by the telephone. The research will also quantify the acoustic correlates of voice similarity to lay the foundations of a framework for the description of voice similarity applicable to voice parades\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028814/1","grantId":"ES/F028814/1","fundValue":"67789","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francis  Nolan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
