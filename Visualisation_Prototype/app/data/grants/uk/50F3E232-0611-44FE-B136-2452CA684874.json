Affected individuals lose their ability to control movement, develop psychiatric problems, an impaired mental capacity and lose weight. The disease progresses for 15-20 years until patients have almost no movement and cannot swallow or speak. There are effective treatments for some psychiatric problems (e.g. depression) but there is no way to halt or slow the mental decline or disease progression. The European Huntington?s Disease Network (EHDN) (funded by the CHDI Foundation) has been established to provide the infrastructure, tools and resources necessary to perform clinical trials for HD in Europe. Unlike Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s disease, HD is always inherited and a genetic test can be used to diagnose individuals with early stage disease and before symptoms develop. This group of people will be particularly suited to receive disease-modifying treatments once they are developed. To develop the tests to monitor the emergence and progression of disease in this group, the CHDI Foundation has funded TRACK-HD, a three year initiative that commenced in 2007 to develop clinical, magnetic resonance imaging and blood tests and compare their utility. \nThe mechanisms that underlie HD are extremely complex and many potential therapeutic avenues have been proposed. However, because clinical trials will remain resource intensive and expensive, the number of drugs that can be tested in the clinic will inevitably be limited. Mice that have been genetically altered to carry the HD mutation are very good models of the human disease. Therefore, because drug trials can be performed relatively quickly in mice, the demonstration that a treatment has a beneficial effect in an HD mouse model is the factor most likely to be used to prioritise drugs for testing in clinical trials. Therefore, mouse trials must be rigorous, controlled and reproducible and ideally incorporate tests that are relevant to the human disease. In partnership with the CHDI Foundation, we shall conduct a detailed comparative evaluation of HD mouse models, with a particular focus on presymptomatic and early stage disease using tests chosen to complement the TRACK-HD clinical study. This project will inform the design of mouse trials using tests that emerge as being the most useful for clinical evaluation. This synergy will maximise the chance of translating successful therapeutic strategies for HD into the clinic using validated HD mouse models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800846","grantId":"G0800846","fundValue":"682744","fundStart":"2009-04-14","fundEnd":"2012-12-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Bates","coPersons":["Sarah Joanna Tabrizi","Michel  Modo"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
