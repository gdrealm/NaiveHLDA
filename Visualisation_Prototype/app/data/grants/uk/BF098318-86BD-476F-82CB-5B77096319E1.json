It is essential to understand the mechanisms through which the nerve cells (neurons) degenerate, to be able to design advanced therapies for protecting the cells. The process of autophagy, self-digestion, is of vital importance for human health in ageing and neurodgeneration. Autophagy is known to help neurons in keeping healthy through degradation of old and not functional cell components. We have discovered that new group of genes, acting in a pathway (the Fat/Hippo pathway), which is best known for its effects on cancer, is also essential for correct autophagy and neuronal health. We now wish to investigate the mechanism through which the Fat/Hippo pathway affects autophagy, so that new intelligent approaches can be designed for alleviating neurodegeneration by modulating the activity of this pathway.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002186","grantId":"G1002186","fundValue":"498559","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Manolis  Fanto","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
