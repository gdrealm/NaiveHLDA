An ideal technique for monitoring and triggering the structural evolution of such transformations within the millisecond timescale is time-resolved X-ray scattering, employing pressure as the triggering variable. The p-jump technique can be applied quite generally to the study of soft condensed matter and biomolecular phase transformations, such as lyotropic liquid crystal phase transitions, micelle-vesicle transformations, DNA unwinding, and protein folding. To this end we aim to develop and construct a millisecond pressure-jump X-ray cell for use at the Non-Crystalline Scattering beamline I22 at Diamond. We will also develop user-friendly apparatus control, integrated with the beamline software currently under development for I22. Although this apparatus is primarily designed for pressure-jump experiments, it can also be used for rapid scanning of pressure in the range 1 bar - 5 kbar, allowing pressure-temperature phase diagrams to be determined rather efficiently. It should also be noted that the cell will be capable of holding a fixed pressure for specific experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F001401/1","grantId":"ST/F001401/1","fundValue":"343613","fundStart":"2007-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-01-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Michael Seddon","coPersons":["Richard  Templer","Oscar  Ces"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
