During this project a number of interesting discoveries were made:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>water was being contaminated in the household</li>\n\n <li>there was a general lack of understanding surrounding the re-contamination of water </li>\n\n <li>few people were aware that chlorine (household bleach) was widely available.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>High levels of self reported illness were recorded in the community and it could be said that water related diseases impacted on the day to day lives of people in this community. </p>\n\n<p>Drinking water quality in this area can be improved by building capacity in the community to make informed choices when managing their drinking water. </p>\n\n<p>The knowledge from the PhD will be returned to the community through interactive workshops with household water managers utilising a tool kit called Ketsoâ„¢ and developing workshops for children with a local environmental group. These workshops will explore household contamination of water, safe storage, re-contamination of water and household drinking water treatment, and the general issues around water, sanitation and hygiene.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-192-22-0097","grantId":"RES-192-22-0097","fundValue":"3079","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  PatersonClaire  Furlong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
