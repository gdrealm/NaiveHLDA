The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using novel techniques for the rapid production of coated microbubbles with a high degree of quality control. The work will focus on the generation of phospholipid-coated microbubbles for use as targeted drug-delivery agents in the detection and treatment of cancer. This application presents a significant challenge in terms of the constraints on bubble size, monodispersity and uniformity and a successful outcome would have huge impact across both the industrial and research communities. The project will draw upon complementary expertise from engineering, materials science and medicine and represents a key stage in the development of larger multi-disciplinary projects and future exploitation of the technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E012434/1","grantId":"EP/E012434/1","fundValue":"142409","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The techniques developed under this research grant have formed the basis for collaboration with Unilever to apply them to food product engineering for enhanced nutritional value.

It was successfully demonstrate that both coaxial electrohydrodynamic and microfluidic processing could produce bubbles with very narrow size distributions and uniform coatings. Both techniques were shown to be greatly superior to conventional methods such as sonication in this respect and more efficient. Further investigation of upscaling potential is required to achieve comparable yields. Microfluidic processing was found to produce the most monodisperse suspensions but the electrohydrodynamic method was better suited to producing smaller bubbles and also had the advantage of being less susceptible to nozzle clogging. In the food and pharmaceutical industry; also in other sectors requiring encapsulation such as the cosmetics industry and materials engineering and in the case of the microfluidic bubbling, tissue engineering. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technology was further developed via a subsequent 1 year grant and has now been patented (patent no. 1102148). The investigators received a 2009 Royal Society Brian Mercer Innovation Award and the 2010 Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers Venture prize to start a spin-out company (AtoCap) through which they are commercialising the (EHD) technology and also the microfluidic devices developed in this project. They have also commenced funded collaborations with Unilever and Veloxis to exploit both technologies in the food industry with the former and the EHD methods in the pharmaceutical industry with the latter. The investigators have also commenced several clinical collaborations for controlled drug delivery. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
