The study of the corresponding imaging, or reconstruction, problem is a more recent one. If the material parameters of the PDE present high contrast ratio, the solutions of the PDE become particularly challenging to analyse and to compute. Similar problems occur in time dependent equations in the frequency domain for high frequency. On the other hand, very high frequency regimes, or very contrasted materials, were considered first in imaging, as well-differentiated areas are, at first sight, simpler to locate by ad-hoc methods. Over the last decade the analysis of the inversion problem at moderate frequencies, the rigorous derivation of asymptotics at very high frequencies, and the regularity properties of solutions of elliptic PDE in very heterogeneous media have received a lot of attention.Part of the attention is due to the fact that these problems are particularly challenging. For another part, it is because of the numerous applications of these results in material sciences and in bio-medical imaging. Recently, emerging bio-medical imaging methods based on the observation of non-linear interactions of coupled physical phenomena (such as for example vibro-acoustography) have also become the subject of active research. Progresses on the mathematical understanding of the direct and inverse problems associated to these hybrid imaging methods are crucial to obtain enhanced imaging possibilities, beyond what is obtained by the integration of different imaging modalities taken separately. The focus of this workshop will be to stimulate collaborations between the participants, in the hope of achieving significant progress in (a) complete understanding of the direct problem with high contrast or high frequencies, (b) unified approaches to the inverse problem for both small and large contrast or frequencies, and (c) mathematical modelling of emerging experimental measurement methods. With this goal in mind, we wish to bring together senior experts and young researchers interested in the mathematical problems associated with imaging of multi-scale, or high contrast materials. All the mathematicians participating in the workshop are actively working on different aspects on these problems. Their expertise comprises heterogeneous random media, regularity theory for linear and non-linear PDE with very contrasted coefficients, mathematical invisibility (or cloaking), imaging and numerical reconstruction, numerical methods for high frequency elliptic problems, and emerging biomedical imaging methods. We have also invited an experimental physicist, whose recent work is devoted to new imaging methods for liquid crystals. The mathematical challenges associated with the mathematical formulation and understanding of these experiments and other hybrid measurement methods could be one of the applications of theoretical developments we hope this workshop will produce.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028668/1","grantId":"EP/I028668/1","fundValue":"15766","fundStart":"2011-06-28","fundEnd":"2011-09-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The majority of the papers published in the proceedings of the workshop have been quoted several times.

The study of the corresponding imaging, or reconstruction, problem is a more recent one. If the material parameters of the PDE present high contrast ratio, then the solution to the PDE becomes particularly challenging to analyze, or compute.

Over the last decade the analysis of the inversion\n\nproblem at moderate frequencies, the rigorous derivation of asymptotics at high frequencies, and the regularity properties of solutions of elliptic PDE in highly heterogeneous media have received a lot of attention.\n\n\n\nThis workshop brought together senior experts and young researchers interested in the mathematical problems associated with imaging of multi-scale or high-contrast materials, working on the different aspects of these problems. It was extremely successful, The main themes were\n\n- Heterogeneous random media, at high frequency, and identification\n\n- High contrast elliptic systems\n\n- Imaging: invisibility and hybrid imaging methods\n\n- Numerical methods for high frequency problems\n\n\n\nSpecial attention was devoted to new models and problems coming from physics leading to innovative imaging methods. The proceedings of the workshop have been published in the Contemporary Mathematics series of the American Mathematical Society, an international peer-reviewed publication. One potential use is seismic imaging. In fact one of the methods presented correctly predicted a seismic event. Other areas of applications are the imaging of liquid crystals, and the development of 'invisibility cloaks', that is, \n\nways to make obstacles not inferere with electromagnetic waves. This worskhop was about accurate imaging of complex media, and (a contrario) invisibility: the methods and results either presented during the workshop or published in the proceedings can be put to use to improve the imaging methods currently used.
