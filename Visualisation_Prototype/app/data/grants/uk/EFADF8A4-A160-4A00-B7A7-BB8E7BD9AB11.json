{"id":"EFADF8A4-A160-4A00-B7A7-BB8E7BD9AB11","title":"NETWORK: ANGIONET - Interdisciplinary Angiogenesis Network","abstractText":"Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed, and it plays a major role in normal development and a number of medical conditions such as cancer, vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and impaired wound healing. However, our understanding of angiogenesis is critically retarded by its inherent complexity and consequent recalcitrance to the application of standard biological methodologies. An Angiogenesis Network will bring together a number of internationally renowned researchers from multiple disciplines within biology, medicine, engineering, and the physical sciences. This group activity will enhance the development of innovative techniques that could not be achieved in isolation. A truly interdisciplinary network devoted to the study of angiogenesis will engage life scientists, clinicians, engineers and physical scientists in developing new approaches and methodologies to improve our understanding of angiogenesis in a variety of contexts, including normal development, wound healing, tumour growth, and tissue engineering.The Network will establish and maintain a multi-disciplinary research consortium interested in determining the mechanisms controlling new blood vessel formation. A series of workshops will allow for the presentation of frontier research, encourage extensive discussion, generate important new projects and techniques, and promote a sense of community. In addition, the Network will embody an openness to new ideas and concepts, and to input from less established participants. This will enable them to develop personal contacts with more senior researchers, and contribute to the development of a new generation of scientists that transcend the traditional barriers between disciplines. An important target is to involve the full range of engineering and the physical sciences, including experimental and computational chemistry, engineering, mathematics, physics, information science and materials science. This very broad range of expertise is a particularly exciting feature of the Network, and should lead to a number of novel, unexpected, and adventurous collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D501083/1","grantId":"EP/D501083/1","fundValue":"63348","fundStart":"2006-03-02","fundEnd":"2009-05-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Markus  Owen","coPersons":["David John  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
