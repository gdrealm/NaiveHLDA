The research aims to undertake a secondary analysis of the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS). The BRHS is a prospective study in middle-aged men in 24 British towns, recruited in 1978-1980. The study has undergone 5 survey waves between 1978-80 and 2003. As well as data on health status the questionnaires gathered information on personal circumstances, smoking history, drinking and physical activity. </p> \n<p>The consistency of the questions asked in the repeated waves means that the data provide an opportunity to examine, longitudinally, lifestyle categories in relation to other information on the lives of the men including occupational class, employment status, family history, age and town of residence.&nbsp;This project will use a method of analysis called Multiple Correspondence Analysis. When combined with methods of analysis that look at the links between lifestyles and health outcomes this method can potentially enhance our understanding of how changes in lifestyles in society as a whole may impact on the health of the nation. </p> \n<p>The findings from the research will inform the development of better Public Health interventions and inform the methodological development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E01822X/1","grantId":"ES/E01822X/1","fundValue":"176736","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Rees Jones","coPersons":["Peter  Whincup","Sasiwarang Goya Wannamethee","Richard William Morris"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
