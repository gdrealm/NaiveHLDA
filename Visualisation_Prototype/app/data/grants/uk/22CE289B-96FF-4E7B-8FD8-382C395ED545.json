While this is beneficial in most cases, severe stress can lead to abnormal brain adaptation and the development of anxiety disorders. \nThe nature of neuronal adaptation leading to abnormal anxiety is still unclear. In order to understand these processes mouse models of stress, anxiety and fear are often used. Using these models it has been shown that one brain region important for processing stress-related information and for anxiety is the amygdala. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that operate in this region to facilitate the development of anxiety disorders. \nWe have previously shown that a protein called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is present in the amygdala and it mediates stress-related neuronal adaptation. Mice in which the tPA gene has been disrupted do not show neuronal adaptation and anxiety in response to stress. \nThe mechanisms by which tPA facilitates stress-induced anxiety is not known. In this project we propose to elucidate these mechanisms by examining the role of molecules that interact with tPA in the amygdala during psychological stress. These studies will help develop more efficient therapies for anxiety disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500231","grantId":"G0500231","fundValue":"314706","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2009-07-08","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Pawlak","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
