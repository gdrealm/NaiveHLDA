Such a measurement tool would need to collect and analyse data in a reasonable time frame, with enough detail, flexible enough for different ages and ethnic groups and at minimal cost. At the moment there is no such dietary assessment tool available in the UK. This study will make use of the internet to develop a new UK focussed dietary assessment tool based on the Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) developed in the USA. The AMPM uses 5 cycles of questioning to obtain a detailed account of food eaten in the past 24 hours. A search engine allows participants to select from several thousand food items in an extensive food database. \n\nThis project has three main components. 1) Development of a new UK on-line dietary assessment tool. Existing online tools from the US and France (ASA24, DietDay, Nutrinet Sante) will be compared using focus groups. 30 potential users will be divided into 3 groups according to age: adolescent; adult; elderly (post-retirement). Following this the new UK tool will be developed based on the American ASA24 tool as template. 2) The second part of the study is a validation study, to see how the new tool compares to existing ?gold standard? approaches. We will compare food and nutrient intakes assessed by the on-line tool with foods and nutrients obtained using an interviewer administered dietary recall (the AMPM) both in comparison to independent biomarkers of nutrients: specifically urinary N (for protein); potassium; sucrose and fructose; and total energy expenditure. 200 participants will provide repeated measurements over 6 months. We will look at differences in agreement between the biomarkers and nutrient intakes as assessed by the average of measurements from both the on-line recall and the AMPM. 3) The final part will be a pilot study to see how well the new tool will work in practise with two different epidemiological cohorts. A subgroup of 200 older women in the UK Women?s Cohort plus their adult children and adolescent grandchildren and 100 participants from the Clinical Biobank at Imperial, a clinic based cohort with mixed population characteristics, will complete 3 on-line recalls over 6 months.\n\nDissemination of the tool is key and open access vital. We intend to provide the software free of charge to other UK researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100235","grantId":"G1100235","fundValue":"992267","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet  Cade","coPersons":["Elio  Riboli","Laura J Hardie","Petra Ariane Wark","Darren Charles Greenwood","Nisreen A Alwan","Paul  Elliott","Gary Steven Frost","Charlotte Elizabeth Evans"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
