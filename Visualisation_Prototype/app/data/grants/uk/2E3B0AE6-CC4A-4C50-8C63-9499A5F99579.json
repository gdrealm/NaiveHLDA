Research on women undergoing abortion shows that in many cases their pregnancy was the result of them suddenly stopping their method of contraception, or switching to a less effective one. Their pregnancies might have been prevented had they been given the right information and advice they needed to continue protection. This study aims to assess the size of this problem, the reasons for it and how it might be addressed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601684","grantId":"G0601684","fundValue":"341744","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kaye  Wellings","coPersons":["Anna  Glasier","Catherine  Mercer","Lisa  Williamson","Judith Mary Stephenson","Andrew  Copas"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
