The genome itself is annotated with information about the locations and functions of genes, and quantitative data about genes and other elements within the genome. The UK-based Ensembl project is a leading genome browser, used by thousands of researchers every day. The value of genomic information is greatly increased when it is integrated with and can be directly viewed alongside other biological data sources such as proteomics - a set of technologies devoted to the identification and quantification of proteins, the functional molecules encoded by each gene. From a technical point of view, the large size of modern biological data sets makes it challenging to efficiently integrate them into genome browsers. A technology called DAS (Distributed Annotation System) is the prevalent technology used by genome browsers to integrate external data but it can no longer support much-needed new features or scale to the sizes of modern data sets. Another genome browser, the UCSC Genome Browser, has developed a more modern and efficient technology, specifically designed for large-scale data sets called 'TrackHubs'. Both UCSC and Ensembl have developed initial support for this technology, but there are still limitations for many users, and Ensembl's support remains incomplete. In the 'ProteoGenomics' project, we first want to further develop the 'TrackHub' technology, expanding its scope of usage in Ensembl, and making it easier for researchers around the world to discover and use TrackHubs containing different types of research data. Ensembl's TrackHub technology will be expanded to proteomics data for the first time and thus improve the provision of non-genomics biological information in this widely used resource.\nIn the project, we are going to build technology to integrate proteomics data with the genome data held in Ensembl, in a dynamic and effective way. With this aim in mind we will use public MS proteomics data submitted and available in one of the main repositories in the world, the UK-based resource PRIDE, which is also one leading the ProteomeXchange Consortium of proteomics resources. We will reanalyse the data in PRIDE via our ProteoAnnotator pipeline to provide updated or complementary information to the results originally submitted by the research team that generated the data. We are pioneering techniques for extracting more value from the same data, to understand how proteins vary in their abundance and in chemical modifications that occur on proteins, altering their function, two types of results often not generated initially by research groups submitting data to PRIDE. Through this data reuse and the extraction of new biological findings, the value of the submitted datasets will increase. In addition, 'ProteoGenomics' will provide a portal for datasets from the recently started Human Proteome Project (HPP), providing the global research community with a single entry point to these datasets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024225/1","grantId":"BB/L024225/1","fundValue":"481807","fundStart":"2014-08-11","fundEnd":"2017-02-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henning  Hermjakob","coPersons":["Paul  Flicek","Juan Antonio  Vizcaino"],"organisation":"EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
