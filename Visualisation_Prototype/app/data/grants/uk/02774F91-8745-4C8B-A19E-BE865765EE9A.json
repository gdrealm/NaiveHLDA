The current plan is that construction will start in 2015. Once complete, DESI will study the expansion rate of the universe and the growth of cosmological structure through a 5-year survey of 14,000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky using the Mayall 4m telescope.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M003760/1","grantId":"ST/M003760/1","fundValue":"76533","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Allington-Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
