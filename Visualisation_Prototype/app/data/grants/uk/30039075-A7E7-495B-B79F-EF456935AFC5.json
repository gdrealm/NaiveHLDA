It is characterised by intrusive unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviours that vary in intensity, frequency and character. The standard treatment is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) aimed at enabling patients to gain better control of their obsessive thoughts and compulsive acts and therefore spend less time being distracted by them and function more normally in everyday life. Patients may also benefit from medication (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) which is thought to act on the brain circuitry that is considered abnormal in OCD. However, these treatments are ineffective in up to 40% and symptoms in this subgroup can be sufficiently severe that patients are unable to perform activities of daily living, sustain work or maintain relationships. The English NHS National Specialised Commissioning Group funds services to provide assessment and intensive CBT and pharmacotherapy for such patients. Although these have good results there remains a truly refractory subgroup with significant disability.\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique which has proved safe and very successful in helping people with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. It is thought to act by modifying abnormal processing in particular brain circuits which are functioning abnormally. DBS has the advantage that stimulation can be adjusted to optimise benefits and minimise adverse effects and it is also reversible in that stimulation can be switched off if the response is unsatisfactory and electrodes can be removed. DBS is now being studied in other disorders such as medically-refractory chronic, severe headache and severe depression.\n\nThere have been several studies of DBS for OCD and the results suggest that two thirds are helped, although patients remain symptomatic. More research is required to determine the best brain target for DBS and to understand more about the mechanisms of action as this might help us improve upon the current response rate and reduce symptom severity even further. Although CBT will not have previously been effective in these treatment-refractory patients, DBS may reduce symptoms enough to enable them to use CBT more effectively and the combination may result in a better outcome than DBS alone. To address these gaps in our knowledge we have brought together a network of specialist OCD clinicians, leading OCD cognitive neuroscientists and expert DBS clinicians to undertake the first UK study of DBS for severe, medically intractable OCD.\n\nWe propose to study 6 patients with severe, treatment refractory OCD who will be recruited through the specialised service for severe OCD and who will already have undergone the treatments involved in that care pathway. The study will fully comply with UK clinical governance procedures. The overarching aim is to compare the effects of DBS in two brain areas previously found to reduce OCD symptoms - the ventral striatum /ventral capsule (VS/VC) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) - in the same patients. We will test the hypothesis, grounded in evidence from cognitive neuroscience, that DBS at both sites is better than either site alone for treating the symptom dimensions of OCD. Specifically, we will employ novel cognitive paradigms and neurophysiological measures of cortical synaptic function to test the hypothesis that VS/VC and STN DBS have different mechanisms of action and that alleviation of OCD symptoms is mediated by improvement in mood/anxiety with VS/VC DBS and by directly interrupting obsessions and compulsions with STN DBS. We will additionally determine whether adjunctive CBT enhances the response to DBS because it provides the cognitive and behavioural skills to optimise their symptom management and thereby improve daily function. At the end of the study the patients will remain on the optimum DBS treatment parameters and will continue to be monitored by our team.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J012009/1","grantId":"MR/J012009/1","fundValue":"235767","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eileen Maria Joyce","coPersons":["Thomas  Foltynie","Patricia  Limousin","John  Rothwell","Ludvic  Zrinzo","Marwan  Hariz","Marjan  Jahanshahi","Lynne Marjorie  Drummond","Barbara Jacquelyn Sahakian","Naomi  Fineberg","Trevor William Robbins","Keith  Matthews"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
