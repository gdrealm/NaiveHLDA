This research examines the impact of intercultural contact by comparing such sojourners with a matched group of peers. The study will monitor a large cohort of international exchange students (sojourners) before, during and after intercultural contact. The research has four objectives. A first objective is to research the occurrence of acculturative stress, specifically examining when, and why stress occurs, and how it evolves over time. A second objective is to examine cultural learning and adaptation. In particular, the research will explore whether sojourners benefit in terms of improved culture specific knowledge (eg language, customs), general cultural awareness, and personal development (eg self-confidence). A third objective is to study the impact of intercultural contact on intergroup behaviour. The study will appraise whether and how intergroup contact influences perception of ingroup and outgroups. Finally, the study will investigate how differences in cultural distance (ie the extent to which cultures are different) affect these issues of stress, adaptation, and intergroup contact.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1211","grantId":"RES-062-23-1211","fundValue":"287859","fundStart":"2008-09-15","fundEnd":"2013-01-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicolas  Geeraert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
