{"id":"6EF51374-F8B9-4895-BD8D-ECD91294D450","title":"Revivalism, Jacobitism and Revenge in Joyce's Dubliners","abstractText":"This project seeks to reread James Dubliners in such a way as to suggest a marked hostility on Joyce's part towards the major figures of the Irish Revival and toward the protestant Ascendancy which nourish them. Thus, far from being the cosmopolitan-in-exile of much critical commentary, this project will seek to reconsider Joyce and his nationalist project and to locate his political allegiances in the Jacobite tradition of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As such, the resulting monograph will shine new light on Joyce's two famous claims for Dubliners: that it was written with 'scrupulous meanness' and that it sought to bring about 'the spiritual liberation of my country'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112660/1","grantId":"112660/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-23","fundEnd":"2006-05-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Shovlin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
