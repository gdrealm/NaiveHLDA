{"id":"E4AE8617-6221-44DF-BD95-52E5D1628DA6","title":"Attention and perceived stability across eye movements","abstractText":"The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of attention in maintaining spatial continuity across eye movements. The eyes move several times each second, and with each eye movement, the entire visual array moves across the retina. When driving, for instance, we may shift our direction of gaze from the rearview mirror to the gear shift, causing the entire windscreen to shift from the lower visual field to the upper visual field. Yet we do not seem to lose track of the visual scene as a whole, and in particular we seem to have little difficulty maintaining the focus of our attention on the locations where important information (such as oncoming traffic) will appear. Indeed, the shift across the retina of the entire visual scene has surprisingly little impact on our subjective sense of space and continuity, despite the fact that when the eyes move, all the neurons in visual cortex suddenly begin receiving information from a new location in space. Visual mechanisms must exist that assist us in maintaining accurate representations of relative space over changes in their retinal positions. One candidate is known as saccadic remapping: namely, cells in some visual cortex regions have been demonstrated to respond to the visual array as though it were already in the retinal locations that it will be in when the impending eye movement is completed. The source of this signal seems to be, at least in part, the eye movement system itself. Saccadic remapping has been suggested to underlie our subjective sense of continuity by providing a continuous representation of visual space over eye movements, though not much is known about how much it actually contributes to visual experience in human observers. This project will investigate the nature of spatial stability over eye movements, specifically assessing whether selective visual attention is a fundamental component of the process. Specific questions that will be addressed are: to what extent do eye movements disrupt spatial attention to peripheral locations? To what extent does attending to specific objects in the environment determine whether their spatial information will be preserved across an eye movement? To what extent do we rely on stable environmental information to keep track of objects when they move on our retina? Behavioural research on healthy observers and patients with brain damage will be used to address these questions. The answers will shed light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying the continuity of conscious visual experience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01280X/1","grantId":"BB/H01280X/1","fundValue":"157707","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Together with colleague Jasna Martinovic (also funded by a BBSRC new investigator grant), I created a family drop-in exhibit for the British Science Festival in Aberdeen (September 7-8th, 2012). My part of our exhibit contained demonstrations and hands-on activities about vision and eye movements, and highlighted some recent advances made possible by this funding. Families could take away a three-panel brochure describing BBSRC-funded research from both of our laboratories, presented in a fun and accessible way.\nIn addition, this BBSRC grant provided funds to support the employment and training of a postdoctoral research assistant and an undergraduate research assistant. Both received essential training and an opportunity to develop their careers. The postdoctoral fellow (Dr W.J. Macinnes) has moved on to a permanent academic post at the University of Moscow, and the research assistant (Silke Jensen) is completing a PhD at the University of Leicester.

Taken together, the results largely support a model of perceptual continuity across saccades that relies on spatial attention, although it is interesting to note that not all the results are consistent with an account based solely on spatial attention, so some further exploration will be required to understand the interplay of multiple possible mechanisms, including feature-based attention and allocentric reference frames. An insight with clinical importance arising from my research on this topic is the very large increases in sensitivity in both the blind and sighted field that we observed in patients with hemianopia when eye movements shift visual information from one retinotopic region to another. This raises the possibility that we can systematically increase visual sensitivity in the blind field through training based on linking blind and sighted-field stimulation through eye movements, an idea that we are currently exploring in further experiments.
