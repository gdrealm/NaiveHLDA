It examines a range of factors include case-, court- and process-specific variables. It aims to develop theoretically and empirically rich connections between law and geography; utilise a range of methods including participant observation, statistical analysis and interviewing; and help to improve legal decision making with geographical and ethnographic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to make a significant impact beyond the university by creating knowledge that will be useful to elite legal decision makers and institutions, asylum seekers and their legal representatives. To this end it will result in the publication of both an interim and final report that will be disseminated among the legal community working in the area of immigration and asylum law.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J023426/1","grantId":"ES/J023426/1","fundValue":"404172","fundStart":"2013-01-21","fundEnd":"2016-07-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Gill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
