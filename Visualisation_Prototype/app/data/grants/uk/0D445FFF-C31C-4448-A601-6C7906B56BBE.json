{"id":"0D445FFF-C31C-4448-A601-6C7906B56BBE","title":"Neurobiology of the DISC1 pathway","abstractText":"Bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia are severe forms of mental illness that together affect approximately one in fifty people at some time in their life. We know very little about what goes wrong in the brains of people suffering from mental illness. However, we do know that these illnesses tend to cluster in families, pointing to genetic (inherited) factors being important in increasing risk of becoming mentally ill. We have identified two such genetic factors, genes called DISC1 and PDE4B, that are damaged in some patients diagnosed with mental illness. DISC1 and PDE4B work together to control the amount of a signalling molecule called cAMP, which is needed for many important brain functions, including some of the thought processes that are abnormal in psychiatric patients. Now we want to understand in more detail how DISC1 and PDE4B interact with other factors in brain cells to carry out essential biological tasks. This will tell us more about the effect of damage to these genes upon brain function, and how this leads to mental illness. If we can understand what happens in the brain in mental illness this work may ultimately lead to development of better ways to treat schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600214","grantId":"G0600214","fundValue":"1133540","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne  Millar","coPersons":["Walter John  Muir","David  Porteous","Douglas  Blackwood"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
