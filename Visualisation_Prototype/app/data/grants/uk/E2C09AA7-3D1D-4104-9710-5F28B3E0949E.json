{"id":"E2C09AA7-3D1D-4104-9710-5F28B3E0949E","title":"Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit Project Portfolio","abstractText":"Observational astronomy in the UK is in a strong position with the\nadvent of the pioneering near-infrared (NIR) survey facilities of\nVISTA and WFCAM and the opportunities for detailed followup provided\nby membership of ESO. Significant advances in astronomy have always\nrelied heavily on surveys of the sky from radio, through optical to\nX-ray wavelengths and the new era of deep NIR surveys is the latest\nstage in this progression. It is also one where the UK has both a\nsubstantial lead and the requisite expertise in the Cambridge Astronomical\nSurvey Unit (CASU) to exploit this advance in wide field astronomy\nthrough delivery of expertly processed and calibrated science data\nproducts. Recognising the benefits of this, ESO are now also heavily\ncommitted to public imaging surveys through the VST and VISTA telescopes and\nlarge scale public spectroscopic surveys, such as Gaia-ESO, with 300 allocated\nnights on the VLT over the next 5 years.\n\nMembers of CASU have played a leading role in survey astronomy, not only \nby pioneering techniques to optimally extract knowledge from survey data, \nbut also by taking a proactive role in exploiting this information to \nproduce world-leading research. This synergy and feedback between data \nprocessing and exploitation has been crucial. \n\nIn the modern era wide-field digital survey cameras produce enormous volumes\nof data that are way beyond the resource capacity and analysis skills\nof non-specialist astronomers. Systematic pipeline processing, calibration \nand legacy curation of observational data are a fundamental requirement of\nan end-to-end integrated observing strategy and a crucial component of\na global Virtual Observatory. The Vista Data Flow System (VDFS) was \ndeveloped to allow an optimal ergonomic solution to this avalanche of data, \nthrough access to multi-Tbyte data storage systems, expert pipeline \nprocessing systems and science user support. Continuing development of the \nCASU processing and analysis pipelines will not only benefit the UK astronomy \ncommunity now, but will also be relevant in the era of Extremely Large \nTelescopes and the radio Square Kilometer Array, by developing the \ninfrastructure and skills to analyse the data from these facilities. \n\n\nThis standard grant proposal builds on the tremendous advances already\nmade and requests funding for CASU for the period 2012-2015 for the\nfollowing activities: continued operation and maintenance of the WFCAM\ndata processing and calibration pipeline; advanced development,\nenhancement, and operation of the UK VISTA pipelines; maintenance and\nupgrades for the VDFS ESO pipeline deliverables; operational support\nand pipeline processing for the UK-led VST public surveys in the\nsouthern hemisphere and the equivalent precursor surveys in the\nnorthern hemisphere; and support for the design, development and operation of \nspectroscopic processing pipelines for the Gaia ESO public survey and future\nproposed spectroscopic survey instruments such as WEAVE and 4MOST","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J00541X/1","grantId":"ST/J00541X/1","fundValue":"1900730","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The primary objective of the CASU programme is to provide cost-effective and timely delivery of key science data and service products\nfrom the ESO VISTA and VST telescopes and a range of other high value UK optical and near-infrared missions including WFCAM, the ESO Gaia Large Survey Programme.\n\nThe science product outputs from these missions are used by a large part of the astronomical community both nationally and internationally and form the underpinning observational data for a large range of key programmes.

This involved the further development and operational execution of advanced processing modules, and also updates to and maintenance of pipeline software, modules and documentation for delivery to ESO as part of an in-kind software contribution. The full calibrated world-class data products delivered by these processing pipelines are a crucial step for full science exploitation of the acquired data. Fully calibrated and optimally processed data are crucial ingredients for full science exploitation of observational data. The outputs from the CASU processing pipelines are world-class and provide the necessary inputs for a broad range of the subsequent astronomical research that is initiated by having these products available. These data products are used throughout the UK, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nThe infrastructure required for optimal exploitation of astronomical survey data has lead to many innovative solutions to data processing and analysis problems which have wide applicability across all image processing domains. As an example, we have been carrying out a collaborative medical imaging research project helping develop analysis tools applicable to Tissue Micro Arrays used for research into cancer diagnostic markers.
