It focusses on two core themes:\na) the relationship of Arabic logic with language and grammar (under this heading comes the research project of the Principal Investigator Schock: Referent, thing, concept: the appropriation of Aristotle's 'what-[it]-is' (ti esti) in Arabic logic, dialectical theology and grammar);\nb) the development of Arabic logic and philosophy of language after Avicenna (d. 1037) (under this heading comes the translation and research project of the Co-Investigator Street: Thirteenth-century Arabic Logic).\nThree young researchers shall be involved in the cooperation. They shall work in two fields of research:\na.) Logical structures in usul al-fiqh und u&szlig;ul an-nahw,\nb.) Issues of logic and syllogistic after Avicenna.\nBesides the particular publications of the research results of all researchers involved in the project a joint publication Major issues and controversies of Arabic logic and philosophy of language is intended. This publication shall condense the particular research results and present them coherently and systematically.\nAnnual workshops will be held to exchange the research results and to discuss interfaces and interdependencies between the two core themes of the project","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I50060X/1","grantId":"AH/I50060X/1","fundValue":"51494","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have not yet been used. There is however an incipient Impact Case arising from the use being made of research produced under the grant (and under its preceding sister grant, 19484/1) in a project to provide Muslim theologians with introductory accounts of logic in the Arabic tradition. This will ultimately go up on a site, due up in the near future, under www.kalamresearch.com.

This means we can read texts that are central even today to Muslim education with much greater accuracy. Since the major objective of the grant was to fund a series of workshops, I include in this summary of key findings the workshops held and the papers delivered.
