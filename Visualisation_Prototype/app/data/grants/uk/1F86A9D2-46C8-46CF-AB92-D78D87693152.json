XMM-Newton is the European X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) telescope, named in memory of Issac Newton, and is dedicated to investigating the many astronomical objects that emit X-rays. X-rays are a form of light that originate from wherever gas is heated to millions of degrees centigrade, or where strong magnetic fields exist. To mention just a few examples, XMM-Newton observes: * Gas falling into Black-holes * Stars with powerful magnetic fields * Aurora around planets * Compact objects, like neutron stars and white dwarfs * Glowing nebula left behind by dying stars XMM-Newton is the most sensitive X-ray telescope ever built, collecting more X-rays than any other previous X-ray observatory. The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most cosmic X-rays, so space-based instruments such as those on-board XMM are required to study these sources. The telescope itself was launched from Kourou in French Guiana on an Ariane 504 rocket on Friday December 10, 1999. The orbit is highly eccentric, orbiting from just 7,000 km above the Earth to a third of the distance to the Moon! This allows XMM-Newton to observe the Universe for 42 hours each orbit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G008647/1","grantId":"ST/G008647/1","fundValue":"713822","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The EPIC instruments are used by many hundreds of scientists in their study of the high energy Universe.

The directly funded research element of this grant had the objective of better understanding the in-orbit characteristics of the instrument and its cross-calibration with similar instruments on other X-ray observatories.
