{"id":"7FCED639-4B02-466E-8475-FA0E622AFDBD","title":"The expansion and contraction of Gaelic in medieval Scotland: the onomastic evidence","abstractText":"The project investigates the evidence of names, primarily place-names, for Gaelic in medieval Scotland, focusing on areas of eastern and southern Scotland, between the high and low tide-marks of Gaelic's medieval expansion and contraction. It does this through the comprehensive analysis of the place-names of a region, Fife, where Gaelic ceased to be the dominant language in the 13th century. The methodology employed there will then be used to produce a comparative examination of the whole study-zone with regard to social context, regional variation and linguistic contacts in a remote and text-poor period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119267/1","grantId":"119267/1","fundValue":"364463","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our research has been used by local history groups, people interested in tourism and heritage, as the underpinning for various walks, brochures, displays and the like. \n\nThe approaches used, as well as some of the research itself, have been used by the body responsible for official Gaelic place-names on road-signs and elsewhere, Ainmean Aite na h-Alba. Heritage Landscape partnerships, e.g. on Bute, have employed this research (and our ex-researchers) to engage in community projects around place-names.\n\nEducationScotland has, with our help, designed learning resources for schools P1-S6, based around place-names.

In particular, a more fine-grained analysis of the loss of Gaelic, and the mechanisms behind that, in Fife was achieved; but also the considerable diversity in the fortunes of Gaelic in other places. \n\nSome real light was shed in a number of subsidiary papers and articles on Gaelic in south-west Scotland, a little understood part of Scotland in the early and central middle ages. Our work is seen as having laid both groundwork and ground-rules (protocols of presentation, for instance) for further surveys of Scottish place-names, esp. further county studies, and this in fact is now being done. \n\nLocal communities are able to incorporate a great deal of local linguistic and historical material from the Fife volumes into their heritage material.\n\nWe have started to work with schools to enable teachers to use the linguistic and historical resources that are embedded in place-names. \n\nOn the academic side, there are some paradigms of approach to Gaelic place-names and place-name types that need to be revisited in detail on a Scotland-wide scale. \n\nA pressing need is the development of an online resource which would enable wider dissemination of the resources than has been practical to date. There is currently some action on this front. Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
