All evidence relating to the specific outputs through which this impact was achieved, such as media articles, presentations, or publications, is provided in the relevant sections of Researchfish.\n\nFirst, we developed a series of 7 Masterclasses on Strategic Thinking for the Global Reinsurance Industry, each of which addresses a key topic of competitive change for the industry, developing specific models, frameworks and case material that managers can apply to their own context. These Masterclasses focus on the needs of the three main stakeholders in the industry, the buyers (insurance companies), the suppliers of capital (reinsurance companies) and the intermediaries that enable capital flow (the broking companies). \n\nSecond, we both emailed these Masterclasses to our distribution list of 800 reinsurance industry participants and also made them available on a dedicated website, where they can be downloaded for free. This website has been enormously successful with over 20,000 views of our material as of October 2014. \n\nThird, we ran a dedicated workshop for a cohort of middle managers targeted for leadership within their companies, attracting participants from leading buyers, suppliers and broking companies. This workshop ran over six sessions in May and October 2013, training these key professionals in the use of our Masterclasses and their frameworks, so enabling them to use our material in their own workplaces, and with their colleagues, as well as giving participants the opportunity to understand the industry from each other's different perspectives. As one of the participants noted, requesting electronic versions of the material to disseminate to her colleagues: &quot;I have really enjoyed your classes and the material you have written is excellent and very insightful&quot;.\n\nFourth, our results, our engagement with industry and the subsequent development of these Masterclasses generated their own momentum, leading to 16 media articles about the findings from our research in the trade and mainstream media from the start of the grant in September 2012 to October 2014.\n\nFifth, based on the interest generated by our research, we ran a senior executive ThinkTank session at Cass Business School in October 2013 bringing together a group of CEOs and Chairmen from the insurance, reinsurance and broking industry, as well as from the regulatory authority, in order to brainstorm about future avenues for this industry as it is undergoing enormous change. Based on this workshop, we provided a confidential report to the participants entitled Reinsurance 2020.\n\nSixth, we were invited to give five industry conference presentations on the back of our research, which were delivered in Continental Europe, London, Bermuda and the USA. The audiences for these conference presentations were diverse, ranging from some of the largest insurers and reinsurers in the world to small cooperatives and mutuals, illustrating the scope of our findings. \n\nSeventh, the results and Masterclasses were taken up and used by specific organizations in a number of ways from hosting the material on their own corporate intranets and sending the material to their clients through links in their corporate newsletters, to specific and targeted application in their within-firm strategies. For example, leading reinsurer SCOR used the results in their strategic planning documents in September 2013, while leading companies followed some of our predicted trends and suggestions, as evidenced by Allianz Re's CEO Amer Ahmed's recent citing of one of our report's findings on consolidation and centralization, stating, &quot;Allianz, among other global insurance companies, has done just that by consolidating and centralizing its reinsurance buying&quot; (Global Insurance Intelligence, 8/09/2014).\n\nEighth, the work was picked up and endorsed more widely in the industry. For example, it featured on industry websites such as Insurance Works, a Canadian insurance platform, and was included in the online resources as well as the libraries of educational bodies, such as the Insurance Institute of London, which provides accreditation and ongoing professional development for their membership of over 15,000 insurance industry professionals. At the same time, leading industry figures endorsed the results, particularly those on the potential for systemic risk, using them as a caution and call-to-arms for the industry, as evidenced by this press statement by the CEO of Hiscox Group, Bronek Masojada: &quot;We've seen in the banking sector what happens when traders become too detached from the risk they take on. This report sends out a clear message to the reinsurance sector that we cannot allow the increasing bundling of risk and dependence on models to cloud the picture when it comes to evaluating the real risk being underwritten&quot; (Insurance newsnet, 20/09/2012).\n\nNinth, we ensured our work would have impact outside the specific insurance and reinsurance industry by publishing a practitioner article that is accessible to the wider finance industry in the Journal of Financial Perspectives. This article was so well received that we were contacted by the editor with a request to translate it into Chinese, as follows: &quot;We have had a request to translate your paper into Chinese, due to the demand from executives for your paper. Can I ask whether we can be permitted to do so?&quot;\n\nTenth, as the frameworks and models we developed were applicable to other industries, we incorporated them into our teaching of strategic management at our respective universities. We now use specific aspects of these Masterclasses at undergraduate, MBA and Executive education level. For example, Masterclass 7 offered a means to address the changing landscape through scenario planning. In particular, we identified key areas of uncertainty in the reinsurance industry, teased out possible implications and provided managers with a step-by-step guide on how to build scenarios, stress-test strategies and plan for the future. This framework has now been incorporated into Aston's MBA programme and used to help students develop knowledge about reinsurance industry and, more broadly, teach them how to effectively build scenarios and deal with uncertain industry contexts.\n\nEleventh, the substantive impact of the programme of research is further evidenced in its award of the inaugural ESRC Outstanding Impact on Business Prize 2013.

However, as a mature market, it faces new challenges arising from technological advances, growing competition, increasing consolidation and growing demand from emerging markets. This project set out to co-produce and implement a knowledge exchange programme to support UK insurers, reinsurers and brokers in responding to these global challenges and opportunities. Leveraging an extensive global reinsurance dataset, our project examined critical trends in the industry and used them to build evidence-based frameworks that these stakeholders can use to diagnose their current strategic positions, consider specific types of differentiation, and build competitive advantage.\n\nWe developed a series of seven Masterclasses that UK incumbents can use to respond to competitive challenges by, for instance, generating co-operative strategies (Masterclasses 1). We also illustrated how greater competitive rivalry is pushing reinsurers towards new strategic positions, creating five distinct strategic groups in the global reinsurance industry (Masterclass 3). Such insights enable UK reinsurers, and other industry players, to analyse their strategic positions vis-?-vis competitor groups and improve their competitiveness by, for instance, moving towards more lucrative strategic positions. \n\nSome research outputs focussed specifically on reinsurers. For example, we identified three critical capabilities that reinsurers must develop in order to coordinate more diverse streams of knowledge (Masterclass 4). The frameworks we developed explain specifically how capabilities can be combined to underpin strategies and build operational excellence. We also developed frameworks to help UK reinsurers manage an increasingly diverse client base, so that valuable time and resources invested in client relationship management support the business strategy; either directly, in the form of profitable business deals, or indirectly, in the form of access to information (Masterclass 5).\n\nWe also generated new knowledge about the primary insurance market. In particular, we showed the implications of increasing insurance industry consolidation and maturity upon changing buying patterns and the development of a new class of reinsurance products (Masterclass 2). Using these insights, we specified those steps reinsurers must take in order to continue attracting insurers' premium. \n\nWe also generated important insights for brokerage firms. For example, we show how consolidation and changing competitive dynamics are eroding the traditional source of broker revenue; their placement service (Masterclass 6). Our evidence-based framework reveals how UK brokers can respond to the new global landscape by, for example, consolidating with buyers, adopting fee-for-service models or developing collaborations with new market players.\n\nFinally, we offered all industry participants a means to address the changing landscape through scenario planning (Masterclass 7). In particular, we identified key areas of uncertainty in the reinsurance industry, teased out possible implications and provided managers with a step-by-step guide on how to build scenarios, stress-test strategies and plan for the future.\n\nWhile our primary focus was on co-producing practical outputs with partners, the project also generated new academic insights. For example, an academic paper explaining how practitioners balance community and market logics is accepted at the leading Academy of Management Journal, another paper is accepted at British Journal of Management and we also have two other academic papers under review on various aspects of risk trading. Lloyd's of London plays a critical role in enabling society to alleviate risk, poverty and hardship following disasters and adverse events. Economically, the UK reinsurance industry generates thousands of jobs and is widely acknowledged to be of great importance to the UK economy. The evidence-based frameworks we have developed are already assisting UK insurers, reinsurers and brokers in asserting their position in a changing competitive and regulatory landscape. They offer (re)insurance and broking companies a key capacity-building resource they can use to evaluate current structures and processes, build awareness, develop new competencies and strengthen competitive positions. For example, reinsurers can evaluate their capacity for analysis, their ability to underwrite different lines of business, and their approach to managing client relationships in order to position themselves vis-?-vis global peers. Likewise, primary insurers can evaluate their capital efficiency, their coordination of reinsurance buying and their product bundling strategies to position themselves among global peers. Finally, brokerage firms can use the frameworks to match their knowledge bases and technical skills to the demands of the UK reinsurance market .\n\nIn addition to helping UK firms, the knowledge outputs can also be used by in-house training programmes, business schools and professional bodies to develop future generations of reinsurance professionals. We anticipate, for example, that our outputs will be used for teaching MBA and MSc students, giving them insight into the financial reinsurance industry. Indeed, some of our early materials are already required reading on some University Courses (see http://www.wlu.ca/documents/56739/429_W13.pdf).\n\nThe project was designed to promote knowledge exchange with the UK reinsurance industry. We have been very proactive in ensuring that our findings obtain maximum impact. For example, our Masterclasses were designed to be used independently by stakeholders for internal professional development and/or teaching purposes. This included, for example, incorporating study questions, bibliographies, exercises, and diagnostic tools.\nWe have actively demonstrated the value of these outputs at two x 3-day professional workshops in May and October 2013, which targeted senior middle managers; the people most responsible for enacting change in their firms. We have also distributed outputs widely, sending them to a distribution list of over 800 practitioners and making them available with professional societies like the Insurance Institute of London and the Worshipful Company of Insurers. Finally, we have developed a dedicated online resource to perpetuate knowledge exchange by making material continuously and freely available: http://www.cassknowledge.com/research/author/paula-jarzabkowski\n\nTo ensure maximum potential impact we have, and will continue, to monitor take-up, record usage rates and engage in adhoc developmental work. We know, for example, our collective outputs have been viewed over 20,000 times since May 2013 and a healthily bounce rate demonstrates that visitors have found the Masterclasses interesting and have continued to look further into the site. The Masterclass series has also been reported in the insurance media: http://www.bermudareinsurancemagazine.com/news/bundled-risk-and-convergence-capital-changing-market and our outputs are also available on the corporate intranets of many major firms. \n\nWe will continue to promote the materials over the coming year in both professional and educational institutions. We will raise the profile of the research in academic circles by presenting work at international conferences and furthering academic papers that are under review. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
