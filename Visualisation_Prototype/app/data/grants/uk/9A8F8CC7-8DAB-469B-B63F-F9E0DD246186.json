{"id":"9A8F8CC7-8DAB-469B-B63F-F9E0DD246186","title":"Enhanced Memory Ability: Insights from Synaesthesia","abstractText":"<p>In this research programme we will investigate enhanced memory in synaesthesia (e.g. experiencing colours for words). Our general approach is to treat synaesthesia as a 'test case' to address other important research questions.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we consider how synaesthesia can inform general theories of memory. Importantly, not all aspects of memory are enhanced in synaesthesia and this can provide insights into how the memory system is structured. Indeed it is not trivially the case that material that elicits 'extra' sensations are better remembered: some material that does not evoke extra sensations (such as abstract figures) are also better remembered by synaesthetes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We suggest that synaesthetes have widespread changes in their perceptual systems (including but not limited to their extra experiences) and that systems supporting perception can also be engaged in memory. We will use both standard and bespoke tests of memory to explore which aspects of memory are enhanced and we will explore how individual differences in perception (in non-synaesthetes) may relate to performance on certain memory tasks.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006215/1","grantId":"ES/K006215/1","fundValue":"319466","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Ward","coPersons":["Julia  Simner"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
