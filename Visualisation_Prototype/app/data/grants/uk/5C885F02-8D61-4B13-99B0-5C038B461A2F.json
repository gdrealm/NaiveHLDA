{"id":"5C885F02-8D61-4B13-99B0-5C038B461A2F","title":"Optimum Tax Compliance Costs and Tax Simplification","abstractText":"<p>It is not difficult to demonstrate that the costs of complying with tax systems are often high or that tax systems are complex. However the purposes of tax systems and the environment in which they have to be administered often necessarily involve high compliance costs and that at least some tax provisions will be very complex. The issue is to balance reform in these areas with other important considerations. The aim of this project is therefore to identify the main factors that should be considered in developing a strategy regarding compliance and tax simplification taking account of the needs of taxpayers and tax systems more generally. Such an approach should, for example, improve understanding of how to improve tax compliance without resorting to methods that might be seen as heavy handed and punitive. An excessive reliance on such methods might reduce the willingness of taxpayers to comply voluntarily and undermine other government policies such as promoting economic enterprise in general and small businesses in particular. The project will be based mainly on an analysis of the contribution of existing research together with the views of tax agencies and tax advisers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1595","grantId":"RES-000-23-1595","fundValue":"93408","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  James","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
