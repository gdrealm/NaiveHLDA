{"id":"D43EBC52-A6F6-4280-B91D-AE0D084564D6","title":"Mapping the cultural authority of science across Europe and India","abstractText":"<p>Modern societies seek their understanding of pressing issues in public debate, conferences, opinion polling, scoping exercises, everyday conversations and mass media attention where the sciences are granted variable cultural authority. The cultural authority of science cannot be taken for granted, it is as much a factor of economic performance as it is a historical achievement.</p>\n\n<p>This Indo-European network will build infra-structure and create a system of science culture indicators based on news analysis and on attitude measures and compare the cultural presence of science in the public debate. Trends in science news (1990-2010; intensity, positioning, issues) are linked to trends in public attitudes to science (interest, attitude, knowledge, engagement: using Eurobarometer and NCAER national surveys, 1989-2010). The network of researchers from UK, Germany and India will mobilise and develop expertise in discourse analysis, computer-assisted text analysis, large scale survey research, sophisticated statistical techniques, and qualitative case study work to track the cultural authority of science comparatively. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005820/1","grantId":"ES/K005820/1","fundValue":"108988","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin William Bauer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
