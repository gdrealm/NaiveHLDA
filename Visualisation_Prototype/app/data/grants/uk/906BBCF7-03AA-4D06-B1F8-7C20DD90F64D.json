{"id":"906BBCF7-03AA-4D06-B1F8-7C20DD90F64D","title":"Quantum-Degenerate Gases for Precision Measurements (QuDeGPM)","abstractText":"Atom interference has been applied in many pioneering experiments ranging from fundamental studies to precision measurements. The techniques of laser cooling and trapping have allowed the realization of bright sources of macroscopic matter waves. This project is part of a EUROCORES Collaborative Research Project (within the EuroQUASAR programme coordinated by ESF) whose goal is to build upon this expertise and use interference of quantum degenerate macroscopic matter waves for a new generation of precision measurements. Two sets of applications are envisioned: (1) Precision determination of fundamental constants and inertial forces in free space, and (2) Interferometers for trapped atoms close to the surface as a microscope for highly sensitive measurements of surface forces on the micron length scale. To achieve the ultimate sensitivity we will engineer the interactions between the atoms and create non-classical matter-wave quantum states to beat the standard quantum measurement limit. Ultracold degenerate quantum gases with their inherent coherence and narrow spread in space and momentum promise to be the ideal starting point for precision matter wave interference experiments, similar to lasers for light optics. In contrast to light, atoms interact with each other, and the physics of degenerate quantum gases is in many cases dominated by these interactions. This can be an advantage, allowing tricks from non-linear optics like squeezing to boost sensitivity, and a disadvantage, resulting in additional dephasing due to uncontrolled collisional phase shifts. We will exploit recent advances in controlling these interactions by Feshbach resonances to pick out the advantages and to suppress the disadvantages caused by the interactions. Much of the planned work will be very fundamental and exploratory as many of the capabilities together with possible limitations have yet to be investigated.The collaborative research project entitled Quantum-Degenerate Gases for Precision Measurement (QuDeGPM) focuses European efforts on precision measurements with quantum degenerate gases and in particular with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). The project is organized along the main objectives of (i) performing precision atom interferometry with quantum degenerate gases, (ii) using quantum degenerate gases for precision surface probing, and (iii) exploring, realizing, and testing novel measurement schemes with non-classical matter wave states. The project in Durham focuses on the use of matter-waves with tunable interactions to probe atom surface interactions. Specifically two experimental thrusts are planned. The first uses bright matter-wave solitons as the basis for a new form of matter-wave interferometry. This work connects to an existing project which began in January 2008 (EPRSC grant EP/F002068/1). The second thrust exploits condensates where the interactions are tuned to zero to study long-lived Bloch oscillations in a 1D lattice in the vicinity of a solid surface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026602/1","grantId":"EP/G026602/1","fundValue":"175404","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  During the course of this work we developed several new techniques to manipulate ultracold atoms.

The project in Durham focused on the use of matter-waves with tunable interactions to probe atom surface interactions. Specifically two experimental thrusts were pursued. The first realized the first caesium condensate in the UK (and only the third in the world) and demonstrated the control of atomic interactions in the vicinity of a broad Feshbach resonance, essential to many of the planned precision measurement applications of Bose-Einstein condensates. By changing the atomic interactions from repulsive to attractive, we were able to induce the collapse of the condensate, the pre-cursor to the formation of bright matter-wave solitons. The study of such solitons is continuing with a view to utilizing them in a new form of matter-wave interferometry that exploits the inherent lack of dispersion of solitons. We have also precisely identified the magnetic field where the atomic interactions are tuned to zero and plan to study long-lived Bloch oscillations in a 1D lattice in this regime. The second thrust focused on the development of an apparatus for the control and manipulation of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the vicinity of a room temperature surface. Here we have succeeded in producing rubidium condensates near to the super-polished surface of a Dove prism and have developed a simple technique for the controlled transport of ultracold atoms up to the surface. We have also implemented optical lattices in this experiment to provide further control over the localization of the atomic gas. The challenge for the future is to combine these two experimental thrusts to give access to condensates with tunable interactions near to the surface with a view to making precision measurements of the atom surface potential. The research project will also contribute to the academic, industrial and commercial sectors of the UK economy by providing highly skilled personnel with expertise in ultra-stable laser techniques, photonics, vacuum technology, control instrumentation and computer interfacing and analysis software. Specifically, the proposed research will deliver the further professional development of a postdoctoral research-assistant. The primary beneficiaries are researchers in the fields of ultracold and quantum degenerate gases and precision measurement. In the short term, the direct beneficiaries will be other experimental groups working in the field. Specifically, the experimental groups directly involved in this collaborative research project are those of Hanns-Christoph Nagerl (Innsbruck), Giovanni Modugno (CNR-INFM, Florence), Claus Zimmermann (Tubingen), Phillipe Bouyer (Institut d'Optique, Palaiseau) and Jorg Schmiedmayer (Vienna). In the medium term our results will benefit theoretical developments in the field, including the groups of Luis Santos (Hannover) and Jacob Dunningham (Leeds) which are involved in this collaboration. The development of new techniques for precision measurement and for the control of ultracold atomic systems in the vicinity of surfaces will, in the longer term, benefit the wider physics community through improved measurements of fundamental interactions, such as that between an atom and a surface.
