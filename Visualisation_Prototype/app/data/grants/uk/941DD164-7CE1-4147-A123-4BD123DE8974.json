The additional qualitative data collection with police officers, case reconstructions, charity workers and families have revealed important learning points which have been taken up enthusiastically by these groups.\n\nOur impact has been pronounced in policing communities where we have engaged in substantial knowledge exchange in police training fora (across the UK, EU and US), and substantiated this engagement via new investment in educational input to on-line police training modules in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe team produced a key report and a resource that is being used by police officers across the UK.\n\nPolicing knowledge exchange I: real-time delivery\n\nThe research team have presented at 11 major national UK police KE events since 2010 including to the Society of Evidence Based Policing and UK and EU FBI, and attendance has ranged from 10 to 200 police officers across the events. The research has helped create new EU KE networks amongst researchers of missing people and police via a project event in Brussels, May 2013 (30 attendees from 5 countries). The team have delivered a KE workshop in Washington, US in April, 2013 as part of an International Police and Justice Evidence Based Network and 200 attended this event (supported by the Scottish Government), as part of a new KE network with the Centre for Evidence-Based Crime Policy in George Mason University, Washington. The research findings were also launched at the first International Missing Persons Conference in 2013 via a keynote speech and official launch of the public resource 'Missing People: Missing Voices' (with a co-sponsored reception by the ESRC funding).\n\nHighlights of these face to face impacts include a 'scenario' based case study resource workshop being delivered in July 2013 to 30 specialist POLSAR officers in training at the Police National Search Centre, Bramshill, Hampshire. The police evaluation of the use of this workshop was excellent.\n\nPolice knowledge exchange II: securing educational and training legacies\n\nSince 2014 - a new Glasgow University (GU) Knowledge exchange investment (approx. &pound;30K) facilitated the PI and the Research Fellow to produce new impact - and the extension of the ESRC facilitated this research (with GU paying for staffing).\n\nWe have contributed to the re-shaping of several on-line education and training modules offered by the UK National Police College. This work took place between January and June 2014. We are now waiting for the police college to make the changes.\n\nWe have contributed to the Police National Search Centre (PNSC) CPD events (reaching 300 officers in 2014) and leaving a legacy of materials delivered 3 times a year, and to 90 specialist search officers annually. This produces regular evaluations from the PNSC.\n\nMore details are outlined in the engagement section of the research record.\n\nCharity sector impacts:\n\nMissing People Charity, support and public education: The GU team have delivered several workshops to the charity and co-funded the first ever family conference with the charity. 60 families of missing people came together for the first time to listen to research stories and discuss their common experiences. The GU team produced a key report on family interviews and the findings were used by the charity to help an application for funding to the Big Lottery - and this was successful. PI Hester Parr now serves on the advisory board for a new support service in Wales: 'Missing People Aftercare' that was launched with this funding.\n\nPublic impacts and engagement\n\nThe project has a well visited website www.geographiesofmissingpeople.org.uk (39,469 total page views - large for a single project) and all research resources are publicly accessible and have been advertised by postcard in public places.\n\nThe PI and GU research fellow have now used 45 returned missing people's narratives to form 10 'stories of missing experience': 'Missing People: Missing Voice's' is an audio/text resource (read by actors) and provide a public awareness function for those interested in the experience of missing people.\n\nChannel 4 screened a documentary, produced by RAW TV, who has liaised with the project team for a year for advice, contacts and guidance. 'The Missing' was screened in April, 2104 and reached 2.4 million people on a variety of C4 platforms.\n\n'Missing People: Missing Voices' has been performed or played at a variety of public events, including the 2014 AHRC 'Being Human Festival'.\n\nPublic Awards: \n\nThe 'Geographies of Missing People' project has been awarded the 2013 Scottish Policing Award from the Scottish Government for 'Applied Policing Research'. This competitive award (from a shortlist of five selected national nominees) was handed to the team by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, on Monday 11th March, 2013.\n\nPolicy\n\nHester Parr and Penny Woolnough serve on the National Strategy Working Group on Missing Persons - led by the Scottish Government in partnership with Police Scotland in 2014. This will result in organisational and operational change in the future and will be be tangible in 2015.\n\nPolicing Practice:\n\nOur recommendations for good practice in relation to family liaison and return interviews with missing persons have been included with in Police Scotland's 2014 Standard Operating Procedure and influenced an aide memoir for officers dealing with missing persons. This impact reached around 14,000 officers in 2014.\n\nTestimonials of the impact of the research from key stakeholders\n\nUK national stakeholders:\n\n'Until now no research or study has been available to help explain why adults go missing and to explore their experiences. This research report has an immediate relevance and utility in evidence-based operational practice. From a policing perspective, translating the learning from this research study into evidence-based practice and then synthesising it with other practice will lead to huge improvements in safeguarding our most vulnerable people. This is a research study of true value and importance and it is a pleasure to welcome and commend this work'.\n\n Joe Apps, Manger of the UK Missing Persons Bureau, National Crime Agency\n\n 'I believe the work being done to really understand what happens when people go missing is crucial to improving the police response. Listening to a presentation on the findings so far made a huge impact on me and gave me a greater insight into the psyche of those who go missing, than anything I had experienced in the past 30 years. This work will provide a sound foundation for the future development of police tactics and indeed the way in which the public in general can better understand those who go missing' \n\nChief Constable Pat Geenty, Wiltshire Constabulary and UK Police Lead for Missing Persons\n\nThe Missing People charity:\n\n'Research is such a vital way to promote understanding and The Geographies of Missing People project has provided valuable insight into the experience of losing someone special, and living with this loss. I wholeheartedly welcome and commend this research. We are grateful to the families who took part in the research and for sharing something so personal for the benefit of others. This report, and its recommendations, will help all of us working with and supporting families of missing people by helping to ground us in the reality of how it feels to lose someone and not know where they are. I pledge that at Missing People we will hear the messages in this report from the families and work with its recommendations. We will embed these in our understanding, our practice, our communication and our development of services'. \n\nJo Youle Chief Executive Missing People Charity \n\n'The stories launched in this project allow us to hear, for the first time, the voices of people who have been missing in the past. [T]hese are stories that we have to hear, and we have to share. We must learn from them. And we owe this team out thanks for bringing us these stories, as we owe our thanks to those people who bravely shared with them their most personal stories.' \n\n'When making a case for support to funders we need to provide evidence of need, and we have previously found it difficult to find information about the experiences of missing people (particularly adults) and their families. The important work of the Geographies of Missing People project has filled this gap. The research has also been a valuable independent endorsement of our work, while providing evidence for needed services developments. Our Partnerships team also regularly use the findings in presentations and in meetings to illustrate the issue.'\nLucy Homes, Research Manager, Missing People Charity\n\n'I have seen this research have an impact on professionals' understanding of the mind-set and experiences of adults who are missing. I believe it has commenced a change in attitude towards adults whose behaviours while missing now have more limelight than previously. This research has created a framework through which police can discuss how adults behave and think'. \n\nMissing People's Head of Partnerships and Development \n\nPolice Scotland:\n\n'The main report of the Geographies of missing people has been particularly useful to Police Scotland as this provides an insight into the feelings, emotions, expectations and ultimately the journey of the missing person.\n\nThis research has allowed Police Scotland to view missing person investigations from a different perspective, and the recommendations provided will be introduced so to improve service delivery. These recommendations given by the research will be incorporated into policy guidance (SOP) and also operational guidance (training and aide memoire).\n\nThe significant changes which have come as a result of the study are those which have already been mentioned; the use of positive and reassuring language with the family, the sign posting towards support the need to conduct return interviews in the right circumstances and for officers to be mindful of their conduct during such interviews. \n\n It is recognised that making these changes should improve service delivery and will assist in gaining support from the family during the investigation and also from the missing person upon their return.'\n\nAndy MacKay, National Missing Person Strategic Co-ordinator, Police Scotland.

Significant findings include that people do not always know they are missing or what this means; that missing people stay local to points of departure; that return interviews and after-journey talking is critically important to this group and that they lack the opportunity to do so. These findings have been extensively reported to and used by police knowledge-exchange forums and in education and training modules. The research has made a difference to how key figures in UK national policing bodies and Police Scotland think about and act on missing persons enquiries.\n\nInterviews with 25 families of missing people have revealed new evidence of both good and poor police practice in the handling of missing persons cases and family liaison. This has been brought into focus in hard-hitting research reports which have resulted in the findings being included in new police guidance in introduced by Police Scotland in 2014. The Missing People charity has acted on the findings to apply (successfully) for Big Lottery Funding to provide a new aftercare service in Wales. We collaborated with the Missing People charity to bring together 60 families of missing people to hear the research results and share experiences with each other. The charity has committed to using the findings to inform their service development in the future.\n\n23 interviews with police officers and analysis of 12 police case files revealed that responding to reports of missing persons represents one of the biggest demands on the resources of police organisations. The research provided insights into the different stages of the investigative process and some of the key influences which shaped the trajectory of a missing person's investigation. In particular, it highlighted how officers understand and construct investigations, which are often shaped by a mix of police craft, ‘science’ and ‘reputational’ issues. These findings have contributed new knowledge to police research.\n\nThe interviews with returned missing people and family members have resulted in research findings that have been taken up into new national guidance for police officers in Scotland and have been included in updated training modules by the UK National Police College. 2 members of the research team now sit on a National policy working group in Scotland and are part of a team creating a new strategy for missing people, led by the Scottish Government.\n\nThe research was awarded a special category award in the 2013 Scottish Policing Awards for excellence in ‘Applied Policing Research’. The presentation was made Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, on Monday 11th March, 2013. Professional and charitable communities are using the research findings and creative-artistic products to improve education and training provision in the area of missing persons. We are actively shaping these contributions in new collaborative partnerships eg with the Police National Search Centre and the UK National Police College.\n\nThe stories of missing people are being used in public (via web and event dissemination) to raise awareness amongst the public about missing people and the experiences they have. \n\n2 members of the research sits on a National Strategy Working Group for Missing Persons, led by the Scottish Government and here we are pushing for further public education and awareness raising, based on our findings. Police Scotland has also changed its guidance to 14000 officers, based on our research findings.\n\nWe have contributed the production of a Channel 4 documentary on Missing People by providing expert guidance and background information. This documentary reached 2.4 million people in April 2014. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
