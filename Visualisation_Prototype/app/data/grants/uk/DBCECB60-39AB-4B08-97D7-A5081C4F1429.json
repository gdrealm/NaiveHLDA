Neurons contain a cell body (soma). There are many protrusions from the cell body. The vast majority of these are known as dendrites. Dendrites receive analogue signals (post-synaptic potentials) from other neurons and relay these to the cell body. The cell body processes and integrates these signals and passes them onto the axon, a specialized structure that emerges from the cell body. The primary role of the axon is to convert these analogue signals into digital, all or none signals, known as action potentials. Action potentials travel along axons and cause neurotransmitter release from these. The neurotransmitters in turn bind to proteins, receptors, located in dendrites and generate post-synaptic potentials. These are the fundamental cellular mechanisms that underlie many normal brain functions such as learning and memory (cognition). It is important to understand how these cellular mechanisms are regulated as dysfunction of these can lead to neuronal disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.\n\nIn addition to receptors, neurons contain specialized proteins, ion channels, which form pores in the membrane. These are permeable to particular ions such as potassium, sodium and calcium. Some open and close in response to small changes in voltage across the cell membrane and are known as voltage-gated ion channels. Others are activated by ligands (neurotransmitters) binding to them - ligand-gated ion channels. \n\nWe are interested in a particular type of voltage-gated ion channel, the Kv7 channel, which is permeable to potassium ions only and is located principally in axons. We have recently shown for the first time that in the hippocampus a key area of the brain involved in learning and memory, axonal Kv7 channels are open continuously at rest. Since potassium ions flow out of cells, these channels form a constant inhibitory current. This makes it more difficult for action potentials (which are large positive voltages or spikes) to be generated. This effect of Kv7 channels is likely to help a neuron maintain its normal activity. Indeed this might explain why mutations in Kv7 channels in humans lead to epilepsy.\n\nNew evidence suggests that axons can contact each other and that neurotransmitter receptors may also be present on axons. Our new data show that axons that release the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, are closely associated with hippocampal axons. Further, our data show that these hippocampal axons also express receptors for the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, glutamate. It is unknown though if acetylcholine and glutamate, by binding to their respective receptors, can activate signaling proteins within a neuron and lead to changes in the properties of axonal Kv7 channels. More importantly, we do not know how this might alter information processing within axons. In this study, we aim to investigate these problems by using state-of-the art methods such as making electrophysiological recordings of currents generated from Kv7 channels present in single hippocampal neurons and using specific reagents (some of which we have designed ourselves) to study the function of axonal Kv7 channels. \n\nSince a decline in Kv7 channel function results in loss of hippocampal-dependent learning, loss of cholinergic neurotransmission is associated with cognition related disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and since axon loss occurs during normal aging, it is important to understand the factors involved in axon information processing. This could ultimately lead to better therapies for disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, which are prominent in the elderly population and for which at present there are few treatments available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L000679/1","grantId":"BB/L000679/1","fundValue":"362121","fundStart":"2014-04-30","fundEnd":"2017-04-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work is still at an early stage but it is potentially very useful for the pharmaceutical industry.

They have a cell body (somata) and two main types of processes (axons and dendrites). Dendrites receive information from other neurons and process this information. This is then relayed to axons via the cell body. Axons will then generate signals (action potentials) that will cause the release of chemicals (neurotransmitters) from nerve endings (synaptic terminals). Understanding how axons process information that leads to release of neurotransmitters is important as axon damage and re-routing is a hallmark of many disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Huntington's disorder. \nWe have discovered that acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a fundamental role in cognition, can significantly alter axonal information processing in the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in learning and memory. This is the first time that this has been demonstrated. We have also made significant progress in understanding the cellular mechanisms by which acetylcholine does this. This may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive disorders. This is necessary as acetylcholinesterases, which prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine and are currently used for the treatment of mild Alzheimer's disorder, are not suitable for all patients. We have begun to understand the mechanisms by which acetylcholine enhances axonal processing. This is partly via inhibition of axonal KV7 channels. Since anticholinesterases are not very effective for the treatment of cognitive disorders, others may wish to explore the possibility of axonal KV7 channel inhibition for the treatment of cognitive disorders.
