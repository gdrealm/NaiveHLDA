{"id":"2E258278-BC4D-4414-BAB3-845EC5F6C36F","title":"Multistage Ejectors for Flare Gas Recovery","abstractText":"The project focuses on the development of a multistage ejector for use in flare gas recovery in the oil and gas industry.\nSignificant levels of flare gas is released in the extraction of oil and gas. This was equivalent of 140 billion metres cube in\n2011. The adoption of flare gas recovery units is dependent on a financial return as there is as yet no international\nconvention of flare gas emission currently enforecd. This project will explore the feasibility of using a two stage ejector\nbased system to compress the flare gas to a useful pressure rather than &quot;flaring&quot; it off. The current difficulties with this\nproposed system are: i) at elevated waste gas inlet pressure to the second stage ejector, currently at elevated suction\npressure the efficiency of the ejector is reduced significantly. ii) multistage ejector systems rely on phase separation\nbetween stages, Transvac currently does not possess the necessary information on optimal separation technology for this\napplication. If these issues could be overcome then the multistage system would represent a significant reduction in both\nthe cost of flare gas recovery system installation and operation, making the process more feasible for installation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508561/1","grantId":"EP/N508561/1","fundValue":"74861","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Buddhika Naleen Hewakandamby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
