For example, one can know that it rained yesterday because one experienced or saw the rain, because someone else told one, or because one is making an inference. English tends to use adverbs such as 'allegedly' or 'evidently' for conveying these meanings, but other languages make these distinctions within their grammatical system. Often, indicating one's source of information is obligatory in languages with such evidential systems. Evidentiality is closely related to epistemic modality, which is the linguistic marking of the speaker's degree of certainty regarding the truth of a statement they make. In English, this notion is coded grammatically through modal verbs such as 'must' or 'may' as well as by adverbs such as 'probably', 'possibly'. When looking at particular markers in a language it is often difficult to decide whether they mark evidentiality or modality, and there is therefore an ongoing debate about the relationship between these categories. Some researchers have argued that evidentiality is a subcategory of modality, but others, including myself, have argued that they are distinct. \\n\\nThe aim of the current project is to develop a formal analysis of evidentiality and modality in the Quechua language spoken in the region of Cusco, Peru, with two subgoals: (i) to make a strong case for the distinctness of the two notions and thereby enhance our understanding of both, (ii) to contribute to the development of a formal theory of evidentiality, which to date is still in its infancy. It also aims at providing a detailed description of epistemic modality in Quechua as this phenomenon has hardly been studied before in Quechua linguistics.\\n\\nIn Quechua, evidentiality and epistemic modality are expressed by clearly distinct sets of linguistic markers, which facilitates the development of a theory for each notion independently. It will be argued that Quechua modals are part of the asserted content of an utterance, whereas evidentials provide a comment on that content, which means that they belong to a different level of meaning, the so-called level of speech act meaning. This difference supports the claim that evidentiality and modality are distinct categories. The project will also study the interaction of evidential and modal markers when they occur together in a sentence. The framework in which the analysis will be cast, Segmented Discourse Representation Theory, makes a clear distinction between asserted content and the speaker's attitudes towards that content, and as such is the ideal formal tool for analysing these notions. Having a good grasp of the issues involved in a language like Quechua and having a worked-out theory for one language will greatly facilitate the development of a more comprehensive theory of evidentiality in the future capable of coping with evidential systems across languages. While the focus is on Quechua, data from other languages will be discussed for contrastive purposes where relevant. \\n\\nThe project will build on my previous work on evidentiality in Quechua, but goes substantially beyond this work by including epistemic modal markers and their interaction with evidentials, and by developing a formal analysis within SDRT. \\nNew data on epistemic modals will be collected during a fieldwork trip to the region of Cusco in the summer of 2006.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000711/1","grantId":"AH/E000711/1","fundValue":"21292","fundStart":"2007-01-27","fundEnd":"2007-05-26","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martina  Faller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
