{"id":"DA1018B7-A5E4-4343-97BC-9B31F8B58912","title":"MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity","abstractText":"The work of the MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity is aimed at obtaining a fuller understanding of how synapses work. Information is stored in our brains by alterations in the efficiency of communication at synapses and the MRC Centre is interested in understanding the molecular processes involved in this plasticity. Thus synaptic plasticity is critical for the correct wiring of the brain during development and enables learning and memory to occur throughout life. Pathological alterations in these mechanisms are likely to contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease. \n\nThe MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity is strongly committed to the public understanding of science. Indeed, its Director is a founder member of the European DANA alliance and is the Bristol Medical School liaison with @Bristol, a landmark millennium project devoted to improving the public understanding of science. MRC Centre scientists present public lectures, such as at the British Association, give talks in local schools and at open days, and communicate with the press on topical issues. The MRC Centre will continue to strongly support such activities. The MRC Centre also maintains a large website, a part of which it devoted to the public understanding of science. A major new initiative for the University of Bristol is the appointment to the Collier Chair for the Public Understanding of Science of Kathy Sykes. Professor Sykes will be closely associated with the MRC Centre and will devote 25% of her time to promoting its public activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9721540","grantId":"G9721540","fundValue":"2491510","fundStart":"1999-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Leon Collingridge","coPersons":["Eric  Thomas"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
