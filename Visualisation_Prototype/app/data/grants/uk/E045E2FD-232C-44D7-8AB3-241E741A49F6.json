CLEF is addressing these issues both technically and, more importantly, at the level of public policy and the direct engagement of public in discussions and workshops to work towards a wider consensus on the balance between the benefits to science and the risks to individual privacy.\n\nCLEF is based on a person-based approach to research and care. The underlying technologies are specifically designed to be capable of being redeployed to make increased information on their health and course of treatment available provided the ethical barriers can be overcome. Future research will focus on exploiting this potential to support truly patient centred healthcare.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300607","grantId":"G0300607","fundValue":"2555510","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Rector","coPersons":["David  Ingram","Carole  Goble","James  Mackay","Iain Edward Buchan","Robert  Gaizauskas","Jo  Milan","Mark  Hepple","Mark James Elliot","Dipak  Kalra","Ning  Zhang","Donia  Scott","Martina Angela  Sasse"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
