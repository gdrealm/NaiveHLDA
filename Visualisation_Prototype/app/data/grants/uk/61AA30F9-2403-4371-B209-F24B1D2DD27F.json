{"id":"61AA30F9-2403-4371-B209-F24B1D2DD27F","title":"The geometry of groups and homomorphisms","abstractText":"This project is about using geometry to understand relationships between groups. A 'group' is the technical mathematical term for a collection of symmetries, and relationships between groups are the 'homomorphisms' of the project title. We will try to understand fundamental, unanswered questions like:\n\n - 'When can we embed one group of symmetries in another?';\n - 'What do the finite groups that a group relates to tell us about it?';\nand\n - 'Can we classify all the relationships between a group and 3-dimensional spaces?'\n\nAnswers to these questions will deepen our understanding of the abstract geometric spaces on which these groups of symmetries act. Although these questions come from within pure mathematics, the tools that we will develop to answer them can also potentially be applied to abstract spaces that arise in other, more applicable, disciplines, such as biology or data analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L026481/1","grantId":"EP/L026481/1","fundValue":"284364","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henry John Wilton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
