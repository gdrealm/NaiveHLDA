{"id":"962FBBE6-D169-432F-A839-B9A3F1666B23","title":"The cultural history of psychoanalysis in the twentieth century","abstractText":"Psychoanalysis had a remarkable influence on the history of the twentieth century, from the development of the human sciences and medicine via the growth of psychotherapy and related professions to the arts, cinema and literature. Its implantation and development was crucially affected by politics (Nazis and Communists) and the internal growth of the 'psychoanalytic movement' itself. There have been major histories of psychoanalysis in individual countries, but there has been no overview of a global cultural history of psychoanalysis. This study will lead to the completion of such a study, in a book to be entitiled 'The Freudian Century.'","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112905/1","grantId":"112905/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Forrester","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
