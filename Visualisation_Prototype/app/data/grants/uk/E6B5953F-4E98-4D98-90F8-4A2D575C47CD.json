The AAT uses single borehole tracer tests to provide site. specific data on aquifer properties for the engineering design of in situ groundwater remediation. The commercial potential arises from the reduced costs and high data quality achieved with this technique compared to existing site investigation methods. industry research partners have identified further testing is required to gain the necessary confidence for commercial exploitation.The AAT will be tested at different sites representing the intended market, comparing its commercial performance (data quality and cost) against traditional SI methods. Benchmarking will also be carried out by comparing AAT results against historical SI data at the test sites. Existing software for test interpretation will be enhanced to improve usability for practitioners. Business Development Workshops will evaluate these outputs identify marketing strategies and develop a detailed business plan for commercialization, potentially at an international scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502962/1","grantId":"EP/E502962/1","fundValue":"89596","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2007-10-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ryan  Wilson","coPersons":["Steven  Thornton","Steve  Banwart","David Nicholas Lerner"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
