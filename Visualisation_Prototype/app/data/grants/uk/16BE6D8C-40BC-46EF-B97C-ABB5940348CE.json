Many of the open questions in this field are related to the structure and physics of the innermost regions of protoplanetary disks, where material is transported onto the forming star, ejected in powerful jets &amp; outflows, or accreted onto newly-formed planets. However, most of the aforementioned processes take place on astronomical unit-scales very close to the star, which has prevented a direct investigation with imaging observations so far. The aim of this project is to employ the new opportunities provided by infrared and sub-millimeter interferometry in order to explore the terrestrial planet-forming zone in protoplanetary disks for the first time with direct imaging. The obtained images will reveal the fundamental inner disk structure and allow us to search for planet-related disk surface structures, such as tidally cleared gaps or the hot accretion region around young, embedded protoplanets. Combining interferometric observations at infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths will allow us to determine the temperature &amp; density distribution and dust composition in the inner disk. This approach will result in an unprecedented global view on the structure and physical processes in protoplanetary disks and help us to understand how planets are forming and how they interact with the disk material during their early evolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K003445/1","grantId":"ST/K003445/1","fundValue":"222578","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Kraus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
