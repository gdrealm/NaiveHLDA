{"id":"EAE7876C-6875-431B-89C5-BC471BA7BBFA","title":"Linear Observations and Computational Effects","abstractText":"Computational effects is a collective term for imperative aspects of computation, such as modifying state, raising exceptions, jumping, input/output, nondeterminism, etc., which together comprise a program's behaviour during execution. Typically, each occurrence of an effect is an individual event with its own identity. This separateness of distinct events is most naturally modelled using a special kind of linear logic which enforces the individuality of different occurrences. In this project we propose a canonical method of combining (a restricted but sufficiently expressive version of) such a linear logic with the standard mathematical machinery for modelling computational effects. An application will be to elucidate the nature of the linear usage of effects , whereby standard programming idioms ensure that the individuality of effects is respected.A second contribution is towards understanding the nature of behavioural equivalence between programs with effects. Whereas previously such equivalences have been axiomatized as basic, we instead implement them as observational equivalences , so programs are only distinguished if their observable behaviour differs. The novelty here is to build the notion of observation directly into the mathematical model, using it to determine all the other components usually required to model effects. This leads to new and rich mathematical models of effects, and also provides a basis for straightforward proofs of operational properties of programs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F042043/1","grantId":"EP/F042043/1","fundValue":"346830","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used in academia where developing approaches to reasoning about program behaviour in the presence of effects is a major endeavour destined for long-term impact on software development.

The project developed a formalism based on &quot;linear logic&quot; for modelling and reasoning about programs with effects taking account of their individual identity. It also develop a general mathematical theory of behavioural equivalence for programs with effects subsuming combinations of effects. A specific logic &quot;probabilistic mu-calculus&quot; was developed to reason about programs involving one particular combination of effects: probabilistic choice combined with nondeterminism. The problem of reasoning in the presence with effects is an active research topic, with reasoning about probabilstic behaviour a particular hot topic.
