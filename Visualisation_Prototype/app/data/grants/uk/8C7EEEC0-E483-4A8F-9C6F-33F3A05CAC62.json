{"id":"8C7EEEC0-E483-4A8F-9C6F-33F3A05CAC62","title":"Bringing Advanced LIGO to Design Performance and Further Sensitivity Enhancements","abstractText":"Through the design and construction project &quot;Advanced LIGO UK,&quot; the UK has succeeded in making fundamental contributions to the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detectors in the US by transfer of technology originally developed for GEO 600. \n\nAs a direct result, UK groups are in a position to fully exploit the rich science data that will be produced over the coming decade. There is, therefore, a unique opportunity to ensure that UK scientists maintain leadership in gravitational wave science, and that UK delivered equipment and facilities for the aLIGO detectors are fully exploited to maximise the science output. This is true both in terms of their implementation within the aLIGO baseline configuration, and when it is planned that reconfiguration or upgrading of aLIGO will be undertaken. It is envisaged that the UK equipment which has been designed to meet all long-term project goals, will remain in place even following such upgrades, and continued UK technical contributions and R&amp;D effort will be essential to ensure that is the case.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J00166X/1","grantId":"ST/J00166X/1","fundValue":"202852","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  the advanced modelling of (sub-)systems in gravitational-wave laser interferometers that has been delivered is now part of the standard modelling tools for Advanced LIGO, the most sensitive instrument in the world, and other GW laser interferometers Education,Other Cultural","person":"Alberto  Vecchio","coPersons":["Andreas  Freise"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" advances in radiation pressure noise have been included into FINESSE, one of the main gravitational-wave laser interferometer simulation tools. the modelling advances are now part of the standard ground-based laser interferometer modelling tools, and Advanced LIGO as well as other efforts in the world, such as Virgo and KAGRA are using these results and tools Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
