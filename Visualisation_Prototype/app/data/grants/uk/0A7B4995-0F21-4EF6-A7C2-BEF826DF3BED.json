{"id":"0A7B4995-0F21-4EF6-A7C2-BEF826DF3BED","title":"Design with Heritage","abstractText":"With the Arts and Humanities as the driver, the KE Project will develop a mutual learning environment among universities, cultural institutions and digital design industry. This will benefit the UK economy, its unparalleled wealth in tangible, intangible and digital cultural heritage and advance the UK's position as the global leader of digital design-led, research-based Knowledge Exchange in the field of cultural heritage.\n\nAims and Distinctiveness\nThe KE Project Design with Heritage will challenge heritage disciplines to engage with digital design industries, thereby realising their potential to support the development and growth of the Creative Economy. It will promote the value of cultural heritage assets as a resource by utilising research to develop products and services, and to improve productivity. It will facilitate connections, communication and exchange between A&amp;H research and Creative Industries and increase public engagement.\nUniquely, the KE Project will address the digital design sector engaging with cultural heritage and will address barriers to effective business engagement such as fragmented company base, cultural issues in academia and resource issues in the business sector. The KE Project will be enriched by the success of the AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme run by UCL. The activities will be extremely relevant to the RCUK Digital Economy Grand Challenge, the Care for the Future theme, and enhanced cultural tourism, all major AHRC priorities. \n\nSummary of key knowledge exchange activities and main partners involved\nTwo Work Packages (WPs) will be used to deliver knowledge exchange activities across 2 themes: WP1: Design for Enhanced Exhibitions, and WP2: Design for Augmented Artifacts. \nA Jumpstart event at UCL will produce clear questions identifying gaps and needs in Knowledge Exchange. A Green Paper will detail the priorities for engaging digital design industries with cultural heritage. Two interactive Sandpits focussing on the KE questions will be organised. KE Feasibility projects will be funded to provide support for practical exploration of new ideas. Outputs from these projects will include exhibition, case study, teaching, and web-based materials (e.g. apps). \nA final showcase event will disseminate and communicate public information in the form of a Symposium organised at the V&amp;A, and an Exhibition with enhanced web presence. \nTwo mechanisms will support the engagement of digital design industries with the Project: (i) academic backfill programme enabling academics and researchers at UCL and V&amp;A to be seconded to work on KE Feasibility projects on the basis of financial compensation for their time; (ii) KE Projects, emerging from Sandpits, supported by the KE Project and addressing barriers to effective engagement between academia, heritage institutions and digital design industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K002694/1","grantId":"AH/K002694/1","fundValue":"199674","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"May  Cassar","coPersons":["Stephen Alexander Gage","Matija  Strlic","Sandra  Smith","Glenn  Adamson","Boris  Pretzel"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
