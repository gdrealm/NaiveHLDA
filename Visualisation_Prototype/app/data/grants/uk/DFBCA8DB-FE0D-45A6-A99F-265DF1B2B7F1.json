Yet much evidence is incompatible with this model. This is problematic: without utility, how can a planner make welfare judgements on the basis of choice data?</p>\n\n<p>Though psychologist have traditionally explained apparent 'anomalies' by looking at decision making heuristics, this approach has until very recently been strongly resisted in economics. Recent developments in theory have however shown that it is possible to characterise plausible, psychologically founded decision procedures that both share the model building tradition of economics, and are testable in the same way as the standard utility maximisation model. </p>\n\n<p>This project builds on Mandler-Manzini-Mariotti's theory of Checklists (MMM). MMM postulates that an agent chooses from a set by going down a checklist of properties eliminating at each step the alternatives that do not have the specified property or, if no alternative has the property, moving on to the next property. Although no maximisation of utility or of preferences is invoked, MMM show that the two approaches are broadly equivalent. </p>\n\n<p>From this starting point, the project develops the MMM approach to study what characteristics of the checklist and its properties determine choice behaviour that cannot be reconciled with standard preference maximisation.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G03771X/1","grantId":"ES/G03771X/1","fundValue":"75792","fundStart":"2009-11-05","fundEnd":"2010-11-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marco  Mariotti","coPersons":["Paola  Manzini"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
