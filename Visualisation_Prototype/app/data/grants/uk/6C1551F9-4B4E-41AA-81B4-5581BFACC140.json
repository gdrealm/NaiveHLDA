While brown adipose tissue has earlier been considered active only in neonatal mammals and in small adult mammals, it has recently become evident that active brown adipose tissue exists in most adult humans. Expanding brown adipose tissue mass can thus be of potential therapeutic interest as a means of manipulating body mass in obesity by increasing caloric expenditure. It is therefore of considerable importance that the regulation of differentiation of the two adipose tissues is understood. We have recently found that the precursor cells of these two fat storing cell types can be distinguishable, prior to them becoming a white or a brown fat cell. It is through the use of this information that we can understand the control of the differentiation process and potentially how we can regulate these processes to increase the amount of brown adipose tissue. We generated microarray data to make these discoveries. This is a tool to capture the expression level of all genes in one experiment, producing 20,000 data points for each study. It is of utmost importance for cell function that gene expression levels can be accurately regulated. For this, the cell has numerous means of controlling expression levels, with a recent addition for the regulation of gene expression levels being the ability to inhibit the translation of the gene message into protein by the synthesis by microRNA molecules. microRNAs are RNA-only genes that can block the translation of multiple genes (so preventing protein expression). In preliminary experiments, we have found that some of the microRNAs present in the brown and white adipocytes are turned on and off during the differentiation process when the cells develop from immature to mature cells. We will continue these studies of miRNA regulation during differentiation with the aim of obtaining tools to influence and possibly redirect these developmental processes. Following the completion of the gene expression studies in brown and white fat cells, we aim to study the effects of manipulating the levels of genes specific to brown or white adipocytes. We will determine the ability of the fat cell to maintain it's phenotype in the absence of one or more of its marker genes. Studies will be performed both in cell lines that are as representative as possible for these normal cells and also in precursor cells derived directly from tissue. These robust studies will allow us to work out ways through a substantial list of interesting genes, and provide the best guidance as to which genes and mechanisms to focus on for future research. The original study that provided evidence for the distinction between brown and white adipocytes has allowed for the creation of a data base containing information on the expression levels of numerous genes of interest specifying a brown or a white phnotype. Further studies will investigate the effects of stimulation by the natural nervous system transmitter substance noradrenaline. Noradrenaline is the agent which activates heat production in brown adipocytes and also helps to regulate the number of cells found under different circumstances. These comparisons will pin-point genes that are activated in brown adipocytes and enhance caloric expenditure, and these genes could provide as potential targets for reversing obesity in humans. Our data base of results still holds large quantities of information that require further analysis, which will also be pursued within the project. This can give information about means by which the brown adipose tissue can be activated as a possibility to decrease body weight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G013128/1","grantId":"BB/G013128/1","fundValue":"507623","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Barbara  Cannon","coPersons":["James Archibald Timmons"],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" The project has focused on the molecular mechanisms and potential to turn white adipocytes into calorie consuming brown-like adipocytes (which we have named 'Brites'). Based on the extension of our original observation for a novel set of marker genes that define the brown adipocyte we have systemically explored a) the anatomical distribution of these marker genes so that we could select which populations of white-cells should be used to manipulate cell fate. We have clearly defined this within the literature (Petrovic 2010, Wald?n 2012) and then went on to establish that 2 novel proteins (TBX15 and a second un-published target) appear to play a key role in defining the process of switching on the brown adipocyte expression programme. We have established that the majority of microRNA changes in vitro are consistent across primary mouse adipocyte types (brown and white) and that some do change in human adipose tissue with increased BMI. We have also prepared, as a public data based, a novel gene-splicing data set that will be fully searchable to all researchers using an online web based tool. \n\n\n\nThis resource will be available from the summer 2012 and represents the first major gene splicing resources for studying the biology of adipocytes. The online gene splicing databased will provide both academic and commercial activities the opportunity to understand adipocyte function in much greater detail. So far there are no obvious drug gable targets within the data we have examined but we continue to evaluate this situation. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
