{"id":"EF987E81-2B0E-47F4-ADA5-4BC9220E813D","title":"Mathematical modelling of bladder cancer: effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy","abstractText":"Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the UK, affecting approximately 12,000 people a year. Doctors now believe that giving radiotherapy alongside chemotherapy could prove more effective in the battle against bladder cancer than giving them individually. \n\nClinical trials have indicated that there are survival benefits from the combined treatment compared to either chemotherapy or radiation alone. However it is not yet clear whether the benefit is primarily due to potentiation of radiation or to additional cancer cell kill by the chemotherapy. One chemotherapeutic drug, being used in bladder cancer, chemo-radiotherapy trials is gemcitabine.\n\nA fuller understanding of how chemo-radiotherapy works requires quantitative modelling. This project will focus on developing mathematical models to obtain a better understanding of whether the effect of gemcitabine-radiotherapy is determined primarily due to the effect of more cancer cells killed by the drug or as a result of the drug making the cancer cells more susceptible to being destroyed by the radiotherapy.\n\nAt present neither the optimal time interval, nor the most beneficial sequence of administration of gemcitabine are known. Mathematical modelling could therefore be of immense value in investigating the optimal sequencing schedule of gemcitabine-radiation therapy and identifying the potential gains which might be expected.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701852","grantId":"G0701852","fundValue":"92564","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sheelagh Francesca Shearer","coPersons":["Joe  O'Sullivan"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
