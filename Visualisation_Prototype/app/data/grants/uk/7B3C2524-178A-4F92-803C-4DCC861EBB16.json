{"id":"7B3C2524-178A-4F92-803C-4DCC861EBB16","title":"Regulation of the positional stability of neurons in the developing nervous system","abstractText":"The nervous system is composed of clusters of neurons that communicate through a network of processes, sometimes called nerves. Neurons are large and complex cells that extend processes, sometimes metres long, to specific targets. Yet, while they extend these long processes, the cell bodies of the neurons must also find their own settling places within precise boundaries. This is important to build a functional nervous system: that like neurons cluster together at the appropriate place when at the same time extend processes to different parts of the body. Strangely enough, we don?t know how neurons do this but recent experiments suggest that their supporting cells, the glia, play a role in setting the boundaries. This is what I want to investigate. This is important if we want to understand how the nervous system is built, why things sometimes go wrong in development or adulthood and how to fix them. For example, recently people have been talking about the possibility of using stem cell therapy to repair the nervous system. These stem cells will be implanted in the nervous system and will have to migrate to the right position, be maintained there and extend processes. Should they not be maintained, they might prove counter-productive and perturb the nervous system they are supposed to cure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501187","grantId":"G0501187","fundValue":"320197","fundStart":"2006-07-11","fundEnd":"2009-07-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthieu  Vermeren","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
