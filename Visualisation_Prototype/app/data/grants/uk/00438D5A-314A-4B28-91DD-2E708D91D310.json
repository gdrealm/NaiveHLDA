A large proportion of\npatients die from the infection, in part because the current recommended treatment,\namphotericin B for 2 weeks, is difficult to give in hospitals in the developing world, because\nit is relatively expensive and needs to be given intravenously and has side effects, often\nstarting in the second week, meaning monitoring is needed with frequent blood tests. The\nalternative oral tablet treatment, fluconazole, that is available and cheap and currently\ncommonly used, is much less effective.\nTherefore, based on a number of earlier small trials by the study team, we wish to test 2\nnew treatments, (1) Short, 1-week amphotericin B, and (2) Combination tablet treatment\nwith high dose fluconazole plus another drug called flucytosine, that are as fast and effective\nin killing the infection as 2 weeks of amphotericin B. We will compare these new treatments\nwith 2 weeks amphotericin B, in a larger, randomised trial that will enable us to see whether\nthey are as good in preventing deaths from the infection. After 2 weeks of the study\ntreatments, all patients will receive the usual follow on therapy with fluconazole, and will be\nstarted on drugs for the underlying HIV infection, as currently recommended, and followed\nup for 10 weeks. 570 patients (190 given each alternative treatment) will be studied. This is\nthe minimum number needed to reliably compare the results of the treatments.\nThe project has been developed with doctors in 3 centres in Malawi and Zambia where there\nare many cases and where alternative, affordable and practical treatments are urgently\nneeded. Each centre has the laboratories needed, and experience in doing such trials. Both\ntest treatments have been shown to be much more rapidly effective than fluconazole alone,\nand would have less side effects and be much more easily given in developing countries than\n2 weeks amphotericin B. However, if 2 weeks amphotericin B was found to be the best\ntreatment, then the costs required for its use could be justified. The costs as well as the\neffectiveness of the treatments will be compared to help decide which treatment to\nrecommend in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100814","grantId":"G1100814","fundValue":"3237240","fundStart":"2012-03-08","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Harrison","coPersons":["Peter  Mwaba","David  Lalloo","Olivier  Lortholary","Chishala  Chabala","Shabbar  Jaffar","Robert Simon Heyderman","Charles  Van Der Horst","Daniel  Namarika"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
