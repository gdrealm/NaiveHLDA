{"id":"21B7D168-F361-40C3-AF1C-62F1C6B24F07","title":"Virtual Exhaust Prototyping System (VExPro)","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to optimise the throughput of multi-disciplinary and multi-physics optimisation problems. The\nproject will focus on optimising a lightweight exhaust system encompassing areas of thermo-mechanical, mechanical,\nacoustics, vibration, manufacturing and light-weighting analysis and design in a High Performance Computing (HPC)\nEnvironment. The project will explore the aspect of numerical accuracy and uncertainty between physical principles, theory,\nmathematical modelling and analytical methods. This will be achieved by &quot;scaling&quot; model complexities in order to\n&quot;harmonise&quot; multi-physics computing requirements, run time and accuracy. The project aim is to investigate the potential\ntrade-off between accuracy and the computing time in a multi-physics and multi-disciplinary optimisation context by\ndefining, developing and validating (against physical experimentation) an optimisation algorithm for HPC computing with an\nultimate aim of eliminating the use of prototypes. The project brings together Unipart Ebersp&auml;cher Exhaust Systems Ltd.\n(UEES) and Coventry University (CU) in a 2 year project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506771/1","grantId":"EP/M506771/1","fundValue":"394947","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jesper  Christensen","coPersons":["Christophe  BASTIEN"],"organisation":"Coventry University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
