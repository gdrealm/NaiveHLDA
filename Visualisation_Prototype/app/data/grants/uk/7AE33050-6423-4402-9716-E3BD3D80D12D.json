Such a process is very familiar in atomic systems but barely studied in the nuclear case because Compton-scattered gamma rays may be mistaken for two-photon emission. The best cases to study this phenomenon are therefore those where emission of a single photon is forbidden and this is the case where initial and final states have spin zero. In this case, the first order process is emission of a conversion electron which has a very different character to two-photon emission. A handful of cases of two-photon emission in nuclei were studied 20 years ago and earlier. These showed that there was an unexpected intereference between electric and magnetic dipole transitions in the two-photon decay. Unfortunately, this process was never fully understood. We hope to shine new light on this with a very sensitive measurement using the state-of-the-art gamma-ray detector array, Gammasphere situated at Argonne National Laboratory. This grant is to carry out an approved experimental study of two-photon emission in 98-Mo using Gammasphere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002995/1","grantId":"ST/I002995/1","fundValue":"4413","fundStart":"2010-08-20","fundEnd":"2010-11-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The impact is in the field of nuclear physics.
