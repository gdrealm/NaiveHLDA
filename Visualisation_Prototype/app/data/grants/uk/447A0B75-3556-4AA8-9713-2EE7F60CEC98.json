{"id":"447A0B75-3556-4AA8-9713-2EE7F60CEC98","title":"BBSRC Embrapa: Temperature resilience of flowering in UK and Brazilian wheat (TempRe)","abstractText":"The project involves Rothamsted Research, University of Nottingham, and Embrapa Trigo. Between them the teams have expertise in the genetic control of abiotic stress tolerance, developmental genetics of flower formation, and metabolic signalling systems. They bring a range of complementary techniques, from systems biology and bioinformatics through genetics and physiology to wheat transformation. All three institutions are well-equipped, with facilities for all aspects of the study in place. The aim is to study the response of UK and Brazilian wheat to temperature stress between booting and flowering using molecular, whole-plant and transgenic approaches.\n\nUK team:\nProf. Nigel Halford, RRes: Expertise in the genetics of metabolic regulation in crop plants and how metabolism is affected by abiotic stress, using techniques ranging from mathematical modelling of metabolic networks through molecular and biochemical analyses of signalling factors to RNAseq and GC-MS analyses. Visited Embrapa Trigo in 2013.\nDr Matthew Paul, RRes: Expertise in trehalose 6-phosphate signalling, the role of sugar signalling in responses to abiotic stresses, and manipulation to improve yield under stress conditions. Uses a range of molecular and physiological techniques, as well as innovative chemistry. \nProf Huw Jones, RRes: Leads wheat transformation at RRes, exploiting gene up-regulation, RNAi silencing and genome editing and validating 30 different gene promoters. Participated in the BBSRC/Embrapa workshop on wheat improvement in 2011 and will deliver a plenary lecture in the XV Brazilian Congress of Plant Physiology in 2015. Has experience of GMO risk assessment and GM field management.\nProfessor Zoe Wilson, University of Nottingham: Expertise in plant developmental genetics, specifically the regulation of pollen and anther development. Current research involves the translation of pollen gene networks from models to wheat and barley, and temperature stress during pollen development in Arabidopsis, wheat and crops such as Bambara Ground Nut, which show tolerance to extreme temperatures.\nProf John Foulkes, University of Nottingham: Expertise in the traits determining stress tolerance in wheat. Current research includes the development of high-throughput remote sensing phenotyping, the physiological and genetic basis of ear fertility and the identification of novel genes controlling tillering, spikelet primordia number and floret fertility. Visited Embrapa Trigo in 2013.\n\nBrazil team: \nDr Edina Moresco. Embrapa Trigo: Expertise in wheat breeding, specifically quantitative genetics, classical breeding techniques, G x E and plant/pathogen interactions, with a focus on evaluation and selection of plants for abiotic stress tolerance. \nDr Antonio Nhani Jr, Embrapa Trigo: Expertise in bioinformatics applied to the identification of molecular markers and the analysis of wheat transcriptome data related to biotic and abiotic stresses.\nDr Elene Yamazaki Lau: Expertise in molecular biology and biotechnology; currently developing A. tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation protocols for wheat in order to generate lines with increased tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat. \nDr Jorge Fernando Pereira: Expertise in the molecular basis of abiotic stress responses in wheat and barley; also has interests in developing wheat and barley transformation techniques. \nDr Luciano Consoli: Expertise in molecular genetics and wheat pre-breeding; investigating abiotic stress responses and pre-harvest sprouting using association genetics and QTL studies.\nDr Mauro Cesar Celaro Teixeira: Expertise in the mechanisms underpinning stress tolerance and yield potential of wheat cultivars in harsh environments.\nDr Osmar Rodrigues: Expertise in plant physiology; currently studying the physiological bases for yield formation and grain set on wheat during the winter growing season in the Southern part of Brazil.\nAretha Arcen P.
