The aim of the network is to bridge the gap between the currently prevailing understanding of China's policy interests and processes and its development impacts in low income countries. </p>\n\n<p>Network members are leading academics, policy analysts and policy-makers from China, Europe and low income countries who will be led by Dr Frauke Urban of the Climate Change and Development Centre, Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in cooperation with Open University and Tsinghua University. </p>\n\n<p>Three workshops will be organised in Beijing, London and Brighton. The first workshop willl discuss the implications of a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of the domestic processes behind China's development activities for its external engagements.The second workshop will analyse the actors, institutions and modes of interaction through which China and low income countries engage. The third workshop will apply the analytical framework developed throughout the network activities to particular areas of on-going research on energy and climate change, focusing on the Mekong Region and Africa. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-075-25-0019","grantId":"RES-075-25-0019","fundValue":"66222","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frauke  Urban","coPersons":["Giles Marcus Mohan","Lan  Xue"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
