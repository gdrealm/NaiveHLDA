{"id":"95FE761E-3BBC-4783-B015-DEAEBD2081D4","title":"US-UK BBSRC-NIFA Collab: Control of emerging bunyaviruses","abstractText":"Arboviruses are viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, biting flies or ticks, and can infect both man and livestock. Bunyaviruses are one group of arboviruses and include the well-known Rift Valley fever virus that causes devastating epidemics among sheep and cattle in Africa, and a new virus, Schmallenberg virus, that appeared in Europe in 2011 and rapidly spread throughout the continent causing abortions, stillbirths and malformations of calves and lambs. In order to prepare for future outbreaks of bunyavirus disease we need to understand why certain insect vectors are able to spread a particular virus whereas others cannot, and whether local insects would be capable to supporting transmission of an introduced virus. This will be addressed by infecting different mosquito and midge species with different viruses, and determining the factors involved in a successful transmission. Should a new outbreak occur, we need to be able to respond rapidly with vaccines to contain the disease. We will use our ability to genetically modify viruses to produce weakened viruses that can no longer cause disease but are able to induce protective antibodies in the host animal that will preventive subsequent infection. The candidate vaccines will be assessed for their efficacy in sheep and will establish general principles for the development of further vaccines in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M027112/1","grantId":"BB/M027112/1","fundValue":"479311","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alain  KohlRichard M Elliott","coPersons":["Massimo  Palmarini"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
