{"id":"070C34DF-2143-4EBE-949F-AA4C7E11735A","title":"Shakespeare and the Modern Poet","abstractText":"An inquiry into the ways in which Shakespeare is referred to, characterised, and becomes both a model and an anxiety in a range of modern poets writing in English, particularly W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. The study will consider both their original poetry and their prose writings - critical essays, letters and journals. And it will look at some of Ted Hughes's manuscript material.\\n\\nThe study will also enquire into the ways in which, after Yeats, these poets read one another in relation to their views of Shakespeare: how Auden, for instance, writes in some ways against Eliot, and how Hughes both amalgamates Yeats and Eliot and writes against Auden. The project will uncover a story of inter-relationship: antagonisms as well as affiliations.\\n\\nIt will also address the writings of major commentators - literary critics and theorists - who have speculated on the nature of literary reference and allusion, seeking to discover the best way of characterising the relationship between these poets and Shakespeare.\\n\\nThe outcome of the research will be a book of about 95000 words in length. It will also give rise to a keynote lecture at a conference on Shakespeare and Modern Poetry and an essay in a volume of essays on Shakespeare and England.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F001681/1","grantId":"AH/F001681/1","fundValue":"38328","fundStart":"2008-01-25","fundEnd":"2008-05-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Corcoran","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
