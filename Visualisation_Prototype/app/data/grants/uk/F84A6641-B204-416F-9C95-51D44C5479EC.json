An international comparison between Australia and the UK","abstractText":"<p>The type of school a child attends has been shown to impact on educational attainment and later labour market earnings, but there is very little persuasive empirical evidence (although widespread and varied anecdotal evidence) on why parents choose to send their children to particular types of schools, or opt to take their children outside the state system. This project will attempt to look at this question by comparing the determinants of school choice in Australia and the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It will do this in two related projects. The first will look at changes in household demand for private education over the last 20 years in the two countries. The second will look at the determinants of school choice. This collaborative research project will attempt to answer these important questions by focusing on some key potential drivers in these two related projects using similar UK and Australian data. It will do so by paying careful attention to what is similar and what is different about the underlying factors driving changes in school sector choice over time in the two countries.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2524","grantId":"RES-000-22-2524","fundValue":"80889","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorraine Margaret Dearden","coPersons":["Stephen Jonathan Machin","Richard  Blundell"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
