The XMM-Newton Survet Science Centre(SSC) is an international collaboration involving a consortium of 10 institutes in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The main role of the SSC in the XMM-Newton project are: to develop and maintain the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (ii) routine pipeline processing of all XMM-Newton scientific data. Within the INT WFC programme a total of ~1000 deep optical images have been obtained covering over 200 XMM-Newton fields mostly in 3 different wavebands or optical colours. This data can be used to decide what is causing the X-ray emission in the sky. e.g. is it caused by black holes in the centres of galaxies or is it caused by energetic activity in stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F006799/1","grantId":"ST/F006799/1","fundValue":"79919","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Gerard McMahon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
