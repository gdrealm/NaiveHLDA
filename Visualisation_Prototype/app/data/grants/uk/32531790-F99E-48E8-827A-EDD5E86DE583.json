This project focuses on how negative emotions, such as anger, influence punishment in children, adolescents, and adults and assesses interested attentional control, that is disengaging attention away from negative information and thoughts, moderates when and how negative emotions affect punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Three interrelated studies will examine the role of negative emotions and attentional control in the development of punishment. Participants in all three studies will consist of 8-year-old children, 14-year-old adolescents, and undergraduate students.</p>\n\n<p>Study 1 will investigate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>whether punishment of unfair behavior is associated with an increase in skin conductance responses (a measure of emotional activation) and negative emotional ratings</li>\n\n <li>whether the relation between emotional reactivity (skin conductance, emotion ratings) and punishment is modulated by attentional control. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Study 2 will examine:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>whether anger (induced by watching film clips) affects</li>\n\n <li>whether children and participants in a low attentional control condition show higher punishment than adults, adolescents and people in a high attentional control condition. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Study 3 will assess:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how induced anger affects third-party punishment versus compensating the victim of a violation. </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000942/1","grantId":"ES/K000942/1","fundValue":"251920","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The have only been scientific impacts yet.
