{"id":"B1B7F1AD-32C8-4FC5-B49F-B9D15CFB9C70","title":"Victims of crime, criminal justice and social exclusion","abstractText":"I will use my institutional and AHRC leave to complete a book project, 'Victims of Crime, Social Exclusion and Criminal Justice'. This book will be a socio-legal analysis of the rights of victims of crime in the UK criminal justice system. That is, the legal and quasi-legal rights of victims will be analysed as they appear in formal rules and procedures, and as they operate in reality. The concept of 'victims' used in the book will be deliberately wider than that generally recognised currently, demonstrating that victim policy is only partially-inclusive. This is despite the growth of rights of victims of crime over the last 15 years or so, and the increased prominence of victim participation in the criminal justice system. The book will show that the way victims' rights are currently conceived and implemented are exclusionary in many different ways, partly because of a responsibilisation strategy on the part of government. That is, a strategy whereby increasing responsibility is thrust onto victims for the pursuit of 'their' cases, although the strategy is generally presented as a way of empowering victims. The book will begin by contextualising patterns of victimisation and victim participation in criminal justice historically and comparatively, and will examine 'official' concepts of 'crime victim' critically. The 'needs' and desires of crime victims will then be analysed, along with the main ways in which these are met in the UK, and models of criminal justice will be outlined that will serve as an organising framework for the book. The major stages of the criminal justice system will then be charted from investigation, through decisions to prosecute or divert from prosecution, to trial and then post-trial processes. Issues such as restorative justice, victim impact statements (of various kinds) and special provisions for vulnerable witnesses and victims will be discussed in each of these chapters where applicable. Then will follow an overview of victims' rights from the human rights point of view, examining how far they are exclusionary or inclusionary. Finally two alternative visions of the future will be presented: an ideal inclusionary vision, in which the needs and desires of victims are catered for in ways that do not impact adversely on the accused; and a more realistic prediction of future developments in which the system becomes ever-more exclusionary for many categories of victim and accused alike.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G007209/1","grantId":"AH/G007209/1","fundValue":"39520","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Sanders","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
