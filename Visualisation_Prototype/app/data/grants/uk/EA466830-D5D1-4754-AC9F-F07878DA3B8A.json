{"id":"EA466830-D5D1-4754-AC9F-F07878DA3B8A","title":"Experimental Particle Physics","abstractText":"Our research is focused on experimental measurements and physics anlaysis of data taken at CERN and DESY laboratories. We contribute to the design, construction and testing of detector components, preparation of software and physics analysis, monitoring and operation of detectors during data-taking and physics analysis of the recorded data. We are making significant contributions to the ATLAS experiment which is being prepared for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. During the period of the grant this experiment will make the transition into physics data collection and analysis, in which we will be very strongly involved. In addition, we are completing the analysis of physics data from the H1 experiment, preparation for the NA62 experiment and a range of research and development projects for future accelerators and detectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H00100X/2","grantId":"ST/H00100X/2","fundValue":"2082650","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Watkins","coPersons":["John Allan Wilson","Paul  Newman","Nigel Keith Watson","Christopher  Hawkes","Alan Trevor Watson","Cristina  Lazzeroni","David  Charlton"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
