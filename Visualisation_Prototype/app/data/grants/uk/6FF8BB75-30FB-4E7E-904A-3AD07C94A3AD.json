{"id":"6FF8BB75-30FB-4E7E-904A-3AD07C94A3AD","title":"Revolutionary Electric Vehicle Battery (REVB) - design and integration of novel state estimation/control algorithms &amp; system optimisation techniques","abstractText":"The latest draft of the main application form (submitted by OXIS Energy on behalf of all collaborators) is attached. This\ngives a fuller picture of the project, including detailed work package descriptions.\nCranfield's research is divided into six work packages:\nWP CF1: High-Level Requirements Gathering\nWP CF2: Architectural Design\nWP CF3: Modelling and Estimation\nWP CF4: Control and Optimization\nWP CF5: Integration\nWP CF6: Development of Reusable Software Tools\nDetailed descriptions of each follow.\nWP CF1: High-Level Requirements Gathering\nIn this work package, we will work with the other consortium members to determine the exact requirements that the\nautomotive battery pack needs to meet. We will understand the power requirements and other demands on the battery\nsystem.\nThe ultimate end use of the technology would be in an electric vehicle. For the purpose of this project, the consortium is\nplanning to produce a hardware-in-the-loop 'technology demonstrator'. This will be developed by Lotus Engineering, and\nCranfield will use it to integrate and test state estimators and control algorithms. (The requirements for the hardware-in-the-loop simulator are directly analogous to those for a real electric vehicle, so we can be confident that our work has realworld\nrelevance.)\nWP CF 2: Architectural Design\nIn this work package, we will work with one collaborator in particular (Lotus Engineering) to design the structure of the\ndemonstrator's Battery Energy Manager. (This is a computer control system that can be embedded in a vehicle, and we\nwill be using it to control the behaviour of the powertrain components.) We will first seek to understand Lotus's existing\ncontroller in detail. After this, we will be able to produce detailed requirements for our controller and estimator, and then\ndesign an architecture for it.\nWP CF3: Modelling and Estimation\nIn this work package, we will develop low-order models of the battery suitable for embedding in the Battery Energy\nManager, and we will use these to design a novel state estimator that will give 'virtual measurements' for quantities that are\nhard to measure directly. We will prepare an initial version of these in time to support Lotus's parallel software design\nactivities. We will then refine the algorithms, taking into account development in our collaborators' research activities.\nThe low-order models will also be used to design controllers in WP CP4.\nWP CF4: Control and Optimization\nIn this work package, we will apply multi-objective system optimization techniques to the driveline as a whole. We will also\nuse advanced control techniques to develop a novel control algorithm for the Battery Energy Manager. We will prepare\ninitial versions of these in time to support Lotus's parallel software design activities. We will then refine the algorithms,\ntaking into account development in our collaborators' research activities.\nWP CF5: Integration\nIn this work package, we will support Lotus as they integrate our estimation and control algorithms into their Battery Energy\nManager and hardware-in-the-loop technology demonstrator. We will simulate the behaviour in a virtual environment,\nmodify the algorithms if needed, and then support integration on the hardware-in-the-loop technology demonstrator itself.\nWP CF6: Development of Reusable Software Tools\nIn this work package, we will take the software tools we develop in earlier work packages, and develop them to make them\nrobust enough to be useful to others who wish to apply similar techniques. (We will distribute our tools over the WWW.)","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505286/1","grantId":"EP/L505286/1","fundValue":"468617","fundStart":"2014-02-14","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  It is early in the project, but our findings are being used to develop a novel BMS system.
