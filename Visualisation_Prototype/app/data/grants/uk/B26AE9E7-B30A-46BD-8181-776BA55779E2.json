There will be original research: analysing philosophical principles underpinning ancient cosmogony, analysing ancient anti-cosmogony arguments - assessing ancient scientific / explanatory resources, assessing what the ancients wanted from cosmogony, relating ancient's cosmogonies to their cultural context, arguing that understanding cosmogony helps us understand ancient views in related areas, drawing illuminating comparisons and contrasts between ancient and modern cosmogony.
