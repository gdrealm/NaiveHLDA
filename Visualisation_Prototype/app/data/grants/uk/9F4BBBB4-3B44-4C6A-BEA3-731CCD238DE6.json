It is enjoyed by expert and novice alike, but its complexity andreal-time nature make it difficult for listeners to fully understand andappreciate the content of a musical recording. This proposal is predicated onthe assumption that the vast majority of music consumers, professional andamateur alike, want to know more, but the tools and services they routinelyaccess are incapable of helping them. The tools and services that the Centre forDigital Music has been researching for several years can fulfill this demand,given the appropriate interaction with users.This proposal therefore sets up scenarios to examine how people's relationshipwith music is changed by using new technologies, enabling us to understand howto bridge the gap from laboratory curiosity to the mainstream market.Underpinning this proposal are the new technologies associated with metadata --in particular, Semantic Metadata. These have the potential to change thelandscape for music (and indeed other media types) in all areas from creation toconsumption. By changing how users interact with music, this proposal will shedlight on new business models for the music industry.The British Library (BL) has a catalogue of 3.5 million soundrecordings, approximately half of which are in a digital format,including many unique historic items, which visitors can listen toin the Library's Reading Rooms while taking notes with paper and pencil. No tools areprovided in the Reading Rooms, and the data can not be taken off site due to copyrightregulations. The current situation hinders contemporary research, which aims tocomplement listeners' impressions with precise measurements of musical features.User feedback regarding deployment of analysis and visualisation tools at the BL,undertaken as a preliminary study to inform this proposal, indicated thepotential to transform musicology research.Such tools must however be carefully tailored to meet the data securityrequirements of the BL.Our software tools have a broader application than to expert musicologists.Hobby musicians and music lovers can also benefit from our music analysis,search and visualisation software. The most likely market is younger people, sowe also target school music students as a first step towards reaching young peoplein general. Our relationship with schools will help penetrate the market, asyoung people inevitably spread the word (probably using Facebook) on cool new stuff to enjoy music with, as well as help evaluate the potentialfor a business model for Sonic Visualiser, based on music education.The BBC's relatively new www.bbc.co.uk/music/introducing site hasacquired over 34,000 music tracks in the astonishingly short period of 11months. New bands are invited to upload their songs. Added to this, thecollection contains many video recordings from BBC-sponsored concerts.Everything is accompanied by high quality metadata, much of it using theMusic Ontology that the Centre for Digital Music pioneered. New bands willbenefit from interacting with ananalysis of their songs, and on-line users will benefit from new ways tonavigate through this exciting collection, while simultaneously understandingmore about what goes into the music.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001832/1","grantId":"EP/I001832/1","fundValue":"250102","fundStart":"2010-09-13","fundEnd":"2012-03-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Software for recommending music for learning guitar.\n\nHOTTTABS uses Echo Nest's &quot;hotttnesss&quot; measure to obtain a selection of hottest artist and tunes you might like to learn to play on guitar. After a track has been selected, HOTTTABS looks into the YouTube database to get video tutorials of people playing the track, and our guitar tab web crawler to fetch the guitar tabs from as many guitar tab web sites as we can find. The guitar tabs are then clustered into three levels of difficulty (easy/medium/difficult) based on a statistical criterion computed from the tune's chords. It presents the tabs in a 3D-tag-cloud style so you can visualise the main chords used and the available tabs at your preferred level of difficulty.\n\nSoftware for automatically finding and displaying the score for a given audio recording.\n\nSonicMuse combines the application Sonic Visualiser for viewing and analysing the content of music audio files with the online music sheet database MuseScore. The music score that best matches the metadata of the given audio track is retrieved and displayed alongside the audio in Sonic Viaualiser. SonicMuse is a first step towards enhanced performance practice analysis based on audio and symbolic information.\n\nA web service for allowing users to view the chords of music videos available on YouTube.\n\nWe developed a prototype web service, Yanno (http://yanno.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) for analysis of music videos available on YouTube, allowing users to view the chords of their favourite songs and to play along with them, or just listen while simultaneously understanding more about what goes into the music. This was received enthusiastically by teachers and students alike.\n\nBeneficiaries: Musicians, music students, music teachers, researchers, general public\n\nContribution Method: Determined the concept and design of the system Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Simon  Dixon","coPersons":["Mark  Sandler"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" Technologies such as YouTube, mobile phones and MP3 players are beginning to be integrated into secondary school music in the UK. At the same time, the gap between formal and informal music learning is being bridged by the incorporation of students' preferred music into class activities. We conducted an ethnographic study in two secondary schools in London, investigating the roles of technology in the negotiation of musical concepts in music classes. From this, we report some observations on the relation between formal/informal and authorised/unauthorised activities in class, and some specific observations on the role of YouTube, mobile phones and MP3 players in the class context. In the lessons we observed, these technologies functioned as part of a richly multimodal ecosystem of technologies, combining aspects of formal and informal use. This carries implications for how we plan for the use of technology in the delivery of music education.  Education","dataset":"gtr"}
