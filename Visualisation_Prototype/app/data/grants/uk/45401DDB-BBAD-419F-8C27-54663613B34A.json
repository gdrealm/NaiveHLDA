{"id":"45401DDB-BBAD-419F-8C27-54663613B34A","title":"Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infection: identification of the host cell intimin receptor (Hir)","abstractText":"Escherichia coli (or E. coli) is the name of a normally harmless bacterium that lives in the human gut. However, a few strains of E. coli have acquired the ability to cause disease. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC for short) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC for short and also known as E. coli O157) are two such closely related strains of E. coli that cause diarrhoeal diseases in man and sometimes cause death. EPEC is a cause of infant disease particularly in third world countries whereas EHEC is a food-borne pathogen common in developed countries; a few recent fatal E. coli O157 outbreaks in the U.K. have highlighted the importance of this recently emerged pathogen. In order to cause disease these bacteria, once consumed, must stick to the lining of the gut and grow to large numbers, a process known as colonisation. EPEC and EHEC express a surface protein known as intimin, which plays a central role in colonisation of the gut epithelium. Previous reports have shown that the EPEC/EHEC bacterium injects a receptor known as Tir (translocated intimin receptor) into the host cell that intimin binds to. However, a large body of evidence point to existence of an intimin receptor which is of cellular origin which we tentatively call Hir (host intimin receptor). Although Hir seems to play a major role in colonisation, its identity is still unknown. The aim of this investigation is to identify and characterise candidate Hir. This will aid in understanding the molecular basis of EHEC and EPEC infection and in the development of novel intervention compounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401551","grantId":"G0401551","fundValue":"220000","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gad  Frankel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
