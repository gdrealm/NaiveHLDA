The commonest lesions arising in cells are chromosomal DNA single-strand breaks, in which one strand of the DNA double helix is broken. This work will address the hypothesis that the cellular machinery that repairs chromosomal single-strand breaks is important for maintaining proper function of the nervous system. It will address the possibility that defects in this machinery result in hereditary, debilitating, and progressive neurological disease. This work may also identify the molecular abnormality present in some of these diseases in which the underlying genetic defect is currently undefined.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400959","grantId":"G0400959","fundValue":"189321","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Caldecott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
