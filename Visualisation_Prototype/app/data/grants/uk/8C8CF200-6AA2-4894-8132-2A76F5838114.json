{"id":"8C8CF200-6AA2-4894-8132-2A76F5838114","title":"Development of human ex vivo bone-tumour niche for the study of cancer bone disease","abstractText":"The skeleton is the preferential site for tumour metastases and the incidence and management of primary bone tumours (e.g. osteosarcoma) typically affecting young adults, have remained unchanged for over a decade. Moreover, the spread of tumours to the skeleton often represents the final stages of disease. Consequently, there is a large field of research aimed at reducing the spread and development of tumours within the skeleton, and which involve a wide range of animal models. These include models where tumours are injected into distant sits (e.g. heart) and allowed to spread to bone, or where tumour cells are implanted directly into skeletal sites (e.g. tibia). In addition, human tumour cells are often used in such mouse models, and where animals lacking an efficient immune system are used, and which do not fully capitulate the human bone-human tumour microenvironment seen in patients with cancer-bone disease. \n\nThis proposal aims to address this issue and reduce/replace the use of animals as a first line tool in such studies, through the development of a new ex vivo model where human bone is isolated under sterile, ethical- and human tissue act-approved procedures, and colonised in culture with human tumour cells. The extent of bone destruction and tumour growth will be assessed as is used for bones dissected from mouse models of cancer-bone disease. This will include using computer-generated 3D images of the bone and histology, with tissue culture media stored for future analysis or bone- and tumour-derived factors. In addition, this proposal will re-use data from previous in vivo studies conducted within our group to compare directly against data generated using this ex vivo assay, and which will include the testing of anti-cancer therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/M000133/1","grantId":"NC/M000133/1","fundValue":"74130","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"James Robin Edwards","coPersons":["Claire M Edwards"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
