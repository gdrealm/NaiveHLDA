{"id":"FAD1D3F9-01B2-4E24-BF68-4FA9B4B01F5C","title":"Novel application of LFW to enable near net shape forming of components","abstractText":"An applied research project led by GKN Aerospace, taking an existing joining technique, Linear Friction Welding (LFW), and applying it in a novel way to achieve near net shape forming, resulting in a step-change in overall UK manufacturing competitiveness. It enables both a significantly reduced raw material requirement and machining time and cost, delivering a much improved 'Buy to Fly' ratio and environmental sustainabilty. Environmental benefits will be achieved through the whole supply chain from reduced energy used during material supply and part manufacture of both hard and soft metals.\n\nWork will be undertaken with Thompson Friction Weld, who have a proven experience in using LFW, and academic support from the University of Birmingham for weld characterisation, optimisation and validation. This advanced manufacturing technology will enable high value cost efficient environmentally beneficial manufacturing to be exploited in the UK in an increasingly competitive global market. The project adresses two challenges identified in this call: Intelligent processing of metals/net shape hybrid structures and Innovation in new manufacturing process competencies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K503691/1","grantId":"EP/K503691/1","fundValue":"112438","fundStart":"2013-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-03-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bowen","coPersons":["Yu Lung  Chiu"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
