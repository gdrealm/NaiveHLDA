Registration concessions are generally negotiated on a case-by-case basis in addition to reduced student registration evident at each event. Late-breaking 'bare bones' packages to UK PhD and MSc.students comprising basic accommodation and minimum registration fees have also been available once a near break-even point has been achieved. A significant percentage of delegates have therefore attended at a reduced rate subsidised from various sources that are no longer available (se CFS). Such rates will not be possible in 2004 unless other sources of subsidy can be found. The over-riding intention has been to maintain a high-quality, high benefit event whilst ensuring access to delegates from wide spectrum of backgrounds and career stages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D052351/1","grantId":"EP/D052351/1","fundValue":"5569","fundStart":"2006-04-20","fundEnd":"2006-10-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Parmee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
