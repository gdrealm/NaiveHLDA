It is capable of finding the satellite by itself within milliseconds, is simple, lightweight and low cost. We have identified that there is a significant requirement in the market for truly worldwide satellite internet broadband coverage. Cloud computing is one example, 50Bn mobile devices are projected to be connected to the cloud by 2025. How do you get the worldwide wireless infrastructure to support this? It may not be economical to provide terrestrial wireless broadband over large continents such as Africa, although satellite broadband can provide a solution to this. The satellite infrastructure is already there to provide global broadband coverage (eg Inmarsat BGAN). The problem is that the user terminals, particularly the antenna, are difficult to use by unskilled personnel, and require accurate pointing at the satellite. They are also prohibitively expensive, mainly due to their complexity and the low volume of users, similar to the early days of the mobile phone market, where phones were the sizes of bricks and calls cost a fortune. At QUB with the support of three EPSRC projects from 1998 to 2010, we have developed highly novel self steered antennas, which have the capability of &quot;pointing&quot; to a satellite within milliseconds. These antennas use simple analogue circuits, unlike current tracking antennas which either rely on complicated digital circuits, which consume a lot of power, or require heavy motorised steering mechanisms. That is why there has never been a simple, lightweight, low powered satellite broadband antenna on the market. The Follow on fund will allow us to produce a prototype self steered antenna, that will operate with the Inmarsat BGAN system. It will allow a user to &quot;switch on and surf&quot; with a simple, lightweight user terminal, that will find and track the satellite, even in on moving vehicle. The resultant prototype will be simple enough to enter the market at reasonable cost, opening up many markets for truly worldwide satellite broadband. During the project our in house commercialisation team will run a targeted marketing campaign to highlight this massive opportunity to potential licensees of the technology, and work closely with the companies and service providers, who are already partnering with us in the project, to ensure the resulting solution fits market needs","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J013897/1","grantId":"EP/J013897/1","fundValue":"164629","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Major potential to influence penetration of satellite user terminals into non specialised markets . Exisisting systems are based on reflector type antennas and the specifications for thier set up by non-trained users is difficult to achieve. Flish a self steered phased array type antenna mitigates these difficulties. Deployment will allow more widespread use, and easier type approval of steerable satellite user terminals.\n\nBeneficiaries: Anyone requiring broadband data from difficult locations or when operating from a mobile environment.\n\nContribution Method: Opens access for the first time for a simple satellite terminal which requires no user intervenation during its set up.
