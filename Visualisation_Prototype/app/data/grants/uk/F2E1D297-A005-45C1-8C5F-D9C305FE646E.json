{"id":"F2E1D297-A005-45C1-8C5F-D9C305FE646E","title":"Collaborative Housing and Community Resilience","abstractText":"The proposed seminar series critically examines the emergence of a variety of collaborative and cooperative housing projects in the UK, noting the relevance of cohousing as a concept that combines protected elements of household privacy within a self-governing cluster of (20-30) households sharing outdoor space and communal facilities. The cohousing approach is collaborative because it embeds self-managed governance structures (such as co-production of building and landscape design) in the life of the community in a deliberate attempt to increase purposeful interaction between resident members to improve quality of life. While existing literature documents a rich history of radical experiments in communality, as well as enduring attempts by town planners to engineer social interaction between neighbours, the UK lags behind Continental Europe and North America in terms of completed housing schemes that reflect a culture and politics of everyday practices of sharing. This picture has changed dramatically since 2007 when the UK Cohousing Network began as an umbrella organisation for established and forming cohousing groups. Today there are 50 developing cohousing groups in the UK, an 80 percent increase in two years. A further 15 groups are recently established. Significantly, growing interest in approaches to community living and cooperative ownership and management of neighbourhoods is not confined to the grassroots. Mainstream media coverage lists cohousing among the 'top ten' solutions to the UK housing crisis and the language of government policy increasingly positions community-led housing development as a civil society self help response to loneliness, ageing with choice, and as an effective scale of influence for carbon-reduction and technology adoption. \n\nIn the proposal we stress the need to look beyond the confines of the home and the household in order to understand the positive contribution of a collaborative scale of congregated housing with social mechanisms for collective decision-making in carbon reduction behaviour, green technology adoption and community resilience. We stress the need to conceptualise resilience not only in terms of material and technological efforts to tackle housing and environmental vulnerability, but also human capacities for organising and living collectively. Tackling the combined challenge of housing affordability and sustainability requires not only methods of collaboration between civil society, third sector and state agencies, but also integrated and broader scale analsysis of community engagement and practice. The seminar series will explore complex and diverse ways of thinking through collaboration, resilience, affordability and ecological citizenship and bring this theorising to bear on everyday dilemmas facing diverse demographic groups.\n\nThe proposal would see the formation of a new interdisciplinary network that will strengthen links between UK and international cohousing networks and make possible new constellations of collaboration at the intersections of housing access and affordability, green technology, ecological citizenship and community resilience. Through a series of six events, including visits to iconic collaborative housing projects, the network will exchange knowledge and understanding on cutting edge comparative research and practice; it will develop a frame of reference for terminology and concepts to be used in multi-media published outputs. Each seminar draws on a suite of national and international reference projects that will help translate community-led housing into tangible evidence: this aspiration to 'mainstream' collaborative housing is shared by politicians, municipal authorities, third sector organisations, many academics and activists. The proposal benefits from the PI's proven track record in delivering two successful seminar series': Time-Space and Life-Course, and Working Class Lives, Geographies and Sociologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M002012/1","grantId":"ES/M002012/1","fundValue":"27351","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-11-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Clare Jarvis","coPersons":["Fionn  Stevenson","Melissa  Fernandez Arrigoitia","Lucinda  Sargisson","Dermot  O' Reilly","Jo  Gooding","Paul  Chatterton"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
