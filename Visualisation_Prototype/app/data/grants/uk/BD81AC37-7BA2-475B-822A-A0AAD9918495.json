{"id":"BD81AC37-7BA2-475B-822A-A0AAD9918495","title":"Know your place, Know Your Bristol","abstractText":"A programme of work will be undertaken involving collaboration between University of Bristol researchers (including students), the University's Centre for Public Engagement, and community groups in Bristol, focusing on the running of 6 'Roadshows'. These events will focus on different communities or localities, and will also involve different types of community heritage (e.g. memory, historical artifacts, photographs, film). They will include geographical communities (e.g. Hillfields, an inter-war Bristol housing estate), as well as more 'virtual' ones (eg visitors to the Bristol Zoological Gardens). The aim is to make academic research and expertise available through collaboration with local community partners, to aid the production of local knowledge for preservation by community groups, the Bristol City Council 'Know Your Place' project, and for researchers. The events will explore the potential for future programmes of interaction, and development of HLF and other funding bids, and underpin development of sustainable partnerships. They will be recorded through blogging and other social media, as well as through digital media, and the project website will develop a resource-bank outlining how arts and humanities researchers at Bristol can aid, as well as learn from, a wide variety of different local community groups.\n\nBristol City Council's 'Know Your Place' project has created an open-access interactive map website covering Bristol: layers of historic maps are overlayed on the modern map of the city, allowing users to explore the historic landscape underneath their feet, and the evolution of their localities. The project aims to capture additional user-generated data -- photographs, film, documents, recorded oral testimony, and proactively sought out university researchers to help it develop a strategy with which to achieve this. By collaborating with the Bristol City Council team, arts and humanities researchers will be able to help feed material towards this recourse, and will be facilitated in establishing and consolidating relationships with and between community groups, including newly-established ones such as Kings Weston Action Group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013323/1","grantId":"AH/J013323/1","fundValue":"19800","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Bickers","coPersons":["Mark  Horton","Josie  McLellan","Timothy  Cole","Mike C Fraser","Angela Ann Piccini","Peter  Coates"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
