Defects in adrenal differentiation can be lethal if left untreated. Relatively few transcription factors have been identified to be important in adrenal development and function. The transcriptional coactivator CITED2 has been implicated in the development of the mammalian embryo in various tissues. Mice deficient for Cited2 show absence of adrenal development. The aim of this project is to determine the role of this factor in adrenal differentiation and to establish the molecular and cellular pathways that it regulates within this tissue. These studies will provide insight into the process of mammalian adrenal development and will allow us to further understand the basis for deficiencies in adrenal development in man. Members of the CITED family have been implicated in carcinogenesis through their role in the regulation of cell proliferation and control of hypoxia inducible pathways such as angiogenesis. Therefore we propose to investigate if CITED2 has a role in adrenal cortical tumour formation in humans. Tumours of the adrenal cortex are relatively common and mostly benign. However, a proportion gives rise to malignant adrenal carcinomas that have extremely poor prognosis. Given that developmental pathways are often implicated in carcinogenesis, we will analyse the pathways that we have identified to be activated by CITED2 in embryonic adrenal differentiation in the adrenal tumours. The aim of these studies is to provide diagnostic markers that may help the treatment of this disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401179","grantId":"G0401179","fundValue":"231123","fundStart":"2005-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Amanda  Swain","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
