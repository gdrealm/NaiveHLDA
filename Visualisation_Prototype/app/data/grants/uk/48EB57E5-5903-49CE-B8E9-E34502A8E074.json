Which parts of our brain are involved in how we see, to some extent depends on what we are going to do with the information (move one s eyes, head, point etc). How we view a scene also changes with expectations and expertise and this work will establish how our brians build up an expectation to make predctions about the world. As part of the deveopment of my reserach it will build on taking laboratory findings to real world situations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700929","grantId":"G0700929","fundValue":"966994","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  Walsh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
