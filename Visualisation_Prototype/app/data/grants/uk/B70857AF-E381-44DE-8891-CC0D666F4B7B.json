{"id":"B70857AF-E381-44DE-8891-CC0D666F4B7B","title":"Cuckoo host interactions: co-evolution and learning","abstractText":"In Nature, conflicts between species often involve evolutionary arms races, eg. improvements in strategies of attack by predators/parasites lead to improvements in defence by prey/hosts, leading to further predator/parasite improvements, and so on. Interactions between the cuckoo Cuculus canorus and its hosts provide a good subject for studying this process. The cuckoo is a famous cheat: it relies on other bird species (hosts) to raise its young. It lays just one egg per host nest. If the hosts accept this, eleven days later the cuckoo chick hatches first. Just a few hours old, it then ejects the host's eggs, balancing them on its back, one by one, and heaving them over the nest rim. Not surprisingly, hosts have evolved defences. One is to eject eggs unlike their own. In response, the cuckoo has evolved into genetically-distinct races, each specialising on one host species and laying eggs just like its host eggs, which the hosts are less likely to notice. Another is to attack adult cuckoos and increase the likelihood of rejecting eggs if they see a cuckoo on their nest (and so are more certain of parasitism). In response, the cuckoo has evolved rapid laying (c. 10 seconds) to decrease the chance it alerts the host. Although the arms race has led to genetic changes in cuckoos and hosts, individuals are also likely to improve their success through learning. The aim is to examine a case of learning on each side. (a) Learning by hosts: Hosts readily approach and attack adult cuckoos, in marked contrast to their wariness of dangerous enemies, such as sparrowhawks. How do hosts come to recognise the cuckoo as a nest enemy? Previous studies show that host populations isolated from cuckoos still reject eggs unlike their own, but have a much weaker response to cuckoo mounts on their nest and this does not stimulate increased egg rejection as it does in parasitised populations. These results suggest that unparasitised host populations may simply not recognise the adult cuckoo as an enemy because they haven't had the chance to learn this. We will do experiments with presentations of mounts of various enemies to colour-ringed, known-aged, reed warblers (a favourite cuckoo host) to test the following: what features of a potential nest enemy induce mobbing; whether mobbing calls attract neighbours; whether this experience leads naive birds to increase their mobbing and egg rejection when they encounter the same enemy on their own territory; whether hosts are predisposed to react aggressively to cuckoos, or whether they can be tricked into learning that a novel, but harmless, bird is a nest enemy; whether social learning can transmit enemy recognition along a chain of host territories. (b) Learning by cuckoos: We have discovered that not only have cuckoos evolved a 'well-matched egg' for their particular host species, but also a 'well-tuned' chick. Nestling cuckoos raised by reed warblers have different begging calls from those raised by dunnocks. Experiments show that young cuckoos change their tune appropriately when swapped between host nests, so they must somehow learn, through experience, how best to beg. We will study the begging calls from hatching to test whether cuckoos try out different calls and learn, by trial and error, which to use. We will also do experiments in which we broadcast various cuckoo begging calls to different host species to test whether the calls chosen by the cuckoos are the ones which are most effective in stimulating their particular hosts to feed them. This study of how both hosts and cuckoos fine-tune their responses by learning will help us to understand how rapidly enemies can adapt to environmental changes. In future, we hope to incorporate the effects of learning on the course of cuckoo-host co-evolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D001439/1","grantId":"NE/D001439/1","fundValue":"154084","fundStart":"2006-04-24","fundEnd":"2009-10-23","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our results were included in a BBC Radio 4 program and a BBC TV program narrated by David Attenborough.

Cuckoo-host interactions provide a model system for studying such reciprocal co-evolution. Previous research has shown that hosts have evolved changes in egg appearance and rejection of foreign eggs in response to cuckoo parasitism. Cuckoos, in turn, have evolved host-egg mimicry as a counter- response.\n\n This project has revealed that hosts also have an effective front-line of defence which protects their nest from being parasitised in the first place. Field experiments with model cuckoos showed that reed warblers who mobbed cuckoos most strongly were less likely to have their nest parasitised. Furthermore, mobbing of cuckoos is modified strategically according to local parasitism risk; reed warblers breeding at higher risk sites (closer to cuckoo surveillance perches, and earlier in the breeding season) mobbed cuckoos more strongly. By comparing reed warbler responses to other enemies (sparrowhawks) and harmless controls, we showed that this plasticity in mobbing response with parasitism risk was specific to cuckoos.\n\n Comparative analysis of plumage of all 141 species of cuckoos (family Cuculidae) showed that parasitic cuckoos are more likely to have hawk-like underpart barring. Field experiments involving plumage manipulations of taxidermic mounts revealed that hosts were more wary of cuckoos with underpart barring and more likely to approach and attack cuckoos with unbarred underparts. In particular, first-year reed warblers were more likely to be afraid of cuckoos. We suggest that hawk-mimicry has evolved in parasitic cuckoos to reduce host attacks, and so thwart the host's front-line of defence.\n\n A field experiment showed that naive reed warblers could acquire increased mobbing of cuckoos by social learning from experienced neighbours. Social learning enables host populations to rapidly increase their defences and to track fine-scale spatial and temporal variation in parasitism. This has the potential to influence both the coevolutionary interactions and population dynamics of cuckoos and hosts. Cuckoos are perhaps the most notorious cheats in Nature. We hope our results showing how hosts defend themselves, and how cuckoos have evolved tricks to slip through host defences, will be of wide interest. The results will be of interest to scientists who study co-evolution and show the potential for organisms to adapt rapidly to a changing world. Our studies reveal which habitats are best for cuckoos and have the potential to influence management plans (cuckoos have declined alarmingly in recent decades). Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
