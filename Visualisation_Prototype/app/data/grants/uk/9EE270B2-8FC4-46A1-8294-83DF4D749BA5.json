Increased atmospheric CO2 is leading to an increase in sea surface temperature (0.6C in the past 100 years) and is causing an expansion and dilution of the oceans due to increased rainfall and input of melt water from terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets. In addition, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the CO2 produced by humans since pre-industrial times. The resulting reductions in ocean pH, otherwise known as Ocean Acidification (OA) and carbonate concentrations are causing some alarm, as many marine invertebrates such as corals, echinoderms and molluscs depend on seawater carbonate sources to calcify their external shells and skeletons. Moreover, these groups are largely intolerant of environmental stress and are limited in their abilities to adjust to change. As a result they are considered to be the most sensitive to the climate-related changes expected in the oceans. Currently there is a real concern that many of these species will experience population declines and may even become extinct. This would lead to irreversible changes in the ecology of marine ecosystems by influencing community interactions and community structure. \n\nMore recently, however, it has become apparent that taxa and species normally expected to be more tolerant of the projected changes may also be under threat. This realisation has come about because of recent examination of longer term responses to OA (weeks to months) in response to multiple variables i.e. usually OA plus temperature. It is now appears that organisms that are able to compensate physiologically and buffer the changes caused by environmental disruption, may be indirectly impacted by these environmental changes because such adjustments are ultimately energetically expensive. Currently, it is unknown what will happen to these organisms over time because the energy required for compensation could be diverted away from other vital processes such as immune function and growth, leading to increased susceptibilities to disease and a reduction in growth rates. The present project aims to establish links between compensatory capacities, energy use and performance in 2 species of brachyuran crabs with differing abilities to compensate for change. First year juvenile crabs from an ecologically important and highly invasive species outside of Europe, Carcinus maenas, and a commercially important species, Cancer pagurus, will be exposed to elevated pCO2 (0.08 kPa - levels predicted by 2100) and reduced salinity (~80%) for up to 18 months. The key physiological questions are whether the 2 species will be able to adjust their physiology to continue to function optimally, and whether these adjustments are metabolically costly and can be maintained over time. The key ecological questions will be whether these costly changes compromise individual fitness and performance with the potential to compromise population size. A project studentship will run in parallel to the main project and allow us to investigate the effects of high pCO2 and low salinity on the more vulnerable larval stages of three species of brachyuran crabs, C. maenas, C. pagurus and Necora puber. The studentship will investigate changes in larval development and performance which could impact larval recruitment, and will therefore identify potential population bottlenecks. \n\nThis proposal represents the results of an on-going collaboration between researchers at Bangor and Southampton. These research teams are involved in a number of national and international OA research projects, but have identified that our limited understanding of the interaction of pCO2 and salinity, plus the lack of information on the responses of marine crustaceans to OA, is a weakness of existing research effort.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J007544/1","grantId":"NE/J007544/1","fundValue":"374702","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Nia Mererid Whiteley","coPersons":["Jose Luis Gimenez","Shelagh  Malham","Ian  McCarthy"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
