{"id":"BEE32E52-890B-4ABD-959B-C37F140D4F4C","title":"NSF: Quantum Frustration","abstractText":"The new generation if electronic devices requires control if electronic properties in the atomic scale. There is particular interest in magnetic materials fir magnetic electronics ( spintrinics ) applications. Some magnetic materials have the property if frustration : this combines with quantum mechanical effects ti produce new and useful properties that can potentially be employed in the spintrinics industry. This project aims ti understand how this quantum frustration occurs by doing experiments on carefully chosen materials, each designed ti isolate a particular aspect of quantum frustration. The experiments include neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, magnetization and electrical conductance measurements between 0.05 K and room temperature, and under applied pressure. The investigation team in the UK involves both physicists and chemists: they will also collaborate with leading physicists and chemists in the USA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C534654/1","grantId":"EP/C534654/1","fundValue":"533578","fundStart":"2006-02-06","fundEnd":"2009-11-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our research was fundamental and has opened up research areas based on quantum phenomena in condensed matter and in the study of effective magnetic monopoles Electronics Societal","person":"Andrew  Wills","coPersons":["Steven  Bramwell","Desmond Francis McMorrow","Gabriel  Aeppli"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The aim of the project was to pioneer experimental studies of the effect of geometrical frustration in the quantum limit. Achievements of the project have included many key measurements of important magnetic materials, and notably the first experimental observation of the effective monopoles in spin ice. An achievement that has produced extensive media coverage and been used as a vehicle for the public understanding of science We have continued fundamental work into the properties of frustrated magnets and continually learn more about these exotic quantum states. Our findings will be relevant to the application of quantum electronic phenomena for electronics. There is particular interest in the fabrication and study of thin films that may become the basis for new electronic devices.
