With the explosive growth of internet usage and multimedia services, the demand for higher data rate wireless communication systems is soaring. However, conventional single antenna systems are reaching the limit and cannot satisfy this need. By using multiple transmit and receive antennas, MIMO Layered Space-Time (LST) systems exploit the additional spatial resource and can reach far beyond the limit of single antenna system. This technology, however, requires the number of receive antennas at least as many as the number of transmit antennas. Being limited in size at the mobile unit, such a requirement cannot be met easily and hinders the maturity of this promising technology. This project aims at reducing this stringent requirement by exploring the novel idea of virtual receive antennas. The signals from these virtual antennas are created by using some signal processing techniques on the actual received signals. The result of this research will allow feasible implementation and wider dissemination of the MIMO LST technology. This idea will be thoroughly investigated for different channel environments. The receiver architecture will be developed and its performance will be obtained by computer simulation. Preliminary study on practical implementation will also be conducted to allow further exploitation of this new idea in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D037425/1","grantId":"EP/D037425/1","fundValue":"126210","fundStart":"2006-05-02","fundEnd":"2008-11-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our work has been cited by our researchers in the area of overloaded (or under-determined) MIMO systems.

For MIMO layered space time system, a requirement is that the number of transmit antennas must not be larger than the total number of receive antennas. However, this is too stringent especially for downlink communication. This project fully developed the concept of virtual receive antenna to solve this problem. The scheme made use of transmission timing offset and receiver oversampling to create the virtual antennas, and thus create enough signal dimension to detect the multiple signals. Theoretical analysis has also be performed and shown to match the simulation results. This concept is also applied to OFDM transmission and also shown to be feasible. The proposed scheme can therefore be applied in overloaded MIMO system. If exploited, this work can allow high data rate downlink communication without the need of large number of receive antennas on the mobile. This will allow mobile device with smaller form factor.
