This is particularly\nimportant in rapidly developing markets where product legislation is loose or non-existent (e.g. personal protective\nequipment (PPE)), as opposed to more mature markets where legislation is clearly defined and methodologies are well\nestablished. Whilst the automotive industry has lead the way in the uptake and application of CAE simulation tools, other\nsectors where product performance requirements are more fluid and cost implications of physical testing are less significant have been far slower to embrace the concept of simulation and as a result many UK businesses are missing out on\nopportunities to accelerate NPD and jump ahead of global competition.\nIn order to improve simulation accuracy, this project will exploit recent developments in geometrical data processing to\nconvert large, high accuracy 3D data sets (typically from laser or CT scans) into a size and format compatible with the\nlatest impact simulation software. Innovative methods for building this data into transient models to optimise accuracy and\nrobustness of results will then be developed.\nFurthermore, new solutions for visualising and interacting with simulation and physical test data will be developed, using\nstate-of-the-art immersive 3D technologies, facilitating the communication and understanding of results beyond the data\nanalysts, to designers, managers and customers alike.\nThe objectives of the project are fundamental to business growth and competitive advantage for the lead partner, Simpact,\nwhilst Aegis, the end user partner, is keen to exploit the potential of CAE to enable faster, more efficient innovation in the\ndevelopment of PPE products. The project will lead to major advances in the reliability and usability of CAE for impact\nsimulation, creating a significant step change in PPE NPD, with potential to be exploited further across Simpact's HVM\ncustomer base.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J50175X/1","grantId":"EP/J50175X/1","fundValue":"133254","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Antony Williams","coPersons":["Alexander Neale Attridge"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
