Cross-age peer tutoring consists of student partnerships in which an upper primary pupil is trained to work with a younger child to conduct structured reading sessions. International research suggests it is one of the most powerful and cost-effective methods for raising achievement. Evidence from Kenya is also emerging showing that the use of a freely available multi-media software programmes known as ABRACADABRA (ABRA) can significantly raise attainment in reading comprehension. However, while there is ample robust research on the positive effects of peer tutoring and use of multi-media software including ABRA for teaching literacy in high-income countries, evidence about its effectiveness in low income countries is in need of further research.\n\nBecause of the impoverished environment found in many Kenyan classrooms, interventions that require additional infrastructure or learning resources, or extra work from the teacher, often encounter strong resistance. Therefore the cross-age peer tutoring programme will be designed to reflect local realities with regard to teacher training, class sizes, learning resources, and school infrastructure, and to fit in with the Kenyan national curriculum guidelines for the teaching of reading. Because most Kenyan schools do not have a wealth of reading resources at their disposal, the peer tutoring intervention will use both printed children's books and online texts from the ABRA programme and a free, printable digital library to enhance children's reading.\n\nBy providing school-based in-service education and training to teachers, the project will explore to what extent cross-age peer tutoring, with and without the support of the ABRA literacy software, can help them cope with the range of challenges they face in the Kenyan primary classroom. We believe this programme has the potential for transformative impact for improving children's reading because it makes effective use of 'resources' that already exist in the school, that is the children themselves. Effective peer tutoring can change children's perceptions of themselves, empowering them as facilitators of learning. It will also be cost effective and sustainable because it uses materials that are freely available, and can be printed locally. Once students are trained as peer tutors in a school, a core of expertise is established which can be drawn upon in future years.\n\nThe study will provide evidence as to whether the development and scaling-up of cross-age peer tutoring in cultural contexts like Kenya supported, where possible, by multi-media literacy software is feasible, cost effective and results in substantive learning gains in reading. During the first year of the study we will conduct a pilot study of the project, make adaptations based on the pilot, and then in the second year conduct a large-scale randomised evaluation of the cross-age tutoring, with and without the support of the ABRA early literacy software programme. After the trial is finished, teachers in the control schools will be taught how to implement both cross-age peer tutoring and ABRA and be given the training and support materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M005380/1","grantId":"ES/M005380/1","fundValue":"438303","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Hardman","coPersons":["Philip C.
