{"id":"9EF3C9D6-26FC-4EC2-9C74-68B15EA32834","title":"Modelling the path to better soil-applied pesticides","abstractText":"Many pesticides are soil applied, including residual herbicides, soil insecticides and seed treatments incorporating fungicides and/or insecticides. They are under intense regulatory pressure with regard to water contamination, and continue to be lost from the market as a result. Simulation models are the primary basis for regulating pesticides against EU ground- and surface-water protection standards. Since these models are one-dimensional, they cannot explicitly represent plants or their roots, or the effects of formulations and formulation placement strategies. Other models exist that represent individual components of the system is a more satisfactory way. This project will create a conceptual framework for representing local pesticide concentrations in the whole soil-plant system, and will use it to produce a spatially-competent simulation model, that integrates existing knowledge. Advanced formulations and placement strategies offer the prospect of reduced off-target movement. The new model will for the first time enable their environmental benefit to be quantified in a cost-effective way. This offers the prospect of being able to gain credit in the regulatory approval process for these technologies, offsetting the negative economic effects of evolving regulation. In combination with existing empirical approaches, the new model will also deliver quantitative understanding of pesticide efficacy in the soil-plant system, enabling the rational design of new active ingredients and formulations. In short, the project will enable efficacy and environmental protection to be optimised for soil-applied pesticidal products, aiding product invention and supporting regulatory approval.This project is well aligned to the competition scope. The results will enable the optimisation of efficacy and water protection at the product design stage, leading to more efficacious products that enhance crop productivity and reduce environmental impact. The project also creates a way to demonstrate the environmental benefit of advanced formulation technology and product placement strategies, and offers the prospect of gaining credit for these in the EU regulatory review process for pesticides, in which great weight is placed on pesticide fate models. Formulations and placement strategies that significantly reduce water contamination would also fit naturally into regulatory mitigation strategies, and risk management schemes at the field and watershed level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001034/1","grantId":"TS/I001034/1","fundValue":"456937","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The model has been used to explain why certain products having high activity did not work in the field and prevented a more extensive field program being used for these. Visualisation of chemical concentrations has allowed greater understanding of the issues of pesticide movement in soils than was previously possible. These have been extremely valuable. \n\nThe model is working and is having a financial impact. Follow on work is the adoption of more modelling to understand modelling capabilities and future developments to the framework that might be required. Within the regulatory arena more work on model validation is needed for adoption of this model into the regulatory framework.

The project also sought to promote to a wider scientific and regulatory audience in order that it may be considered as a future model used in pesticide regulation. \n\nThe project has delivered the model that has been parameterised to simulate spring/winter wheat growth and maize growth under European conditions. The model has already been used to evaluate different seed release characteristics and elucidate findings from field trials. Presentations at several international scientific conferences has publicised the model, although it is too early to get the model established in the regulatory framework for pesticides. \n\nThe major impact of the project has been the adoption of the model as a means for rational design of pesticide release technology within Syngenta. In summary therefore the project goals have been achieved and exceeded in the extent to which the model has been adopted by Syngenta and has already had a financial impact. Syngenta have appointed a scientist to continue this work on this area in the UK Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
