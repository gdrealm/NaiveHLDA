{"id":"FD9060C0-3600-4AA6-9923-FC83E75A4A37","title":"Late talking toddlers: Relating phonological to lexical development","abstractText":"<p>This study will investigate the relationship of phonetic and phonological advance to lexical learning in 24 children identified at age two as late talkers (LTs), based on their limited lexicon (or vocabulary) and few attempts at combining words into sentences.&nbsp;The study&nbsp;will record the children at play with a parent monthly from age 2;6, until they produce about 25 different words in 30 minutes (‘25 word point’: 25wp). Based on transcriptions of these sessions, the extent of each child’s vocal practice, phonetic complexity, and phonological systematicity will be established and compared with that of 12 typically developing children (TDs) at their 25wp. One year after the 25wp both LTs and TDs will be recorded, with parent and with peer. </p> \n<p>The naturalistic data from these later sessions will be analyzed for lexical, phonetic, phonological and grammatical advance. In addition, at 30 and 42 months standardized tests and, at the last recording session, tests of phonological sensitivity (rhyme, alliteration, blending and elision) will be administered to all children. </p> \n<p>The primary goal of the study is to determine which aspects of phonetic or phonological advance are most critical for normal lexical and grammatical development. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1536-A","grantId":"RES-000-23-1536-A","fundValue":"278637","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marilyn  Vihman","coPersons":["Jarrad Anthony Lum"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
