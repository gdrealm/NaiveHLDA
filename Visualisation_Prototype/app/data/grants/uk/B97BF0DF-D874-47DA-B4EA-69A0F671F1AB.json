{"id":"B97BF0DF-D874-47DA-B4EA-69A0F671F1AB","title":"Rational design and molecular characterisation of novel bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors","abstractText":"Bacterial infections are a major cause of human disease. Until recently most infections were easily treated with a range of antibiotics discovered and developed during the golden age of antibiotic discovery between 1940 and 1970. However, there has now been a dramatic rise in the incidence of bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics, leading to the possibility of returning to a pre-antibiotic era when only palliative care could be administered. A disturbing feature has been the emergence of bacteria multiply resistant to antibiotics, the so-called superbugs. Two very important examples of such bacteria are methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) and multiple drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). New antibiotics are urgently required to combat these bacteria. The identification and characterisation of new inhibitors of RNAP, an essential bacterial enzyme, as proposed in this grant application, will provide new approaches to relieve the burden of disease caused by infectious drug resistant bacteria, . The newly identified inhibitors, or molecules subsequently derived from first-generation inhibitors, could become candidates for development as antibiotics. Ultimately it is hoped that new antibiotics, identified by the proposed research, will be used to treat life-threatening bacterial infections in man such as MRSA and TB. We anticipate that this will include patients suffering from these infections in the United Kingdom.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600810","grantId":"G0600810","fundValue":"703926","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Chopra","coPersons":["Alex John O'Neill","Colin  Fishwick","Simon Edward Phillips"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
