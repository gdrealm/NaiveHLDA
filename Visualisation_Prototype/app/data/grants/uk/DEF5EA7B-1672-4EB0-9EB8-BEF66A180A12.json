By investigating how this protein protects these cells, we aim to understand what role it might have in human skin cancer. \nFibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) play fundamental roles in biology, influencing how cells behave during development, maintenance and repair of the body. They act by binding to specific receptors, one of which, Fgfr2b, is the protein that has this protective role.\nMice lacking Fgfr2b in their skin cells are very susceptible to skin cancer and the aim of this project is to identify why such cells are so prone to developing into tumours. As well as being relevant to cancer research, Fgfr2b is also implicated in developmental abnormalities, thus in addition to addressing questions of fundamental biological interest, our research will address clinically significant problems.\nHopefully, as a result of these studies, new drugs might be designed to stimulate the beneficial actions of these receptors and to have an impact on cancer development in man. \nMy group consists of one post-doctoral fellow and one PhD student, and we are all interested in various aspects of Fgf biology. This project grant would fund an additional post-doctoral fellow who would be able to spend three years using our mouse model of skin cancer, together with cell culture approaches, to dissect out the mechanisms by which Fgfr2b protects cells from becoming cancerous.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601091","grantId":"G0601091","fundValue":"343675","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Grose","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
