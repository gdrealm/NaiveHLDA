Our adult constitution, including our susceptibility to common chronic diseases, depends on how our experience - in the form of nutrition and the physical and social environment - interacts with our inheritance, our individual genomes. Until recently biological inheritance was regarded as the genes and their variations ? the makeup of our DNA that we inherit from our parents. Of course, during pregnancy there is an overlap of generations in the same body, so the mother?s lifestyle can directly impact on the baby she is carrying. If she smokes, the baby ?smokes?, but that is part of Nurture (or rather poor nurturing!) not Nature or inheritance. There was no room in this view for the environmental ?exposures? that father experienced during his lifetime to be directly passed on to the next generation via his sperm. \n\nHowever, over the last few decades animal experiments have hinted at the possibility that drugs and other toxic exposures in the male might influence development in the next generation(s). Human evidence is harder to come by, but the present applicants and collaborators have already made a start by examining data from more than one generation in circumstances that represent a natural experiment. Using historical records of swings in food supply in the 1800?s in Overkalix, Northern Sweden, Bygren?s group showed that the longevity (and diabetic deaths) of people born in Overkalix around 1900 was influenced by whether their paternal grandparents experienced famine or plenty during their mid childhood. It seemed that information about the ancestral environment was being transmitted by sperm. Supporting evidence came from the applicants? study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). If the study father started smoking before 11 years his future sons would have a greater body mass index.\n\nThe present research exploits the unrivaled collection of data on the ALSPAC participants during development and records on their parents to further characterise these transgenerational responses. We will look at the effect of the study parents being exposed as a fetus (via maternal smoking) on the growth and development of the study participants. In line with animal research we will also look at the impact of emotionally traumatic events (e.g. death of a parent) during the childhood of the study parents on the psychological and physical development of the next generation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100226","grantId":"G1100226","fundValue":"178042","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean  Golding","coPersons":["George  DaveySmith","Kate  Northstone","Marcus  Pembrey"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
