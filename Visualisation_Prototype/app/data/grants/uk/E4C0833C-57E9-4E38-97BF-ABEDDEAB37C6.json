{"id":"E4C0833C-57E9-4E38-97BF-ABEDDEAB37C6","title":"Quantum Mathematics and Computation","abstractText":"The Centre for Quantum Mathematics and Computation will integrate expertise in the Oxford Computer Science and Mathematics departments to tackle the fundamental problem of understanding the mathematical and computational nature of quantum phenomena. Through a distributed research agenda, we will develop a new geometrical language unifying diagrammatic methods in algebraic topology and quantum representation theory with graphical techniques from quantum computation, computational linguistics, and software and hardware design. This language will natively encode the fundamentally continuous, topological nature of the structures arising in these areas, enabling unprecedented advances of both a theoretical and practical kind.\n\nThis research effort will be organised into four cross-disciplinary strands, and the research projects of the Centre will address such fundamental problems as the flow of information in quantum protocols, the design of natural language processing platforms, the automated analysis of large unstructured data sets, and the classification of quantum field theories. The resulting integration of knowledge and methods has the potential to transform the practice of computer science and mathematics.\n\nThis ambitious, integrated research agenda will be achieved by uniting a robust group of researchers spanning the disciplines of the Centre, and by enabling its members to actively engage with the broader scientific community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K015478/1","grantId":"EP/K015478/1","fundValue":"935304","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2016-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Samson  Abramsky","coPersons":["Bob  Coecke","Christopher  Douglas","Yakov  Kremnizer"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
