This is associated with so-called epigenetic changes ? structural modifications to DNA that alter the activity of genes without altering the genes themselves. These epigenetic changes are dynamic and reversible but can also result in stable alterations. For example, animal studies have shown that maternal care can modulate the activity of stress-related genes and thus influence the resilience of adult animals to stressful life events. Thus, epigenetics provides a bridge between the genes and the environment, refining neural networks according to experience.\nPain, whether caused through injury, disease or surgery, is usually temporary and serves to protect the body from further injury. As the body heals the pain diminishes and finally disappears. However, in some cases, pain persists and becomes a chronic pain state. Chronic pain is an area of an immense unmet medical need with 19% of adult Europeans suffering from chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity. New and improved treatments are required for these patients as only around one half receive adequate pain management. To develop these treatments we need a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the pain that persists after the injury has healed. Could these mechanisms be related to epigenetic processes? I will use my knowledge of pain mechanisms to ask how epigenetic events contribute to the establishment of persistent pain states and more generally modify the plasticity of the nervous system. This proposal will tell us a great deal about the way epigenetic regulators work and how the nervous system adapts to injury. \nBy reaching sufficient understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms we will gain insight into the way persistent pain states develop. With this knowledge we will design new and specific pharmacological tools for the treatment of chronic pain. This study will also inform other research on mental retardation and neuropsychiatric disorders since deregulation of epigenetic processes has been associated with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100577","grantId":"G1100577","fundValue":"472543","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandrine Martine Geranton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
