{"id":"A174CF76-5332-44AD-94CA-4EDAD4D13BDC","title":"South East Regional e-Research Consortium","abstractText":"This platform grant proposal seeks to gain support for the next five years to continue the developments of the Oxford e-Research Centre, and to create a stronger regional program of activities by building further on existing collaborations between Oxford, Reading and Southampton Universities and the STFC e-Science Centre at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Each of the three University sites has acted as an e-Science regional centre; each has unique capabilities that are complementary and that will bring benefit to the partner sites. We believe that this is a unique opportunity to bring together three leading research centres, to create an exciting new capability, to allow application teams across the sites and with complementary technical skills to come together in ways which we otherwise could not do. There is potential for substantial added value through the consortium and clear near term and long term benefits for enhancing collaborative e-Research throughout the region. Our aim in the near term is to address shared application areas, Climate, Archaeology, and Quantitative Biology and Chemistry, embedding through light-weight tools and from lessons learned at each site, and to support the steady expansion into new communities. In brief, the Platform grant will allow the existing communities at each of the Universities to be better served, and provide a critical mass of experts capable of widening community adoption in particular through the involvement of the STFC. Lead by Oxford University this consortium will truly be a regional e-Research centre that brings benefits to each of the individual Universities and can underpin a more ambitious regional engagement effort. We believe that this platform grant will allow the continued development of the partner Centres individually, but more importantly will provide the basis for a substantial high profile regional effort.The funding will be used to retain key personnel at the University Centres, to enable new collaborations at the regional level, and to support research and development in new technologies. We aim to keep some flexibility over the period of the grant, using the funds to allow the continuation of activities and leveraging other research support funds. The people funded by this proposal will work directly with application researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F05811X/1","grantId":"EP/F05811X/1","fundValue":"1419320","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne Elizabeth Trefethen","coPersons":["Jonathan David Blower","David  De Roure","David  Wallom","Jeremy Graham Frey","Keith  Haines"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
