Glucocorticoids are also produced naturally by the body, in both active (cortisol) and inactive (cortisone) forms, which help to control inflammation. The inactive cortisone is converted to active cortisol by an enzyme, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), which thus acts to amplify active steroid levels in specific tissues. Levels of 11beta-HSD1 are rapidly increased in inflamed tissues, where it may promote the successful resolution of inflammation by increasing ?local? glucocorticoid action. This suggests that 11beta-HSD1 is anti-inflammatory. We have shown that mice lacking 11beta-HSD1 have an exaggerated (more severe and earlier onset) inflammatory response. We now aim to identify the cells responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of 11beta-HSD1 and determine the mechanism by which it exerts these important effects. The results will be of potential therapeutic importance to target anti-inflammatory treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800235","grantId":"G0800235","fundValue":"477103","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Chapman","coPersons":["Jonathan  Seckl","John  Savill","Mohini  Gray"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
