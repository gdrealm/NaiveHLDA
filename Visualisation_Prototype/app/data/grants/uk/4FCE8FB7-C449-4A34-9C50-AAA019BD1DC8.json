In many neurological diseases myelin is lost and nerve fibres cannot conduct impulses properly, and may even die. Just as a skin wound can heal, myelin injuries can be healed spontaneously by stem cells present in the CNS. However, this repair process, called remyelination, often fails. Scientists are therefore studying how CNS stem cells can be encouraged to heal myelin injury more efficiently. In this project we will determine the role of two distinct CNS stem cells that we have recently identified in remyelination.\n\nWhen myelin is first produced in the developing brain the process is influenced by small molecules released from neurons, called neurotransmitters. However, it is unknown whether these neurotransmitters can influence remyelination. In this project we will study how remyelination by one or both types of stem cell is regulated by neurotransmitters. The results of this project will help in devising new remyelination therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701476","grantId":"G0701476","fundValue":"480384","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-05-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ragnhildur Thora Karadottir","coPersons":["Robin James Franklin"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
