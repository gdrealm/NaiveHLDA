During tumorigenesis, disruption of cell-cell adhesion is a key event for cell detachment from solid tumours and metastasis. We found that increased activity of Rac, a signalling protein, leads to a rapid destabilization of cell-cell contacts and increased migration and invasion of cells. Similar Rac hyper-activity is found in many different types of tumours and participate in malignant transformation. Here we propose to identify regulatory molecules that are recruited by Rac to help perturb cell-cell contact stability and investigate their potential as therapeutic targets during tumorigenesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600791","grantId":"G0600791","fundValue":"296728","fundStart":"2007-03-21","fundEnd":"2010-03-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Vania  Braga","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
