{"id":"9FB8F5B7-F74B-4B25-8ACD-7BA2445D69E3","title":"Re-organisation of microtubule minus-ends during apico-basal epithelial polarisation and differentiation","abstractText":"Development of elongated epithelial cells such as those of the gut and kidney involves a dramatic rearrangement of tubular structures called microtubules into apico-basal bundles that run from the apex to the base of the cells. Microtubule rearrangement is likely to be dependent on a change in the distribution of molecules such ninein that anchor one end of the microtubules and organises them into specific patterns like the apico-basal bundles and this is likely to be vital for the normal function of these cells. Defects in epithelial elongation and microtubule bundle formation lead to loss of function, abnormal cell migration and cancer. How the microtubules become organised into bundles in elongating epithelial cells is not fully understood. Most of what we do know has come from investigations of columnar shaped flat sheets of cells in culture that do not have the natural tissue architecture. Importantly, we have now established a novel live three dimensional gut organoid culture system that mimics normal gut development producing mini gut-like structures with elongated epithelial cells. This system provides a powerful new way to study microtubule reorganisation during epithelial elongation and tissue development using live microscope imaging and studies that inhibit the function of potential key molecules. We have shown that ninein travels along microtubules and relocates to apical peripheral attachments where the ends of the microtubule bundle become anchored. We have also shown that elongating epithelial cells first form a radial pattern of microtubules that run from the cell centre and out to the cell periphery and that microtubule associated molecules such as CLIP-170 are important for mediating contact between the microtubules and the cell periphery. This contact is likely to be important for the relocation of ninein and therefore also for microtubule reorganisation. Ninein and CLIP170 are therefore likely to play critical roles in microtubule reorganisations and thus also in epithelial development. Studies by others have shown that ninein is important for the development of new blood vessels, neurons, skin and for stem cell determination. All in all, this points to ninein having a major role in cell and tissue development. The aims of this project are to determine the mechanisms responsible for ninein relocation and its role in microtubule reorganisation and epithelial development. Findings from this project are likely to have far-reaching implications for our understanding of cell development, stem cell fate and diseased states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J009040/1","grantId":"BB/J009040/1","fundValue":"456489","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The organoid model system has greatly benefited our ability to investigate developmental processes live in a biological system that closely mimic the in vivo gut tissue architecture and morphogenesis. \nIn addition, we have made advances in bio-imaging of proteins, delivery and expression of fluorescent tagged proteins and shRNAs.

We have also established the tools-kit needed for future further investigations.\nWe have established that EB2 helps to maintain a dynamic microtubule population which is required for microtubule reorganisation during the early stages of differentiation and that EB2 is down regulated during differentiation in cells containing distinct microtubule bundles (Goldspink et al 2013).\n We have also established that ninein is essential for apico-basal polarisation and that Clip-170 is required for its redeployment (manuscript submitted).
