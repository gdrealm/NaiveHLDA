{"id":"DA3831F5-EE68-4469-BB7A-B3FED4347499","title":"Resource recovery from wastewater with Bioelectrochemical Systems","abstractText":"Production and recovery of energy and industrial materials from novel biological sources reduces our dependency on the Earth's finitie mineral petrochemical resources and helps the UK economy to become a low carbon economy. Recovering energy and valuable resources such as metals from waste materials is an attractive but challenging prospect. The valuable materials are usually present in wastes at very low levels and present as a highly complex mixture. This makes it very difficult to concentrate and purify them in an economically sustainable manner.\n\nIn recent years there have been exciting advances in our understanding of ways in which microorganisms can extract the energy locked up in the organic compounds found in wastewater and in the process generate electricity. This is achieved in devices known as microbial fuel cells (MFC). In an MFC microorganisms on the anode oxidize organic compounds and in doing so generte electrons. These electrons are passed into an electrical circuit and transferred to the MFC cathode where they usually react with oxygen to form water, sustaining an electric current in the process. In theory MFC can be configured such that, rather than conversion of oxygen to water at the cathode they could convert metal ions to metals or drive the synthesis of valuable chemicals. It is our aim to develop such systems that use energy harvested from wastewater to recover metals from metal-containing wastestreams and for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, ultimately from CO2.\n\nThis project will bring together experts from academia and industry to devise ways in which this can be achieved and will form the foundation of a research programme where scientists working on fundamental research and those with the skills to translate laboratory science to industrial processes will work together to develop sustainable processes for the production of valuable resources from waste.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K015788/1","grantId":"NE/K015788/1","fundValue":"67434","fundStart":"2013-04-30","fundEnd":"2013-10-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  They have been used to develop a full research project that has now been funded.

It also funded some &quot;proof of concept&quot; studies to provide pilot data for the full proposal\n\nThe key findings from the pilot studies were that it was possible to deposit metallic copper from solution on the cathode of biological electrochemical system and that there were a number of potential routes to organic synthesis at cathodes of BES, and both electrochemical and bioelectrochemical synthesis have potential. Findings were used in a full proposal to the Resource Recovery from Waste Programme. This project has recently been funded and as just begun. Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
