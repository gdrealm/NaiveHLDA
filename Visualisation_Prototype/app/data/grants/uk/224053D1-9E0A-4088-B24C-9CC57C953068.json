While human modification of vegetation and landscapes has been underway throughout the Holocene, arguably the most significant interference with global environments has been the onset of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) over the past two centuries. However, in his 'early anthropogenic hypothesis', Ruddiman (2003) proposed that humans began modifying greenhouse gas concentrations thousands of years before the industrial era, with forest clearance and intensification of rice agriculture leading to increases in atmospheric CO2 and CH4 levels, respectively. More specifically, the concentrations of these gases show early Holocene peaks followed by declines, but the downward trend was reversed after 8 and 5 thousand years ago for CO2 and CH4, respectively. By drawing analogies with natural trends in the previous four interglacials, Ruddiman suggested that the Holocene evolution of GHG concentrations was anomalous, but differences in orbital configurations and uncertainties over their precise synchronization have underlined the limitations of such comparisons. \nMore recently, the period around 780 thousand years ago, known as Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 19 has been identified as the closest analogue to the current interglacial on the basis of the phasing of orbital parameters and overall climate evolution. As such, it provides a more appropriate testbed for evaluating the Holocene evolution of GHG and vegetation succession. However, despite this potential, MIS 19 remains substantially understudied. \nThe proposed project aims to address this imbalance by generating the most detailed record (~200-yr resolution) of vegetation and hydrological changes during MIS 19 from ODP Site 977 in the Alboran Sea, S Iberian margin and combine it with ongoing analyses of palaeoceanographic proxies from the same samples, currently underway by the Spanish Consortium GRACCIE. In recent years, the western and southern parts of the Iberian margin have emerged as critical areas for linking marine and terrestrial records directly through joint pollen and palaeoceanographic proxy analyses in the same marine archive recovered adjacent to the continent. This allows a direct comparison between ocean and terrestrial changes, bypassing timescale and correlation uncertainties. The results will establish:\n\n(1) the duration of the MIS 19 interglacial in sea surface conditions and the precise phasing with vegetation changes;\n(2) Vegetation trends during MIS 19 vis-&agrave;-vis those already observed in the region during the Holocene;\n(3) the nature of vegetation and hydrological changes during the peak in atmospheric methane concentrations at the end of MIS 19c;\n(4) the response of vegetation and impact on erosion to short-term climate variability during the intervals before and after the interglacial as well as within it.\n\nIf the MIS 19 - MIS 1 analogy is correct, these results will have implications for assessing: (i) the natural length of the current interglacial, in the absence of anthropogenic forcing; (ii) the extent to which human impact over the past millennia has overprinted natural vegetation trends in the region; (iii) the underlying causes for the Holocene evolution of methane.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I025115/1","grantId":"NE/I025115/1","fundValue":"215918","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our paper Tzedakis et al. in Nature Geoscience on the natural length of our current interglacial has been cited by the IPCC in its recent AR5 Environment ","person":"Polychronis Constantinos Tzedakis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The period around 780 thousand years ago, known as Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 19 has been identified as the closest analogue to the current interglacial on the basis of the phasing of orbital parameters and overall climate evolution.

Planktonic foraminiferal isotope analyses and sea surface temperature reconstructions have been completed and provided by the Spanish Consortium GGRACCIE. Synthesis of the results will allow us to:\n1. determine the duration of interglacial sea surface and vegetation conditions, with implications for the current interglacial length;\n2. assess the extent of anthropogenic disturbance in the region during the Holocene;\n3. examine the nature of vegetation and hydrological changes during a peak in atmospheric methane concentrations at the end of MIS 19c, with implications for the Holocene methane evolution.\n4. establish the response of vegetation and impact on erosion to short-term climate variability during the intervals before and after the interglacial as well as within it. The generated pollen dataset will be of direct interest to palaeoecologists as it provides an insight into natural vegetation changes on orbital, millennial and sub-millennial scales. However, its expected high impact lies in its combination with sediment and marine proxy data from the same sequence in the Iberian margin. The combined datasets will be of interest to both the terrestrial and marine communities, as they will deliver better constraints on links between key parameters in the climate system. In addition, the results of this project will be of interest to the ice core community as they pertain to an evaluation of the strength of the hydrological cycle at mid-to-low latitudes, which can be useful in constraining sources of atmospheric methane. \n\nUltimately, the proposed project will be of interest to the wider field of global change, because it provides a baseline for assessing natural trends and the extent of anthropogenic interference during the Holocene and can clarify our present position in the interglacial cycle.
