Yet, with hundreds, if not thousands of experiments on individual decision-making, there is almost none which examines the behaviour of collective units like the household, despite the fact that in most countries the majority of people live alongside other adults with whom they must make decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The research proposed will conduct experiments using established couples to test theories about household decision-making. The theories to be tested will be drawn from both economics and the social psychology/marketing literature.</p>\n\n<p>The major academic benefits will be</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>The opening up of a new field for investigation by experimental economics â€“ experiments on the household;<br /></li>\n\n <li>better data on household decision-making; and<br /></li>\n\n <li>clear tests of some theoretical models. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The information will be useful to economists engaged in work on consumption and labour economics, to consumer researchers and to social psychologists interested in household behaviour.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E01531X/1","grantId":"ES/E01531X/1","fundValue":"55681","fundStart":"2007-02-26","fundEnd":"2008-02-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alistair  Munro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
