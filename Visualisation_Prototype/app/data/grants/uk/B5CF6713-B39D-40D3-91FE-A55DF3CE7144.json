Low-temperature combustion prevents formation of oxides of nitrogen, but it has not been achieved in automotive and aerospace applications due to lack of understanding and predictive models. This study will probe the fundamental fluid dynamic processes which are critical to ensure stable, efficient, and clean conversion of fuel energy under such highly dilute conditions. Two complementary technological applications motivate this study. The first is application of 'split-injection' strategies, which are being investigated by partners in the automotive industry. These strategies employ large numbers of separate fuel-injection events in order precisely to control the timing and rate of heat release and pollutant formation. The second application is the injection of highly dilute reactants into a flow structure that recirculates combustion products. This process underpins low-emission aero-engine development by project partner Rolls-Royce - indeed it is fundamental to the development of combustion systems in general. High-end scientific computing methods will be employed to perform full-resolution numerical experiments, designed to explain the relationship between the fluid-, mixing-, and chemical-dynamics of split-injection. For the first time, the age concept will be used in the analysis of these experiments; the age, or residence time, of a mixture is a natural reference quantity for understanding how kinetically limited combustion processes (e.g. autoignition, highly-dilute combustion, NOx and soot-particle formation) evolve. A novel modelling framework, built on this concept of fluid age will be developed and subsequently its potential for the design of ultra-low-emission combustion systems will be demonstrated in automotive and aerospace applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L002698/1","grantId":"EP/L002698/1","fundValue":"179184","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Simon Richardson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The project has successfully delivered several new results, as well as new computational methods. First it has been shown how a technique where fuel is injected into an engine in a series of short bursts, known as 'split-injection', can be used to control mixing of fuel and air in engines. By controlling the ways that fuel and air mix, we are able to control the amount of pollutant formation. Second, we have shown that the fuel's residence time in the engine has an important effect on the combustion progress. By developing mathematical models based on the residence time of the fuel, we have developed engineering design tools for the next generation of split-injection diesel engines. The modelling approaches can be applied to diesel engine simulation and design. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
