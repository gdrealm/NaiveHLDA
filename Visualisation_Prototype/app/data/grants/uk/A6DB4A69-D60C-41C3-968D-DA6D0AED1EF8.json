The first to deal with research into the physics and engineering of the offshore wind farm. The second to look more specifically at the wind turbine, building upon the lessons of Supergen Wind 1. In the third and fourth years of the project, the results of these two Themes will feed into a third Gathering Theme, which will consider the wind farm as a power station looking at how the power station should be designed, operated and maintained for optimum reliability and what the overall economics will be.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018662/1","grantId":"EP/H018662/1","fundValue":"4834190","fundStart":"2010-03-23","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Supergen Wind 2 Work Programme has targeted offshore wind energy research challenges.

Some examples of discoveries developed through the research are:\n- IBC (Individual Blade Control) technology for extreme wind turbine blade load reduction.\n- Fibre-optic accelerometers for monitoring of electrical and mechanical degradation in wind turbine generators.\n- New controllers for increased operation flexibility of wind turbines. - DECC is providing funding to demonstrate the IBC with an OEM to enable exploitation. This technology is also being considered for tidal stream turbines.\n- Fibre-optic accelerometers are being exploited through a collaboration with QPS Photonics (Canada).\n- Wind turbine controller developments are being exploited and brought to market both through a collaboration with a wind turbine control supplier. A Horizon 2020 project has been submitted to fund the demonstration of its application to provide ancillary services, to maximise power production and reduce O&amp;amp;M costs.
