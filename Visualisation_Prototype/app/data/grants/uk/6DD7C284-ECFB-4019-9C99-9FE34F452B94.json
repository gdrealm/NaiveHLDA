New, effective treatments are needed. Developing these is slow, partly because of the blunt measurement instruments we have for assessing symptoms and outcomes. We are proposing a new approach to measuring symptoms based on collecting data on symptom severity several times a day using an adapted mobile phone. We wish to evaluate how well this works in comarison to standard methods, and how acceptable patients find it to use in everyday life. If successful, this offers a new way to evaluate treatments and outcomes, and could in the longer term be used routinely by patients, with clinical staff, monitoring their own health in the community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901434","grantId":"G0901434","fundValue":"375839","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Shon William Lewis","coPersons":["John David Ainsworth","Iain Edward Buchan","Anne  Rogers","Shitij  Kapur","Graham  Dunn","Christine  Barrowclough","Emma  Barkus","Til  Wykes"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
