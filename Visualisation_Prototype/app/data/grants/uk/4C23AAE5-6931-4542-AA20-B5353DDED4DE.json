{"id":"4C23AAE5-6931-4542-AA20-B5353DDED4DE","title":"Inducible SAA transgenic mice: a refined model of human amyloidosis","abstractText":"Amyloidosis is the name for a group of diseases caused by abnormal aggregation and build-up of certain proteins (amyloid) in various organs throughout the body. Amyloid interferes with organ function and is frequently fatal. About one in a thousand people in the UK die from generalised (systemic) amyloidosis, and a localised build-up of amyloid also occurs in some common disorders including the brain in Alzheimer?s disease and the pancreas in type II diabetes. There is presently no specific treatment for amyloidosis, although a number of drugs are in development. \n\nAbout 5% of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis develop a type of amyloid called AA amyloidosis, which causes kidney failure and often death. AA amyloidosis also occurs in wild and farmed animals that have inflammatory disorders. It is caused by the presence of very high levels of a blood protein called SAA, which accompanies inflammation. \n\nMice with inflammation develop AA amyloidosis after about two months, and the mouse model of AA amyloidosis has been studied for over 50 years. It closely resembles human amyloidosis, and remains a vital and widely used model for studying the effects of new treatments. Indeed, proof of efficacy in mouse AA amyloidosis is a necessary milestone in the development of anti-amyloid drugs, and no suitable test tube models exist. \n\nThe experimental induction of mouse AA amyloidosis requires persistent inflammation for two months or more produced by daily injections of substances that cause inflammation in the skin. This is a moderately severe procedure.\n\nIt is self-evident that daily injections of inflammatory substances for many weeks are undesirable on welfare grounds. We therefore propose to generate transgenic mice that will massively overproduce SAA when given a specific simple dietary supplement. The availability of mice in which SAA production can be increased from healthy trace levels to very high levels without the need for any inflammation should enable the induction of amyloidosis to be achieved reliably and consistently without recourse to administration of toxic inflammation-provoking substances, and will provide much new information on amyloidosis. \n\nWe hope that this project will ultimately enable the present invasive method for inducing mouse amyloidosis to be abandoned completely by colleagues throughout the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800737/1","grantId":"G0800737/1","fundValue":"302107","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-01-04","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Paul Simons","coPersons":["Philip Nigel Hawkins","Mark Brian Pepys"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
