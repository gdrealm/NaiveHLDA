{"id":"9AC7834D-1A70-4236-9353-15B51E843064","title":"Bilateral Germany: A comparison of centralized and decentralized combinatorial auctions","abstractText":"Combinatorial auctions (CAs) are multi-item auctions in which bidders can place bids on combinations of items, called ‘packages’, rather than just on individual items.&nbsp; This allows the bidders to better express their valuations for items, which can lead to increased economic efficiency or higher revenue in the presence of synergistic values, ie where a package of items is worth more to a bidder than the sum of the individual values.&nbsp; Combinatorial auctions have already found application in transportation, industrial procurement, and allocation of spectrum licenses for wireless communication services, among others.&nbsp; Almost all combinatorial auctions today are centralized designs, meaning that an auctioneer collects bids and determines prices and the winning allocation. While determination of winning bids in a standard auction is a simple problem, the problem of determining the winning bids in a combinatorial auction—called the \n<i>Winner Determination Problem</i> (WDP)—is ineluctably difficult.&nbsp; Decentralized CA designs can circumvent the WDP.&nbsp; In this project, we will compare decentralized CAs with centralized CAs.&nbsp; We aim to generate new results on the pros and cons of each of these approaches based on various bidder valuations and bidding strategies. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0821","grantId":"RES-062-23-0821","fundValue":"288125","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Steinberg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
