How it is, for example that we know what an object is when we look at it. </p>\n\n<p>To study this we will be measuring the eye movements of people under many different viewing conditions. By analysing where people look when they are viewing objects we hope to be able to better understand how our visual system functions: what kinds of information about the shapes of objects it processes and how we adapt to different viewing conditions.</p>\n\n<p>A further challenge of this project is to apply this knowledge about the human visual system to the development of more efficient artificial, computer-driven, vision systems&nbsp;- such as robotic systems. To achieve this goal, we will be developing a project dedicated website to publicise our research findings to researchers in both human and computer vision, as well as to industry, commerce and the general public. We will also be presenting the results of our work at scientific conferences in both research fields. We hope that this will stimulate future inter-disciplinary research in this area and stimulate interest from industrial and commercial partners.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2075","grantId":"RES-062-23-2075","fundValue":"542462","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project generated new empirical datasets, as well as novel methodological tools and theoretical advances in our knowledge of eye movements and object recognition in human vision. We have (to date) published 6 papers - including one paper (Davitt et al., 2014, JEP:HPP) that was selected by the American Psychological Association (APA) as an outstanding new scientific paper across ALL papers published in APA journals: \n\nhttp://charlotte.neuro.brown.edu/shared/PeePs/PeePs%20-%20Issue%2017.htm).\n\nThere are also currently 4 other papers in revision or in preparation. There were 14 conference and other presentations in the UK and abroad. The work produced a methodological breakthrough for the analysis of eye movement in 3D (stereo) environments. This technique, and associated software (Matlab) code should be of wide interest to researchers in psychology, computer vision and other applied domains.

To analyse these data we developed novel statistical geometric modelling tools (to be made freely available in Matlab code through the project website) that co-register fixation points to underlying object features (e.g., regions of surface curvature, edge density etc.) in 3D space. These techniques will permit future researchers to combine eye tracking with stereo viewing. The research data showed that human eye movement patterns during recognition are not random, but highly systematic, and driven by the spatial distributions of surface curvature, and higher-order object part structure. At the same time, we also showed how shape information is used during perception varies according to a number of task-related factors including the level of image classification required, and whether observers have been asked to identify object shape, or plan a grasping action towards it. These findings provided new constraints on models of object representation in human vision. (1) The work will inform researchers in academia and industry with interests in eye movements, object recognition, stereo vision and robotics. The project has fostered new collaboration with machine vision researchers to facilitate the exploitation of the results in computer vision environments. The project directly contributed to our involvement in the EPSRC-funded Network Award ‘Visual Image Interpretation in Man and Machine’ (2013). This is a UK-based inter-disciplinary research cluster involving several institutions including Birmingham, Oxford, UCL, Bristol, Bradford, Cardiff and Heriot Watt. \n(2) Publication of our initial findings in Leek et al (2012) initiated a venture between the research group and SBXL Ltd (http://www.sbxl.com) - a company which undertakes consumer evaluation work for retail clients. The aim is to use our knowledge of shape perception and eye tracking to optimise package shape/design, and consumer/shopper product perceptions. \n(3) We were also able to employ the new methodological techniques arising from the project to examine eye movement patterns in neurological populations suffering from disorders of visual perception and object recognition. Additional studies using these new methods will help us to further our understanding of acquired cognitive impairments in clinical populations, and potentially lead to the development of new techniques of therapeutic intervention.
