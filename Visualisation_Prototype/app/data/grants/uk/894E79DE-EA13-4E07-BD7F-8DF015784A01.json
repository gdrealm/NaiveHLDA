{"id":"894E79DE-EA13-4E07-BD7F-8DF015784A01","title":"Habitual Gait Speed: A Novel Marker of Exercise Intolerance and Prognosis in COPD","abstractText":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a very common lung disease that is usually smoking-related. People with COPD are often breathless, particularly when exerting themselves. COPD is responsible for over 25,000 deaths in the UK annually and is predicted by 2020 to be the third leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability worldwide. Currently it is very difficult to objectively assess disease severity as there are many aspects to the condition that influence patients? symptoms, some of which are not focused on the lungs. Traditionally, the amount of air you can blow out in one second (FEV1) has been used to assess severity in COPD. Regulatory authorities use an improvement in FEV1 to make decisions about the approval of new drugs for COPD. However FEV1 is relevant to only some of the processes involved and hence over-reliance on this measurement would bias against treatments where the main action is outside the lungs.\nIn healthy older people, usual walking speed predicts loss of independence, falls, nursing home admissions, dementia and death, and is very easily measured. Walking speed may slow due to lung function decline, muscle weakness, breathlessness, the presence of multiple medical problems, poor balance, low mood and cognitive decline ? all factors seen in COPD, and it may be a simple but global marker of disease progress. The proposed research study aims to assess whether usual walking speed is a useful marker of disease severity in COPD, whether it relates to measures of exercise capacity and whether it has value in predicting hospital admission and death in patients with COPD. The research should be of interest to all health care workers involved in the care of COPD patients as it will validate a simple test that could easily be introduced into clinical practice. This research should also be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry as it could help guide the development and assessment of new and more effective medicines for COPD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002113","grantId":"G1002113","fundValue":"249814","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Man","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Fdn Trust","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
