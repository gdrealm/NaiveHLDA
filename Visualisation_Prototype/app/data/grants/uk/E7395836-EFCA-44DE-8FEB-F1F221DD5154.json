{"id":"E7395836-EFCA-44DE-8FEB-F1F221DD5154","title":"An experimental evolution test of signalling theory","abstractText":"The natural world is filled with examples of signalling or communication between individuals. Males attract females with showy ornaments or repel rivals with loud roars, offspring beg from their parents, ants release chemicals to coordinate foraging behaviours and poisonous caterpillars warn their predators away with bright colours.\n\nAlthough the advantages of signalling may seem obvious, it actually poses a problem for evolutionary theory. The problem is why don't individuals lie or exaggerate, to their own benefit. For example, why don't all male peacocks signal that they are the best quality mate, or why don't all chicks signal that they are the hungriest? Put simply, what keeps signals honest? If signals were dishonest, then the best strategy would be to ignore them, and so the signalling system would be lost.\n\nEvolutionary theory has proposed a number of ways in which signals could be kept honest, and there is an excellent empirical literature on this, examining traits that range from birds tails, to facial markings in wasps, to the roars of deer, to eyespan of flies, to begging in chicks. However, the nature of working on signalling in animals limits what kinds of experiments are possible.\n\nHere we will take advantage of the fact that bacteria signal to each other, to coordinate cooperative behaviours, in order to test very general theory about how signalling will evolve. We will manipulate factors such as the extent to which honesty is favoured, block signalling, enhance signalling and then follow the evolutionary consequences. Furthermore, because we are working on bacteria, we can follow the consequences at all levels from the behaviour to the gene.\n\nOverall, our aim is to examine how the social and ecological environment influences the evolution of communication. This work is not an alternative to working on animals, but rather a complementary way to get at different aspects of the same questions.\n\nFurthermore, our work has potential medical consequences, because bacterial signalling controls the behaviours that determine how well pathogenic bacteria grow, how virulent they are in their hosts, and how well they resist antibiotics. Consequently, by examining the consequences for these pathogenic behaviours, we will also collect data that is a necessary first step in determining whether signalling can be exploited as a medical intervention strategy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J007064/1","grantId":"NE/J007064/1","fundValue":"369416","fundStart":"2012-10-08","fundEnd":"2016-04-07","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  To date I am not aware that our findings have been used.

This poses an evolutionary problem, because individuals could potentially signal dishonestly to coerce others into behaving in a way that benefits the signaller. Theory suggests that honest signalling is favoured when individuals share a common interest and signals carry reliable information. However, whilst many studies have manipulated signals, to examine how this influences behaviour, it has not been possible to directly test how the behaviour of signallers and receivers evolve in response to manipulation. Here, we exploit the opportunities offered by signalling between bacteria (‘quorum sensing’) to show that: (1) a reduced relatedness, and therefore reduced common interest between interacting individuals, leads to the relative breakdown of signalling, via both reduced signalling and a reduced response to signal; (2) signal interference selects for lower levels of signalling. More generally, whilst our results provide clear support for signalling theory, we did not find evidence for the previously predicted coercion at intermediate relatedness, suggesting that mechanistic details can alter even the qualitative nature of specific predictions. Furthermore, the populations evolved under a lower relatedness caused less mortality and damage to insect hosts, showing how signal evolution leads to strain diversity influencing the evolution of virulence in the opposite direction to that usually predicted by theory.\n\nWe have also developed an ex vivo pig lung model that can be used to grow bacterial populations in spatially structured tissue. This model will allow researchers to test how bacterial populations evolve in more realistic environments and have an impact on the NC3Rs due to a reduction in animal use. It will be a useful model to screen the effect of new antimicrobial drugs on bacteria growing in tissue. Signalling systems in bacteria (i.e.: quorum sensing) are often directly linked to the regulation of toxin production and virulence. Understanding how and why signalling systems evolve in bacteria will help us understand the biology of infection in greater detail and will potentially lead to new compounds and systems to interfere with bacterial signalling during infection. Reducing virulence would be the key aim here and such new approaches are crucial in this current era of increasing antibiotic resistance. Our experimental work studying how signalling evolves in bacteria is relevant to theory on signalling in higher organisms such as birds and mammals. Therefore our findings will be of direct interest to scientists working on signalling systems in a wide range of animals.\n\nOur ex vivo pig lung model can be used by a range of researchers working on chronic infections and who are interested in testing the efficacy of new antimicrobial compounds in spatially structured tissue.
