Identical twins share all of their genes and show striking physical resemblance, while more distant relatives tend to look less alike the less closely related they are. This variation in degree of family resemblance suggests that many genes influence physical appearance. However, few of the genes have been identified. The aim of this proposal is to identify genetic variants influencing a selection of such features: body size and shape, pigmentation (of hair, skin and eyes), facial features, type of hair, baldness and hair greying. To facilitate this task we propose to study Latin American populations which represent a mixture of different continental populations (Europeans, Native Amerindians and Africans). These continental populations have quite differentiated physical features and provide us with higher statistical power for detecting genetic effects. With independent funding we are recruiting over 7,500 Latin American research volunteers (from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Brazil) and we are characterizing their physical appearance. We record face features using photographs and specialized imaging processing techniques, skin using an instrument allowing colour measurement and the other features through physical examination. Here we request funding for the genetic analysis of this sample. Initially we propose to examine the entire human genome in 3000 individuals using about ~300,000 genetic markers. This information will be used (together with the human genome sequence) to identify regions showing association with the physical characteristics of the individuals. The regions showing association will then be examined in the rest of the Latin American cohort (an additional 4,500 individuals) and in European cohorts being studied by collaborators (comprising over 20,000 individuals). In this way we will confirm our findings. We will then use statistical techniques to evaluate if these variants can predict the physical characteristics of unknown individuals based only on a DNA sample. Identification of genes involved in physical appearance has a number of important consequences for basic biological research, such as examining the evolution of this traits and optimize their use in studies on human origins and diversification. This work will also have important biomedical implications as the genes identified could be involved in human disorders (of development pigmentation, aging and skin cancer). This work will also lay the foundation for the development of an entire new field of forensic genetics: the reconstruction of an individual's physical appearance based on a DNA sample. Finally, our proposal will inform the public about aspects of the relationship between genetics, ethnic identity and race.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I021213/1","grantId":"BB/I021213/1","fundValue":"847076","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andres  Ruiz-Linares","coPersons":["David J Balding"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
