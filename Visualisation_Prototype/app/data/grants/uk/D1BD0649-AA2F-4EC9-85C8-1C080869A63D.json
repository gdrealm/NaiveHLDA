The research will use advanced techniques of statistical analysis, such as path analysis with categorical variables and simultaneous hazard modelling.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I038187/1","grantId":"ES/I038187/1","fundValue":"520435","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Erzsebet  Bukodi","coPersons":["Heather Evelyn Joshi","John  Goldthorpe","Jouni  Kuha"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
