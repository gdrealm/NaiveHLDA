{"id":"6F30FD66-2E0E-4C85-9C98-66122BADDF0C","title":"Social learning and facial attractiveness","abstractText":"<p>To date, most studies of individual differences in face preferences have focused on the role of biological factors, such as the judge's health and hormonal condition. By contrast with these studies of biological factors that influence face preferences, this project will investigate whether social learning is also a potent source of individual differences in face preferences.</p>\n\n<p>The project will also investigate the range of circumstances under which social learning effects on face preferences occur. The project will use a paradigm developed by Jones et al. (2007, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B) to investigate whether social learning effects on face preferences only occur for social transmission of mate preferences or also occur for social transmission of attitudes during same-sex interactions. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the project will investigate whether viewers are more likely to copy the face preferences of physically attractive individuals generally or are more likely to copy the face preferences of individuals who are of similar attractiveness to themselves. These tests will offer insights into the mechanisms through which visual experience during social interactions shapes face preferences.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2498","grantId":"RES-000-22-2498","fundValue":"70264","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Observing social interactions influences attractiveness judgments of the actors involved.
