{"id":"C6EDA71F-879A-498D-9243-CB6C4F3D8781","title":"Cultural and psychosocial influences on illness and disability attributed to occupational hazards","abstractText":"The topics that we propose to research are of immediate concern to the general public. A high proportion of people have at some time suffered disability from disorders of the back or upper limb, and there is intense media interest in the health risks from technologies such as pesticides. The hypothesis that we will investigate will be unpopular with some people, who will interpret it as implying that their symptoms, which may be severely disabling, are all in their mind . In communicating our work, it will therefore be important to adopt a sensitive approach, explaining clearly what it does and does not mean. We hope that it will provide opportunities to educate journalists further in the principles of risk management, and through them, the public at large.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400490","grantId":"G0400490","fundValue":"1126750","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Coggon","coPersons":["Keith T Palmer"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
