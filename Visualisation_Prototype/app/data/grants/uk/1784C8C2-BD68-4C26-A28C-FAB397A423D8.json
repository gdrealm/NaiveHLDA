{"id":"1784C8C2-BD68-4C26-A28C-FAB397A423D8","title":"CAPP: Combining Algal and Plant Photosynthesis","abstractText":"In most plants, growth rate is limited by the rate at which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up and converted to sugars in the process of photosynthesis. The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be faster and plants would grow faster. This speeding-up of photosynthesis will happen naturally over the next fifty years or so as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise due to human activities. However, there is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in tiny green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. We have recently discovered important new information about this mechanism, and we have invented new and rapid methods to discover algal genes that contribute to it. We have two complementary and parallel aims. First, we will apply our new methods to identify all of the genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and we will discover exactly how these genes work. Second, we will transfer the most important genes into a plant, and study whether the same CCM can be recreated inside a leaf. If it can, we expect that our experimental plant will have higher rates of photosynthesis and hence a higher rate of growth than normal plants. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024453/1","grantId":"BB/I024453/1","fundValue":"313802","fundStart":"2011-10-10","fundEnd":"2014-10-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" In most plants, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the low concentrations of carbon dioxide (inorganic carbon) in the atmosphere. If the concentration of inorganic carbon inside the leaf could be elevated, rates of photosynthesis and hence plant productivity would increase. Some organisms, including green algae, possess carbon-concentrating mechanisms that allow them to accumulate high concentrations of inorganic carbon inside their cells. The aim of this project was to discover whether a carbon-concentrating mechanism could be transferred from green algae into plants, and whether this would improve photosynthesis and hence productivity. The project was a collaboration with experts in Cambridge, UK and in Stanford University, California who study photosynthesis and carbon concentrating mechanisms in green algae. \nWe successfully transferred several components of a carbon-concentrating mechanism from a green algae called Chlamydomonas into a model plant, Arabidopsis. These components include proteins called transporters that allow the movement of inorganic carbon across cell membranes. We showed where these transporters are located in the higher plant cells, and in some cases targeted them to new, more appropriate locations. We also showed that they can function correctly in Arabidopsis, and assessed their effects on the performance of the plant.\nOther components of the Chlamydomonas carbon-concentrating mechanism successfully transferred into Arabidopsis include the enzyme Rubisco, which assimilates inorganic carbon - the starting point for photosynthesis. The enzyme in Chlamydomonas has specific properties that allow it to form an efficient structure - the pyrenoid - inside the chloroplast. We showed that Rubisco from Chlamydomonas can work successfully in the Arabidopsis chloroplast, and can substitute for the Arabidopsis Rubsico. This is a starting point for development of a functional pyrenoid in the Arabidopsis chloroplast. This project creates a higher plant that contains components of a mechanism normally found only in algae, which concentrates carbon dioxide inside chloroplasts and thereby increases the rate of photosynthesis. \nAt this stage, our modified plants do not have higher rates of photosynthesis. In an extension of this project we will be adding more, newly discovered components from algae into our plant, and monitoring the effect on photosynthesis. \nThe successful introduction of a complete carbon-concentrating mechanism into a plant would have very important implications for efforts to increase crop productivity, to provide more food and renewable raw materials for the increasing global population.
