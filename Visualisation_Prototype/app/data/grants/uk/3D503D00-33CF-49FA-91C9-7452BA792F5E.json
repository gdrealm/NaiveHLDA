They have all lectured to non-specialists ranging from CEOs of leading utility companies to local school children, and at the Royal Institution to the Science Museum. In addition, for example, EF was a BA Media Fellow and worked for 8 weeks in the BBC World Service, conveying science to an international audience, and still has strong ties to the Association of British Science Writers including judging their 2003 and 2004 ABSW awards. All groups also regularly give talks to the lay public in Patients and Carers groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500288","grantId":"G0500288","fundValue":"653035","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Fisher","coPersons":["Linda  Greensmith","Majid  Hafezparast","Joanne  Martin"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
