{"id":"7B8AF1D3-477B-4A33-AC59-D878066BFBD1","title":"New Directions in Monetary and Fiscal Policy Analysis at the Macroeconomic Level","abstractText":"Recent theoretical work examining the ability of monetary and fiscal policies to stabilise economies over the business cycle suggests that monetary policy should, in the short-run, stabilise output and inflation, while fiscal policy be assigned the role of stabilising government debt. This existing work also suggests that optimal fiscal policy should not implement a target for government debt, but that debt should fluctuate in response to shocks. This is clearly at odds with the adoption of debt/deficit targets in a number of countries. This project will explore the extent to which political conflict, particularly in the setting of fiscal policy, could justify the use of debt targets.&nbsp; The remainder of the project will focus on the finding that there is a limited role for countercyclical fiscal policy unless monetary policy is constrained (eg by joining a monetary union). This project shall consider economies subject to significant additional inefficiencies which the existing theory typically ignores – for example by allowing for a link between stabilisation policy and economic growth and by considering labour market inefficiencies – and will assess whether there is a role for countercyclical fiscal policy in dealing with such distortions. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G006873/1","grantId":"ES/G006873/1","fundValue":"177903","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Campbell Blair Leith","coPersons":["Simon  Wren-Lewis"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
