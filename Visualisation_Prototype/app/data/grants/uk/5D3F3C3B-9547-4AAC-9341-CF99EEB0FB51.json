Very few people will have any natural immunity to the virus and up to half of the population could become ill with pandemic influenza at some point. \nEveryone will need to work together to reduce the spread of the virus. Although simple hygiene precautions such as hand washing will help, we do not currently know which hygiene measures are the most effective. Nor do we know enough about how influenza is spread to say for certain whether or not it will be worthwhile for members of the public to wear face masks and if so, in what circumstances. \nWe need to design new studies that will give us clear answers to these questions to help governments around the world make policy decisions based on firm evidence. We will assemble experts in influenza and infection control to look again at the existing evidence and decide upon the design of some newer studies that will answer the questions once and for all. These experts are scattered across the globe, and so we need funding to bring them together, face to face, in dedicated workshops where they can interact and design new studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701554","grantId":"G0701554","fundValue":"47023","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2008-10-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Van-Tam","coPersons":["John  Oxford","Robert  Booy","Andrew  Hayward","Carolyn  Bridges","Allison  McGeer"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
