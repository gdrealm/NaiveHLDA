{"id":"BE3AD660-EFB3-45E8-98E5-321E89BE6397","title":"Modeling of Condensed Phase Reactive Fluid Flow","abstractText":"Research in the field of condensed phase reactive flow encompasses a broad range of interests ranging from safety considerations in the chemical processing industries, to commercial mining activities and defence related research. This proposal is concerned with the establishment of a network amongst these disparate technical communities in the UK. The aims are to provide a means of developing joint research applications, providing bibliographic data support, benchmarking UK research on modelling techniques and further extending international links.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03664X/2","grantId":"EP/D03664X/2","fundValue":"55278","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Braithwaite","coPersons":["Anna Barbara Crowley"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
