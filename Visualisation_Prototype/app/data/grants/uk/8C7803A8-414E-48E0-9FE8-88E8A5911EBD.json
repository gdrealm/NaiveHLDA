This is having an impact on the culture in our area: researchers are now beginning to look at how their methods mesh with others, rather than assuming they should compete.

We did, though, discover that several existing plant root measurement systems were complimentary, and as a result designed a common formal (Root System Markup Language) for passing information between them. Other developers of image-based plant root measurement systems could adopt the RSML format and associated software tools, integrating methods across the community.
