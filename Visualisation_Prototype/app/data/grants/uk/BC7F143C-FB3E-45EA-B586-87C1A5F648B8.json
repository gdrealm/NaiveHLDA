Blood tests and scans are not usually accurate enough to confirm the presence of cancer so cells are usually obtained from the lining of a narrowed bile duct with a brush (brush cytology) to look for cancer under the microscope. Brush cytology however only detects cancer in 20-50% of cases which means that patients often have to undergo additional invasive procedures, leading to potential complications and delays in diagnosis. Better diagnostic tests are clearly needed. \n The aim of this study is to test new potential markers called minichromosome maintenance proteins (mcm 2-7) which may improve the early detection of precancerous changes and cancers involving the bile duct, and thus enhance the longevity and quality of life of patients living with pancreatic and bile duct cancer. These proteins are necessary for DNA replication which is essential for all cancer cells to multiply and grow. We have shown that the levels of these proteins are increased in a wide variety of early and advanced cancers in comparison to benign tissues, and can be used as accurate diagnostic tests for cervical, oesophageal and bladder cancer. \n We have recently completed a study of 102 patients which showed that Mcm 5 protein when detected in bile is more than three times better than brush cytology at detecting pancreatic and biliary tract cancer, with up to 80% of cancers correctly diagnosed. The accuracy if this test depends in part on how many cells there are available to test. Brush cytology contains many more cells than bile and we now have exciting early results indicating that when Mcm 5 is detected in brush cytology specimens, close to 100% of cancers may be detected. We therefore plan to confirm these results by studying this marker as part of a large multicentre study, including patients at high risk of developing pancreatic and bile duct cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801588","grantId":"G0801588","fundValue":"330873","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Paul Pereira","coPersons":["Maesha  Deheragoda","Gareth Haydn Williams","Kai  Stoeber"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
