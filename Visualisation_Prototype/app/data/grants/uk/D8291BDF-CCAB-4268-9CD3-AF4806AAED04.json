These resources may be used 'off the shelf' as a complete course in QM (and accessible as such by any UK HEI undergraduate), or individual components can be integrated into existing courses by QM teaching staff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course content will be adapted to undergraduate level by producing additional modules on sources of data, on data visualisation, and on secondary data analysis, and by adapting the course materials to a wider range of student abilities. The course will also be adapted so that it may be used with a range of statistical software.</p>\n\n<p>The use of the learning materials will be monitored, revised and reviewed in the light of teachers' and students' feedback. The maintenance of the learning resources server and links will be continued for three years. At the end of this period the materials will be collated and archived so that they continue to be available for use.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012025/1","grantId":"ES/J012025/1","fundValue":"77053","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our revised online learning materials have been used by 2 postgraduate courses (2013, 2014), an undergraduate summer conversion course (2014) and are planned for an undergraduate introductory political science methods course in 2014-2015.

The tool introduces students to key concepts before teaching them various statistical approaches and techniques. It also contains modules on data visualisation and data management. The course can be completed using SPSS, Stata or R. This course can be used as a basis for additional online or blended learning training. In can be incorporated in existing courses to provide practical activities or self-tests within a larger stats course, or it can be used as the first step in the development of more intermediate or advanced courses in particular statistical techniques.
