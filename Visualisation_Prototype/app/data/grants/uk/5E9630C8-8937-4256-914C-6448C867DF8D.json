This clock is very precise, as it is daily reset by timing cues we receive from the outside world, and especially environmental light. Early light experience has been shown to have an influence on the developing animal, so that the daily rhythms are shaped in a manner that lasts throughout its life. Early sensory experience is thus modifying adult behaviour and sculpting developing neural circuits. This is of particular concern in preterm infants, as they might be exposed to specific light conditions during the first critic weeks of life which may not only have acute or long-term disruptive effects on the developing biological clock, but it may also affect their weight gain, sleeping pattern and development in general. The main aim of this project is to determine the specific effects and consequences of early light experience at the visual level, and also on the biological clock located in the brain. Rodents (and specifically mice) have proven excellent models of human physiology with regard to biological rhythms in physiology and behaviour. I will therefore rear mice under different light conditions and I will then look at the effects of this early experience on visual function, expression of the daily locomotor activity rhythm, and of different neurotransmitters and clock gene expression at the brain clock level. In summary, by increasing understanding of the interaction between light conditions and the developing biological clock, I hope to improve knowledge and understanding of the effects of early experience on adults' behaviour, and thus provide a conceptual framework within which to develop specific strategies to promote improved care of neonates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019718/1","grantId":"BB/F019718/1","fundValue":"401798","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Merce Canal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
