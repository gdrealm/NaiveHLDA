The cause of low surface energy is the underlying chemical structure of the interfacial layers: the ability to control surface properties being the direct consequence of chemical structure. Since the first development of anti-wetting surfaces, it has always been necessary to employ long Fluorinated tails (&gt;7 x CF2/CF3 groups) in the surfactant additives. There are numerous applications of LSEMs today, such as printing, painting, adhesion, metal-plating, emulsification/suspension (medical, cosmetic, food packaging, etc.), washing (electronics, clothes, etc), antifogging and repellent surfaces (self-cleaning windows, water-proof textiles, anti-snow, anti-fog surfaces, papers, fibers, etc.). Therefore, development and optimization of LSEMs has attracted much attention, and a wide variety of useful LSEMs can be obtained by Fluorinating surfaces. Unfortunately, this has dramatic environmental consequences because of the persistence and bioaccumulation of Fluorocarbons (FCs). [Food Addit Contam. 2005, 10, 1023-31, Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40, 32-44]. As outlined below, this project is centred on intelligent programmed molecular design of hydrocarbon (HC) surfactants, which will generate similar surface properties to the undesirable FCs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K020676/1","grantId":"EP/K020676/1","fundValue":"251019","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2016-01-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Julian  Eastoe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
