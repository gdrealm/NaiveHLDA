In the long run, the ratios of these prices to the overall consumer price index have altered because of technological changes and globalization, among other factors. For example, the prices of internationally traded consumer goods have fallen relative to prices of services. By building separate models for the components, the long-run information in the data and specific economic features likely to drive each component can be exploited. </p> \n<p>These models will test for asymmetries, such as the tendency of petrol prices to respond faster to rises than to falls in oil prices. The models should help better understand the causes of overall inflation through understanding the inflation trends of the underlying sectors. Modelling the components separately should also highlight where interest rate policy could be effective, and where other policies such as competition policy or price regulation might have complementary benefits. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2066","grantId":"RES-000-22-2066","fundValue":"79857","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"JANINE  ARON","coPersons":["JOHN NORBERT MUELLBAUER"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
