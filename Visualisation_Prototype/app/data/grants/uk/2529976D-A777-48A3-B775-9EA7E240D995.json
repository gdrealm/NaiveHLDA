The real value of a network like this one, of \ncourse, lies not just in the ideas it generates \n(and the workshops did this in spades), but also \nin the connections between people that are \nmade. The eclectic mix of disciplines and \nbackgrounds in this project has created new \nstrands and challenged researchers' established \nway of thinking. The project has identified a \nnumber of research gaps, which are \nsummarised below:\n1. Although there have been many attempts at \ncase studies for social innovation, these are \nnot 'joined up', which makes learning lessons\nand replication very difficult. The first \nproject recommendation is for a research \nprogramme that will make a detailed \nstudy of historical and current case studies \nand based on these, devise guidelines for \nsuccessful social innovation projects. These \nguidelines could include both qualitative \nand quantitative elements.\n2. The second project recommendation \nis a research programme to investigate \nwhether we need new forms of institutional\nstructures to better support connected \ncommunities. For example, PhD study \nemphasises the work of the individual, \nwhich seems to be opposed to the notions \nof collaboration and community. Research \nshould be instigated that looks at the \nstructures of universities and government \nand devises new forms of organisational \nworking that better support and involve \ncommunities. \n3. Finally, one interesting proposal that \ncame out of the Inclusion workshop was \na research programme based around the \nconcept of 'listening'. A big issue in any \nlocally-oriented initiative is the ability to \nlisten to a full cross section of community \nvoices. This problem is shared by research \nprojects (who to sample?) as well as \ngovernment. A proposal was made for a \nproject that would examine the properties\nof listening and being listened to as a \ndemocratic human process. \n4. On the financial side, there is a need for a \nstructural macroeconomic model to analyse \nthe current faults in the system.
