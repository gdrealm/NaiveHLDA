Projections for regional sea level change over the next century are similar in magnitude to those for global sea level rise. Yet there are wide discrepancies between model projections of its pattern, amplitude and the underlying causes. The broad aim of this project is to determine the sensitivities of regional sea level changes, and associated changes in ocean circulation, to surface fluxes of heat, freshwater and momentum, to remote circulation anomalies, and to uncertain model parameters. These sensitivities will be determined for both the present climate and various future climate scenarios. We will use a state of the art ocean model and its so-called 'adjoint' to efficiently determine these sensitivities. In contrast to traditional modelling studies, in which a large number of experiments must be performed to determine the sensitivity of a model output to model inputs, the adjoint model provides each of these sensitivities from just a single model run. The project is timely in that it addresses key issues identified in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report, released last month, concerning uncertainties in projections of sea level change and circulation. It also draws on the expertise and success that the team has built up in using the ocean model and its adjoint through a current NERC-funded project to attribute changes observed in the overturning circulation in the Atlantic to local and remote surface forcing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F00236X/1","grantId":"NE/F00236X/1","fundValue":"411347","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David Philip Marshall","coPersons":["Helen Louise Johnson"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" A key issue in understanding ocean teleconnections, and their impact on regional sea level and circulation, is how surface wind and buoyancy forcing over the ocean interior excites ocean eddies and the subsequent fate of this eddy energy. We have showed, using theory, numerical modelling and analysis of altimetric sea level data, that ocean eddy energy is generated in the open ocean, propagates westward, and is removed at the western boundaries of ocean basins. This represents a significant fraction of the global ocean energy budget. In contrast to conventional wisdom, most of the eddy energy is dissipated locally at the western boundaries rather than propagating equatorward. This result has surprising implications, e.g., for monitoring the meridional overturning circulation. Ongoing work is studying the rectified impact of the eddies on western boundary currents, analogous to rip currents generated by surface waves breaking at a beach. \n\n\n\nWe have used observations and simple models to study the wind power input to the ocean circulation, clarifying the importance of high frequency wind forcing in the overall power input. We have also used forward models and observations to study the impact of surface wind and buoyancy forcing on ocean heat content and regional sea level in the Atlantic. High-frequency variability in the meridional overturning circulation excites heat content and sea level anomalies that are confined to low latitudes whereas lower frequency (decadal-multidecadal) overturning anomalies excite heat content and sea level anomalies at all latitudes. These results have implications for observing global sea level variability and sea level rise using tide gauges.We have further probed the remote sensitivities of regional sea level, heat content and circulation anomalies to remote wind and buoyancy forcing anomalies, and developed some novel theoretical tools. Improved understanding of the impact of climate forcing anomalies on ocean heat uptake and regional sea level change will help in the quest to deliver improved climate projections and forecasts, as well as understanding inter-annual variations in global and regional climate change. Material produced under this project has featured in public lectures given by the investigators. This work is primarily aimed at an academic audience but will help develop improved climate models, for example at the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
