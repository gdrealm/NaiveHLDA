{"id":"AEC216F9-C884-4406-B623-C9334E3336DA","title":"Systems Development: Domain-Specific Modelling","abstractText":"Traditionally, engineers use their experience in a problem domain and their knowledge of science and mathematics to find suitable solutions to a problem. They develop candidate solutions by building appropriate mathematical models, which they then analyse and test, using tools wherever possible. In the same way, system engineering is becoming ever-more dependent on modelling and a range of different tools and techniques are being used. These models are used to solve the problem in terms familiar to the domain expert, but in doing so they leave a wide gap between the domain model and the implementation technology. In this context, the project will address three challenges:(1) How do we use automated tools to support a variety of different modelling languages in a consistent manner?(2) How do we integrate them into existing development processes?(3) How do we obtain requirements traceability?We will develop new approaches using domain-specific modelling processes and will provide effective tool support. The project will be carried out in partnership with the National Physical Laboratory, and will be validated by experimentation on end-to-end case studies provided by NPL. Prototype tools will be ready for further development and exploitation as production-quality tools at the end of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061947/1","grantId":"EP/G061947/1","fundValue":"274762","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Charles Woodcock","coPersons":["Richard  Paige"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
