{"id":"4AA7096E-D475-42AA-856F-7864115AA07B","title":"Analysis of infinite systems of noncommuting fields","abstractText":"The purpose of the project is to study the ergodicity properties of semigroups with generators given in the H\\ ormander's form via an infinite system of noncommuting fields defined on an infinite dimensional space. Such cases are very important in applications (e.g. in statistical mechanics of nonhomogenous systems, superconductivity, ecology, finance,...) and therefore it would be important to make a progress in their mathematical understanding, which is still very restricted. We would like to develop a method for controlling the construction, (local) smoothness as well as ergodicity of dissipative dynamics and apply it to some important models (as e.g. d&gt;2 Heisenberg models with generalised Kawasaki dynamics).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D05379X/1","grantId":"EP/D05379X/1","fundValue":"322522","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They have been used to further progress our understanding of the problems of infinite dimensional analysis.
