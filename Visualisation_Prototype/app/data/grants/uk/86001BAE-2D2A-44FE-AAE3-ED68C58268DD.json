{"id":"86001BAE-2D2A-44FE-AAE3-ED68C58268DD","title":"Stories of Change: Exploring energy and community in the past, present and future","abstractText":"The ways we have lived with energy in the past has often changed - and will change again. The question is: what changes do we want and how do we tell these stories of change?\n\nThe 'Stories of Change' project works with a range of communities to explore the varied and changing ways in which humanity has lived with energy in the past, and the choices available to us all in the future. It draws on history, literature, social and policy research and the arts to encourage a more imaginative approach to energy choices. The project supports the cross-party commitments to decarbonisation that sit at the heart of the UK Government's Climate Change Act. Research has shown that many people feel disengaged, disempowered or actively hostile to the kinds of changes to the UK's energy system required to meet the targets embedded in the Act. Societies the world over are faced with pressing shared challenges about future energy choices. Polling points to wide acceptance that actions will be required to reduce demand and cope with future environmental hazards. But new developments and measures to manage or reduce demand can generate conflict. Our project seeks to make space to work through the areas of conflict and identify elements of a collective vision. \n\nWe are inspired by the example of the Mass Observation movement's stories of everyday life in the UK, above all in the 1930s and 1940s. Their work combined a desire to give ordinary people a voice, radical innovations in social research and bold new ideas about media and the arts. It has inspired our three objectives: \n\n1. To listen to and give a platform to more diverse, often unheard, voices;\n2. To mobilise change through research and the arts, and;\n3. To innovate in use of digital media. \n\n'Stories of Change' is organised around three mini research projects, or 'stories' and one cross-cutting project 'Energetic' that supports these, and draws wider conclusions. The project works with communities in three locations; each representing a different area of life. 'Policy Story: Demanding Times' gathers a novel mix of communities of interest around energy policy, and generates new accounts of energy policy and politics past, present and future. 'Industry Story: Future Works' is rooted in the English midlands, and seeks to unearth fresh accounts of the long relationship between energy, industrial making and landscape, and explores where it might go next. 'Everyday Story: Life Cycles' engages with the role that energy resources have played in shaping communities and everyday life in south Wales, from migration, for example from within Wales and as far as Somalia to work with coal, to new movements of people and things that support the UK's largest wind array.\n\nWe are working with stories because they offer a popular and engaging route into thinking about the past and present and imagining possible futures, and also because stories, narratives and narration are concepts that people from a range of academic and creative disciplines can gather around. History, digital storytelling, fictional narratives, and scenarios of the future all communicate different ideas about the consequences of change for everyday life, and explain different perspectives and attitudes towards change.\n\nWe will gather these stories - old and new - into an online publicly accessible collection (our 'Stories Platform'). We will offer pathways ('stories') through the materials, but it will also be easy for users to browse, or make up their own stories of change by threading material together using digital tools we provide. The academic team will also produce academic articles and a book, policy briefs and popular materials. The communities, our creative partners and the research team will also collaborate to produce a mix of creative writing, songs, short films, performances and museum and festival shows.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L008173/1","grantId":"AH/L008173/1","fundValue":"1169420","fundStart":"2014-04-29","fundEnd":"2017-04-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We are in the earliest stages of the project but are seeking to ensure impact from the start.
