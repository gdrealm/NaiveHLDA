{"id":"51DC85DE-70EC-450E-9FB3-4C7B94B85B8B","title":"Corporate Governance, Managerial Characteristics, Compensation, Risk Management and Derivatives Use.","abstractText":"<p>Managerial risk taking is an ongoing theme in the theory and practice of corporate financial management and control that affects shareholders, debtholders and other stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers and clients. There is however, no consensus on what drives corporate attitudes to risk taking or even on how the financial tools for risk management should be regulated and used. </p>\n\n<p>The proposed research will investigate the complex mix of corporate governance, the determinants of managerial decision-making and derivatives use and firm riskiness. It starts from the insight that managerial decisions can be motivated by managerial compensation and biographical characteristics but that they ultimately depend on the actual power of the CEO to implement his/her preferences. Thus the extent to which managers have the freedom to increase or decrease firm risk depends also on the firm's governance structure. </p>\n\n<p>The main objective of this study is to use regression analysis to empirically examine the factors that influence the managerial decision-making, derivatives use and the riskiness of the firm.&nbsp;The approach is multidisciplinary&nbsp;and draws from three strands of the literature, namely agency theory, human capital theory and corporate governance. This approach will provide new insights for shareholders, debt holders, policy makers and regulators.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H00596X/1","grantId":"ES/H00596X/1","fundValue":"68859","fundStart":"2009-09-30","fundEnd":"2011-09-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We had meetings with groups of researchers for whom we provided written material and Professor Clark has met with HRM and Financial Control at Carrefour.
