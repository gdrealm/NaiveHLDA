Using the Bristol Approach to examine trends in absolute poverty in sub Saharan Africa between 1995 and 2015.","abstractText":"<p>This project will use high quality, nationally representative, individual level data from over 140 household surveys conducted between 1990 and 2015 in 40 sub-Saharan African countries, to produce national, sub-regional and regional estimates of absolute poverty for the years 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Age appropriate and gender relevant indicators of severe deprivation of basic human needs will be operationalised, and an internationally recognised peer reviewed methodology (the ‘Bristol Approach’) used to show how poverty is patterned across Africa, and how it has changed over 20 years. It will show if rural populations have been left behind as urban areas develop, or if with increased rural to urban migration, poverty in Africa has evolved into a primarily urban problem.&nbsp; It will address important issues about gender and geographic disparities in poverty, which until recently have only been assessed in monetary terms.</p>\n\n<p>The application of the Bristol Approach, to reflect non-monetary dimensions of poverty, will reveal a more meaningful picture of poverty in Africa and how it has changed over time.</p>\n\n<p>Links will be developed with researchers across Africa, including academics at the Universities of Cape Town and the Western Cape. Project data will be deposited with the UK data archive.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001809/1","grantId":"ES/K001809/1","fundValue":"156758","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Shailen  Nandy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
