{"id":"9B864CBD-9F93-4FA4-9B10-C7FC739ADF74","title":"Regulation, contract enforcement, entry and meritocracy","abstractText":"<p>The project explores the role of institutional frictions in generating inefficient allocation of talent (failures of meritocracy) and insufficient entry of new firms (failures of entrepreneurship). There are at least two research papers that are part of the project. The former studies failures of meritocracy in a dynamic growth model with imperfect enforcement of financial contracts. In this environment dynastic management (or inter-generational transmission of control within a family) emerges, and leads to low levels of aggregate TFP (total factor productivity). The paper tries to quantify the potential importance of this channel for cross-country differences in aggregate efficiency. The second paper studies the economic consequences and the political economy of reform in economies where inefficient contract enforcement prevents transfer of control in existing firms, and high regulatory barriers to entry stifle the creation of new firms.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1497","grantId":"RES-000-22-1497","fundValue":"43339","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesco  Caselli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
