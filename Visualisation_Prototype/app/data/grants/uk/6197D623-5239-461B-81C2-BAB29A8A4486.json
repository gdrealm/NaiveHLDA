Of these approximately 10% are actively accreting material from their surrounding environment producing vast amounts of energy with luminosities often far in excess of the total integrated light from all the stars in the surrounding host galaxy, so-called Active Galaxies. The small sizes of their nuclear emitting regions prevents their study by direct imaging. Instead indirect techniques, eg. spectroscopy and time-variability studies are required.\n\nA particularly powerful tool in this regard is reverberation mapping. This technique, similar to mapping geological structures on the ocean floor using sonar, instead uses light echoes to determine the spatial distribution and kinematics of fast moving ionised gas close to the central engine. The variations in the ionised gas are driven by variations in the ionising continuum from the accretion disc. The ionised gas lies in a region where line-emission dominates the cooling, resulting in broad emission-lines in their spectra. The line-emission responds to continuum variations on time-scales of order the light-crossing time between the disc and the fast moving gas. The distance at which a particular line forms depends upon the ionising photon flux and the hydrogen gas density. Thus by studying several lines of different atomic species, reverberation mapping can yield a picture of the spatial distribution, kinematics and run of physical conditions with radios of the line-emitting material.\n\nThis study focuses on: \n\n(i) gaining a better understanding of the flow of material into and out of the nucleus on spatial scales of between one and a few hundred light-days\n(ii) understanding the origin of the accretion disc variations.\n\nWe use a two-pronged approach. First, we have developed a self-consistent model for the line emitting material, in which the material resides in a region bounded on its inner edge by the accretion disc and where continuum processes dominate the cooling, and on its outer edge by a dusty torus, where UV photons are destroyed by grains, again diminishing the line emission. Thus the fast moving photoionised gas (the broad emission-line region) occupies a region where line-emission dominates the cooling. We aim to develop this model further by testing the predicted time-variable emission-line profiles against those measured for several nearby AGN by the AGNWatch and LAMP collaborations. A key component of our model is a significant scale-height dependent turbulent component. This elevates the material at large radii and was introduced to :\n\n(i) provide closer agreement with the predicted line formation radius of the optical recombination lines and their measured delays\n(ii) explain the factor of 3 smaller than predicted size of the hot-dust as inferred from the measured K-band delays.\n\nWe have also begun to investigate the nature of the BLR outer boundary. We predict that the dust outer boundary is required to remain rather static in the face of continuum variations. This prediction needs to be tested against real data.\n\nOur modelling work is supported by two high profile monitoring campaigns starting in 2014, a 180 day (1 orbit/day ) HST UV monitoring campaign of the nearby AGN NGC5548 to provide 2-d velocity delay maps for the ultraviolet emission-lines in this source (co-I, Goad), together with a 120 day (3 orbits/day) Swift X-ray--UV monitoring campaign (co-I, Goad) aimed at determining the accretion disc continuum inter-band delays in the same source. We have also applied for 2 LT monitoring campaigns of the same source, the first to provide opt-IR interband delays (PI, Goad), the second to provide 2-d velocity resolved data using the LT IFU (co-I, Goad) for the strong optical recombination lines in support of the HST/Swift monitoring campaigns.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005654/1","grantId":"ST/L005654/1","fundValue":"28653","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Robert Goad","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
