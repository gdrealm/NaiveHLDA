{"id":"7653E684-7FAD-4F31-AC69-8B98FCF5289F","title":"Interpretation and Application of Scientific knowledge in Disaster Management: A Volcanic Perspective","abstractText":"<p>Earth's 1,500 active volcanoes directly threaten nearly 500 million people. Most of these volcanoes erupt at intervals of several decades or centuries, so that economic constraints prevent their permanent surveillance. As a result, vulnerable populations are often unaware of their exposure to volcanic hazards, a condition that promotes an ineffective response when a volcanic emergency does eventually occur. </p> \n<p>The efficient communication of warnings to vulnerable communities and to official and non-governmental institutions is central to reducing losses during a future crisis. For such warnings to be effective, it is vital to develop methodologies that address not only the technical aspects of hazard mitigation, but also raise general awareness of volcanic behaviour among the populations at risk. Such methodologies will necessarily also help decision makers to understand the views and needs of their communities. </p> \n<p>The seminar series will use volcanic hazards to investigate procedures for integrating the physical and social science approaches to disaster management. Social scientists, physical scientists and practitioners will be brought together to develop co-operative partnerships with the primary aims of improving co-ordination among groups from different disciplines, enhancing collaborative decision-making strategies, and identifying gaps in knowledge for future policy-oriented and inter-disciplinary research on risk and disasters. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-496-25-4008","grantId":"RES-496-25-4008","fundValue":"19993","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Richard Kilburn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
