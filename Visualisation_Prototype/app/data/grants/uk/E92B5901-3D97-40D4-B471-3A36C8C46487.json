The LS constitutes a research resource of great value which has been used in many influential studies.&nbsp;It is representative of the whole population of England and Wales, including those in non-private households, includes all age groups, is maintained through the recruitment of a sample of new births and immigrants, and now includes individual level data from four censuses (1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) as well as linked information on births, deaths and cancer registrations. Additional data from claimant count records will be linked to the database in 2006. </p> \n<p>In order to meet confidentiality requirements, the LS dataset can only be accessed within a safe setting currently located in the ONS London office. ONS maintain the dataset and also provide core documentation. CeLSIUS provides an expert interface to the data. This involves helping users with specification of projects; creating data extracts and running tabulations and analyses; and providing a wide range of training and information resources accessible via the CeLSIUS website <a href=\"http://www.celsius.lshtm.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.celsius.lshtm.ac.uk</a></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-348-25-0004","grantId":"RES-348-25-0004","fundValue":"1572000","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily M D  Grundy","coPersons":["Andrew Burgess Sloggett"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
