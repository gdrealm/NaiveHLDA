{"id":"03D62750-630C-4B5D-98AB-DC58136C5B8D","title":"Later Medieval France","abstractText":"'Later Medieval France' (c.1300-1460) presents a new analysis of political and social change within the kingdom of the Valois monarchs, and is the first single-authored English-language book on the subject in 40 years. Rather than see the political history of the kingdom as a function of growing royal centralisation and the consequence of late medieval crisis, 'Later Medieval France' demonstrates the importance of the evidence from region and locality of the key political role played by the nobility, grouped by ties of lordship, kinship and clientage into powerful interest groups, and of the municipalites of the kingdom, whose leaders attained unprecedented levels of influence and authority. In this fresh analysis of political change, the author is mindful of the wider context of European history in the period, and of earlier and later developments in the history of the French kingdom.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005885/1","grantId":"AH/G005885/1","fundValue":"24928","fundStart":"2008-09-08","fundEnd":"2009-01-07","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Graeme Peter SMALL","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
