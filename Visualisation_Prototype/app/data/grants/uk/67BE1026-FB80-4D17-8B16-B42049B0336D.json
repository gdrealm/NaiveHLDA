In the UK, asthma affects 1 in 11 children and 1 in 12 adults (Asthma UK). Asthma symptoms include wheeze, cough and shortness of breath caused by airways that narrow too much and too easily in response to harmless stimuli such as dust, cold air, air pollutants and pet dander. There is no cure for asthma. For many sufferers, current therapies help manage the symptoms of the disease, but for approximately 10% of patients with the severest disease current therapies are ineffective. There is an urgent need to identify the underlying basis of asthma, and to develop appropriate new treatment strategies. \nThe causes of asthma are not fully understood. While exposure to environmental triggers can bring on an asthma attack, it is known that asthma tends to run in families and may be inherited. Over the last 10-15 years, considerable progress has been made in identifying small changes in a number of genes that have been associated with inheritance of asthma. However, the functions of these genes (ie. how they work inside a cell) and/or how the small changes in their genetic code contribute to changes in their function that contribute to development of asthma remain poorly understood. Traditionally, scientists try to understand how a gene works by using 'animal models' (usually mice or rats) which allow them to investigate disease states in ways that would be inaccessible in a human patient. For example, they can deliberately delete or mutate the gene of interest and look at the consequence for the animal. However, such approaches are costly, time consuming and may not give any useful information because on the one hand, the animal may not show any difference or may give information that does not tell scientists about humans, and on the other hand, it may die as a result of the genetic modification. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative approaches that replace the use of animals and reliably speed up the screening process, as well as offer potential for introducing several disease-genes into the same organism. This will allow assessment of how they interact together to cause the disease and how they influence responses to environmental triggers. \nThe fruit fly has proved to be a useful genetic tool for studying a number of common human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insects possess a very simple airway system which shares many features with the human airway. Beside these characteristics, there are very efficient and easy methods available for altering genes in Drosophila, making this model so unique. This comprehensive toolbox of methods allows directed manipulation of any gene of interest (including human genes) with complete control in any cell type and at any time. Crucially, fly models can be developed and assessed in a relatively short period (within a month), so if the first approach doesn't work we will be able to make changes and study their effects very quickly. Therefore, we wish to determine whether 'fly models' can be used to replace animal models of asthma to study asthma susceptibility genes. We will demonstrate proof-of-principle by targeting two susceptibility genes called CDHR3 and ADAM33 where we have prior experience in animal and human cell systems, so enabling direct comparison with the fly system. By allowing screening of the function of key asthma genes, as well as providing a model for high through-put drug screening, we believe that this approach will greatly accelerate our understanding of the underlying genetic causes of asthma and help to develop new therapies that can control better the disease, or ultimately, prevent development of asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/M001482/1","grantId":"NC/M001482/1","fundValue":"89116","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Donna Elizabeth Davies","coPersons":["Jane Elizabeth Collins","Amrit  Mudher","Hans Michael Haitchi"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
