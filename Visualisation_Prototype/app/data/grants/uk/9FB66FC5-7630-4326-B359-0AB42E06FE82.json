{"id":"9FB66FC5-7630-4326-B359-0AB42E06FE82","title":"The expression, modification and enhancement of protein therapeutics","abstractText":"Site directed modification by both homogeneous glycosylation and pegylation has hitherto been unavailable in drug development and offers a major innovative advance to patients and carers alike. Such control of protein modifications by this consortium will for the first time bring the opportunity for clear structural control to produce the maximum therapeutic effect required. The consortium will use the additional funding provided by a successful application to develop better therapeutic glycoproteins. The expression of aglycosyl proteins in high yielding yeast systems will provide the protein backbone from which novel synthetic glycoproteins will be constructed. Synthetic glycans will be used to improve glycosylation and enhance pharmacokinetic properties. The application of a novel targeted pegylation technology will improve uniformity of pegylation as well as improve protein potency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F00270X/1","grantId":"DT/F00270X/1","fundValue":"191419","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings were used within Glycoform Ltd for business development.
