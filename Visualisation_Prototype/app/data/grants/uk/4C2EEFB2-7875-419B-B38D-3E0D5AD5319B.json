Developing such an understanding using rigorous quantitative theory constitutes the ultimate aim pursued in the proposed research.&nbsp;This research focuses specifically on the connections between the legal framework, the decisions of financial intermediaries regarding borrowing limits, and the default levels. These three elements along with the role played by other economic agents (creditors, debtors and financial intermediaries) will allow the authors to analyse an ample range of relevant interactions and mechanisms. Taking explicit account of the responses of financial intermediaries (via borrowing limits) and debtors (via their default choice) to changes in the economic and legislative environment may prove significant for policy conclusions since the existing literature does not account for those responses. Examples of policy issues include the evaluation of bankruptcy reforms and redistributive policies as to their effect on measures of social welfare and macroeconomic aggregates, interest rates and asset prices, as well as the personal distribution of wealth.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1149","grantId":"RES-000-22-1149","fundValue":"46492","fundStart":"2006-02-28","fundEnd":"2007-08-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Giulio  Seccia","coPersons":["Xavier  Mateos-Planas"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
