{"id":"A267CCE1-A08D-4371-B13B-56912EB0409A","title":"Neural Control of Movement","abstractText":"We know surprisingly little about how the brain decides to start and then control an apparently simple movement such as picking up a glass of water. Yet the consequences that occur when the system goes wrong, as in Parkinson?s disease or after a stroke, are only too clear. This CoOperative Group brings together scientists who study control of movement with a range of different methods, from recording single neurones in animals, to computer modelling of arm movements in robots. It also involves clinicians studying new treatments to rehabilitate patients who have difficulties in moving. Tackling the problem with a range of techniques allows us to see how a problem in one part of the central nervous system can have knock-on effects at many other different sites. Some of these changes help compensate for disease or brain injury, others, such as the spasticity seen after stroke are maladaptive and block recovery. Our aim is to describe the complex interactions between different levels of control in the CNS and show how this can be used to target treatments more effectively in disease and after trauma.\n\nIn the next five years we will target (a) disorders of movement that are caused by genetic deficits (e.g. some forms of Parkinson?s disease or torsion dystonia), to understand how the gene interferes with specific functions in the motor control system. (b) New neurosurgical approaches to treat movement disorders, such as deep brain stimulation in Parkinson?s disease. Here we aim to identify how the brain reacts to these stimulators, and whether they induce any long term changes in the way the brain controls movement. (c) Finally we will examine processes involved in recovery after stroke and spinal injury in order to understand why, despite apparently similar amounts of damage, some patients may go on to make a good recovery whereas others in the same age group will fare poorly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9806600","grantId":"G9806600","fundValue":"518557","fundStart":"1998-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Rothwell","coPersons":["Peter Anthony Kirkwood","Brian Leslie Day","Roger Nicholas Lemon","Alan James Thompson","Patrick  Haggard","Daniel Mark Wolpert","Peter  Brown"],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
