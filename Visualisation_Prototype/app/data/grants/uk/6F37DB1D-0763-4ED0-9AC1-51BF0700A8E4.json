Pregnancy appears to be an important time for developing sensitive maternal responses. We have shown attentional preference to images of infant distress develops during pregnancy and is disrupted by depression. This may result from the disruption of reward pathways that occurs in depression.</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms of depression during pregnancy are common and the infants of women who were depressed during pregnancy show impaired development. </p>\n\n<p>We plan to investigate whether depression during pregnancy is associated with a mother's responses to her infant in observed interactions one year after birth.</p>\n\n<p>ALSPAC is a longitudinal study of mothers, fathers and their children starting in pregnancy during 1991 and 1992. We will use the data collected from a sample of 1000 mothers to investigate whether depression during pregnancy impacts on the quality of videod mother-infant interactions and whether this effect is more important than maternal depression occuring at other times. We will also explore whether maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, which may also alter reward systems in the brain, is associated with the quality of mother-infant interactions. This study aims to inform interventions to improve maternal sensitivity in vulnerable women before their infant is born.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4175","grantId":"RES-000-22-4175","fundValue":"80573","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Evans","coPersons":["Roberto  Melotti","Jon  Heron","Carol  Joinson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
