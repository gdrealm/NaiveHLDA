Transplastomics, is a new and exciting method, that allows the detailed study of chloroplast genes. Despite the importance of chloroplast genes to life on this planet and sustainable manufacture of high-value products, we know virtually nothing about the processes that maintain these genes in plants. This project will study these processes by identifying the proteins that interact with chloroplast genes. We will use advanced transplastomics to find out what effects these proteins have on chloroplast genes. This work will allow us to understand better how these genes are protected from the damaging effects of sunlight, and how they are maintained and inherited in plants. By studying the machinery responsible for maintaining chloroplast genes we will understand one of the key molecular processes required for chloroplasts to function and this underpins the healthy growth and development of plants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E020445/1","grantId":"BB/E020445/1","fundValue":"325516","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research project has had positive impacts throughout the research life cycle. The findings have provided new knowledge on a key set of genes that are required for the viability of the crops. We depend on crops performing well for our food security and this new and shared knowledge will contribute to our knowledge-based economy to enhance the quality of life. The project has the added value of training highly skilled scientists who have entered the private consultancy sector and secondary education to improve the economic competitiveness of the UK and effectiveness of public services. In addition, the project has provided networking opportunities outside academia to promote the research expertise developed during the project.

Because the process requires little input and is energy-efficient and carbon-neutral it allows sustainable production of bio-molecules important to maintain our quality of life. Chloroplasts are unique in containing their own DNA blueprint comprised of a circle of ~100 genes. These genes were known to be very important but resisted our early attempts to study them using modern molecular tools. Transplastomics is a new and exciting method, that allows the detailed study of chloroplast genes. Despite the importance of chloroplast genes to life on this planet and sustainable manufacture of high-value products, we know virtually nothing about the processes that maintain these chloroplast genes in plants. Maintenance of chloroplast genes is carried out by proteins that are encoded by the nucleus (nuclear genes). This project identified important nuclear genes involved in maintaining chloroplast DNA. We showed this by first identifying and then reducing the amounts of proteins made by these nuclear genes. This was followed by monitoring the impact this had on the chloroplast genes. Important nuclear genes involved in chloroplast gene maintenance had a large effect on the maintenance of chloroplast DNA and in turn this affected the growth of the plant. This demonstrated the importance of the chloroplast gene maintenance pathways we had discovered for growth and development of plants. This better scientific understanding provides us with new knowledge to monitor and ultimately improve a key molecular process required for the healthy growth of crops. In addition to significant new knowledge the project also led to: new skills and research methods to study the maintenance of chloroplast genes and a potential method to influence the inheritance of chloroplast genes in the vegetative parts of the plants. It also opened up new research opportunities for using our new found knowledge to improve transplastomic technologies in crops. The project enabled networks and collaborations with other research groups and the knowledge and skills needed to support the specialist training of three PhD graduate students. They in turn increased our research capability over the period of the grant. The findings provide new information on the key genes required for chloroplast gene maintenance. The project will be of interest to academic researchers and the agri-tech sector (green biotechnology) interested in improving chloroplast genes, which encode proteins that are essential for the growth and productivity of crops. Plants can be used for the sustainable manufacture of recombinant proteins for white and red biotechnology and chloroplast expression can boost protein yields. Understanding the key proteins that are responsible for maintaining chloroplast genes opens up new opportunities for improving transplastomic technologies in a wider range of crops for applications in green, white and red biotechnology.
