A second aim is to fill a gap in the literature by testing the theoretical integration of implicit attitudes with the affect heuristic. Demonstrating that implicit attitudes and the affect heuristic may be different measures of the same psychological processes is important because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>it would suggest that affect is a central component of implicit attitudes \n</li>\n <li>the two separate strands of research concerning implicit attitudes and the affect heuristic need to re-evaluate their theories and findings in relation to each other.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is crucial to understand how these constructs relate to each other in order to fully-understand the nature of attitudes towards such societal concerns and create adequate risk communications about these issues. </p>\n\n<p>Two large experiments will be conducted using different methods from the affect heuristic and implicit attitude literatures. Each will provide new knowledge about implicit social cognition, the affect heuristic and risk perception.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2579","grantId":"RES-000-22-2579","fundValue":"67445","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ellen  Townsend","coPersons":["Alexa  Spence"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
