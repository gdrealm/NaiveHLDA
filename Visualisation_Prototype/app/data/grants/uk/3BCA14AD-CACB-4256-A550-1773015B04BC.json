It will also provide channels for knowledge exchange between these audiences and the four projects. \n\nA second objective of the Network is to enhance the communication between the four projects, providing a forum for the discussion of common tools, techniques and issues. The Network will also offer workshops and other help to the 20 doctoral students associated with the projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I037741/1","grantId":"EP/I037741/1","fundValue":"103776","fundStart":"2011-06-13","fundEnd":"2014-06-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Gilbert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
