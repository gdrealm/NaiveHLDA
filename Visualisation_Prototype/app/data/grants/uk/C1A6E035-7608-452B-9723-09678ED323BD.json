Their unifying feature is that they are all caused by the over-activation of a white blood cell called the neutrophil. In general, neutrophils are hugely important. They are very numerous in the blood, and are mobilised very quickly to sites of infection, where they hunt and destroy bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. Their ability to kill bugs comes from carrying a range of toxic proteins which they deliberately release onto the microbes. When the neutrophil?s job is done, it naturally dies and is removed by cells specialised in clearing up (like macrophages). The death of the neutrophil is highly regulated in a process called apoptosis, and is designed so that the neutrophil doesn?t spill any of its toxic antimicrobial compounds into healthy or healing tissues. However, if the neutrophil lives too long, or doesn?t get cleared properly when it dies, spillage of these toxic compounds can cause major tissue damage. This is thought to be an important contributor to a wide range of diseases, for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, commonly caused by smoking). \nWe think we?ve worked out how neutrophil survival might be regulated at sites of infection. This survival response depends upon a clever series of orchestrated signals that keep the neutrophil alive for just the right length of time. We also think that, in diseases like COPD, these survival signals are doing too much. Our work plans on studying these systems in much more detail. We want to look at normal neutrophils, and neutrophils taken from the lungs during inflammation. To study these pathways in the test tube, we plan to make neutrophils from stem cells that we have manipulated to be deficient in specific proteins. Putting together these approaches, many of which are really new and technically very exciting, we think we?ll identify some genuinely new potential drug targets that might revolutionise the treatment of lung disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801983","grantId":"G0801983","fundValue":"712005","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Sabroe","coPersons":["Moira Katherine Whyte"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
