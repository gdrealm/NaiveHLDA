{"id":"3510829B-EAE9-48DC-A723-8093D92CAD60","title":"A Big Data History of Music","abstractText":"This collaboration between Royal Holloway and the British Library will provide a paradigm shift in how music history is researched. It will bring together for the first time the world's biggest datasets about published sheet music, music manuscripts and classical concerts (in excess of 5 million records) for statistical analysis, manipulation and visualisation. \n\nData from seven existing databases and catalogues will be used as the basis of this project. These datasets (two of which are not currently available online) include: the British Library's catalogues of printed and manuscript music; the bibliographies created by R&eacute;pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) that list European music printed 1500-1800 and music manuscripts in European libraries; and the RISM UK Music Manuscripts Database and the Concert Programmes Project database. These catalogues and databases are already essential finding tools for all researchers of music history and musicology, plus many scholars of performance studies and cultural history. However, until now it has not been possible to analyse these rich collections of data for large-scale trends in the dissemination of music, the popularity of specific composers, or the development of musical taste. \n\nOur project will align and combine the seven datasets so that they can be analysed as big data. Key areas of the British Library data will be enriched and cleaned in order that they can be successfully aligned with the other datasets. The project team will then pilot ways in which the combined dataset can be analysed with approaches taken from the study of big data. By analysing the frequency, spread and distribution of specific compositions and composers' outputs, the project will challenge current thinking about how music was transmitted across borders, how musical taste developed, and how certain composers or repertories were canonised as carrying aesthetic value. The results of this research will be disseminated via a symposim held at the British Library, to which academics and non-academics will be invited. Finally, the data will be made available as an open dataset for researchers to undertake big data research across multiple disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L010046/1","grantId":"AH/L010046/1","fundValue":"79231","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is still at an early stage. Nonetheless its methods and findings are already inspiring information professionals to (a) engage with the data produced by the project and (b) reappraise how their own databases might be analysed in similar ways.\n\nUnder category (a), software engineers at Facebook (e.g. Jason Sundram) and at the Dutch Data Archiving and Network Service (e.g. Marnix van Berchum) have expressed interest in creative analyses of the data produced by the project, and they are planning a hackathon on the project data (to be held on 10th March 2015). \n\nUnder category (b), librarians and information professionals have been inspired to consider how their own library databases might be analysed as Big Data. Anna Penseart, music librarian at Cambridge University, blogged after our project presentation in Antwerp:\n'I think it's fantastic that in the world of Digital Humanities it is now possible to take data that was primarily created as a bibliographical tool and use this for research using a range of technologies, statistics and visualisations. It just struck me how labour intensive (if not completely impossible) this would have been in the good old days when I was a musicology student and feel very impressed indeed. The actual process of cleaning up the data in order to make research possible sounded absolutely fascinating.'
