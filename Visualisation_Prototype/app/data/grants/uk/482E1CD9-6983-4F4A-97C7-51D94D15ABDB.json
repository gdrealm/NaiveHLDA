{"id":"482E1CD9-6983-4F4A-97C7-51D94D15ABDB","title":"The nature and function of the classical Greek theatre mask","abstractText":"Classical Greek tragedy was performed in masks, and I shall explain why. Though commonplace in many African and Asian cultures, masks play relatively little part in the modern western theatre, except in acting training, so the cultural differences of the ancient world has to be addressed alongside the practicalities of performing in huge outdoor spaces. A comprehensive study of masking in the twentieth-century productions of Greek tragedy opens up the diverse possibilities of the mask. I shall examine the archaeological evidence afresh from first principles. Important themes in the book will include possession, and the emergence of individualism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112635/1","grantId":"112635/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wiles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
