Patients with faults in the gene encoding this protein can have either diabetes or raised fasting blood glucose that is usually treated by diet alone or low blood glucose levels which are usually treated with diazoxide. \n\nIt is not understood how all of these faulty proteins result in low or high blood glucose values in patients. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which the defective genes cause diabetes or low blood glucose. Recently it has been discovered that some faults in genes do not cause disease because they change the protein; but that they affect the intermediate step of RNA processing that prevents or alters protein synthesis. My study will look at whether this is true for glucokinase gene defects. I will also look to see if some defects in genes cause disease because they prevent the glucokinase protein from being regulated by other proteins. This work is important because it will help interpret genetic test results and will also increase our understanding of an important drug target for the development of therapeutic agents to treat diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700222","grantId":"G0700222","fundValue":"350389","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna L Gloyn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
