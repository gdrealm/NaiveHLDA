The study of ancient DNA has had a huge impact in zoology, enabling researchers to obtain DNA sequences from extinct species such as mammoths and cave bears, leading to new discoveries about the evolutionary relationships between these animals and their living relatives, and providing insights into the reasons why these species failed to survive the climate changes of the last 50,000 years. Potentially, ancient DNA could have an equally great impact in archaeology, for example by enabling the family relationships between groups of human skeletons to be traced and by charting the migrations of prehistoric human populations. Sadly, this potential has not been realized, for the simple reason that specimens such as bones are easily contaminated with modern human DNA by handling, and it is difficult to distinguish this contamination from the genuine ancient DNA in a specimen. A number of researchers, including us, have suggested solutions to this problem, but none of these 'solutions' have been completely successful. Our best attempt so far is based on the fact that ancient DNA is chemically different from modern DNA because the ancient molecules have become partially degraded. Identifying the degraded molecules in a bone extract should therefore pinpoint which ones are ancient DNA. But there is a complication: it turns out that even the contaminating DNA is degraded to a certain extent, because usually it is deposited on a specimen during excavation, and this can be months or years before the DNA in the specimen is examined, enough time for the contaminating DNA to begin to degrade. Identifying the ancient DNA therefore becomes more difficult because, rather than simply identifying which molecules are degraded, we must distinguish the ones which are most degraded (and which could therefore be ancient DNA) from the ones that are only slightly degraded (and are therefore likely to be modern contaminants). We have tried to do this with the standard methods used to study ancient DNA, with some success, but these methods are not really suitable for this type of analysis. In this project we plan to test a new method, called single primer extension (SPEX), which was recently developed as a tool for obtaining more accurate DNA sequences from extinct species such as the moa and Tasmanian wolf. Unlike the standard ancient DNA methods, SPEX does allow accurate comparisons of the amounts of damage in different DNA molecules, and we therefore believe that SPEX will enable us to distinguish the genuine ancient DNA in a human specimen from the contaminants. The objective of the project is therefore to apply SPEX to analysis of the DNA in a human bone, to see if our expectations are fulfilled.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F010109/1","grantId":"NE/F010109/1","fundValue":"55290","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The main users of the research will be those scientists attempting to obtain sequence information from small amounts of partially degraded DNA.

We have tried to do this with the standard methods used to study ancient DNA, but these methods are not really suitable for this type of analysis. This is because these methods are based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which has the unfortunate habit of creating hybrid molecules, made up partly of ancient and partly of modern DNA. The presence of these hybrid molecules makes it even more difficult to distinguish the genuinely ancient ones. In this project we tested a new method, called single primer extension (SPEX), which was recently developed as a tool for obtaining more accurate DNA sequences from extinct species such as the moa and Tasmanian wolf. We applied SPEX to human bones that had been artificially contaminated with modern DNA. SPEX did not create hybrid molecules, making it easier to use the degree of degradation displayed by the sequences to distinguish the genuine ancient DNA in the specimen from the more recent contamination. We also devised a modified version of SPEX that preferentially targets the more damaged DNA in an extract, so sequences are selectively obtained from the ancient DNA rather than modern contamination. We are still working on this new technique which we hope to patent in the near future. During the course of the project a small collaboration was set up with Dr Odile Loreille of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory which enabled the outputs of the project to be utilised in attempted identification of the remains of three US servicemen killed during the Korean War. Identification was successful in one of these three cases. The main users of the research will be those scientists attempting to obtain sequence information from small amounts of partially degraded DNA. These include biomolecular archaeologists working with DNA from archaeological specimens, forensic scientists, who like biomolecular archaeologists increasingly work with highly degraded DNA samples, clinical geneticists working with archived human material, and environmental biologists working with degraded DNA in samples such as animal hair, bird feathers, and droppings.
