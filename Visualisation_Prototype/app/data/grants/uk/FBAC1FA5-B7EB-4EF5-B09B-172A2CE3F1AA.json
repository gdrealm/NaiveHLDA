{"id":"FBAC1FA5-B7EB-4EF5-B09B-172A2CE3F1AA","title":"MRC-Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma","abstractText":"Allergy affects 1 in 6 people in the UK and Asthma affects 1 in 12 of the population in the UK, with 5.4 million people currently receiving treatment. The UK has one of the highest prevalences of asthma in young adults in Europe and the numbers of children reporting asthma symptoms has risen six fold over the last 30 years. Asthma costs the NHS almost #1bn per year and it is estimated that at least 12.7 million working days are lost due to asthma each year. This health and economic burden on the nation emphasizes the importance of research that tries to understand the diseases. The current proposal for a Centre brings together a group of doctors and scientists to discover new ways to prevent, treat and cure allergy and asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000758","grantId":"G1000758","fundValue":"4436610","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sebastian L Johnston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
