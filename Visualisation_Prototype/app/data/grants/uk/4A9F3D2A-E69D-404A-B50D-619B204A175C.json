The Mediated Word: Approaches to Literary Experiment on Radio. The manuscript, more than two-thirds finished, has already received extremely positive feedback from both Oxford University Press and the University of Minnesota Press. My editor at Oxford wrote that &quot;it will fill a real void in the field.&quot; In addition to writing an introduction only three, extremely manageable, research tasks need to be undertaken: \n\n1) Research needs to be completed on the section which discusses the radio work of F.T. Marinetti and the literary experiments of Italian Futurism. The principles laid out in the Futurist manifesto La Radia and their performative literary technique of parole in liberta' were central their recorded speech experiments and their attempts to work in broadcasting {particularly Marinetti's Violetta ed gli Aereoplani). Interestingly however the most sustained and significant of Marinetti's radio experiments happened not Italy but on his 1926 tour of Brazil {in Rio de Janeiro and the surrounding hinterland). While these broadcasts are often cited in passing as Marinetti's key radio productions, there exists to date no substantive and detailed account and analysis of them. 1 have already begun liaising with Professor Lucio Agra of the Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo {an authority on Modernism in Brazil) about available resources and will have the necessary material in my possession this summer. \n\n2) To expand the section on radio literary communities in the 1960s and 1970s I need to add discussions of Susan Howe's programme Poetry produced for Pacifica Radio's WBAI in New York, and Cid Corman's This is Poetry produced for WMEX in Boston (programmes which were cited by several significant twentieth-century American poets—such as Robert Creeley and Larry Eigner—as being important and influential). After contacting Howe, the special collections librarian in charge of her archivethe University of California at San Diego, the Pacifica Archive, Al Gayzagian (Corman's occasional co-producer) and Professor Benjamin Friedlander of the University of Maine {a Corman scholar), 1 have located the material needed to complete this section. Similarly, I will have most or all of it in my possession this summer. \n3) Finally, to expand my taxonomy of rhetorical tropes used in the contemporary digital audio editing of radio speech I need to survey the work of the following practitioners: Sherre Delys, Matt Thompson, Antony Pitts, John Jacobs and Miguel Macias. These will be added to the existing analyses of the work of Gregory Whitehead, Piers Plowright, John Oswald, Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky), Christof Migone, Erik Belgum, Elizabeth James and Jane Draycott already completed. Particular tropes need to be isolated, defined and contextualized within the tradition of &quot;auricular figures&quot; first presented by the early modern rhetorician George Puttenham. The material for this analysis has already been collected; all that is required is the opportunity to approach it. \n\nThese three research objectives are discreet, well-defined and will be developed on top of the substantial body of contextualizing research already completed. All that is needed is time to complete the writing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504647/1","grantId":"AH/E504647/1","fundValue":"19576","fundStart":"2007-04-16","fundEnd":"2007-07-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Spinelli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
