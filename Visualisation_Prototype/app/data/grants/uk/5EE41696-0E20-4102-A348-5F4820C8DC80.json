Eca de Queiro's is Portugal's primary of this period, and one of its most polemical writers. Throughout his novels he sought to question the nation's sense of itself regarding both its historical past (the period of the maritime discoveries), its decline into a European periphery in the nineteenth century and its likely trajectory in the future. The family, and in particular the figure of the mother, both in its concrete reality and as a metaphor for national identity figures as a central theme in this author's work and in the analysis to be developed throughout the essays that will constitute the proposed volume.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112930/1","grantId":"112930/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-17","fundEnd":"2006-07-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Manuel Lisboa","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
