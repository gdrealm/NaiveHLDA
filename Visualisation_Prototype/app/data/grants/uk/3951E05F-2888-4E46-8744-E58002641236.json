In this project, we will perform experiments that will allow us to understand how multi-resistance to antibiotics is caused. We will focus on broad substrate-specificity efflux pumps that actively export the drugs, thus rendering them less effective. We want to know the contribution of increased efflux pump activities in the development of multi-drug resistance in Acinetobacter spp. in the clinical environment. We anticipate that we will discover physiological substrates of these pumps and the biochemical pathways that produce them. This could lead to the discovery of novel antimicrobials and inhibitors of the broad-spectrum efflux pumps.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901366","grantId":"G0901366","fundValue":"136861","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Jane Piddock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
