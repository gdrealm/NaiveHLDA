The devices that carry out early steps in genetic information flow (gene expression) are small molecular machines often highly regulated by a number of cues. We plan to study one molecular machine at the level of how its use of the energy currency of the cell is converted to a useful output. By analogy, we want to know if a multi-cylinder engine needs to use all its combustion cylinders, can it run on less, and do all connect to the wheels or not. In so doing, we will uncover the design and operating principles of our molecular machine, providing important information about how we might modify and exploit its properties for managing harmful bacteria, creating pathway specific inhibitors and making new molecular devices. The type of device we will study is found in the simplest organisms (bacteria) and amongst the most complex (humans, plants).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G001278/1","grantId":"BB/G001278/1","fundValue":"330739","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Buck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
