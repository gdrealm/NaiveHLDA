{"id":"9666C069-2CF5-4EC4-8663-FB0F574C2518","title":"German Jewish Travelling Cultures, 1919-1939","abstractText":"This project analyses tourism and travel writing in Jewish popular culture during the interwar period. Instead of centering Jewish cultures in the German nation state, it views Jewish tourism as an important element of dwelling in a trans-national context. The destinations offered not simply objects for social and historical investigation, but a realm in which travelers experienced and negotiated their identities. Visitors' accounts provided not only important information for curious readers but related and narrated multi-faceted experiences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119498/1","grantId":"119498/1","fundValue":"3314","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2007-01-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nils  Roemer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
