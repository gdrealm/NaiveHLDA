Treatment with the one available drug does not prevent reinfection so an effective vaccine would enhance control. Sequencing of the worm's transcriptome (2003) and genome (2009) has facilitated post-genomic initiatives. Brazilian science would greatly benefit from an injection of cutting-edge proteomic technologies from UK experts to better orientate the search for novel vaccine candidates. As stated above previous collaborations between the proposed partners have led to publications in high impact journals, which in turn have informed the research of vaccinologists in Brazil and worldwide.\n\nProteomics is a young subject, expanding into a very sophisticated technology with enormous potential to illuminate many of the disease problems we face in the developed and developing world alike. The group in Ouro Preto is also in the growth phase. The proposed project could serve as the springboard to establish a longer-lasting collaboration with a leading group of UK researchers at the cutting edge of Proteomics. The impact that this would have on infectious tropical disease research in Brazil cannot be underestimated. The new collaboration will inject advanced proteomic techniques to underpin and consolidate the inventory of novel proteins we expect to identify and quantitate. We anticipate that the collaboration will kick-start a new round of vaccine testing.\n\nIn this programme, we will apply technologies developed at Liverpool to the analysis of potential vaccine candidates. In particular, Liverpool will host scientists and trainees from Ouro Preto, giving them access the super facilities that are located there. In addition, scientists from Liverpool will visit Ouro Preto to provide advanced training and to deliver a formal training course that will be open to other Brazilian scientists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028801/1","grantId":"BB/M028801/1","fundValue":"41704","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Jeffrey Beynon","coPersons":["Peter Damian Ashton"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
