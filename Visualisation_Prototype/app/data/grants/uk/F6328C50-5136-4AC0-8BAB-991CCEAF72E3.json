Sometimes the electronic and magnetic properties of the surface can be very different from those of the underlying material, and difficult to predict. This work will answer questions about some material systems which we know are unusual, and we know how to create them, but without a complete understanding of their properties they cannot be fully exploited for technological applications. For example what is the difference in the surface structure of silicon atoms between 2- and 3-Dimensional rare-earth silicides? Do the exceptional magnetic properties of small clusters of atoms originate from the bulk or the surface? We will use a variety of techniques to measure these properties, but in particular metastable de-excitation spectroscopy. In a unique instrument, excited (metastable) helium atoms are focussed onto the surface of interest using laser-cooling methods. Approaching to within a few Angstroms of the surface, the energy of the atoms is released, liberating electrons from the sample with an energy spectrum characteristic of the electronic, structural and magnetic properties of the surface, and not confused by contributions from underlying atoms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D034604/1","grantId":"EP/D034604/1","fundValue":"287028","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven Philip Tear","coPersons":["Sarah Madeleine Thompson","Jing  Wu","Herve  Menard","Chris  Binns"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" The further development of the meta-stable helium de-excitation spectroscopy technique which utilises laser-cooling to enhance the signal-to-background information has been demonstrated. The very high surface sensitivity of the technique has been exploited, and complemented by other surface science techniques and theory, to study technologically relevant surfaces and initial interfaces with molecules (e.g. C60 and crotyl alcohol), rare earth silicides on silicon, and iron nanoclusters on silicon. The development of the enhanced MDS technique has relevance in the study of nanomaterials for the developing field of spintronics, where spin-polarisation of the incident helium beam can be used to determine surface spin-polarisation of technologically relevant materials.
