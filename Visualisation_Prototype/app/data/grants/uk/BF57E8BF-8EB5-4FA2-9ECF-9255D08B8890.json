{"id":"BF57E8BF-8EB5-4FA2-9ECF-9255D08B8890","title":"Conceptual Change as the Combination of Domain-Specific and Domain-General Mechanisms","abstractText":"<p>We typically evaluate children’s knowledge by how well they perform on tests designed to tap into underlying cognitive abilities. The problem with this approach is that there are many more ways to fail on tests than to pass so that failure may not necessarily reflect the true cognitive ability we are trying to evaluate. This research project focuses on two domains of knowledge that emerge early in children but undergo major change over the preschool years. In physical and psychological reasoning, preschool children generate models or “theories” to explain aspects of the physical world as well as the content or beliefs held in other people’s minds. These are essential and fundamental domains of common sense knowledge that every child needs to acquire before school. Traditionally, these two domains have been investigated separately but there is good evidence that they may change and develop through the shared activity of the mechanism of inhibitory control. Inhibition acts to suppress aspects of situations and tasks that interfere with successful performance. In a longitudinal design, we will follow up groups of pre-school children on measures of physical and psychological reasoning and determine how they are inter-related with changes to inhibitory control.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018955/1","grantId":"ES/E018955/1","fundValue":"340342","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  By elaborating current models of cognitive development Education Cultural","person":"Bruce MacFarlane Hood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" This research examined toddlers' ability to suppress impulsive thoughts and behaviours when reasoning in a variety of tasks Furthering the advancement of knowledge Education","dataset":"gtr"}
