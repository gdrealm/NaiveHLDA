The network aims to increase the competitiveness of UK HPC enabled science and innovation by improve the UK's community's engagement with USA's HPC community. A two pronged strategy focuses on supporting individual collaborations at the grass roots level through travel grants, as well as developing and maintaining links with USA university supercomputing centres, national laboratories and key organizations such as XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment); INCITE (Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment); and CASC (Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation).\n\nIn the previous year the EPSRC UK-USA HPC network funded 10, primarily early career, researchers to attend Supercomputing Conference (SC13) in Denver Colorado. This proven to be a popular initiative - we received 21 applications although the funding call was only advertised for two weeks. As detailed in our post-SC13 report this was found to be highly successful in creating new collaborations and professional relationships between the UK and USA. The network also catalyzed cooperation between CASC and the UK HPC-SIG. This has the potential to a unified network of across supercomputing centers at universities across the UK and USA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M019721/1","grantId":"EP/M019721/1","fundValue":"67786","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerard  Gorman","coPersons":["Lee  Margetts","Andrew  Richards","Mike  Ashworth"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
