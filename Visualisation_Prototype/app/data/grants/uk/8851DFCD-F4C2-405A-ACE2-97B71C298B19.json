At this early stage we see the impact as one of network development and capacity building, but with the prospect for joint research initiatives on, for example, sustainable housing growth and the living wage campaign in York. In the cultural and societal fields participants in the Goldsmiths and Newcastle seminars (Emma Jackson and Alex Schafran) organised the ReCAP related 'Lots of Planets Have a North' exhibition at the Tetley Gallery in Leeds on 26 September 2014. Friends of the Earth also made use of ReCAP discussions about the future governance of cities in their 'Big Ideas Change the World' literature review on Cities available at http://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/cities_interventions.pdf Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Simon Frank Parker","coPersons":["Stephen Douglas Graham","Rowland Graham  Atkinson","Caroline  Knowles"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" The ESRC Rethinking Centres and Peripheries (ReCAP) seminar series ran from January 2013 to November 2013 at the University of York, Goldsmiths College London University and Newcastle University. Bringing together academics from 3 leading northern and southern English urban research centres together with practitioners from local government, voluntary sector and non governmental organisations and the creative industries - a total of 19 papers were given and discussed. A high proportion of paper presenters and discussants were early career researchers who have sustained subsequent research collaborations. We hope to include several of these papers in the forthcoming book based on the seminar series edited by Simon Parker, Daryl Martin and Emma Jackson. Presentations were subsequently made available through audio podcasts on the Centre for Urban Research's website. Seminar presentations were supplemented by the showing of a documentary film and a walking tour of neighbourhood transition in East London. The seminar succeeded in its aspiration of an interdisciplinary critiquing and rethinking of the concept of 'core' and 'periphery' in the context of the UK's increasingly uneven urban and regional development by identifying examples of urban resilience and growth in the North and corresponding examples of vulnerability in London and the South. The social and cultural dynamics of local identity and belonging were explored alongside historic and contemporary policy initiatives aimed at addressing the highly topical problem of Britain's growing economic regional disparities. We see the research findings that were presented at the ReCAP seminars as forming part of a national and international conversation that includes the recently launched City Growth Commission report on 're-balancing' urban and regional communities in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash and 'the new austerity'. Our findings emphasise the value of human and social capital in building successful and more equitable urban communities and the importance of social diversity in generating employment and economic opportunity in 'peripheral' locations that would otherwise experience social and economic abandonment. The edited book based on the seminar series will include impact oriented studies drawn from a range of social, cultural and public policy interventions that will be of wide interest to a broad public and practitioner readership as well as academic researchers in a range of environmental and social science disciplines as well as the arts and humanities.
