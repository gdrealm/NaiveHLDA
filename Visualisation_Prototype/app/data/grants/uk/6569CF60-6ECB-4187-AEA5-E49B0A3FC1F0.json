{"id":"6569CF60-6ECB-4187-AEA5-E49B0A3FC1F0","title":"Patent Litigation and Takeovers","abstractText":"<p>Commentators argue that a technological gap exists between the United States and the European Union, fuelled by the different levels of protection of intellectual property (IP) rights. In particular, the US courts are perceived to have changed their attitude consistently since the 1980s toward a stronger patent protection, a change that prompted the creation of large patent portfolios by dominant US firms. Given that new innovations increasingly tend to be sequential, ie they build upon previously-patented art; large patent portfolios can have an effect of discouraging future innovation activities by start-up firms, which are often considered as the core source of new ideas. </p> \n<p>The objective of this project is to further our understanding of the impact of different levels of IP protection on the long-run innovation dynamics in such environments. In doing so, emphasis will be placed on the role of takeover deals (mutually advantageous out-of-court settlements) in cases of potential infringement, which are a common practise in the US but relatively rare in the EU. Specifically, the project aims (1) to formulate the argument through a mathematical model that can be computer-simulated and, (2) to calibrate the model using EU and US data, which hopefully can help form robust policy recommendations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E021891/1","grantId":"ES/E021891/1","fundValue":"79820","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"In Uck  Park","coPersons":["Andreas  Panagopoulos"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
