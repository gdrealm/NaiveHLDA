The CREST philosophy is that software engineering can be thought of as a search for good quality solutions within a potentially enormous search space, while balancing many different competing, sometimes conflicting, objectives. We believe that this philosophy is important in all engineering disciplines, but it is in Software Engineering where it finds its greatest potential. The materials and artifacts used in software engineering are very different; they are pure processes and information, essentially without physical manifestation. This makes the search--based optimisation agenda particularly apposite and offers the significant advantage of automation. The work supported by this platform proposal will develop, extend and disseminate this agenda of Automated Optimisation in Software Engineering.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G060525/1","grantId":"EP/G060525/1","fundValue":"1091080","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Harman","coPersons":["David John Clark","Jens  Krinke","Nicolas  Gold"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
