{"id":"2068F5E3-5DE5-491A-B8CD-7C320AA1F7C3","title":"The Development of Working Memory","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project is to build on previous psychological research with both children and adults to provide the most comprehensive model to date of the factors involved in the development of working memory performance in children. In doing so, the project will investigate the extent to which these factors are separable or inter-related. Also the project will assess how these factors contribute to mediating the strong relationships commonly observed between working memory and academic attainment.</p>\n\n<p>The research has four specific objectives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To determine whether age-related changes in short-term memory capacity are related to working memory development. </li>\n\n <li>To determine how age-related changes in processing speed are related to working memory development.</li>\n\n <li>To determine whether age-related changes in long-term memory utilisation are related to working memory development.</li>\n\n <li>To determine which of the above factors mediate the relationship between working memory performance and educational attainment.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These objectives will be met in a set of empirical studies, using both existing and novel experimental measures. These measures will be related to academic attainment and measures of classroom behaviour.&nbsp; Each study will involve large samples of children in two age groups (around 5 and around 9 years of age).<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H029397/1","grantId":"ES/H029397/1","fundValue":"460008","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Jarrold","coPersons":["John Nicholas Towse"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
