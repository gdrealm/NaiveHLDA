Finds at the site include imported Chinese pottery from as early as the 8th century AD, gold coins, and the oldest carbonised coffee bean in the world, as well as other material that gives insights into the lives of the community that occupied the site until its abandonment 700 years ago. Analysis of the finds will help archaologists to piece together the history of trade and development in the Indian Ocean in the years before European travellers and traders arrived.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112845/1","grantId":"112845/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2006-04-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Kennet","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
