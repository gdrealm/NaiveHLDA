The paradox in the long endeavour to supply safe blood - that new risks have emerged or been manufactured, even as progress is achieved- resonates with wider sociological discussions about the nature of risk in modern societies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project methods include socio legal analysis and qualitative methods such as interviews, which will generate new empirical data on the perspectives of patients, professionals, and policy makers about risk and safety in the supply of blood and blood products.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2751","grantId":"RES-062-23-2751","fundValue":"281045","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Busby","coPersons":["Anne-Maree  Farrell","Julie  Kent"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
