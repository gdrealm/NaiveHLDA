During processes such as development, where energy demands are high, insulin activates multiple biological switches that ultimately generates new mitochondria. Decreases in mitochondrial number and function, and/or the accumulation of damaged mitochondria accelerate the ageing process. Moreover dysfunctional mitochondria can drive the onset of a chronic inflammatory state that underpins to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Insulin-resistance is a hallmark of such age-associated diseases strongly suggesting that suppression of insulin-mediated mitochondrial production is a common route to ageing and disease. However, the biochemical reactions that link insulin stimulation to mitochondrial health are largely unmapped. Gaining a systems-level view into the signaling networks that link insulin stimulation to mitochondrial production is essential.\n\nWe aim to use a combination of genetic and phosphoproteomic technologies to map key biochemical reactions that are critical for insulin-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis. We are optimistic that a comprehensive understanding of these reactions will allow us to ultimately develop means to manipulate insulin signalling networks to improve well-being during the ageing process. \n\nUsing a novel genetic screen that we have recently developed, we first aim to comprehensively identify all genes required for mitochondrial health. This cost-effective screen that use computational algorithms to automatically measure mitochondrial shape in millions of single cells following inhibition of each gene in the genome one at a time. If inhibition of a particular gene leads to abnormally shaped mitochondria this strongly suggests a role for this gene in promoting mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\nWe have recently developed a cutting-edge mass-spectrometry based technology to monitor levels of protein phosphorylation on all proteins in a cell. Kinase proteins phosphorylate different proteins as a means to turn different proteins &quot;on&quot; on &quot;off&quot;. By monitoring all phosphorylation events that occur in cells following stimulation of insulin, we can then determine which proteins are likely to be regulated by insulin.\n\nBy completing these two aims we will thus identify sets of proteins that are both involved in mitochondrial health (through genetic screens completed in Aim 1), and that are regulated by insulin (through completion of Aim 2). \n\nIn order to determine the kinases that are responsible for phosphorylating substrates identified in Aims 1 and 2, we will then combine genetics and mass spectrometry to monitor protein phosphorylation following systematic inhibition of all kinases in insulin-treated cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J017450/1","grantId":"BB/J017450/1","fundValue":"655756","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Bakal","coPersons":["Claus  Jorgensen"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":" We have performed genome-scale RNAi screens for genes that contribute to mitochondrial shape and/or organisation in single cells. Through these screens we have characterised how hundreds of genes differentially affect mitochondrial shape and organisation in normal proliferative conditions, and thus are developing a unique resource for future studies by our laboratory and others. In particular, we have discovered a novel role for adhesion signalling in the regulation of mitochondrial morphogenesis. \n\nIn parallel, we have established conditions by which to monitor dynamic changes in mitochondrial shape and organisation in response to stimulation by Insulin Growth Factor.\n\nFinally, we have developed a new method (Woorboys et al.
