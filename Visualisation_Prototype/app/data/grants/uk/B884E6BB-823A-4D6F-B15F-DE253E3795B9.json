However in South Africa, and other developing countries, many people with HIV die because they cannot access ART in time, usually because of the lack of health service capacity. A big problem is dependence on doctors, even though nurses provide most primary health care. The health department of the Free State province of South Africa wants to deploy nurses to prescribe ART, if they can be shown to be effective and cost effective compared to doctors and so, together with the national health department, has supported this study. The central study is a randomised controlled trial. 31 clinics providing ART have been randomly allocated either to the ?control arm? of the trial, which will continue with current practice (doctor-led ART) or to the ?intervention arm?, which will implement nurse-led ART. Nurse led-ART will include extra training and managerial support for nurses, and authorising the nurses to prescribe ART. We will follow two groups of patients, for between one and two years. One group will be patients recently enrolled with the programme, who are eligible for ART, or likely to become eligible during the trial. We will compare the survival among these patients in either arm of the trial, to test our hypothesis that nurse-led ART will lead to starting treatment earlier and thus to lower mortality. The other group will be patients who have already received ART for at least 6 months. In these patients we will compare suppression of HIV levels in blood (the main biological effect of ART), to evalutedlonger-term monitoring is better or worse in either arm. We will compare the cost effectiveness of nurse- and doctor-led ART in terms of survival and quality of life. Information on survival and health service costs will come from the randomised trial. We will also interview a random sample of 1000 patients to assess their quality of life and costs of illness and health care. Finally, we will interview patients, professionals and managers, and watch training sessions and clinical encounters, to deepen our understanding about what helps or hinders ART provision. If the trial shows that nurse-led ART is effective and cost effective, it will promote faster expansion of ART in South Africa and other developing countries where nurses provide most primary health care.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800605","grantId":"G0800605","fundValue":"816301","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Max Oscar  Bachmann","coPersons":["Carl Jacobus Lombard","Garry Richard Barton","Merrick Flynn Zwarenstein","Simon Arnold Lewin","Joanne  Stein","Eric Donn Bateman"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
