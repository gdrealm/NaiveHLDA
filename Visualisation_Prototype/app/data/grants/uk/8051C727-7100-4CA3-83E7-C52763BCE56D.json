{"id":"8051C727-7100-4CA3-83E7-C52763BCE56D","title":"SILAC analysis of compartmentalised Ras signalling","abstractText":"We are interested in Ras proteins that sit near the top of many cell signalling pathways and control key cellular functions such as proliferation, migration and cell death. Cells contain three almost identical versions (isoforms) that differ only in their preferred locations within the cell. These overlapping localisations are believed to underlie the biological differences known to exist between the isoforms. This model suggests that by operating from different platforms within the cell, Ras isoforms will come into contact with distinct pools of activators and downstream signalling proteins. We plan to test this model by targetting Ras to each of the different organelles where it is known to reside and compare the signals that are produced. We will use new technology that enables the responses of networks containing thousands of proteins to be precisely analysed. Our datasets will be mined to reveal likely relationships between signalling from each compartment and functional outputs that will be confirmed using cell-based assays. Together these data will provide a comprehensive picture of compartment-specific signalling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G018162/1","grantId":"BB/G018162/1","fundValue":"282115","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2012-11-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  we successfully established novel cell reagents and proteomic profiling pipelines to assay compartmentalised Ras signalling. We found that each subcellular location generates a distinct signalling output and characterised the defining features of compartment-specific Ras signalling networks. The methods also created a capacity to perform large scale cell signalling characterisation that has resulted in further successful grant funding.

These observations inform our understanding of how the family of Ras proteins work and potentially helps to explain how closely related family members generate different outputs. Compartment-specific Ras signalling has emerged as an important model in Ras research in recent years. Our data provide a comprehensive overview of this phenomenon that will be of broad interest to researchers in this area. We are in the process of publishing our data which will allow researchers to access compartment-specific quantitative data on &gt;2000 proteins and phosphosites.
