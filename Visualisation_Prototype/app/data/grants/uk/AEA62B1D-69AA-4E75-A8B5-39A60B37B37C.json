Such research could ultimately help geneticists screen for a variety of conditions in which language is affected, including Alzheimer's, Specific Language Impairment, autism, schizophrenia and depression. It could also contribute to our understanding of how human language evolved, and the profiling methodology could be applied to forensic linguistic analyses. For practical reasons, easily administered quantitative tests of language (e.g. mean length of utterance/sentence; scores on multiple-choice tests; reaction times) have been favoured in psychological and clinical research into language, but linguists have long recognised that much of what characterises the human linguistic ability is qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. There are presently inadequate means for characterising the qualitative aspects of language in ways that geneticists can use, and this project aims to identify analytic approaches that can translate the complexity and richness of language into something countable, so that mathematical probabilities can be calculated (See Objective 1).\\n\\nThe data are 600-word exam essays written at the age of 17 by members of a large Twin Study cohort in Queensland, Australia. These essays will be used to test a wide range of analytic techniques for the quantification or pseudo-quantification of features of the texts, resulting in a linguistic profile for each subject. The essays constitute an excellent linguistic resource in their own right, but their value is multiply enhanced by their Twin Study provenance. Twin studies are a highly effective way to explore the role of genes and environment in relation to a variable. Sophisticated statistical methods calculate the amount of variation between identical twins (who share all their DNA) and non-identical twins (whose DNA varies at the same rate as in non-twin siblings), while factoring in their shared experiences as siblings. \\n\\nThe individual subject profiles that are produced using the analyses found to be most effective and practical to administer will be passed to the Twin Study collaborators for trial multivariate analyses, to see if they have potential as external markers (phenotypes) of genetic differences (Objective 2). These trial analyses will be too small to reveal genuine effects, but they will establish the robustness of the input values. The outcome of the project will be a small set of analyses judged to have potential for phenotyping on a larger scale in a future international collaboration (Objective 3). \\n\\nThe project aims to maximise the range of expert input by inviting sub-field specialists to engage in small-scale trial analyses of the data using existing or new methods. The external contributions will be supplemented by those of in-house experts and early career staff, including a part time research assistant, to create an exciting research environment that fosters creativity and provides opportunities and mentoring for junior colleagues. The project will push the boundaries of the emerging activity in Medical Humanities (Objective 5), while breaking new ground in the quantification of qualitative features of language (Objective 4).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E001874/1","grantId":"AH/E001874/1","fundValue":"82048","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Margaret Wray","coPersons":["Tess  Fitzpatrick"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We used essays written by identical and non-identical 17 year old twins to trial a range of linguistic profiling tools. These tools capture quantitatively different features, many qualitative in nature. We were interested in which tools were both meaningful in linguistic terms and also useable in research that requires reliable quantitative data--in this case, genetics. We examined the results from our analyses in relation to a range of cognitive measures collected by our collaborators (Epidemiologists at the Queensland Medical Research Institute) as part of their wider twin study. Although the data set was too small to directly determine whether there is a genetic component to linguistic variation, we did establish which tools would be most appropriate for ascertaining that on a larger sample in the future. The variables that we concluded as most useful are: idea density (using CPIDR), syntactic complexity (using Fichtner's C), latent semantic analysis (using Coh Metrix), and two measures of lexical diversity, Advanced Guiraud 1000 and Baayen's P. We have developed this research further through a series of other grants, most notably an ESRC project (PI Fitzpatrick) that examined word association responses in teenage and in over-65 yr old twins, and in a BRACE funded project (PI Wray) that is using the same profiling techniques plus word association responses to look at markers of future risk of Alzheimer's disease.
