The dominant narrative is that from the middle of the nineteenth century until after the Second World War, the family was a stable unit organised around a core nuclear or extended unit headed by a married couple. It tends to be assumed that the decline in marriage and multiple family forms are a recent development which can be attributed to the increase in divorce, remarriage, co-habitation and single parenthood since the late 1970s. For example, a recent policy document from the Children's Society claimed that in the past two centuries paid work for mothers has dramatically increased, children are cared for by someone other than their parents and that there is a rise in 'family break-up'. Both the emphasis of the report and subsequent media coverage accord with the common contemporary refrain which bemoans the decline of marriage, the break up of the 'traditional' family and the negative effects of women working, developments which are all seen as relatively recent. Yet the historical evidence of the past few centuries for Western Europe suggests that because of death, desertion and separation, marriages have been far from stable, the structure of the family has been fluid and complex and children frequently may have been looked after by someone other than their parents. Moreover, in Scotland divorce has existed since the Reformation, irregular marriage was legally valid until 1939 and co-habitation with repute until 2006. By providing a long -term historical perspective on the nature of marriage and the family, the project will focus on the complex nature of changing cultural patterns and values. A better understanding of the historical dimension of marriage will help us to interpret the present by avoiding simplistic and over-generalised views of change and continuity in marital and family relationships. An awareness of the variability and complexity of parental partnerships and marriage relationships in the past will help to interpret current patterns and also to formulate future policy options. \\nThe research will be both qualitative and quantative and will be based on a variety of sources, including archival, judicial, newspaper, representational and oral. The outputs will benefit the academic community of social and cultural historians, sociologists and those in social policy. The results will be disseminated through a variety of means including conference and seminar papers, academic journals and a published monograph. Outputs will also include databases of household information which will be deposited in the UK Data Archive. In conjunction with Teaching and Learning Scotland we will also produce an e-pack for use in schools. A website based on the project will also be developed. We intend to disseminate our results to the non-academic community by making our working papers available to organisations including the Centre for Families and Relationships, SAY women, Scottish Women's Aid, the Women's Support Group and the Glasgow Women's Library and by posting them on our website. In addition, we intend to host two one-day workshops aimed at relevant practitioners, policymakers and researchers, an international colloquium and an exhibition of the project's findings for a public audience. \\nThe proposed study seeks to fill a serious gap in the social and cultural history of Scotland and therefore Britain. It will also inform international historical debates about marriage and the family. The project will provide sound empirical evidence about the nature of working-class marriages and family in the past in the belief that a better understanding of their historical roots will aid in interpreting the present and in formulating policies for the future. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002542/1","grantId":"AH/J002542/1","fundValue":"791844","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Eleanor Jean Gordon","coPersons":["Annmarie  Hughes","Rosemary  Elliot"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
