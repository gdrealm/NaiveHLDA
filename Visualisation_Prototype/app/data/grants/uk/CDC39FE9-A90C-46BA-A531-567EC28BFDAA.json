Certainly, some non-researchers have heard of the work. I've given public lecturers, and all our subjects were debriefed at the end of the experiments, thus exposing dozens of members of the community to research on aging and cognitive neuroscience. The results from the aging experiments were included in teaching lectures, small group teaching, and workshops, drawing strong interest from students.

Our project tested this prediction, by using the electro- encephalography technique, which allows a millisecond-by-millisecond analysis of how the brain responds to visual information. Healthy participants ranging from age 19 to 98 performed a well- characterised face recognition task, while brain activity was measured. We have developed a technique that allows us to determine precisely when the visual system is sensitive to\ninformation that is necessary to recognise a face. Our results demonstrate that indeed the time course of the brain sensitivity to task-related information is delayed with senescence, with an estimated trend of 1 millisecond per year, or 50 ms between 20 and 70 - a lot of processing time for neurons! These results will be important for the development of new techniques for evaluating age-related visual deteriorations. These results were published in international neuroscience journals, and presented at conferences and in lectures. The success of the project relied on the development of new tools and an unusual approach to ERP analysis / ageing research. The tools have been incorporated into a freely available Matlab toolbox, thus ensuring wider dissemination of the research findings: https://gforge.dcn.ed.ac.uk/gf/project/limo_eeg/\nThe philosophy behind the approach has been publicised in talks, papers and workshops, and I hope has helped improve the research quality in fields beyond those of my original research project.
