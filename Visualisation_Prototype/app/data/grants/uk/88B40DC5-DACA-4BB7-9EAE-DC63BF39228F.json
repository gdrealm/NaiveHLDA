{"id":"88B40DC5-DACA-4BB7-9EAE-DC63BF39228F","title":"Spatial and vertical patterns in the megabenthos of Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula","abstractText":"We propose to use the ROV Isis to determine the spatial variation and fine resolution of zonation of megabenthos over a ~3000m depth range in Marguerite Bay, off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Few observations of the deep Antarctic fauna have been made to abyssal depths so the use of Isis to carry out transects across the slope of the Peninsula is unique. This proposal is timely as the ROV is committed to Antarctic science and this proposal will give a value-added component of using the ROV in Antarctic waters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D008352/1","grantId":"NE/D008352/1","fundValue":"43046","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Tyler","coPersons":["Andrew  Clarke","Alex David Rogers"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
