{"id":"CCEE5CA8-EF6E-41AC-8970-75F3E53451F4","title":"Innovative Forging and Fabrication Solutions for the Nuclear Industry","abstractText":"The Sheffield Hallam team will conduct novel experiments to characterise mechanical properties of formed and thick\nsection components from large forgings. Initial work will focus on developing the specimen design and test strategy using\n3D Digital Image Correlation (3DDIC) to obtain Crack Tip Opening Angle (CTOA) resistance curves for the material; post\nweld heat treated conditions will be of primary concern. Using CTOA measurements and crack extension data is an\nestablished method of determining both KIc and JIc, using data from 3DDIC has been applied to thin section specimens\nand will need adapting for thick sections particularly for uneven crack front phenomena.\nOnce specimen geometries and test techniques have been established the results will be compared to data for the same\nmaterial obtained using standard test methods according to BS EN to the UK Civil Nuclear code. This will serve as\nvalidation of the suitability of DIC to determine fracture properties of the material.\nHaving validated the technique a series of tests comparing different heat treatment procedures and different regions of\ninterest in the forging (determined by SFIL) will be evaluated. The results of these tests will be compared to the\nmicrostructural properties of the different specimens and optimal treatments identified.\nRunning concurrently with DIC based fracture toughness measurements will be a benchmarking fatigue program at\nelevated temperature (c.700C) using the current treatment parameters for the material. This will provide baseline high\ntemperature fatigue properties. Once optimal microstructures are determined based on fracture toughness results a\nsecond set of fatigue tests will be conducted using the ideal structure at elevated temperature to confirm any increase in\nperformance.\nOnce initial fracture characterisation is complete development work will start on acquiring high temperature values of KIc\nand JIc, the equipment to adapt the currently available DIC hardware at SHU has been factored in and the potential results\nare deemed to be of high value both to the academic community and the lead partner. A systematic approach drawing on experience within SHU and LaVision (hardware supplier) and a working relationship with Instron UK will enable trials to\ntake place with relative ease. Development work is likely to focus on the finer points of obtaining robust correlation from\nthe high temperature surface, namely speckle pattern retention and reducing interference from the emitted photons from\nthe specimen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508482/1","grantId":"EP/N508482/1","fundValue":"138010","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Thomas Asquith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
