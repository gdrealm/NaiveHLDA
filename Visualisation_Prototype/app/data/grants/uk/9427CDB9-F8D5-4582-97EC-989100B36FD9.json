{"id":"9427CDB9-F8D5-4582-97EC-989100B36FD9","title":"A late Byzantine Book of Ceremonies: A study, with English translation and commentary","abstractText":"The ceremonial of the Byzantine court expressed the unchanging majesty and grandeur of the empire to foreign visitors and to the empire's subjects. It also conveyed contemporary messages. The fourteenth-century treatise which is the subject of my study is one of three surviving text that describe ceremonial. It is particularly detailed in its delineation of the clothing of court officials, their hats and insignia, and their functions. My study will show how the treatise relates to the earlier ceremonial books and what it can tell us about the times in which it was composed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112978/1","grantId":"112978/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-04-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Macrides","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
