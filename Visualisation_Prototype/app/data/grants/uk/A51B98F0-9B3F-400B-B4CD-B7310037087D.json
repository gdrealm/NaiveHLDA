{"id":"A51B98F0-9B3F-400B-B4CD-B7310037087D","title":"Prevalence of bullying in secondary school by SEN type: Analysis of combined NPD and LSYPE data files","abstractText":"<p>Studies suggest that about 10 per cent&nbsp;of all 11-18-year-olds are bullied at least 'sometimes' at school. Although bullying of pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN) has been less studied, it does to seem to increase the risk to around 50 per cent, and if so, it may be that bullying is a factor impeding the social inclusion in schools of pupils with SEN. This research is seeking answers to these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Are pupils with SEN bullied more than other pupils in secondary school?</li>\n\n <li>What are the relative risks of being bullied of the different categories of SEN?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Attempting to answer these questions involves analysing information about pupils' experiences of being bullied contained in two Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) pupil databases. These are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>The Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE); </li>\n\n <li>The National Pupil Database (NPD).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The research will be conducted under the auspices of Aston University which has granted ethical approval for the study through its Research Ethics Committee. The applicants expect the findings to be of practical use to educational policy-makers, teachers, parents and researchers who are involved with secondary school pupils in England and beyond.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H021558/1","grantId":"ES/H021558/1","fundValue":"27047","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Brian  Naylor","coPersons":["Jeremy  Dawson","Eric  Emerson","Digby  Tantam","Stephen  Walters"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
