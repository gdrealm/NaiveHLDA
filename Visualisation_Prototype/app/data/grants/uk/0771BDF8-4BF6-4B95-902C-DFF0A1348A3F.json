This mainly gaseous envelope around us performs many vital functions e.g. it protects us from harmful ultraviolet light (high energy light) from the Sun through the stratospheric ozone layer. Through the water cycle, clouds are formed in the atmosphere that redistributes water in the Earth systems. These clouds also cool the planet by acting like mirrors, reflecting some of the energy from the Sun back to outer space. This cooling mechanism is essential to the Earth system to permit an equitable surface temperature to exist that allows all the diverse life forms on it to exist. As well as this natural cooling mechanism, so called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (e.g. carbon dioxide, CO2 and methane CH4) absorb infrared energy released by the Earth and trap some of it, very similar to the analogy of putting on a blanket and warm the Earth's surface up. Both these natural cooling and warming mechanisms are essential to a habitable surface and as long as they stay in balance, the surface temperature will remain reasonably constant. However, over the last 200 years humans have been increasing the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and evidence shows that this is leading to an overall warming of the surface of the Earth. The consequences of even a modest increase in average global surface temperature are significant for human, animal and plant life.\n\nIt is known that chemicals released naturally by plants (unsaturated organic molecules such as alkenes) can react with oxidants in the atmosphere to produce extremely fast reacting intermediates, so called Criegee intermediates (CI). However, recent studies by us have shown that these Criegee intermediates react rapidly with a number of species present in the atmosphere such as sulphur dioxide (SO2). Ultimately, these reactions lead to the formation of sulphuric acid, which is very good at promoting aerosol formation (cloud precursors). Under polluted environments, aerosol formation may have detrimental effects on health but in the background atmosphere, promotion of cloud formation leads to a cooling of the Earth's surface. We have assessed the possible impact of these natural emissions of chemicals using computer models of the atmosphere and it appears that this process may be very important in producing cloud precursors and therefore be having an important impact on the Earth's climate (cooling it). \n\nHowever, we have only been able to investigate the reactions of two possible Criegee intermediates and there are potentially thousands of different ones. Whilst it would be impossible to study them all and indeed not a sensible endeavour, it is important to study different types of Criegee intermediates. If they all have a similar reactivity then the impact on the atmosphere is likely to be true and would then be important to include in climate models. In order to investigate how quickly these Criegee intermediates react with species such as SO2 we have devised an experiment in the laboratory that takes advantage of recent developments in optics. Using laser light to generate these Criegee intermediates we will be able to detect them using a highly sensitive technique called cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS). In the experiment the Criegee intermediate is generated in a closed system where light is trapped between two highly reflective mirrors. As the light bounces backwards and forwards between the mirrors it may be absorbed by the Criegee intermediate and so less light is left. The greater the level of Criegee intermediate made the less light is reflected back and forth and so we have a way to measure this species. In this way we will be able to investigate how fast these Criegee intermediates react with a number of important gases in the Earth's atmosphere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K004905/1","grantId":"NE/K004905/1","fundValue":"385951","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-01-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Dudley  Shallcross","coPersons":["Andrew  Orr-Ewing"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
