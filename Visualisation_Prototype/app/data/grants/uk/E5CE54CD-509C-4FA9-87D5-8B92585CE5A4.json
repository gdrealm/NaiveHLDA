The ISSP is one of the most important attempts at undertaking cross-national survey research that currently exist. Originally started in 1985 by research teams from Australia, Great Britain, the United States and the then West Germany, its membership now extends to 41 teams from countries that between them extend to all five of the inhabited continents. Its aim is to facilitate in depth study of cross-national variation in attitudes towards subjects of global importance and interest.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the programme is not, however, simply to visit one topic and then move on to another. Rather it is that topics should be revisited on a regular basis. This means that the programme not only provides a means of examining cross-national differences at one point in time but also cross-national differences in trends over time. Over the next three years ISSP will address three topics. One is entirely new, ‘Leisure and Sports’, to be fielded in 2007. Thereafter the programme will in 2008 visit ‘Religion’ for a third time and then in 2009, ‘Social Inequality’ for a fourth time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-501-25-0001","grantId":"RES-501-25-0001","fundValue":"112919","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Park","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
