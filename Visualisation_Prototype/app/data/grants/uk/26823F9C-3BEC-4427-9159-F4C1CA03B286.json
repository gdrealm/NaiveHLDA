{"id":"26823F9C-3BEC-4427-9159-F4C1CA03B286","title":"Printing the Moon","abstractText":"The primary aim of this project is to deliver a workshop to schools based around the concepts of space, data and 3D printing. The goal is for school pupils to print parts of the moon and then use these physical objects to make simple measurements of lunar dimensions, akin to a standard first year university experiment using shadow data from lunar photographs.\n\nThe workshop will explore a range of topics, from the lunar history, lunar exploration, lunar surveying and the role of satellites, but at its core will be the use of real satellite data from NASA and exploring how this can be manipulated into a form that can be printed out. The goal is to bring the excitement and wonder of space into the classroom as a physical object.\n\nThe impact will be to deepen pupils understanding of space and space technology, and to bring them into contact with disruptive technology, 3D printing, that will give them new skills and experiences that will be beneficial across the school curriculum (specifically the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence in the context of this proposal). We simply want to make space a less ephemeral thing that exists beyond our reach and show that space objects have form and that space technology can be used to probe this, giving us rich new understanding of how our solar system, how our Universe operates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002276/1","grantId":"ST/M002276/1","fundValue":"9968","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  McGloin","coPersons":["Soko  Matsumura"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
