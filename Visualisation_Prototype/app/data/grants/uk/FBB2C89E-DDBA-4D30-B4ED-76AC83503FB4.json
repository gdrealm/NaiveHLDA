The chemistry that is proposed to be developed will also allow structural analogues of the natural substance to be readily prepared such that, following biological screening, more potent substances can be identified.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E011217/1","grantId":"EP/E011217/1","fundValue":"299995","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2010-01-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We understand that Novartis and UCB have used our synthesis route to aspercyclide A to make this for testing in their assays.

The research proposed here was geared towards the development of an efficient chemical preparation of a natural substance, (+)-aspercyclide A, that is known to inhibit a key protein-protein recognition event involved in all allergic pathways and which could represent a crucial lead for the development of new preventative treatments for allergic disorders. The total synthesis was completed via two racemic routes and the biological activities of the two enantiomers, which were separated by CSP-HPLC, were evaluated by ELISA and found to reside almost exclusively in the natural (+)-enantiomer. An enantioselective synthesis was also developed and this route used to prepare analogues whose activity is still being evaluated. The leads have potential for drug development in the anti-asthma arena. The research is ongoing with an EU Marie-Curie Grant. it is expected that more potent and potentially druggable analogues of this natural product will emerge.
