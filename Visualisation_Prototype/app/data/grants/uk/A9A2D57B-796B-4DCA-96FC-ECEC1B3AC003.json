{"id":"A9A2D57B-796B-4DCA-96FC-ECEC1B3AC003","title":"Small Grant for Visiting Researcher Professor Marek Kimmel, Rice University","abstractText":"Systems Biology (SB) seeks to understand the workings of biological systems as a whole, placing a greater emphasis on the interactions between components, and the consequences of such interactions, than on the molecular components themselves. As such mathematical modelling and statistical analysis are key theoretical tools. Such work is considered to be of great importance to a better understanding of an enormously broad range of biological and medical priorities such as disease mechanisms, pharmaceutical drug discovery, drug target validation, and horticulture and agriculture. Dr Kimmel is an internationally leading expert in three areas which are central to this research: branching processes (particularly theory and applications in cell biology and genetics); statistical aspects of genetics and genomics; and mathematical modelling of cellular signaling systems. This grant is to fund a visit of four and a half months to the University of Warwick to mutually strengthen research in these areas and to encourage new collaborations between researchers at Dr Kimmel's group, and researchers at Warwick and elsewhere with interests in Systems Biology or the mathematical/statistical skills to contribute to it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J006653/1","grantId":"EP/J006653/1","fundValue":"23974","fundStart":"2011-09-05","fundEnd":"2012-09-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work open up a new collaboration ob NF-kappaB signalling and the immune system.
