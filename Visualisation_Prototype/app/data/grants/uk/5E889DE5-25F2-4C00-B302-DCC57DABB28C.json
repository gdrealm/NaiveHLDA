Green supply chain integration and its performance implication","abstractText":"<p>In recent years firms are under pressure to reduce environmental impacts of their global supply chains. Customers in many developed countries intend to accuse or boycott firms lacking environmental responsibility if their developing-country supply chain partners are convicted of causing environmental damage. This has triggered the needs for suppliers and customers to coordinate environmental management practices.</p>\n\n<p>This research proposes a novel concept for environmental collaboration among suppliers and customers. The new concept, called “green supply chain integration”, involves the strategic collaboration of partner firms in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities by coordinating the intra- and inter-organisational processes. This concept extends the concept of environmental collaboration by integrating environmental management systems across a supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>The research is anticipated to identify effective practices of green supply chain integration that can simultaneously improve operational and environmental performance of firms from developing and developed countries. It contributes to the understanding of policy issues and helps to reframe debates surrounding the adverse effects of the environmental regulation differences between developed and developing countries. The outcomes of this research help to advance knowledge on environmental collaboration and sustainability within the business and management discipline.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J016799/2","grantId":"ES/J016799/2","fundValue":"70593","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research reveals strategic collaboration among suppliers and customers in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities is becoming mainstream.

The research argues that a novel approach to integrating environmental management best practices among suppliers and customers is needed. The findings reveal in practice strategic collaboration among suppliers and customers in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities is becoming mainstream. Both the systematic literature review and survey data reveal that firms have started to integrate green supply chain management practices into four different parties, from integration across internal functions to supplier and customer, and even coordination with other stakeholders such as governmental and non-governmental organisations. Our analyses of the survey data confirm findings these four novel concepts (called green supply chain integration) being used in practice for the first time; hence, lay the ground for future research. The findings can be taken forward or put to use by other researchers - they can apply the theoretical conceptualization of the green supply chain integration and its empirical evidence to further advance theories related to environmental supply chain management in a complex supply chain. Other researchers should consider adopting a multiple dimensional measure of each type of green supply chain integration in order to examine the real extent of the novel green supply chain management concepts.\n\nThe findings can be taken forward or put to use by practitioners - especially for those firms that have responded to the survey, they can use the list of green supply chain management practices to first diagnose their practices and benchmark their practices with other survey respondents. They can then learn from the case studies of this research to identify effectives ways to improve both operations and environmental performance through applying the green supply chain integration approaches identified by this research.
