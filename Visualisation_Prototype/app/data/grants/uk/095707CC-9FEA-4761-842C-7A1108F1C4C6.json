Methodologically themed seminars (photography, video and film, creative arts, space and place and new visual technologies) provided a timely opportunity for cross-disciplinary intellectual focus on the theoretical and methodological contribution of visual research and its implications for social science theory and research practice.\n\nEstablished new networks:\nSeminars and public events were attended by early career and established academics, public and third sector organisations, creative artists and film-makers, enabling connections within and across disciplines and sectors, generating new multi-disciplinary networks of academics, policy-makers and practitioners and enabling new forms of community engagement and collaboration. \n\nNew research capacity:\nA combination of academic seminars supported by a programme of events which engaged local communities and research users enabled the series to develop new research activity, not least a programme of co-produced, participatory research with communities and a collection of methodologically and theoretically informed scientific outputs elaborating the potential of critically focused, participatory research.\n\nContribution to empirical understanding, methods and theory\nThe seminar series generated seventeen journal articles including a special issue in Critical Social Policy with contributions spanning sociology, social policy, history, education, and health. Additional papers from the series are published in methodological, policy, community nursing and education journals and include contributions to themed issues on childhood, creative methods and video analysis.\n\nEstablished new networks:\nThe seminars and events involved over two hundred participants as speakers, discussants and workshop hosts, facilitating the development of new networks spanning disciplines and sectors and considerably extending the networks of the award holders and participants. Award holders have been invited to present and host workshops (summarised in 1c). Partnerships have crossed traditional disciplinary boundaries, for example, the artist Miranda Sharpe's collaborations with Fink and Lomax and psychologist and film maker John Oates culminating in a first academic publication (Sharp, 2012) and a significant contribution to course production at the Open University.\n\nNew research capacity\nNew collaborations have generated collaborative research bidding (ESRC, AHRC Connected Communities, British Academy, Leverhulme) and collaborative writing. For early career researchers this has included first journal submissions, international speaking opportunities and participatory film-making experience. \n\n- Six seminars: Here's looking at you: Photographic practices and methods (Jan 2010); Visual narratives in video and film (June 2010); Creative arts: Methods and practices for engaging with social inequalities (Oct 2010); The politics of space and place (Jan 2011); New visual technologies: Challenges &amp; opportunities for inequalities research (May 2011) and A new visual agenda? (Sep 2011)\n- Seventeen journal articles as described and listed on ROS\n- A programme of public events as described in section 2a including film screenings at the International Visual Methods Conference; Milton Keynes Gallery; Woughton Community Council; Milton Keynes Learning Network)\n- Over twenty conferences papers, including a keynote address to the ESRC Methods Festival (Rose, 2012 ) ; keynote address to the inaugural conference of the International Association of Visual Urbanists (Rose, 2012); key note to the Children's Services Conference (Whiting, 2012); papers to the British Sociological Association Annual Conference (Lomax 2011; Fink, 2o12); the International Qualitative Research Conference (Whiting, 2012); the 2nd International Visual Methods Conference (Fink, 2012; Lomax, 2012) and Assets for Health and Wellbeing Across the Life Course International Conference (Whiting, 2012).\n- Significant contribution to the planning and organising of the International Visual Methods Conference attended by over 200 international delegates and including art walks, gallery trips, film screening and exhibitions. A review of the conference can be fund in Mannay (2013 in press) in Visual Studies. \n- A project website with news, outputs and resources averaging 500 visits per month during the life of the series.\n\n- The photographer Vicky Lamburn worked alongside Fink and Lomax in the generation of visual data for the empirical work and public engagement activities. Her book 'Impression Milton Keynes' acknowledges the support of the seminar series.\n- The visual artist Miranda Sharp presented her work at seminar two, from which she developed and published her first academic paper (Sharp, 2011).\n- Early career researchers and arts practitioners have, as a result of the series generated publications (Lamburn 2012; Martin, 2012; Moore, 2013; Wilkins, 2012; Whiting, 2011, 2012); received opportunities to host international workshops (Mannay, 2012) and new collaborations with practice (Singh, 2010) and with established academics (Lomax et al, 2011).\n- The editors of Critical Social Policy, who published the special issue from the Series noted its unique contribution and deployment of the visual; a first for the journal 'expand(ing) its horizons significantly'.\n- In order to engage with audiences beyond the series, the award holders have contributed over twenty workshops, papers, film screenings and exhibitions to academic, third sector and public audiences at international conferences, research groups and publics, including: The Festival of Social Science (Rose, 2012; Lomax, 2012; ESRC Seminar Series, Women in the 1950s (Fink and Lomax, 2011); ESRC Seminar Series, Alternative Discourses of Childhood (Fink, 2012); International Visual Methods Annual Conference (Fink, 2011: Lomax, 2012; Rose, 2012); and Assets for health and wellbeing across the life Course International Conference (Whiting, 2011).
