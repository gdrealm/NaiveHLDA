{"id":"E84AFC68-BCDF-4FF4-9219-EFDD2D254B58","title":"Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance","abstractText":"This research addresses the novel responses by government to the role of religion in public life by investigating the emerging significance of Muslim religious values, practices and engagement within contemporary governance. It explores: how current government strategies and policies relating to citizenship recognise and respond to Muslim religious difference; how participatory forms of governance engage with Muslim groups, religious values and identities; and the impact of Muslims' participation in governance on policy processes and outcomes and for the organisation of and relations between Muslim civil society organisations more broadly.\\nThe research explores these issues through analysis of national and local government policies and statements relating to citizenship, equalities, integration and diversity, considering how these refer to and recognise Muslim religious difference. This is extended by qualitative research with state and Muslim actors involved in participatory governance exploring how their understandings of religious identities, values and practices shape their engagement and the impact of this on policy processes and outcomes. \\nThe research analyses and compares these processes at national and local levels investigating how different contexts may produce different governance practices and understandings of the role of Muslims in public life, and variations in local responses to national level policies and statements. The research explores how and why some Muslim groups and actors enter into governance at these levels, and the impact this has on relations between Muslim civil society organisations. These questions are investigated through empirical work at national level and in three localities: Birmingham, Leicester and Tower Hamlets. These areas are selected as they have significant, different and diverse Muslim populations, varying ethnic and religious demographic profiles and where the politics of governing religion and diversity are quite different.\\nThe research team brings together wide-ranging expertise in the fields of governance, participation, Islam, multicultural citizenship, public policy and local politics and includes: Dr O'Toole (PI, University of Bristol), who has considerable research experience in the fields of political participation, governance, local and community politics and qualitative research; Professor Modood (CI, University of Bristol) who is a leading authority on multiculturalism, British Muslims and citizenship and has a track record of public engagement on these issues; Dr Meer (research consultant, University of Southampton) who has carried out extensive research on Muslim, multicultural and race equality politics; and an External Advisory Group of local and national publicly engaged experts. The team will also employ one Research Officer for 30 months to assist in research design and implementation and one Research Associate for 12 months to assist with local case-study fieldwork.\\nThe research will inform current debates on multiculturalism, cohesion, citizenship, the role of religion - and particularly Islam - in public life, and the interplay between secular and religious values in participatory governance. It will be of value to academic, policy-maker and civil society audiences. The research will engage over the life of the project with these audiences by: working with an External Advisory Group; publishing outputs for academic audiences; hosting a national conference and three workshops in the three localities to engage academic, policy-maker, practitioner and civil society actors. The team will also produce a research report and policy briefings to maximise the impact of the research findings.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H016066/1","grantId":"AH/H016066/1","fundValue":"328947","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Therese  O'Toole","coPersons":["Tariq  Modood"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Taking Part: Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance  Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government/ Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
