{"id":"4F67C921-C2CF-4C20-A0DA-3BD2F68C7654","title":"The psychology of credit card repayments","abstractText":"<p>Minimum payments on credit card bills protect those who would otherwise make no repayment by preventing their debt from growing exponentially. However, for those paying off part of the bill, minimum payment information leads people to pay off less than they would if this information were omitted. This is an instance of the psychological phenomenon of anchoring, in which an arbitrary number influences people's judgments. Although existing theories of anchoring predict the basic finding that including minimum payment information reduces actual repayments, they do not explain how small variations in the minimum payment lead to the observed big variations in actual repayments. </p>\n\n<p>The first programme of experiments will systematically examine this effect in a variety of domains, providing data which constrain the development of new theories of anchoring. In addition, a large-scale analysis of actual credit card repayment data will examine the phenomenon in the real world. The research also has an applied component. The cost of anchoring on minimum payments is estimated to be large; the second programme of experiments will examine the effects of manipulations, currently under consideration by UK and US regulators, which are intended to improve people's decisions about credit card repayment.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G031142/1","grantId":"ES/G031142/1","fundValue":"74937","fundStart":"2009-04-10","fundEnd":"2010-08-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Stewart","coPersons":["William John Matthews"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
