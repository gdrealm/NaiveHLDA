This project will offer a unique attempt to build bridges between political science and political biography by drawing from both approaches to provide an empirically-rich, yet theoretically informed, account of the contemporary nature of the British core executive.&nbsp;It brings together a team with a strong track-record in researching the British core executive, alongside&nbsp;senior politician David Blunkett, to study the work of&nbsp; two Whitehall departments&nbsp;- the DfEE 1997-2001 and the Home Office 2001-04.&nbsp;The aim is to understand and interpret the nature of the policy-making process, the relationships between ministers and civil servants and analyse the 'New Labour effect' on the core executive.</p> \n<p>The project will draw on four key debates within current studies of British central government:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>The utility of&nbsp; the Westminster model in offering a realistic organising perspective of the British political system.</li> \n <li>The utility of the 'power-dependency' model in explaining the nature of core executive relations.</li> \n <li>The use of the policy networks approach for analysing the nature of policy making.</li> \n <li>The impact of the present Labour Administrations on the way in which the core executive operates.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2040","grantId":"RES-000-22-2040","fundValue":"81168","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Richards","coPersons":["Helen  Mathers"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
