However, currently there are no such measures used in clinical practice for the diagnosis or prediction of clinical response in psychiatric disorders. Brain imaging studies have revealed significant, and often wide-spread, abnormalities in several psychiatric disorders. An essential step towards a clinical application would require a measure of patterns of brain activation that distinguishes patients from healthy individuals. This entails a shift in the data analysis from focusing on differences between groups of patients with a psychiatric illness and groups of healthy individuals to identifying for a particular individual the likelihood that he or she would have a particular illness. The present project will develop statistical analysis methods which are essential for the investigation of such quantitative measures for psychiatric disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802594","grantId":"G0802594","fundValue":"99973","fundStart":"2009-04-15","fundEnd":"2010-04-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Cynthia H.Y.
