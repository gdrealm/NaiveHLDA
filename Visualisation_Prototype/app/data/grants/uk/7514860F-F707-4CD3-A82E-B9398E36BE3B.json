In the UK, only 40% of men and 28% of women meet the minimum amount of exercise suggested by the Chief Medical Officer. One simple answer to this problem may be increased stair climbing at work. Few people think of stair climbing as exercise but it actually burns more calories per minute than jogging. Increased stair climbing can reduce both the risks of heart disease and weight. Most adults spend half their waking life at work and regular stair climbing could help combat the rise in obesity.\n\nRecent research by the team has produced a 50% increase in stair climbing in one workplace, a major advance as the previous best was a 5% increase. Instead of simply encouraging people to stay healthy, we converted the science behind stair climbing into lay terms. For example, an average man going upstairs in his house an extra ten times every day for a year expends energy equivalent to three pounds of fat. We place signs at the choice point between stairs and lifts outlining the benefits that stair climbing brings. Two recent studies by the team have produced greater increases in stair climbing in overweight individuals. This project will explore the best way to promote stair climbing. First, we will compare the merits of different types of messages. For this, we will interview people at their place of work and then test the different messages in workplaces. Second we will investigate new ways of delivering this message so that people continue to respond to it. Typically people get used to health advice and the messages lose their impact. The project will test whether changing the message regularly can reverse any decline in response. All the studies set out to encourage working people to be more active. \n\nRecent estimates put the annual cost of obesity in England at about #4.2 billion to the NHS and weight problems at around #16 billion to the overall economy. Obesity is bad for our health and the nation?s wealth. When rolled out nationally, the cost of stair climbing campaigns for a five storey workplace would be about #25, which equates to 5p an employee for a workforce of 500. This cost-effective approach to exercise promotion could make a significant difference to rising levels of obesity and its associated health problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802070","grantId":"G0802070","fundValue":"236909","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Eves","coPersons":["Sheila Margaret  Greenfield","Oliver  Webb","Douglas  Carroll","Roger Leonard Holder","Amanda  Daley"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
