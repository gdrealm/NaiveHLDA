At the same time advances in scientific knowledge and clinical medicine have great potential to improve the health of children and their families. Health during childhood and later life is influenced by social, biological and emotional environments which act and change throughout pregnancy, childhood and adolescence, unique periods of growth and development. Thus research to understand the causes, outcome and prevention of these conditions requires complex statistical analyses and the development of new methods to investigate the role of genetic predisposition and environment and to support follow up to adult life. This grant for a MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health will support population scientists and biostatisticians working in this field to develop these new methods, to find better ways of translating scientific evidence to guide policies for children and to carry out policy-relevant research. It will also provide training for scientists of the future who wish to improve childrenâ€™s health and well-being through high quality scientific research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400546","grantId":"G0400546","fundValue":"1759840","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Dezateux","coPersons":["Helen Elizabeth Bedford","Marie Louise Newell","Maria  Bitner-Glindzicz","David  Ingram","Christine  Power","Angela  Wade","Mario  Cortina Borja","Catherine  Peckham","Patricia Ann Tookey","Jugnoo Sangeeta Rahi","Catherine Mary Law","Harvey  Goldstein","Timothy James Cole","Ian Chi Wong"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
