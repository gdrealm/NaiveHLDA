It will build on information in the ESRC Demographic Review (2005) and will provide baseline data for the development of the Joint University Council Social Work Education Committee Research Strategy (2006). The project consists of three related studies which involve:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Scoping potential funding for social work and social care research. This will involve producing a literature review for an expert group who will subsequently prepare a consultation document.<br /></li>\n\n <li>Auditing the research capacity of UK social work educators. A survey will be undertaken of all social work academics in UK university departments that deliver qualifying training to identify the research qualifications, training, experience and networks of staff.<br /></li>\n\n <li>Auditing research methods teaching in the new Social Work degree. A survey of all social work undergraduate qualifying courses will provide a map of the content and process of research teaching on the new degree in Social Work including attention to research across the curriculum.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The results of the audit will inform ongoing deliberations about the developments and resources necessary to support building research capacity within the discipline of Social Work.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F033036/1","grantId":"ES/F033036/1","fundValue":"37326","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joan Elizabeth Orme","coPersons":["Jackie  Powell","Jan  Fook","Jill  Manthorpe","Elaine Ruth Sharland"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
