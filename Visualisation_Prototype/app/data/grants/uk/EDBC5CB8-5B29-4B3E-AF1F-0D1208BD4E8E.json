{"id":"EDBC5CB8-5B29-4B3E-AF1F-0D1208BD4E8E","title":"Models and Impact Relevant climate Prediction (MIRP)","abstractText":"The importance and relevance of communicating our knowledge of future climate has never been more widely recognised, and needs no further introduction here. Yet both the Stern report, which directly quantified costs and benefits, and most of the impact and adaptation component of the recent 4th Assessment of the IPCC report, were based on climate predictions which did not use the most recent physical climate predictions (in many cases on data six or more years old)!. This project is about exploiting the BADC position as one of three global repositories for model intercomparison data to facilitate information and data flow between the earth system modelling community and the impacts and adaptation communities, including both those who 'research' impacts and adaptation, and those at the front end of planning in government and industry. The main aim is to have in place the ability for that information flow to be appropriate and available during and soon after the next IPCC assessment phase, rather than inappropriate and years late!","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H00145X/1","grantId":"NE/H00145X/1","fundValue":"429488","fundStart":"2010-04-09","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Bryan  Lawrence","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
