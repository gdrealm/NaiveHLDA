Simply put, un-repaired DNA damage causes mutations which contribute to the incidences of genetic defects and to cancer. Hence DNA repair is crucial to reduce the incidence of harmful mutations.\nThis MRC co-operative award allows several research teams working on DNA repair, cell stress and cancer to benefit from core technologies that support all of them. One technology provides the ability to follow DNA repair proteins by tagging them with fluorescent factors to enable them to be detected in cells, so as we can see how they react to DNA damage. The other technology enables us to analyse DNA repair proteins via mass spectrometry to unravel their composition; this is the first step in understanding the structure of repair proteins so as we can determine how they interact with DNA in our cells to detect and remove DNA damage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301154","grantId":"G0301154","fundValue":"394304","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ray  Waters","coPersons":["Paul James Smith","Christopher John Jones","Alan  Clarke","Julian  Sampson","David  Wynford Thomas","David  Kipling","Simon Huw Reed"],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
