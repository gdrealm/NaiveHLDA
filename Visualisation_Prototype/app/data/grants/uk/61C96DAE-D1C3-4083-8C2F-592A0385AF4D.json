We wish to study one particular family of protein receptors called integrins; these large, membrane-spanning proteins have adjustable adhesion properties, essential for the movement and proper location of cells in the body. We are interested in how integrins can adjust their stickiness to different conditions. We know this adjustibility is essential for many life processes including wound healing and tissue development. Integrin function sometimes changes thus contributing to diseases like thrombosis and cancer. Like many other cellular protein machines the adhesion control mechanism is quite complicated; it involves large structural changes in the integrins themselves and sophisticated regulation of activity by a number of proteins that bind to short, but extended, flexible ?tail? regions of the integrins at the inside face of the cell. We will study how these different proteins interact with the tails to produce controlled responses to environmental changes. We will use sophisticated biophysical tools to measure the various molecular interactions and to obtain atomic resolution structures of the complexes formed. This information will allow us, in the long run, to construct a model for how the adhesion machinery works and, possibly, to design drugs to interfere with it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900052","grantId":"G0900052","fundValue":"350716","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain Donald Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
