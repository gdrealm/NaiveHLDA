{"id":"371BD758-59BD-46CF-AA9B-E0CA38A63C94","title":"Assessing Novel Micro-organisms for Exploitability: Patent and Market Analysis","abstractText":"Twelve unique strains of marine micro-organisms, which have been observed to produce substantial quantities of valuable products (e.g. long-chain Omega 3 fatty acids), and which are likely to have other exploitable properties, were isolated during an Individual NERC Postdoctoral Fellowship. These were identified on the basis of their morphology, because, at the time of their isolation, molecular methods were not available. The group from which these micro-organisms come is now known to make the products observed in these isolates and also to make an unusually large number of other products of considerable potential. \n\nLegal and market information is now required to clarify how best to take forward the exploitation of these isolates and for that reason a Pathfinder award is sought. If successful, the following work will be undertaken: \n\nLegal information: The patent landscape for this group is complex and is growing fast. It is therefore essential that a detailed analysis is undertaken of this and funding is requested for an assessment by an independent patent specialist or firm. The specification for the tender for this analysis will be developed in detailed consultation with the University's Technology Transfer Office (Research and Enterprise Services (RES)) using their considerable experience of similar investigations. Knowledge that there is a detailed understanding of the patent position will also strengthen the subsequent business case. \n\nMarket analysis: An independent analysis of potential markets for the known and likely products will also be competitively commissioned from independent experts, again drawing on the experience of RES. Based on, amongst other things, the size of potential markets, the market drivers and the competitive position (key players and existing products), this will identify niche sectors, where the micro-organisms' products have the greatest potential. The analysis will also identify any barriers to market entry over and above any emerging from the patent analysis. Information on recent investments in the identified niches will also inform the on-going search for commercial partners and investors . \n\nSome external funding has already been obtained for work on these micro-organisms and conversations have begun with other commercial and independent funders. Working with RES, further partners and funders will be approached confidentially during the Pathfinder, if successful, and their views, interests and needs will also inform the development of a full Follow-On Proposal. \n\nRES will work with the applicant to produce the best focus for a full Follow-On proposal, using information from the patent and market analyses and potential sponsors. This is likely to have one or two product areas as its initial focus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M005771/1","grantId":"NE/M005771/1","fundValue":"15898","fundStart":"2014-06-16","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Lesley Polglase","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
