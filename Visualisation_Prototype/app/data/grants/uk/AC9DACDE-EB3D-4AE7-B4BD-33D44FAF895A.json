However, on contact with certain vegetable ingredients - namely onions, garlic, chives\nor cabbage - the LFM starts to go extremely thick and viscous, giving the whole product the appearance of a gel which\nprecludes the use of this mayonnaise in many dips, dressings, dressed salads and other applications such as sandwich\nfillings that also include these ingredients. This phenomenon has not been documented previously, so its origin is a\nmystery at present.\n\nMayonnaise is a concentrated emulsion of oil droplets in a watery phase containing egg yolk and various other minor\ningredients, although the new LFM also contains added polysaccharide thickeners. As such, the instability is almost\ncertainly related to strong aggregation of the oil droplets and/or other ingredients within the formulation. Aggregation could\noccur via: (a) the vegetable ingredients adding components to the aqueous phase that significantly decrease the repulsive\nforces between the droplets or (b) the ingredients adding some extra cross-linking agent that strongly and irreversibly pulls\nthe droplets together. The principal aim is therefore to establish whether mechanisms (a) and/or (b) are operating in order\nto suggest a viable commercial solution to this problem.\n\nMechanism (a) will be revealed through observations of the microscopic structure of the system and measurements on the\naggregation tendency of the droplets under controlled conditions. The change in the full apparent droplet size distribution\nwill be evaluated using various light scattering techniques in our laboratory. The surface charge properties of the the\ndroplets in selected systems will also be measured. Changes in the droplet size when samples are subjected to dilution\nwith simply water or detergents will be used. This can distinguish between very strongly aggregated droplets, which\nappear still as large particles on dilution, versus weakly aggregated droplets that separate simply on dilution with water. A\npossible mechanism of the gelation via (a) is the high ratio of polysaccharide thickeners to droplets, resulting in so-called\ndepletion flocculation (aggregation) of the system, but this should be entirely reversible on dilution. Droplet 'charge' (zeta\npotential) measurements will provide evidence of any significant change in the surface structure or composition of the\nstabilizing layer on the droplets that could help to explain their dramatic change in stability.\n\nMechanism (b) may be biochemical, since onions, garlic and chives are all produce enzyme (alliinase) activity on\nPage 2 of 10 Date Saved: 02/08/2011 08:58:53\nDate Printed: 02/08/2011 08:59:45\nProposal original proforma document\nImpact Summary\nImpact Summary (please refer to the help for guidance on what to consider when completing this section) [up to 4000 chars]\ncutting/crushing that can produce free sulphydryl compounds that could cross-link the protein present (protein in the\naqueous phase or adsorbed to the droplet surfaces) and produce the gelation observed. Cabbage and other Brassica spp.\nproduce reactive isothiocyanates, nitriles, thiocyanates and also other sulphur species via the action of myrosinase\nenzymes, so there is again the capability for protein cross-linking. Cross-linking reactions with the cellulose,\nhemicelluloses and pectin components of the polysaccharide thickeners have not been documented, but the\npolysaccharide may aid the formation of strong gels as they become incorporated into a cross-linking protein network.\nThe above measurements will therefore be performed on formulations where potential cross-linking agents are present or\nabsent. For example: whole onion puree, filtrate from filtered onion puree, enzyme-inactivated filtrate. Enzymes will be\ndeactivated by various heat treatments and or addition of cross-linking blocking agents. If the evidence does point to some\nsort protein polymerization by enzymes more direct evidence for this will be sought via electrophoretic separation (SDSPAGE),\nwhich can detect an increase in molecular weight of protein species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J501694/1","grantId":"EP/J501694/1","fundValue":"100263","fundStart":"2012-04-23","fundEnd":"2013-10-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brent Stuart  Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" not applicable this year commercial exploitation Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
