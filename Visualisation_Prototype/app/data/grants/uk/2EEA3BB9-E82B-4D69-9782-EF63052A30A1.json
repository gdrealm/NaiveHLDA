{"id":"2EEA3BB9-E82B-4D69-9782-EF63052A30A1","title":"Afghan music in London and its ongoing communications with Kabul and the Afghan Transnational Community","abstractText":"It is proposed to research into the dynamics of music practice (composing, performing, and listening) amongst Afghans in London, and to examine how their cultural performances communicate with Afghanistan and other parts of the Afghan diaspora. Building on work already carried out in Pakistan, Iran and the USA, the project will focus on musical innovation, the feedback of new music from the periphery (the transnational community) to the centre (Kabul), and the connection between the creation of new music and transformations in the construction of cultural identity. It thereby addresses some fundamental questions about the relationships between music and migration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119483/1","grantId":"119483/1","fundValue":"9997","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2007-04-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Baily","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
