{"id":"BE0D3A97-5DF4-4A6D-97EB-32905D7BB4BB","title":"THE NEW BASEL ACCORD AND CREDIT RISK ANALYTICS; APPLICATIONS TO UK MORTGAGE RISK","abstractText":"<p>The establishment of an accurate and effective system to measure the exposure to risk of a bank's credit assets becomes increasingly important from the end of 2006 when the new Basel Accord begins to take effect. This would become even more complicated at the portfolio level when the bank has a large number of loans of different categories with a complicated structure of default dependence to evaluate. </p>\n\n<p>In this proposal, we propose a number of new methods (based on Large Deviation Theory) for the estimation of the optimal portfolio of loans and the associated VaR (credit risk) without relying on any specific assumption about the loss distribution. </p>\n\n<p>Our procedures add asymmetric nonlinear dependence into the analytics of credit risk, thus substantially extend the models of Merton (1974) and Duffie et al. (2000) at the portfolio level. We use datasets of UK bonds and mortgages to examine the empirical performance of our credit risk models. Because of the importance of the housing market in a changing economic environment, it is indeed interesting to investigate the risk of mortgage holdings. Our methodology could be implemented by lending institutions and regulators.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1606","grantId":"RES-000-22-1606","fundValue":"47406","fundStart":"2006-05-30","fundEnd":"2007-05-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Hwang","coPersons":["S  Satchell"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
