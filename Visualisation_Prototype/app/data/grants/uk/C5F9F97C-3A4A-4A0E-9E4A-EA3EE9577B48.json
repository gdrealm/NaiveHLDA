Bringing together the strengths of large-scale surveys and local-level investigations, the current project aims to provide comprehensive electoral ethnographies in 15 sites across India. These electoral ethnographies will mark a whole new approach in the study of elections. Rather than treat elections as dry statistical events and in terms of their outcomes, focusing on the 'numbers game' and results, elections in this project will be studied with their full cultural and cosmological meaning, as the most important modern and secular festival of post-colonial India.</p>\n\n<p>Elections in India are seen to overturn the status quo, if only for a day, and are marked by a riot of colour and sound and this is what makes them a carnivalesque festival, quite unlike anywhere else in the world. </p>\n\n<p>As this is the first comprehensive study of elections in India or anywhere else, the academic value of the research across disciplines will be enormous. In a global climate where a successful democracy is widely assumed to be the first requirement for peace and trade, insights about how the world's largest democracy makes it work will be widely shared through the media internationally. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3376","grantId":"RES-000-22-3376","fundValue":"80475","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mukulika  Banerjee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
