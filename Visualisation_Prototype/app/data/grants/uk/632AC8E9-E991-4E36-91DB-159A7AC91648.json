The invention, known as ARF-DCA technology, allows the modulation of specific aspects of development in a manner that retains the plasticity of responses to environmental conditions such as soil nutrient levels. These traits are extremely attractive to breeders and seed companies but in order to take the next step in the commercialisation of the technology we must demonstrate its efficacy in an economically-important crop. Here we describe a work programme of work to translate our proof-of-concept ARF-DCA work in arabidopsis to the globally-important oilseed crop, oilseed rape and further, to broaden the scope of the invention by demonstrating that ARF-DCA technology can also be used to enhance additional auxin-regulated root traits that are crucial to crop nutrition and yield performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K010956/1","grantId":"BB/K010956/1","fundValue":"157250","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project is still ongoing and commercially sensitive.
