In order to be able to understand how all these interactions help an organisms to survive and build models for these interactions, it is important to be able to measure the interactions in a quantitative way. In this proposal we will establish a facility which will house two separate machines which use different biophysical methods to accurately measure interactions between molecules found in biology. We will use these machines to carry out a wide variety of research ranging from how complexes of proteins assemble to how the walls of bacterial cells work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L013851/1","grantId":"BB/L013851/1","fundValue":"223658","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart A Wilson","coPersons":["St√©phane  MESNAGE","Jane Alison Grasby","Robert K  Poole","Kai Sven  Erdmann","J  Green","Andrew  Peden","Bazbek  Davletov","Kathryn Rachel  Ayscough","David  Kelly"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
