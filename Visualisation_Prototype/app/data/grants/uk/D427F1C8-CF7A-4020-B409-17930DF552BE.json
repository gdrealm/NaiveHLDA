{"id":"D427F1C8-CF7A-4020-B409-17930DF552BE","title":"State authenticity: precursors and sequelae","abstractText":"<p>A person is authentic when her or his actions reflect the &quot;true self&quot;. Although psychologists have explored authenticity as a personality trait or as a developmental achievement, there is little research that directly examines the role of authenticity in adults' everyday lives. That is, researchers have a limited understanding of authenticity as a state (ie, as a sense of self in-the-moment).</p>\n\n<p>This research grant seeks to fill this knowledge gap by investigating questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Does the self need to be expressed to other people in order to feel 'real'?</li>\n\n <li>Do situations that cause people to think about themselves facilitate OR inhibit the true self?</li>\n\n <li>How do people feel when being true OR, conversely, when being false?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project makes use of both quantitaive and qualitative data, and employs both correlational and experimental methodology to address questions such as the above. An improved understanding of state authenticity may confer researchers, educators, and practitioners a practical and potent means for providing guidance on how to improve people's daily lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2595","grantId":"RES-062-23-2595","fundValue":"268683","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Lenton","coPersons":["Constantine  Sedikides"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
