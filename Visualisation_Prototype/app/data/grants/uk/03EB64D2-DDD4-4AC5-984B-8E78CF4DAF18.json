{"id":"03EB64D2-DDD4-4AC5-984B-8E78CF4DAF18","title":"Breaking the Barrier: Ligand-Centred Mixed Valence Catalysts for Hydrogen Production","abstractText":"The search for new renewable energy sources is an imperative for the global community; it is at the heart of our economic and political security, and provides the solution to many of our environmental concerns. The development of renewable energy processes will require the collective force of scientists from all backgrounds, but chemistry in particular will play a leading role in creating the necessary materials for new energy technologies. The aim of my research programme is to develop innovative catalysts for hydrogen production. Hydrogen is one of the most promising alternate fuel sources, with regard to environmental factors and energy efficiency. Importantly, this fuel source can be produced from two abundant resources, water and sunlight. However, hydrogen production still remains one of the more obstinate chemical reactions; the chemistry involves a multi-electron process associated with large energy barriers, requiring an effective catalyst to drive the associated reaction. The catalysts presently available for hydrogen production are far too inefficient and costly, discouraging further investment in hydrogen-based technologies. In the proposed research, an innovative approach is used to design an entirely new class of inorganic catalysts able to circumvent the difficulties associated with multi-electron reactions and optimized for hydrogen production. The proposed catalysts employ inexpensive, abundant metals, providing a sustainable solution for fuel technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J014435/1","grantId":"EP/J014435/1","fundValue":"99976","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2013-12-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Corinna  Hess","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
