Cognitive psychologists refer to our memories of the events and experiences that occur during our lifetime as &quot;autobiographical memory&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to giving us a record of the experiences that helped make us the people we are, autobiographical memory also plays important roles in our everyday lives. For example, an individual's sense of&nbsp;&quot;self&quot; is intimately linked with his or her autobiographical memories, whilst sharing our personal histories helps us form and maintain relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, it has been suggested that autobiographical memory may play an important role in shaping our imagination of future events. Our ability to imagine the sorts of events and experiences that we may encounter in the future is an important psychological skill, and has been found to aid adjustment to major life events and reduce vulnerability to psychological distress. It is therefore important to understand the processes that support this ability.</p>\n\n<p>Through a series of experimental studies, the funded research will compare the processes involved in retrieving the past and imagining the future, gaining further insight into the role that autobiographical memory plays in our ability to imagine possible future events</p>\n\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3624-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-3624-A","fundValue":"18235","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The impact of the findings have been in stimulating further academic research. At this stage their impact outside of academia is limited, although we are beginning work that examines how memory and future simulation function in individuals with depression. This could have impact within the mental healthcare sector in the longer term.  ","person":"Rachel Joy Anderson","coPersons":["Stephen Anthony Dewhurst"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":" Ten experiments were conducted as part of this 12 month project. The findings were interpreted within the framework of the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis (Schacter &amp; Addis, 2007) which states that individuals draw on their past experiences in order to imagine or construct future events. Findings are generally supportive of this hypothesis, though some important differences were observed between the generation of past and future events. Findings from the project also indicate that participants can draw on sources other than episodic memory when imagining novel future scenarios. These findings place important constraints on the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis and raise a number of questions that need to be addressed in future research. The findings of the project are being taken forward to examine the differing function roles of past and future thinking. In particular, how they interact with emotion and mental health. The findings of this work are likely to inform the field of mental health, in particular academics and clinicians within the cognitive-behavioural arena. Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
