{"id":"5BA26EF6-8ACC-4CE7-977C-F78D5BEB8D0A","title":"SIGNET2 - Randomised trial of glutamine and selenium supplemented parenteral nutrition for critically ill patients","abstractText":"The demand for Intensive Care Unit beds is high. Patients in Intensive Care are often very ill, many develop infections and some do not survive. \nIn Intensive Care, patients sometimes are given food through a drip into their veins. Previous studies have shown that using specific additives in the food may help patients recover from Intensive Care.\nThis study is looking at the effect of adding two food supplements called glutamine and selenium to the food given to patients in Intensive Care. The aim of the study is to discover whether patients get fewer infections and to see if this improves chances of survival. \nThe study is called a randomised controlled trial. This is the best way to see if a specific treatment really works. Patients are allocated randomly to one of the 4 treatment groups. One group will receive glutamine to the food, one group will receive selenium, one group will receive both and another group will receive the standard food. \nPatients will receive the study food for up to 7 days and will be followed up by postal questionnaires at three and six months. The study will look at the effect on quality of life after Intensive Care and also look at the costs of the new treatments on recovery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401633","grantId":"G0401633","fundValue":"1006880","fundStart":"2005-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Andrews","coPersons":["Luke  Vale","Marion K Campbell","William Gordon Simpson","Alison  Avenell","Bernard  Croal","David  Noble","Fiona  MacKirdy"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
