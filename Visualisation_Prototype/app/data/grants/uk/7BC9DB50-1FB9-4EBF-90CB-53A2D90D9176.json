The research seeks to use creative solutions to overcome the adverse effects of bicycle theft on the achievement of sustainable transport objectives within European cities and to assist in the promotion of cycling and the benefits it offers to society in terms of impact on health and improvements in the quality of the urban environment.\\n\\nPedal bike theft continues to be a problem in London, the UK and internationally. Research shows that theft, or the fear of theft, is a primary inhibitor to bicycle usage and uptake. Clearly the impact of bicycle theft is not insignificant, and yet our preliminary research into bicycle theft, and the opportunities that exist for effective product and service interventions to reduce it, reveals gaps in both academic and educational resources, as well as commercial address to the significance of bike theft.\\n\\nIncreased cycle infrastructure and its security, and the goal of increased bicycle usage, is high on the agenda of European urban design in the 21st century. Bicycle parking provision is seen to affect planning applications and increasingly both public and private funds are being made available to facilitate and promote cycle usage through enhanced infrastructure.\\n\\nThe portfolio of projects, seeks to reduce bicycle theft by applying and integrating the design against crime approach to the design of bicycles, bicycle locks and bicycle parking via the generation of new benchmarks in terms of design standards, design methodologies, design resources, user evaluation and design education that will generate commercial product design application.\\n\\nTo do this, the portfolio will seek to manage three iterative, practice led research projects, record and disseminate their findings via delivery of a SBD standard, a competition, publication of design resource, website and conference. The projects include address to:\\n\\n1- Design standards and design methodologies\\n2- Design resource and design education\\n3- User evaluation\\n\\nEach project has distinct stakeholders groups. They include academics, police officers, local government officials, town planners, crime prevention advisors, architectural liaison officers, designers, engineers, architects, and criminologists who share concern with the problem of theft.\\n\\nThe portfolio project structure will manage multi-disciplinary collaboration between stakeholders. Each research project tackles a stage within the delivery of secure design. This project structure, described in the case for support, favours the metaphor of a 'delivery cycle'. Its approach is neither top down, nor bottom up, but rather seeks to ensure that theories, as well as data from practice led design activities, meet and are combined in a holistic way at each stage of the cycle. To quote John Thackara, this research portfolio acknowledges the need to engage with 'design mindfullness', and the fact that design in the 21st century involves 'complex systems that are shaped by all the people who use them, and in this new era of collaborative innovation, designers are having to evolve from solely being the individual authors of objects or buildings, to acknowledge their role as being the facilitators of change among large groups of people.'","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E507956/1","grantId":"AH/E507956/1","fundValue":"323918","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Senior researchers have presented Bikeoff research methodologies and findings relating to cycle theft perpetrator techniques and how to design against them to crime prevention professionals, designers, specifiers and manufacturers and providers of cycle parking furniture and facilities at 55 conference and seminar events, of which 6 where organized by the project, including 'Velo City 2009' (Europe and the worlds largest cycling policy forum) pan-European plenary session on bike theft (2009).This activity has resulted in widespread acceptance of the link between security of cycle parking provision and cycle theft and led to the default specification of 'secure' cycle parking in all related contexts. Examples of geographical and disciplinary 'reach' within the design community include invitations to speak at The Forum for the Creative Industries, Sao Paulo, Brazil (2007), 'Changing the Change', Turin, Italy, and EAD, Izmir, Turkey (2008). Examples of 'reach' within the field of crime science/criminology include the JDI utilizing Bikeoff as best practice case study within training provided for at least 100 crime analysts a year on crime prevention (since 2008). Also, as a rare example of the application of DAC methodology and a rigorous approach to outcome evaluation, Bikeoff is used as an exemplar in modules taught as part of the MSc in Crime Science at UCL. Furthermore, the CCO framework evolved by Bikeoff has since been applied to DAC risk evaluation within commercial consultancy and academia and has formed the core methodology to building behavioural modelling in a 'safety &amp; risk vulnerability analysis tool' by a research group at University of New South Wales (2008). The understanding that emerged during the project on how people use and abuse public space is also being developed in the field of computational criminology. Linked to a unique visual research and dissemination methodology Bikeoff introduced the Bicycle Film Festival to London in 2006 and continued to produce the festival until 2009 when production passed to commercial partners (the festival remains a popular annual event). The film festival enabled Bikeoff to extend the stakeholder network and draw on visual material produced by filmmakers, relating to cycle theft. Bikeoff used this material to train UK police at cycle security film screenings at the Cochrane Theatre (2006) and the Barbican (2008). Bikeoff also created the film 'Know the Enemy' (2006) focused on cycle theft perpetrator techniques that has been distributed on DVD and shown at numerous public events such as Emirates Stadium Bike Week (2007).\n\n\nAdvisory roles\nSenior researchers have advised public policy forums in relation to cycle parking and security including the Transport for London Anti-Bike Theft Working Group, Government Office for London Counter Terrorism and Transport consultation, Cycle Touring Club General Assembly, National Designing Out Crime Association, Prime Ministers Strategy Unit, Home Office and Design Council Anti-Crime Design and Technology Alliance, Brighton and Hove Cycle Theft Steering Group, Brighton and Hove Operational CDRP, London Assembly Transport Committee Investigation into Cycle Parking in London, Commons Transport Select Committee Inquiry into the Government's Rail White Paper.\n\nNational Competitions\nBikeoff research has resulted in the development and delivery of three national design competitions linked to exploitation of the design resources generated by the research; i) Re-inventing the Bikeshed, (2006) http://www.reinventingthebikeshed.com which catalysed the creation of secure cycle parking design exemplars, several of which have gone into commercial production and have created UK design led businesses as a result, ii) the national student design competition, Designs Against Bike Theft, Design Directions, RSA (2008/09) co-funded by the Home Office received multiple entries from 31 UK art and design HEI's having been adopted as part of their curriculum http://www.bikeoff.org/design_resource/DB_brief1_challenge.shtml and, iii) the Design Council Residential Bicycle Theft Challenge (2010/11), supported by the Home Office's Design &amp; Technology Alliance Against Crime, which has resulted in 4 UK companies receiving funding of &pound;10,000 each to develop and introduce to market secure residential cycle storage solutions. Two of the winning proposals were from companies established as a result of the Re-inventing the Bikeshed competition in 2006. http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Documents/Design%20Out%20Crime%20-%20Residential%20cycle%20theft%20brief.pdf\nMost recently the resource has informed the design of and responses to Nesta's Cycle Security Challenge Prize for which Thorpe was on the judging panel.\n\nLicensing of design exemplars\nResearch led practice within the project has led to the design, realisation, implementation and testing of bike theft reduction design exemplars (stickers and M stands). These designs have been evaluated and shown to increase the security of cyclists parking behaviour. The value of these 'tools' for bike theft prevention is evidenced in their licensing, manufacture, supply and implementation in London, Brighton and Hove and York. Also adopted by rail companies and TfL as the preferred solution at bike theft Hotspots across 31 London boroughs. Commercialisation of Bikeoff outputs such as the bike stands licensed to Broxap, the UK's largest cycle parking manufacturer is estimated by Pricewaterhouse Coopers as &quot;[potentially] being worth &pound;3.2 million (NPV) over 10 years.\n\nPublic Sector Specification\nTFL's Cycle Centre for Excellence has recommended the Bikeoff M stand design as the preferred parking furniture for use by London Boroughs (2012), London Overground, London Underground, Cycle Superhighways and Red Routes. (2010).\n\nClimate setting\nThe Design Council has also used Bikeoff to exemplify how integrating DAC in the design sector can create innovation and differentiation leading to new commercial opportunities (Design Council Hot Products publication). Bikeoffs 'fit for purpose' products are also attractive visual benchmarks. These benchmarks, and the research practice that created them, have been used as exemplars by the Design Council and RIBA to promote DAC as distinct from 'fortress aesthetics'. Additionally, the research has involved the 'lay' community in accepting, supporting and undertaking crime prevention activities themselves. This is evidenced by the adoption of language created within the project (both visual and written) by practitioners, commentators and the broader public. Both the iconography of Bikeoff's 'How to lock stickers' and the term &quot;Flyparking&quot; (coined to describe the securing of bikes to street furniture not intended for that purpose). Evidence of 'climate setting' was also apparent in the comments of stakeholders independently surveyed by PwC to assess project impact. PwC state that &quot;the innovative and visual nature of the research approach has attracted significant attention from stakeholders, contributing to raising the profile of the design issues and changing perspectives.&quot;\n\n\nStakeholder testimonies\n• The Bikeoff project is published on the AHRC website as one of a series of exemplar case studies. www.ahrc.ac.uk/About/Publications/.../DAC%20Brochure.pdf\n\n• Thorpe, A. was invited to present the Bikeoff 2 project as exemplary practice at a regional AHRC research forum at UCL (2009). Subsequently the project was included in a presentation by AHRC Director of Research, Professor Shearer West to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills in relation to research impact (October 2009). \n\n• Roger Geffen, campaigner and Policy Manager of Cycle Touring Club of Great Britain (UK's largest cycling advocacy organisation) referred to Bikeoff research in the CTC submission to the Commons Transport Select Committee Inquiry into the Government's Rail White Paper (2008) stating that &quot;evidence-based methodologies [such as those developed by Bikeoff] are useful to counter misplaced concerns about possible terrorist threats from bike-bombs&quot;.\n\n• UK Home Office used Bikeoff's 'Butterfly' bike stand January 2008 exhibition) to announce Design &amp; Technology Alliance against crime activities, and the Design Council in 2008 wrote up case studies of Bikeoff design benchmarks, which now appear on their website: http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Case-Studies/All-Case-Studies/Bikeoff.\n\n• Boris Johnson, The Mayor of London said of Bikeoff's caMden stand design that &quot;The caMden stand is a great example of the type of innovative solution to crime that can be made reality given the right support. As Mayor... I firmly believe that if we drive out so called minor crime, such as bike theft, then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime. In the process we will also make cycling in London more attractive, which will help to improve the environment for all of us. I've asked Transport For London to do all they can to support such initiatives.&quot; (May 2008). \n\n• Dr. Kulveer Ranger, Director of Transport Policy for the GLA said of Bikeoff research that &quot;It is great that this multi-agency approach is working to bring design forward into dealing with a real problem for cyclists and the cycling community whilst at the same time being innovative in the approach&quot; (September 2008).\n\n• Rose Ades, Head of Transport for London's Cycle Centre of Excellence (CCoE) said of the research &quot;... As Bikeoff [advocacy] started in 2004 bike theft went up but also so did the number of people cycling in London. And then something remarkable happened around 2005-6 - bike theft went down a little and cycling went up even more... there's still a long way to go ... but the work that Bikeoff, in partnership with multiple stakeholders is delivering, is making a difference...&quot; Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Security and Diplomacy,Transport Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Adam  Thorpe","coPersons":["Lorraine  Gamman"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":" 'Bike Off 2 - Catalysing anti-theft bike, bike parking and information design for the 21st century' involved a portfolio of research projects, including:\no A project looking at design standards and methodologies to promote secure cycling which generated design standards and guidance for bicycle parking and originated and tested various frameworks for standard generation and consultation that have informed cycle parking and security guidance and policy in the UK and Europe.\no A project developing design resources and design education via competitions and exhibitions, that have contributed to the design curriculum of over 40 higher education institutions and catalysed designs that have been taken to market creating UK enterprise.\no A project developing tools and methodologies for qualitative and quantitative design evaluation to promote secure cycling the outputs of which have been applied within further research and disseminated to crime prevention and cycle security practitioners in the UK and Europe.\nThe initial research project was based on the DACRC Iterative Practice Led User Centred Design Model. This model has been further developed through iteration within the Bike Off project in collaboration with project stakeholders. The evolved model better defines the research stages and also the twin track approach taken by the project to deliver both design exemplars (to build operational capacity and prove the case for DAC) and design resources (to build innovative capacity within the design and crime prevention communities). Significantly, the model articulates an 'open innovation' approach to social design research that openly shares research findings and embraces stakeholder input. We have found that access to this plurality of design opinion and design experience (be it in creating new or living with existing design) requires research to be shared in a language that is accessible to diverse disciplines and communities, including the design community. Within the methodology developed and applied by Bikeoff the processes of research 'visualisation' uses design skills to develop understanding and enable effective engagement with the widest possible audience of stakeholders, including those that have not engaged with design before. In such scenarios, 'design' facilitates 'co-design' (particularly with those outside design disciplines), and effectively involves those the research seeks to benefit in a process of 'open' research innovation - from research question definition, right through to application of research to practice and evaluation of designed interventions.\n\nAccordingly, this research has identified ways in which design of cycle parking infrastructure, products and services can contribute to or reduce opportunities for cycle theft. The key findings can be found on bikeoff.org, the projects cycle security website, containing over 400 case studies of cycle parking and cycle security design, critical and comparative review of over 100 cycle parking design guidelines and standards from international sources and other outputs of Bikeoff research and other benchmark activities in the field of cycle parking and cycle security practice. In addition there are 1 book, 4 book chapters, 2 catalogues, 3 refereed journal articles, 4 conference papers, 3 critical editions and 7 research reports which detail the application of Bikeoff methodologies to practice in the UK and Europe. Bikeoff research findings have been taken forward and put to use by others in the following ways:\n\nNational Competitions\nBikeoff research has resulted in the development and delivery of three national design competitions linked to exploitation of the design resources generated by the research; i) Re-inventing the Bikeshed, (2006) http://www.reinventingthebikeshed.com which catalysed the creation of secure cycle parking design exemplars, several of which have gone into commercial production and have created UK design led businesses as a result, ii) the national student design competition, Designs Against Bike Theft, Design Directions, RSA (2008/09) co-funded by the Home Office received multiple entries from 31 UK art and design HEI's having been adopted as part of their curriculum http://www.bikeoff.org/design_resource/DB_brief1_challenge.shtml and, iii) the Design Council Residential Bicycle Theft Challenge (2010/11), supported by the Home Office's Design &amp;amp; Technology Alliance Against Crime, which has resulted in 4 UK companies receiving funding of ?10,000 each to develop and introduce to market secure residential cycle storage solutions.
