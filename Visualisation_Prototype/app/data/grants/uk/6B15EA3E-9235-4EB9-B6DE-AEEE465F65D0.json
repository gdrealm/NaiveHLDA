{"id":"6B15EA3E-9235-4EB9-B6DE-AEEE465F65D0","title":"Inattentional deafness: A study of the consequences of auditory inattention","abstractText":"<p>Without attention, people can miss even large changes in the environment. In one well-known example, participants who were counting basketball passes often failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit walking right through the middle of the game! (Simons &amp; Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon – known as inattentional blindness – is receiving large amounts of research interest, but has rarely been investigated in senses other than vision. The proposed research aims to establish and characterise the new auditory phenomenon of inattentional deafness. </p>\n\n<p>The project will focus on two questions. First, if people are engaged in a more demanding task, does this make them less likely to notice an unexpected sound? And second, will unattended sounds be noticed more often if they are made more similar to attended sounds? Both of these research lines relate to important theoretical debates in the study of attention. In addition, the ability to detect and respond to unexpected stimuli is essential for many everyday tasks, such as driving, crossing a road or looking after a group of children. Investigations of inattentional deafness are therefore likely to have a wide range of important practical implications, in areas as diverse as driver behaviour, education and interface design.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G032033/1","grantId":"ES/G032033/1","fundValue":"79106","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  One of the main findings (that that absence of attention can leave people completely unaware of auditory stimuli that are otherwise clearly noticeable) received coverage from a range of major media outlets, including BBC television and radio in the UK and MSNBC in the US, indicating a high level of general public interest in the results. The findings have also been cited in literature concerning aviation safety, driver behaviour and educational practice, as well as contributing to the theoretical understanding of attentional control.

We showed, across several different set-ups, that the absence of attention could cause people to miss auditory stimuli that are clearly noticeable under normal listening conditions. Despite large amounts of research on the corresponding visual phenomenon of inattentional blindness, very little research had addressed the possibility of inattentional deafness. Nevertheless, the factors that determine our awareness of unexpected sounds are particularly important, as so much vital information is delivered auditorily. We also gathered a range of observations relating to the question of whether an influential theory of visual attention also holds in audition.\n\nIn addition, this research delivered a methodological innovation through our use of binaural recording and presentation techniques to create three-dimensional auditory scenes. To our knowledge we are the first to have applied the techniques to create naturalistic auditory scenes for psychological research purposes.\n\nFinally, our work on the influence of task demands on susceptibility to inattentional deafness led to a more applied experiment relating to in-car navigation devices, which fed into an interdisciplinary project on the topic. The findings have been used by people working in areas as diverse as education, aviation safety and driver behaviour and we hope that this wide range of interest will continue into the future.
