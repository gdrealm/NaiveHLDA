Staff visited Institut Pasteur, delivered talks and received training. We now have an active collaboration which will hopefully produce a publication and grant application based on the research. Staff have received training which they can use in job applications and training of other staff.We have a good collaboration with Dr Philippe Bastin which should results in a publication.
