{"id":"F50286F5-BC59-4B80-BB1C-0061F21F9B14","title":"GLOBAL - Advanced Materials for Energy and Sustainable Manufacturing","abstractText":"This project of 12 months duration will develop and extend research collaboration between Cambridge and Bangalore in the areas of materials for energy and sustainable manufacturing. Many of the challenges associated with this field must be addressed through research breakthroughs in materials performance, in the efficient use of materials and in efficient processing. Both Cambridge and Bangalore have broad strengths in the underpinning basic science, and both are working out how to provide appropriate coordination and organisation of research to bring early-stage science rapidly through to engineering and to translation to manufacturing. The global objective, therefore, of this project will be to develop together structures that allow the essential 'bottom up' basic science to be placed within an institution-wide context, and to enable new coordinated research between the two institutions.\n\nFive research projects will be built off some of the current one-on-one links between researchers in Cambridge and in Bangalore (the JNCASR and the IISc) in the general area of materials for energy and sustainable manufacturing. These include three where existing research relationships can be taken to new areas, and two where new relationships will be established. Connections between research projects will be explored. All projects will have significant exchange of researchers from UK to India and vice versa at various career levels. These interactions will be strengthened and broadened through the networking events and workshops in both countries. The five projects involve researchers at the Departments of Physics, Materials Science and Engineering in Cambridge, and cover the following topics: (a) Advanced Optoelectronics Materials Development, (b) Nanostructured Metal-Organic Frameworks, (c) Polythiophene-based Photovoltaics, (d) The optimisation of lightweight structural parts, based on mechanical tests in-situ inside a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and (e) Sustainable Materials Processing of Strategic Metals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004042/1","grantId":"EP/K004042/1","fundValue":"457414","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This one-year grant supported five projects between Cambridge and the IISc and JNCASR in Bangalore.
