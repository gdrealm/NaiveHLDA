The project will also analyse and&nbsp; assess the operational and managerial challenges alongside risks to security associated with the widespread use of SMT.</p>\n\n<p>The project draws together unique expertise in the fields of informatics, mathematical biology, human geography, geopolitics, and sociology in order to address the quantity and content of this interactive process. A review of current MOD and Royal Marine policies regarding SMT will be followed by a second quantitative phase of research incorporating an analysis of language usage and information flow on both officially sanctioned sites and more public sites such as Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The researchers will analyse the use and frequency of different words, co-occurrences of words and phrases, and studies of other language features such as word endings. This quantitative stage will be complimented by qualitative research utilising semi structured interviews, focus groups, and user-generated of mappings. The fourth phase of the research programme will allow for the development of relevant policy development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000113/1","grantId":"ES/L000113/1","fundValue":"237557","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Denney","coPersons":["John  Bryden","Alasdair Douglas  Pinkerton","Peter  Adey"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
