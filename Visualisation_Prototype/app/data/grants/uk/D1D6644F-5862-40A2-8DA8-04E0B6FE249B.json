Prevention of these conditions remains an important public health priority. Although several risk factors are well known, novel biological pathways have also been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease risk. These pathways involve the heart muscle and blood vessel linings, inflammatory processes, fat cells, the function of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas, circulating lipids and nutritional factors (particularly vitamin D). The role of these factors needs to be studied further. The unique 1946 British Birth Cohort (a study of more than 2000 individuals followed in detail from birth to 60-64 years) provides an important opportunity to provide novel insights into the role of these factors. Using this study framework it will be possible to examine the influence of these novel pathway markers on the structure and function of the heart and arteries in middle-age. The investigation will also provide an important opportunity to identify the factors which have the biggest influence on these novel pathway markers. These influences may well operate at different stages of life between conception and middle age, reflecting the fact that at least some of the factors responsible for cardiovascular disease risk operate before adult life. The study will help to determine whether these novel biological pathways mediate the effects of factors operating on cardiovascular disease at different stages during life (for example nutrition in early life) and the effects of socioeconomic factors, which are strongly related to cardiovascular risk. The information provided by the study will improve our understanding of how cardiovascular risk develops through life, and will help to tell us how best to prevent cardiovascular disease at different stages of the life course.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001143","grantId":"G1001143","fundValue":"405824","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Whincup","coPersons":["Alun David Hughes","Naveed  Sattar","Rebecca Jane Hardy","Diana Jane Kuh","Claudia  Thomas","John Eric  Deanfield"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
