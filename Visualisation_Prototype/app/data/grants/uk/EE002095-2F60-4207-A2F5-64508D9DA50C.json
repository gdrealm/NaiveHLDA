{"id":"EE002095-2F60-4207-A2F5-64508D9DA50C","title":"Ethnic density effects on physical health","abstractText":"Some research studies of health among ethnic minority groups have shown that people may have better health if they live in areas with high concentrations of people from the same ethnic group. This has been called a group density effect. It has been suggested that this effect may be linked to the stress and social stigma of belonging to a low status group and the ways in which discrimination and prejudice worsen or ease this stress. One reason why this is such an important area to study is that it allows us to distinguish between the effects of better material conditions usually enjoyed by ethnic minority groups who live outside minority areas, and the effects of psychological or social factors.\n\nThis research project is from a team of social epidemiologists, medical sociologists and demographers, and will examine ethnic group density effects on physical health. Most previous studies have been of mental health and so this project aims to look at the effect in relation to several different health outcomes, in several different ethnic groups, in two countries.\n\nThe results of this research will need to be communicated to non-academic and public users with care and sensitivity, given the possibility as they might be misinterpreted as favouring residential segregation rather than illustrating the effects of social stigma and the benefits that would come from reducing discrimination and prejudice in society. Results will be communicated as non-technical reports to relevant non-academic institutions that have an interest in social policy related to ethnic minorities. In the UK, these include the Commission for Racial Equality, the Social Exclusion Unit and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit. In the USA, non-academic users at the federal level include the Office of Minority Health at the Department of Health and Human Services Administration and the Office of Minority Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Dissemination. \n\nHealth professionals and health service organizations with an interest or remit in cultural competence within health care will also be interested in findings generated by this research programme. Such organizations include: the National Center for Cultural Competence and the Cross-Cultural Health Care Program in the USA, and in the UK: the Black Practitoners and Learners Network of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education and the Transcultural Nursing and HealthCare Association supported by the Foundation of Nursing Studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601005","grantId":"G0601005","fundValue":"304529","fundStart":"2007-08-13","fundEnd":"2010-08-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate Elizabeth Pickett","coPersons":["Kathleen Elizabeth Kiernan","Karl  Atkin","Richard G.
