{"id":"A6E94042-A7EE-4551-BD76-D6247CDA5163","title":"New generation of manufacturing technologies: liquid print of composite matrices","abstractText":"Composite industry exhibits a wide spectrum of efficient manufacturing methods spanning from cheap and robust liquid moulding processes to high quality expensive autoclaving. All the available methods have one feature in common: the continuously reinforced components, no matter how big or small, are produced in one curing/consolidation shot. Thus to achieve good dimensional tolerances and internal composite quality, a heavy tooling must be used: autoclaves, hot presses, double sided RTM moulds and other equipment that can provide high levels of applied pressure over large area. \n\nConsiderable efforts are required to design and monitor these manufacturing processes. It is difficult to introduce any correction once the process has started or to detect and mitigate the defect occurrence when it runs. All possible scenarios of the material formation have to therefore be considered in advance and any possible quality issues must be addressed prior to the material consolidation. There is also a very limited instrument pallete available to adjust the process as the overall manufacturing parameters do not determine the formation of local geometrical features directly. This makes these processes expensive and risky particularly for new applications and reinforcement systems.\n\nThis project introduces a new additive manufacturing concept which negates the need for heavy manufacturing equipment. The process is implemented through local deposition of liquid resin by means of a series of high precision injections through the thickness of a textile preform followed by local consolidation. In other words, the process is realised as 3D print of matrix into the reinforcement which maintains the liquid resin in the required position. The locality of the process guarantees its flexibility and sophisticated control over the geometry and properties. The current project looks at (a) optimisation of injection and consolidation process aimed at competitive rates of print, and (b) understanding effects of manufacturing parameters on the composite properties. In other words, this study offers new flexible high-quality composite manufacturing method tailored to the needs of property enhancement and the management of complex failure processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M009149/1","grantId":"EP/M009149/1","fundValue":"97378","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dmitry  Ivanov","coPersons":["Ioannis  Georgilas"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
