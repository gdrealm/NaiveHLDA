The overall aim of our proposed research is the development of an understanding of pairing in such cold assemblies of Bose or Fermi atoms, including the formation of molecules and their preparation in exotic states. This involves quantitative descriptions of the dynamics of the cross-over from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing to Bose-Einstein condensation of diatomic molecules, the optimisation of the lifetimes of molecular gases, as well as the development of schemes for the production of cold three-atom bound states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025935/1","grantId":"EP/E025935/1","fundValue":"916644","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thorsten  Koehler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
