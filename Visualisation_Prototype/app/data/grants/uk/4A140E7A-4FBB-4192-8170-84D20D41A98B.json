The aim is to understand how stars form in nearby molecular gas clouds, and so shed light on the formation of the solar system.\n\nThe project to observe NGC2264 will use SCUBA-2 observations and supporting data to relate physical properties in the cloud, filaments and cores to the onset and evolution of star formation activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003570/1","grantId":"ST/L003570/1","fundValue":"1491","fundStart":"2014-01-06","fundEnd":"2014-04-05","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John  Richer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
