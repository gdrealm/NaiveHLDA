Most research to date has focused on the impacts at the 'simpler' levels of biological organisation (e.g. polewards migrations of species populations; declining abundance of Polar bears in the Arctic) rather than on complex, multispecies ecosystems, where the effects of climate change are likely to be particularly far-reaching. Food webs are ecological networks that contain information on multiple species (the nodes in the web) and their interactions (links between nodes). As such, they represent how species are connected to one another within a given ecosystem, from the basal resources (e.g. phytoplankton) to the top predators (e.g. Polar bears, or humans in commercial fisheries). However, when food webs are subjected to environmental stress, such as climate warming, they can behave in ways that cannot be predicted from studying species in isolation. Further, although trophic interactions occur between individuals, most food webs have been constructed using coarser, species-averaged data. Consequently, a new, network-based perspective is needed to complement scientists' existing approaches to predicting the impacts of climate warming on the planet's ecosystems. We propose to address this knowledge gap, using aquatic food webs as model systems. Our principal focus will be on freshwaters, which, as 'islands in a terrestrial sea' are particularly vulnerable to environmental stress and for which we possess exceptionally detailed food web data. A key test of our approach will be performed in a unique, whole-ecosystem field experiment in which we will alter the temperature of Icelandic geothermal streams - because these streams are close to the Arctic Circle, they are likely to be among the first to respond to global warming, effectively acting as 'early-warning' sentinels of climate change. This project will form a collaborative link with a 4-year research grant awarded to our Project Partners characterising Icelandic food webs funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, which will maximise our cost-effectiveness (effectively reducing the cost to NERC by about 30%) since the data collected as part of the NSF project will feed into part of our proposal, in which we will parameterise and test new predictive models of food web structure and dynamics. In summary, we will: 1) develop a new approach, where we consider the role of individuals within food webs (rather than simply using species populations as nodes in the network) by enriching existing information with new data on body-size, metabolism and foraging biology; 2) use these data and emerging ecological theories to create novel predictive models of how food webs will respond to warming; 3) test our model predictions using manipulative experiments that simulate the effects of climate warming.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I009280/1","grantId":"NE/I009280/1","fundValue":"341742","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Guy  Woodward","coPersons":["Owen  Petchey"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" The work is ongoing but we have already made several new key findings. Among these is the discovery that food webs differ markedly in response to temperature - even though the regional species pool is shared by all the study sites. We have found evidence for a strengthening of algal-herbivore links at the base of the food web, and suggestions that this increases fish production at the top. Other notable discoveries are a lack of support for the widely-help hypothesis that warmer temperatures favour smaller organisms, with many instances of the opposite being true in the Iceland system. We have also discovered that the fish populations in these streams are heavily subsidised by terrestrial invertebrates, highlighting the ecological significance of land-water interface in the wider landscape - and for provisioning of key ecosystem services. We have engaged with several groups of end-users and stakeholders, particularly to explain how warming affects trout populations and carbon sequestration - and we are also making use of the PI's NERC BESS consortium links to deepen and strengthen these connections to a wider non-academic audience - at both local and international scales. We have already published a paper in an ISI journal this last year (O'Gorman et al Adv. Ecol. Res.) and we have another in review for Global Change Biology. We have given several invited talks at research institutes (University of Zurich; University of Goettingen; University of Iceland; Imperial College London). The PI has also published an outreach article in Pan-Europen Networks, which is distributed to policymakers in the EU Member States and those of The Arctic Council. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
