Our main focus is on the GAP system and the more recent SymGridPar middleware, which provide flexible and effective computation on single processors and small clusters. We will adapt the software to efficiently use large clusters of multi-core processors to perform larger computations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptations we will apply our new software to problems from a number of important areas of pure mathematics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G055742/1","grantId":"EP/G055742/1","fundValue":"181173","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  HPC-Gap has produced a library of tools to enable more straightforward calculations for a range of applications.
