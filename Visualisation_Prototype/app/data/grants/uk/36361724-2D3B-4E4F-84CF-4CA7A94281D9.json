Its main function is in the scaffolding network that supports the axons, the long, delicate processes that extend from the nerve cells. A healthy nerve cell requires a finely regulated supply of tau protein. It is now recognised that subtle variations within the tau gene and protein contribute to some movement disorders and dementias such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer s disease (AD). In recent work, we have used complex genetic analysis to pinpoint which regions of the tau gene contain such variations. We also have shown that their malign influence is by way of increasing production of the tau protein. With this project, we are using cellular and genetic models to investigate exactly how, within the context of the nerve cell, these genetic variations lead to the increased production of the tau protein. A better understanding of this could contribute towards the development of therapeutic approaches that, with greater precision, target the defective pathways. In the case of the tau gene, this could be by fine adjustment of tau protein production to the precise levels that a healthy nerve cell requires.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501560","grantId":"G0501560","fundValue":"854584","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rohan  De Silva","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
