{"id":"48B0AB33-5330-45D7-A067-15DFAE504555","title":"A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of screening for osteoporosis in older women","abstractText":"Osteoporosis is a common disease affecting around 20% of women aged over 50 years. The condition causes a ?thinning? of the bones making a sufferer prone to fractures. These fractures, particularly hip fractures, can lead to disability, a loss of independent living and even death. Current treatment for osteoporosis can reduce the risk of fracture by around 35% to 50%. However, predicting which women are at high risk of fracture and therefore would most likely benefit from treatment has so far not been conducted in a comprehensive and systematic manner. This study sets out to trial a method of screening all women aged between 70 and 85 for risk of fracture. Women in that age group recruited to the study will either be screened or managed as usual. Those screened and considered at high risk will be offered treatment by their GPs. All women will be followed for 5 years and, at the end of that period, a comparison of the fractures in the screened group will be made with those in the non-screened group. It is hoped that screening will reduce the number of fractures by around 20%.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601019","grantId":"G0601019","fundValue":"3724980","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lee  Shepstone","coPersons":["Richard  Fordham","Eugene Vincent McCloskey","Richard  Holland","Alison  Heawood","Terence  O'Neill","Cyrus  Cooper","Neil John Gittoes","Timothy James  Peters","David John Torgerson","Amanda  Howe","Tarnya  Marshall","John  Kanis","Ian  Harvey"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
