The mission would comprise up to 12 spacecraft flying in formation in Earth orbit, with separations from 10's of km to more than an Earth radius. MSSL will be interested in participating in the thermal particle analysers on Cross-Scale. There are a number of different configurations which potentially could be deployed around our high-heritage design concept to measure, for example, electrons, ions and/or electrons and ions, which would need to have their performance tuned to address requirements on each scale. Thus although any proposed instrument would be based on the prototype Improved Plasma Analyser (IPA) developed at MSSL under the rolling grant and on concepts proposed for NASA's MMS mission, a number of studies are required to adapt the IPA to meet the requirements of the Cross-Scale mission and validate its suitability for the mission. Since measurements on the electron scale are the most challenging, the activities proposed for the bridging period are aimed at verifying the requirements for those observations. Measurements on the ion and fluid scales could be made by similar instruments operating below their maximum potential capability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G001200/1","grantId":"ST/G001200/1","fundValue":"27098","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Findings were fed into the subsequent study of the Cross-Scale electron sensor.
