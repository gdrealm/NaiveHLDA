Over the past few years, a conventional wisdom has emerged within policy and research circles associating it with four key factors:&nbsp;poverty;&nbsp;youthful populations;&nbsp;the failure to consider womenâ€™s safety as a specific concern; and the local-level absence of the state. Taken together, these different factors have underpinned a range of policy interventions in a variety of contexts. Urban violence has nevertheless continued to proliferate, suggesting that the conventional wisdom underlying such violence-reduction interventions may be flawed.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research project aims to re-think conventional assumptions and offer new insights into the determinants of urban violence, including in particular identifying context-specific circumstances under which everyday urban conflict becomes violent. The study will focus on four specific cities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America: Dili (Timor Leste), Patna (India), Nairobi (Kenya), and Santiago (Chile). A key hypothesis is that urban conflict &quot;tips&quot; into overt violence principally as a result of qualitatively-specific &quot;violence chains&quot; rather than the quantitative factors. The project therefore aims to identify entry points to break linkages in these chains and foster new violence-reduction strategies both within poor urban communities and at the metropolitan level.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0483","grantId":"RES-167-25-0483","fundValue":"459194","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline Olivia Nonesi  Moser","coPersons":["Dennis  Rodgers"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
