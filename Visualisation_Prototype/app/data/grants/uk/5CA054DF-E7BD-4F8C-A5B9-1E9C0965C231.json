September 2010. The scope of the programme has been expanded to include the UK participation into the HIRES instrument.\nThis proposal is to request support for the contribution to HIRES by the Department of Physics and by the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge, as detailed in the UK E-ELT Programme spending proposal (Colin Cunningham) and approved by the UK E-ELT Steering Committee. More specifically the work packages for the University of Cambridge are listed in the following, along with the associated request of resources, which have already been approved by the UK E-ELT Steering Committee:\n\n- Blue book support: provide input from science, optics, opto-mecanics and detectors specialists (the Blue Book is planned to be published early in 2015) [37k&pound;]\n\n- Support and contribution to the HIRES Phase A proposal (call expected in early 2015). [62k&pound;]\n\n- Investigate methods for image/pupil slicing. [15k&pound;]\n\n- Investigate methods for mosaicing large gratings at cryogenic temperatures: develop a mosaicing prototype and perform lab testing [97.5k&pound;]\n\n- Investigate near-IR detector performances and limitations (stability, flat fielding accuracy, read out noise).
