SE21C studied large estates in upland Scotland and focused on how landowners (private, charitable and community owners) influence those who live and work on the estate.</p>\n\n<p>The research illustrated the impact of landowners’ decisions on community resilience and highlighted their role in facilitating business and lifestyle opportunities through sustaining rural employment and supporting community-generated entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the Small Grant was to present and discuss research findings with landowners, estate managers, communities, policy makers and others who took part in the SE21C project, as well as others interested in the results.</p>\n\n<p>Findings were presented at three feedback workshops in upland Scotland and an accessible reference booklet for practitioners was drafted for presentation at the events. The booklet focused on mutually-beneficial partnerships between privately-owned estates and communities, as well as more generic policy recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Workshop participants were asked to comment on the booklet and their feedback was&nbsp; incorporated into the final version, which was published in June 2012. Findings were also disseminated through research seminars and stakeholder conferences, policy briefings, magazine articles and a project website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I029796/1","grantId":"ES/I029796/1","fundValue":"9619","fundStart":"2011-07-13","fundEnd":"2012-07-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Please see publications and engagement activity Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Martin Francis Price","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Highlands and Islands","findingsText":" 1.
