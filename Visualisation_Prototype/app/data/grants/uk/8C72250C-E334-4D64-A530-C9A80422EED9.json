Consider compression of a quasi-monochromatic pulse with frequency monatonically varying in time from one frequency (w1) to another frequency (w2). This pulse is then propagated down a dispersive medium in which the group velocity of the wave is a function of frequency only. If the wave group velocity in the dispersive medium is an increasing function of frequency, vgr(w2) &gt; vgr(w1), then the tail of the pulse will overtake its leading edge, resulting in pulse shortening and a corresponding growth in the amplitude if the losses are sufficiently low. Compression experiments were first carried out using a smooth metal waveguide and were found attractive because of its capability of handling high power. However a serious drawback of a smooth waveguide as a powerful compressor is its operation very close to the cut-off. In optimum cases, the frequency at the beginning of an input pulse should be only 0.5-1% above the cut-off frequency. If one uses such a compressor at the output of a powerful amplifier, then the low-frequency part of the amplification band will be reflected back to the amplifier resulting in its possible parasitic self-oscillation (RF isolation using unidirectional elements is impossible at very high power). We propose to design and construct a waveguide with a helical corrugation of its inner surface as the frequency dispersive medium, to couple a pair of circularly polarized partial modes of the smooth waveguide having significantly different group velocities. Pulse compression using a 3-fold helically corrugated waveguide using an optimised frequency swept pulse generated by a state-of-the-art programmable Arbitary waveform generator and microwave sweeper will be studied, with the predictions of theory compared to experiment. We propose also to design, build and investigate the use of a larger diameter 5-fold helically corrugated waveguide as the frequency dispersive medium to compress MW frequency swept pulses generated by a gyrotron travelling wave amplifier. The advantage of using a 5-fold helical structure as compared to a 3-fold helical waveguide is that it requires the use of a higher order mode and hence the diameter of the compressor is increased which means that higher peak power radiation can be propagated down the compressor before the electric fields becomes excessively large resulting in RF breakdown. A favourable wave dispersion can be synthesized for the higher-order modes (near cut-off TE2,2 mode which couples to a counter-rotating TE3,1 mode) excited in a 5-fold helical compressor resulting in an increase of the helical waveguide diameter by a factor of 1.5-2 (without significant overlapping of the coupling bands) and correspondingly in an enhancement of its RF breakdown strength. Unique high power (multi-MW), short pulse (~1ns) radiation required in a number of applications will be generated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E058868/1","grantId":"EP/E058868/1","fundValue":"518375","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Simulations and experiments were carried out using an X-band relativistic backward wave oscillator (RBWO) designed to produce a chirped output signal, with power of hundreds of MWs, being compressed to a multi-GW pulse using the 5-fold helically corrugated waveguide. When the top of the voltage pulse driving the RBWO decreased from 550kV to 300 kV and the beam current increased from 8 to 10 kA the RBWO generated radiation with power of 0.6-0.8 GW whilst frequency sweeping from 10 to 9.6 GHz over 15 ns. Compression of pulses down to a half-width of 2.2 ns accompanied by a 4.5-fold power increase up to a value of 3.2 GW was achieved. This method has the potential to compress 750MW, 80ns duration chirped pulses to produce GW pulses.

In the experiments the input radiation was launched from an X-band (8.2-12.5 GHz) waveguide and proceeded through a rectangular-to-circular adapter then through an elliptical cross-sectional polarizer which converted the linearly polarized TE1,1 mode to a circularly polarized mode. This mode was adiabatically transformed into the operating mode [Fig. 1(b)] via a TE1,1 to TE3,1 mode converter. At the output, the opposite transition occurred. The compression experiments were carried out by programming an Agilent N6030A arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to generate an optimized input signal, in the form of I and Q data, to the mixers of an Agilent E8267D vector signal generator (VSG) [Fig 1(d)]. An PTC6321 Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (9.6GHz to 9.0GHz) supplied by TMD Ltd was used to amplify the radiation generated by the solid-state oscillators and mixers, up to a power of 5.8 kW. Experiments performed at 5.8kW, demonstrated that X-band microwave pulses of 80-ns duration with a 5% frequency sweep (9.6GHz to 9.0GHz) can be compressed into 145kW, 1.5-ns pulses having 25 times higher peak power [Figure 2]. Approximately 50% of the input energy was compressed to the main body of the compressed pulse. Good agreement was achieved between theory and experiment providing improved understanding of this method of compressing frequency swept microwave radiation which was applied to the generation of high-power (GW) microwave pulses.
