This is the broad theme of the studentship. The seminar will discuss three areas of debate, of interest both to business and government:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>What knowledge do businesses have of urban regeneration plans and policies, and how do such policies and plans influence business plans and behaviour?</li>\n\n <li>What are the motives for business involvement in urban regeneration? How can these be developed and harnessed?</li>\n\n <li>What factors are likely to inhibit or prevent business involvement in sustainable community building?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-623-26-0001","grantId":"RES-623-26-0001","fundValue":"2959","fundStart":"2008-06-12","fundEnd":"2009-06-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rob  Imrie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
