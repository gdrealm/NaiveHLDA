UK antenatal genetic screening programmes have policies stating that their primary aim is to facilitate ‘informed choices’. Advances in DNA technology will make antenatal screening for many genetic disorders a reality in the next decade, which raises ethical concerns about facilitating informed choice. Furthermore, choice overload may have debilitating effects, resulting in bewilderment and high levels of anxiety and stress, and the paradox of choice is that 'more can mean less'. The primary aim of this project is to explore whether people value choice within the context of antenatal genetic screening, and whether and how people of different ethnic origins (African-Caribbean, British white, Chinese, and Pakistani) share ‘informed choices’ as a value. The project uses Q methodology which involves a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The findings will enable a greater understanding of the different cultural values attached to the concept of informed choice. This is essential for healthcare providers practicing in multiethnic populations largely guided by Western ethical principles, in order to facilitate better communication, quality of care and equity of access, which could impact uptake of services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0036","grantId":"RES-061-25-0036","fundValue":"331764","fundStart":"2008-01-02","fundEnd":"2011-01-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Shenaz  Ahmed","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
