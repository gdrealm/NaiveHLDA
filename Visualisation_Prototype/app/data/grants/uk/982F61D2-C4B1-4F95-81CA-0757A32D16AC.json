However, their implementation is mainly limited by their tendency to agglomerate and sinter into bigger and more stable particles, losing their exceptional characteristics. The aim of this project is to stabilize metal nanoparticles using morphologically engineered supports overcoming the diffusion challenges faced by conventional stabilization approaches, specially relevant in catalytic applications. The potential of this new type of metal nanostructured catalyst will be explored in areas of green chemistry, environment and energy applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K016334/1","grantId":"EP/K016334/1","fundValue":"107061","fundStart":"2013-02-20","fundEnd":"2014-10-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have provided the foundations for a new manufacturing technology for metal nanoparticles and catalysts for their use in electronic, healthcare and catalytic applications.\nWe are currently engaging with industry for the implementation of these findings on their current catalytic systems.
