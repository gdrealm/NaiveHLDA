{"id":"0C3D6CD3-F006-42AF-B216-5F074175047B","title":"Controlled release therapeutic coatings for orthopaedic devices based upon novel sol-gel formulations","abstractText":"Infection is a major complication of arthroplasty surgery with a reported incidence after primary surgery of approx 1-2%. The costs of treatment to eradicate infection are substantial to both patient and institution, and in terms of clinical expenditure are typically up to 4-5 times that of the primary intervention. Prevention of infection is therefore mandatory and prophylaxis with antibiotics plays a significant role. In cemented arthroplasty surgery, antibiotics elute from the bone cement during the crucial early perioperative period. However, the number of cemented hips in the UK has dropped from 54 to 36% while cementless arthroplasty has increased from 22 to 43%. The concept of cementless biological fixation is particularly attractive, especially for the young and active patient, hence the need for an antibiotic-release coating on cementless implants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J014656/1","grantId":"MR/J014656/1","fundValue":"399359","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Akid","coPersons":["Ian  Brook","Thomas John Smith","Paul Vincent Hatton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
