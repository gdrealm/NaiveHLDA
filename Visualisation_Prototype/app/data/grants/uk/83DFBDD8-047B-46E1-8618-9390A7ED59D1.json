{"id":"83DFBDD8-047B-46E1-8618-9390A7ED59D1","title":"Comparable and Parallel Corpus Approaches to the Third Code: English and Chinese Perspectives","abstractText":"<p>With increasing globalisation, translation has nowadays played an ever more important role than before in helping West to meet East or vice versa. Translation Studies is an area of research that has been both aided greatly and advanced by the corpus methodology over the past two decades. As translating is a kind of mediated communication involving different languages, the effect of the source language on the translation is inevitable and strong enough to make the translational language perceptibly different from the target native language.</p>\n\n<p>This research project, which involves international collaboration between Lancaster University in the UK and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, is a corpus-based study of the common linguistic and textual features of translations, from the perspectives of English and Chinese, two genetically distinct major languages in the world, by taking an innovative composite methodology that combines the comparable corpus approach and the parallel corpus approach to language studies on the basis of sizeable corpora of authentic language use in English and Chinese. The combination of :</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the balanced coverage of usage contexts in language use</li>\n\n <li>the strict comparability of the corpora used</li>\n\n <li>the typological distance between English and Chinese as two distinctly different languages</li>\n\n <li>the innovative composite corpus-based approach integrating comparable corpus and parallel corpus analysis</li>\n\n <li>the inclusion of register variation as a variable,</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>will enable the researchers to investigate the linguistic and textual features of translational language more systematically and achieve more reliable research outcomes than ever before. Research of this kind can cast new light on the translation process and help to uncover translation norms, which are of theoretical significance for Translation Studies as well as practical importance for translation teaching, translator training and translation practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010107/1","grantId":"ES/K010107/1","fundValue":"78768","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As the project is still going on in its second phase, we are still working on disseminating our findings to academic and non-academic audience in the forms of conference presentation, publication of internationally peer-refereed journal articles, composition of a monograph, creation of a project website, holding seminars for translation practitioners and teachers, etc. The actual use of our research findings will be reported in more details later on.

These corpora are a one-million-word balanced comparable corpus of translated English (Corpus of Translational English) and two one-million-word balanced parallel corpora of English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation. 2) Based on the comparable and parallel corpora, a series of new knowledge with regard to the general linguistic and textual features of translational English and/or translational Chinese and variations in such features across registers and genres has been exhaustively explored and investigated. The monolingual typical features of translational language, as well as the cross-lingual commonalities and differences between translated English and translated Chinese, are important empirical and theoretical contributions to linguistic knowledge in general and to translation studies specifically. 3) An innovative composite methodology has been practised and improved throughout the research. The methodology not only combines comparable and parallel corpus approaches, but also incorporates statistical analyses of multiple linguistic features of texts in two genetically distant languages across various registers and genres. 4) In addition to the academia, knowledge transfer to non-academic beneficiaries is being carried out in the second phase of the project. We aim to disseminate the corpora and research results to translation teachers, trainees, practitioners and professional bodies of translation. As an on-going project, the second phase of the project aims to disseminate the corpora and research findings to both academic and non-academic audience. The outputs of our research will be of interest and benefit to other researchers in corpus linguistics, contrastive and translation studies, and computational linguistics. We have disseminated some of the findings to the academia by giving presentations at conferences and workshops and submitting two research articles to international peer-refereed journals. And a monograph is also under preparation. To non-academic audience, we are still working on delivering the corpora and findings to translation teachers, students, practitioners and professional bodies of translations with the collaboration of the HK co-investigators. Our corpora will be useful data bases for translation training and practice, development of software tools for machine translation and translation memory. Some research findings are of pedagogical significance to translation training. We hope these findings can be incorporated in creating new textbooks and translation training programmes and raising translators' awareness of the specialities of translational language.
