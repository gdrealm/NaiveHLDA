{"id":"979B253B-AFFD-4945-923C-CABAD554E70E","title":"The Book Unbound: Disruption and Disintermediation in the Digital Age","abstractText":"The human experience of how we produce, disseminate and perceive text is being irrevocably transformed by the advent of digital technologies. The project focuses on how publishing as both a business and a cultural activity is reacting to this constantly changing relationship as we move from print and paper to digital ink and screen. Such seisimic shifts have resulted in a plethora of new business models that challenge the prevailing hierarchies of cultural gatekeeping as well as new modes of authorship, and have also reshaped perceptions of the book as cultural artefact. These alternative business models are growing in popularity. One example is the lean start-up model which, by moving away from author payment by advance to income generated by royalties, has been particularly influential in stimulating entrepreneurial activity in the publishing sector. \n \nThe model of the traditional publishing value chain traces the trajectory of intellectual property from the author to the end consumer, where publishing activities such as editorial, marketing and design are all performed by the single entity of the publisher. However, this process has now been disrupted and disintermediated at every stage by the intervention of digital technologies and consequent infrastructural changes. Authors and non-traditional publishers can now publish, market and distribute their work without the aid of a publisher or conventional business practices. \n \nThe project uses two different modes of inquiry to demonstrate the ramifications of this disintermediation on the publishing industry. Its specific focus is on how 21st century modes of creation, production, distribution and consumption destabilise received notions of cultural authority, and redistributes cultural, social and economic capital. The first mode of inquiry entails the creation of five case studies (of Faber Factory, Unbound, Canongate TV, Bloomsbury Academic, Bloody Scotland/Blasted Heath) which will each describe an emergent business model that has been created in response to technological change. The second mode will involve creating a digital artefact using recently released desktop publishing software in order to analyse and assess the processes involved in creating a textual object, which also has the capacity to incorporate sound, video and social media. This approach will facilitate an examination of how narrative and genre changes when moving from print to convergent digital form. These outputs will be made available on the project website, which will demonstrate how every aspect of the publishing process is in transition. Users will be able to interact with the website infographic to explore each element further.\n \nThe project's potential benefits derive from the publishing industry's state of constant flux brought about by the rapid development of electronic formats and devices. As new standards and devices are released on an almost weekly basis, there is a need to evaluate and test these technologies before investing in them. This requires a significant investment of both time and money, which publishers are reluctant to undertake in a precarious economic climate. The project is informed by the environment of emerging digital toolkits and devices for publishing. The research will identify new learning needs and skillsets required by entrants into the publishing industry, enabling more focussed pedagogy in this area. The project's overview of the changing literary marketplace will be useful to those instrumental in creating cultural policy, as it allows for greater understanding of the needs of individual writers and artists, and SMEs who are involved in publishing and disseminating content and their economic needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J01317X/1","grantId":"AH/J01317X/1","fundValue":"22199","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Squires","coPersons":["Padmini  Ray Murray","Paula Jane Kiri  Morris"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
