Despite this, little is known about the early development of children's self-presentational competencies. </p> \n<p>This project examines the understanding of self-presentational behaviour in young children between 4 and 8 years of age. In particular, the research will examine how children in this age range come to understand that certain behaviours can be used after a rule violation (eg, apologies, excuses) in order to maintain a positive public ‘face’.&nbsp;The work will involve a series of experiments where young children answer questions regarding hypothetical stories about everyday rule violations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These experiments will also test the prediction that certain types of rule violations (eg, where the protagonist breaks a social convention, making him or her look silly) are particularly important contexts for children's learning about these processes. Finally, the research will test the proposal that having attention focused on oneself is the key psychological mechanism, triggering concerns about public 'face'. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0508","grantId":"RES-062-23-0508","fundValue":"201708","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Anil Banerjee","coPersons":["Mark  Bennett"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
