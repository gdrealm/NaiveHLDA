ELMACT will benefit its industrial partners, which encompass the complete value chain, by improved tool performance, and by providing optimised machining conditions and reduced costs. It will reduce the partners' demand for materials, such as heavy metals, that are of increasing strategic importance. The University of Manchester will increase understanding of the use of coated micro-tools and develop specific IPR in the area of femto-second laser technology as applied to sol-gel coating technology, shot peening and re-shaping of micro-tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010512/1","grantId":"DT/E010512/1","fundValue":"429472","fundStart":"2007-06-18","fundEnd":"2010-06-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings supported the collaborating companies in developing micro machining capability. \n\nLaser cleaning of cutting tools was extended to laser cleaning for aerospace application in the SAMULET project Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology Economic","person":"Paul T.
