{"id":"BA80C9FD-882E-4A7D-BFD6-910B6AAD0E7B","title":"The Future of Political Parties in Local Government","abstractText":"<p>There is an emergent view&nbsp;that the dominant role of political parties in local government is experiencing a crisis of legitimacy. The seminar series will explore differing views about the existence and nature of the crisis by an examination of the effects that political parties have on local political representation and decision-making and on the provision of local political leadership. The seminars will examine how parties organise to conduct their activities and council business, and how parties and councillors interpret concepts such as democracy, representation, accountability and citizen participation. They will explore whether, in a local representative democracy, political parties are the only means by which a choice between council candidates can be legitimised and effective.</p> \n<p>The seminars will provide a forum for academics, practitioners and policy-makers to exchange and develop knowledge, experience, concepts, theories and practice about the nature of the relationship between political parties and local democracy and government. Such a review and evaluation of current party practices in the conduct of local politics and council affairs will provide alternative visions of local party politics and stimulate a valuable dialogue about new ways of conducting local politics through political parties. The seminars will conduct such a debate within the context of comparative developments in European local politics.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4210","grantId":"RES-451-25-4210","fundValue":"7534","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Copus","coPersons":["Jo  Dungey","KB  Ritchie","Steven  Leach","Simon Frank Parker"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
