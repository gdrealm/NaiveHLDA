Although transmission of enteric pathogens via salad leaves is on the rise, only a few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms used by human enteric bacterial pathogens to attach to plants. Likewise there have been few studies investigating variation between plant genotypes on bacterial adhesion and/or survival and those that have not addressed the genetic basis of any differences. In this project we aim to investigate how human bacterial pathogens attach to salad leaves (in particular lettuce). We will determine the effect of bacterial growth condition on the ability of the organism to attach to leaves. Similarly, we will determine the effect of plant growth conditions on susceptibility to bacterial attachment. Using genetic approaches, we will determine which bacterial genes are involved in leaf attachment and we will utilise a lettuce mapping population of recombinant inbred lines to initiate studies aimed at gaining an understanding of the genetic basis of a plant's susceptibility to bacterial adhesion. We will also determine survival and replication rates of Salmonella and E. coli on the different lettuce lines. The ultimate goal of our studies is to provide the underpinning knowledge of the interaction between the plant and enteric bacteria in the phyllosphere to allow the development of strategies to reduce the risk of crop contamination and to increase food safety.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G014175/2","grantId":"BB/G014175/2","fundValue":"197623","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Hand","coPersons":["David Anthony Pink"],"organisation":"Harper Adams University","findingsText":" There were 3 significant discoveries arising from this grant as follows:\n1. The identification of plant traits which affect pathogen attachment, especially specific compounds such as phenolics which are involved in plant defence responses. \n2. The significant levels of internal (endophytic) colonisation of lettuce leaves by pathogens which has implications for post-harvest processing in the salads industry.\n3. The discovery of bacteria in the natural leaf microbial community which are antagonistic to human pathogens raises the possibility of natural control methods. Our discovery that specific physical and biochemical components of lettuce leaves affect pathogen attachment and the fact that there is a genetic component to this could be taken forward by further research to further define the underlying genetics and understand the mechanism(s) involved. The information could be used in plant breeding to develop cultivars which are less susceptible to colonisation by human pathogens.\nThe significant degree of internal colonisation of leaves by pathogenic bacteria should be of interest to the salad processing and retail industry as it could reduce the effectiveness of current washing protocols for bagged salads. Washing and monitoring procedures should be reviewed and modified if neccessary. \nWe discovered that some bacteria found in the leaf microbial community were able to inhibit or prevent the growth of human pathogens in vitro. Further research would be needed to confirm this and to determine the nature of the interaction, but it raises the possibility of natural control methods to reduce or prevent contamination of leaves.
