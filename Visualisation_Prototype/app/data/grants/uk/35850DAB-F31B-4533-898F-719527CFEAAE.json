{"id":"35850DAB-F31B-4533-898F-719527CFEAAE","title":"GerManC: A historical corpus of German 1650-1800","abstractText":"<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to set up a historical corpus of the German language, called GerManC, which will cover the period 1650 to 1800. This is a crucial period in the development of the language, as the modern standard was formed during it, and competing regional norms were finally eliminated. The structure of this corpus will parallel that of similar historical linguistic corpora of English and thus be a basis for comparative studies of the development of the grammar or vocabulary of the two languages. </p> \n<p>The present initial stage is a pilot study for twelve months which will aim at collecting a sample corpus of 100,000 words from representative newspapers from the period in question. On the basis of this we shall be developing computer tools to ‘tag’ the corpus, i.e. identify the grammatical features of each word, and for ‘lemmatisation’, i.e. compiling a dictionary of all the words in the corpus. This project will ultimately contribute to and complement a more extensive historical corpus of German, where we shall be working in collaboration with a team of colleagues in Germany based at the Humboldt University in Berlin, G&ouml;ttingen, and the Institute for German Language in Mannheim.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1609","grantId":"RES-000-22-1609","fundValue":"47609","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Durrell","coPersons":["P  Bennett"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
