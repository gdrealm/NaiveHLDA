{"id":"B5E8BE52-CFB9-4BDA-9937-D121741E349E","title":"The Memory Network","abstractText":"From Plato's wax tablet and Freud's exploration of the 'mystic writing pad' to contemporary metaphors of digital archives, our understanding of memory has often been shaped by technological models. But in recent years, this understanding has been significantly enhanced through exciting scientific breakthroughs. Writers, critics and academics working in the arts and humanities are now turning to new ways of thinking within biosciences, psychology, mathematics, and computer science to reconsider individual and collective memory in literary narratives. At the same time, many scientists acknowledge the benefits of engaging with creative ideas and the ethical and hermeneutic perspectives offered through fiction and humanities methodologies. \nThe Memory Network (MN) brings together researchers, authors and organisations to provoke and fuel original ways of thinking about memory. Many important contemporary writers are already in a vibrant dialogue with science and offer crucial starting points for the MN's activity: for example, Ian McEwan's and Will Self's research into neuroscience for Saturday (2005) and The Book of Dave (2006); Margaret Atwood's and Kazuo Ishiguro's thinking about the impact of 'the posthuman' upon human memory; Terry Pratchett's quest to understand the effect on his writing of progressive Alzheimer's; and Hanif Kureishi's interest in understanding how matter and mind are related.\n One of the Network's ambitions is to grow and nurture a community of thinkers interested in cross-disciplinary approaches to memory studies, open to communicating with each other and with the general public. It will also stimulate new creative work and we are particularly keen to actively involve living writers in this community and its various debates. We will encourage a dialogue to develop between the academic community, creative writers and artists, and the general public. Interaction will be encouraged in a number of ways. Firstly, and following an initial symposium called 'The Future of Memory' (funded by the Wellcome Trust), the MN will run a series of free lectures, memory experiments, panel discussions and interactive workshops throughout the first year of the scheme. These events will tackle topics including science and psychogeography, memory, food and phenomenology, memory and new media, memory and prediction, human and artificial intelligence memory, and writing, aging and forgetting. A website called the 'Memory Repository' will support discussion and correspondence between Core Members and the general public in response to these events. Finally, the MN will publish two collaborative works: a 'manifesto' called The Future of Memory: Notes for the New Millennium and an edited collection of essays provisionally titled Memory, Literature and Science.\nThe Memory Network has literary studies at its core, and most of its initial members are based in English departments with an established or emerging research interest in memory and narrative. In addition, key researchers from other disciplines will join as active members or in an advisory capacity. At present the Network is primarily based in contributors from the UK and North America, but an additional aim for its final phase is to critically situate these interdisciplinary investigations in wider contexts with a European and global emphasis, culminating in a major international conference.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005894/1","grantId":"AH/J005894/1","fundValue":"35949","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Both within the academic fields we have covered, within the creative communities we've engaged and energized, and in the public sphere the Memory Network has established changing attitudes to both the role of cognition and memory in contemporary society, as well as contributed to the rethinking the relationship between the arts and the humanities, and the sciences. In society, the role of cognition and memory is on various high profile agendas, in the media as well as in public discourse, and the Memory Network's activities have had a substantial influence on these debates, reaching from the impact of the digital world on our social behaviour and on thinking about climate change to changing identities and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. Within the academe, the Memory Network's modes of connection between disiplines has seen a new wave of interdisciplinary thinking, which are also finding their way into the class room (via new modules on literature/culture and memory, and the brain, for instance) and in a strong appetite for interdisciplinary publications. The Memory Network's influence will be consolidated with the publication of the edited collection 'Memory in the Twenty-first Century' (Palgrave 2015), and the special edition of Memory Studies (2016).

There are multiplicity of revolutions that together are radically reshaping the context of our thinking about what it means to be a human being in the twenty-first century. Memory is key to understanding these new contexts, which simultaneously reshape our understanding of memory itself. We have explored these concerns through a number of research strands, which together form a mapping of the contemporary human condition. One key concern lies in the ways in which the digital world is reshaping our memory, and our social behaviour and relationships. We have shown that new technologies do not simply entails a loss of cognition and memory, but that it changes the mind and behaviour in complex and subtle ways. In summary, we have found that memory has and is changing, and that it displays the following characteristics:\n\n1. There is a renewed engagement with, and fascination by, the complexities of memory in society;\n2. the renewed interest in memory is the result of a new set of complex contexts (including globalisation, climate change, and ageing population) that offer new intellectual challenges;\n3. Memories studies has been greatly influenced by the revolutions that neuroscience has brought since the 1960s;\n4. Due to the dominance of neuroscience, there is move away from thinking of memory as a collective socio-cultural event and a shift towards the pursuit of memory as processes that take place in the brain, body and mind in individual biological units;\n5. the digital revolutions are radically reshaping our memories, sparking much concern from various critics;\n6. With the advances of new technologies and (social) media identified above, memory is becoming more and more a collectively shared, extended and distributed activity of archiving and interpretative process between the various users involved in the original experience, its dissemination and reproduction; \n7. Due to the mass availability of technology for common users, the creation and dissemination of memory is democratized through the effects that technology has on our contemporary experience, which includes sharing our experiences through, for instance, social networking sites, apps and other programmes, but also through new techniques such as crowd-sourcing and the algorithmic patterning and analysis of Big Data, which gives the possibility of accessing, mining, analysing the 'wisdom of the crowd'; \n8. Whereas in earlier times remembering was understood as the retrieval of fixed representations events taken place in the past (whereby the integral purity of the original experience is retained), we now understand that memory is our capacity to constantly reorganise information whose understanding is itself determined by contextual association;\n9.Due to the ubiquity of technology, we are seeing the creation of 'transactive memory', which is dependent on group cognition;\n10. There is a complexification of thinking about the temporality of memory, especially in our conception of thinking how memory related to the future;\n11. There is a new emphasis on the fictional aspects of memory, which sees the return to the uses of literary studies;\n12. A new phenomenon, in the light of, memory storage facilities outside the body is both an anxiety of cognitive offloading, but also a positive assessment of new extensions of the mind. \n \nWhat we also have seen is that the traditional divide between the arts and humanities, and the sciences is narrowing. There is a renewed appetite within the academe, and beyond, for interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration. The Memory Network has played a role in this process. We already have assembled a team which is keen to investigate in more detail the effects of the digital world on our cognition, memory and behaviour. Other researcher will most certainly be picking up on our findings, and find their own research paths. Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
