These languages can be found across a range of cultural sites; from popular and media representations to scientific textbooks and medical journals. \nThis project ask how feminist theory can critically engage with the language of hormones without adhering to either biological or social determinism, that is without accepting that hormones create differences in any simple way or denying their activity altogether. Bringing together feminist philosophies of the body and cultural histories of scientific and medical text, I explore the significance of hormones in the construction of sexual bodies over the twentieth century. Combining the conceptual tools provided by these fields, I develop a new approach to the language of sex hormones, arguing that they can be theorised as active 'messengers of sex' that disrupt culturally validated boundaries between nature and culture, between the biological and the social. \n The three case studies addressed in this argument are; medical and popular discourses or hormone replacement therapy and ageing; and medical and popular accounts of the role of sex hormones in producing differences in males and female babies and children. All of these case studies involve detailed examinations of text and images which describe or figure hormones as central to the production of sexual differences. The project will result in a book, contracted to Cambridge University Press (2007).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501261/1","grantId":"AH/D501261/1","fundValue":"17907","fundStart":"2006-04-17","fundEnd":"2006-08-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Celia Mary Roberts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
