{"id":"44CD9C7F-D3CA-447F-B6DA-FE0B9A90135B","title":"The Political Economy of African Financial (Under-) Development","abstractText":"<br />The broad aim of this project is to examine financial development experiences within Africa, and especially the role of government in both relatively successful and unsuccessful cases. &nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />The theoretical part of the project will develop a model to analyse the relationship between savings mobilisation, financial development and the industrial sector. Savings mobilisation will be captured through individual incentives to make deposits in a domestic bank.&nbsp; The starting point for modelling will be the framework of the “circular city” model of bank competition. This will be extended in several directions to allow an analysis of various stylised facts relating to African banking systems, including variable property rights enforcement and capital flight. \n<br />\n<br />Empirical work will be informed by theoretical results obtained. It will analyse various financial development indicators, including proxies of the degree of savings mobilisation. One set of estimations will be carried out using panel estimation methods, which will take advantage of available data on a large number of African countries.&nbsp; Additional empirical work will aim at making comparisons between successful and unsuccessful cases of financial development in different parts of Africa. This work will focus on a smaller group of countries for which sufficiently long time series data exists. &nbsp;\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2774","grantId":"RES-000-22-2774","fundValue":"70458","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Panicos  Demetriades","coPersons":["Svetlana  Andrianova"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
