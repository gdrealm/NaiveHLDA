{"id":"2A630E0C-0C27-4784-9387-FF96A490A9D6","title":"Foliation Theory in Birational Geometry","abstractText":"The goal of the Minimal Model Program is to generalise the main results \nof the Castelnuovo-Enrique-Severi classification of algebraic surfaces, to \nhigher dimensional projective varieties. \nThe programme was started by Mori in the 1980s, for which he won the \nprestigious Fields Medal. It was successfully carried out for projective \nthreefolds by Kawamata, Koll&aacute;r, Miyaoka, Mori, Reid, Shokurov and many \nothers. More recently, some of these results were also generalised to any dimension.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed research is to develop new techniques, using\nFoliation Theory, to solve some of the current obstacles in the Minimal\nModel Program. This will be achieved by combining together tools from different areas of mathematics, \nsuch as Number Theory, K&auml;hler Geometry and Analysis. In particular, I plan to use the new results \nin the Minimal Model Program to study the classification of foliations over \na projective variety.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J019356/1","grantId":"EP/J019356/1","fundValue":"218570","fundStart":"2013-01-28","fundEnd":"2016-01-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paolo  Cascini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
