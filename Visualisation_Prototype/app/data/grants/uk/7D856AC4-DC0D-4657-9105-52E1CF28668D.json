{"id":"7D856AC4-DC0D-4657-9105-52E1CF28668D","title":"Crane Construction Challenge","abstractText":"<p>The Crane Construction Challenge was a hands-on activity in which family teams designed, built and tested a crane using a simple kit. The Crane Construction Challenge was held on 17 March as part of the Cambridge Science Festival 2007. The activity was designed for children aged 7-13 and was hosted in the New Museums Site, which is centrally located in Cambridge. The activity was supported by a large team of Cambridge University engineers (staff and students) who assisted the teams with their design and construction, and supervised the testing. The event attracted more than 1000 participants over the course of the day.<br /><br />The cranes were constructed from rolled paper tubes which each team manufactured and joined together with nuts and bolts. When completed each team had the opportunity to test their crane to destruction! All teams were able to take home a 'what next?' ideas kit which allowed them to tackle further construction challenges at home. Teams were invited to send in pictures of the structure they completed at home to be displayed on our Outreach website. Prizes were awarded for the most innovative structures.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0057","grantId":"RES-168-26-0057","fundValue":"1784","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey Thomas Parks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
