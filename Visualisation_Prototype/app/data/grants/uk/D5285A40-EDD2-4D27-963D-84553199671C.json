This is accompanied by a higher risk of numerous infirmities associated with old age, including loss of mental capabilities, loss of mobility, as well as increased risk of hospitalization and of death associated with surgical procedures. While in some people the cause of the anemia can be identified as chronic inflammation or kidney dysfunction, about a third have no identifiable cause. \n\nIn this project we will examine if changes to the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the cells that produce all blood cell types, play a role in age-dependent anemia. We have developed a technique that allows us to measure the red cell production of a single HSC, and found that there are different types of HSCs with vastly different ability to make red blood cells. We now wish to examine if changes to the abundance of the different HSC subtypes can account for the decline in red cell production, and in addition, whether such changes are due to influences from the cells that surround and support the HSCs in the bone marrow.\n\nThe aim of these studies is to identify mechanisms by which the decline in red cell production can be prevented, or ultimately reverted.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M024350/1","grantId":"BB/M024350/1","fundValue":"449258","fundStart":"2015-11-08","fundEnd":"2019-05-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claus  Nerlov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
