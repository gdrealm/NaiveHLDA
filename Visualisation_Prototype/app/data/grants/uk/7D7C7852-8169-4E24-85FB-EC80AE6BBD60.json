These aim to pay for nature's services through the involvement of business and the wider public. Specifically, research has informed the development of a pilot UK Peatland Code to stimulate private investment in peatland restoration. The pilot Code, which was published for public feedback in June (and launched in September 2013 by the Environment Minister), sets out guidance and quality standards for sustainable business investment in peatlands. It has implications for chartered surveyors, planners and others advising clients on future land use and income generating opportunities. According to Defra's Deputy Director of Sustainable Land and Rural Evidence and Analysis, lessons from this research have &quot;made a significant contribution&quot; towards Defra's PES agenda, &quot;provid[ing] us with valuable lessons for the development of PES schemes in the UK&quot; (according to Defra's Deputy Director of Sustainable Land and Rural Evidence and Analysis).\n\nAfter completing the research, the team continued working with a team led by URS to finalise a PES Best Practice Guide for Defra, which was published in May 2013. This included the development of a case study on the Peatland Code. This Guide was one of the commitments contained in Defra's Natural Environment White Paper, published in 2011, which has since been used widely among Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs) and Nature Improvement Areas, and a range of other initiatives to facilitate Payments for Ecosystem Services. Working with researchers from this project, the Guide was used to develop and launch a suite of smart phone apps in the Lake District and North Pennines to elicit payments for ecosystem services from members of the public visiting the area.\n\nResearch findings about best practice in knowledge exchange arising from this research were used as the basis for the Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) partnership's Knowledge Exchange Guidelines (launched in November 2012) and the EU Biodiversa programme's Stakeholder Engagement Manual (launched September 2014). These guidelines and manual are informing knowledge exchange activities across LWEC and Biodiversa investments and activities. An international, not-for-profit training programme based on research arising from this project was launched in February 2013. \n\nSince then, researchers from the team have (or are booked to have) trained researchers and managers of research from the University of Maastrict (the Netherlands), ETH Zurich (Switzerland), and in the UK, Universities of Nottingham, Newcastle, Sheffield, Leeds, Glasgow, Stirling, Hull, Portsmouth, Exeter, Lancaster, Manchester, East Anglia, Reading, Leeds, Kings College London, University of the Highlands and Islands (Scottish Association for Marine Science), the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), the Biotechnology &amp;amp; Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Science &amp;amp; Technology Funding Council (STFC), British Geological Survey, the British Ecological Society, Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK Climate Impacts Programme, National Oceanography Centre, Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS), Scottish Government and their Main Research Providers (James Hutton Institute, Moredun Research Institute and Scotland's Rural College), Natural England, Department for Environment &amp;amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and the Permaculture Association.

The research explored the potential to elicit payments for carbon, biodiversity, water quality and recreational benefits associated with peatland restoration, including a scenario-based assessment of possible trade-offs (up to 2030) and an assessment of market and governance needs.\n\nThis research clearly demonstrated that over appropriate timeframes (e.g. 30-100 year contracts) good practice peatland restoration can deliver significant climate change mitigation benefits, with typical costs of restoration between ?53,300-?70,600 for a 100 hectare site. With typical Greenhouse Gas emission reduction benefits of between 3.9-4.2 tonnes CO2 equivalent per hectare per year, this would equate to 11,700-12,600 tonnes CO2 equivalent over a 30 year contract (equivalent to a year's emissions of over 7,000 average family cars). If this investment were turned into an asset, the investment would break even by the end of a 30 year contract if the carbon was worth ?7.50 per tonne. If carbon prices were higher than ?7.50 per tonne, then this would represent a return on investment. At the same time, this work would deliver improvements in water quality (primarily reductions in brown colouration caused by Dissolved Organic Carbon), biodiversity (in particular blanket bog specialists) and recreational access (primarily due to restoration of deep gullies). The research has demonstrated that there is a strong interest in sponsoring peatland restoration from the private sector (notably from food and drink, hospitality and horticulture) and corporations are willing to pay a premium for UK-based projects that deliver climate change mitigation alongside biodiversity and water benefits. However, the research investors need appropriate Government-backed guidance to give them confidence that their investments will deliver these benefits, and guidance is needed to ensure landowners follow good practice restoration. The research team therefore led the development of a UK Peatland Code, funded by Defra and supported by the Environment Minister, with the support of Environment Ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the final phase of the project, research was conducted into mechanisms of knowledge exchange, using upland and catchment management projects as an empirical case study, from which to derive generalisable principles. Policymakers and practitioners hoping to use research findings in their work can face a number of barriers. For instance, poor communication and dissemination of research by scientists, or a lack of technical expertise amongst policymakers and practitioners to interpret and apply the complex research findings, can limit the use of research in a decision-making context. In an effort to overcome such barriers, there has been a growing focus on understanding how knowledge is exchanged between interested parties. For this study, the researchers set out to identify the key principles of effective knowledge exchange.\n\nInterviews were conducted with 32 individuals, who included academics, project managers and non-academic stakeholders from 13 different upland and catchment projects in the UK. The research identified over 50 different themes relating to knowledge exchange from the interviews. These were then reduced down to five broad principles for effective knowledge exchange:\n\n1) Design\nIt is important to know what everyone involved hopes to achieve through knowledge exchange and that these aims are built into the environmental project from the beginning.\n\n2) Representation\nThe distinction between those who carry out research and those who use its results should be made as early as possible. The input of the two groups should be used to help design both the research and knowledge exchange.\n\n3) Engagement\nTwo-way communication and long-term trust should be encouraged between researchers and other stakeholders wherever possible, to facilitate knowledge exchange.\n\n4) Generate impact\nTo keep potential users of research engaged with the research process, there should be a focus on creating tangible results as early as possible, and ensuring that the results that will be valued by as many stakeholders as possible.\n\n5) Reflect and sustain\nEffective knowledge exchange is based around long-term relationships and learning. Monitoring and reflecting to continually improve the process is key. Considering ways to sustain knowledge exchange, even after project funding ends, is also important.\n\nFollowing these principles allows different ways of understanding and working with knowledge to be recognised. This in turn should help researchers, policymakers and practitioners in environmental management work together more effectively to produce, share and apply knowledge to manage environmental change.
