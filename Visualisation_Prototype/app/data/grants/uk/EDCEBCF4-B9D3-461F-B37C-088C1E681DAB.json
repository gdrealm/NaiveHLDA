However, up to 15 exposures may be needed to elicit a positive attitude, a number greater than most parents are willing or able to provide. Our previous work suggests that repeated visual exposure to pictures of foods provides an alternative means of enhancing children's interest in foods.

Familiarity with a food's taste is an established predictor of food liking; our previous work had shown that visual exposure similarly impacts on toddlers' interest in looking at and tasting fruit and vegetables in laboratory tests. The current project extended this work to the home environment. Parents of 127 toddlers identified one fruit and one vegetable which they wished their child would eat. Families were assigned to a 'fruit exposure group' or a 'vegetable exposure group', who looked at a book about their target fruit or target vegetable every day for two weeks, or to a 'control group', who received no book. Parents of all children then offered both target foods to their child every day during a two-week taste-introduction phase. As expected, children's reported liking of both foods increased as a result of taste exposure. Importantly, however, exposure to vegetable books significantly boosted children's liking of the target vegetable, both in the short term and after a six-month delay. Moreover, reported consumption of the target vegetable at follow-up was greater among the vegetable book group than other groups. Findings demonstrate that visual exposure facilitates the introduction of vegetables, in particular, into children's diets. Additional findings of reductions in neophobia and food fussiness levels among the vegetable book group suggest that the benefits of picture-book exposure extend beyond the vegetable targeted.
