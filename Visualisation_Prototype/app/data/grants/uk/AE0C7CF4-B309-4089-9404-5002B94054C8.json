In this project we will examine whether, due to their social importance, faces are ‘special cues’ for visual attention. We will examine whether our attention is drawn automatically to a face as opposed to other types of stimuli (non-human faces, other types of object), when we view a scene. We will also examine whether any effects are modulated by memory – for example, when we carry in mind a particular face that we are looking for. The experiments will use behavioural measures (reaction times, errors) plus also visual-evoked responses (reflecting momentary changes in scalp activity) to provide an ‘on-line’ measure of attentional capture.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2331","grantId":"RES-000-22-2331","fundValue":"79953","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
