{"id":"6E36402D-1F0A-4181-9F82-A1254E50BF8E","title":"Automated Theorem Discovery","abstractText":"This project represents the second stage of a multi-stage project, the long-term goal of which is to emulate a large portion of the human mathematical discovery process. The focus of this particular stage is on fully developing and deploying an Automated Theorem Discovery (ATD) system. By ATD system we mean a system that automatically generates, proves and identifies a significant number of mathematical results which mathematicians are likely to recognize as Theorems, Lemmas, Corollaries, etc. (as opposed to the sorts of results which, true though they might be, would probably not be deemed worthy of recording).Generations of mathematicians have appreciated the benefits of building a mathematical knowledge base bit by bit, Theorem by Theorem, in that previously discovered results often prove quite useful -- perhaps even necessary -- in the discovery and the proof of subsequent results. Moreover, since the advent of the modern computer, it has become increasingly apparent that automated reasoning (AR) systems can likewise benefit from a similar incremental build-up of Theorems. This is especially true for certain formal verification problems, in which state-of-the-art automated theorem provers can dispatch some -- but not all -- of the generated proof obligations. The remaining proofs can only be achieved once certain Lemmas have been discovered; at present, this discovery must be done by hand.We therefore anticipate that an effective and practical ATD system would be very useful, not only to mathematicians, but to computer scientists as well -- particularly those who work in formal verification. Indeed, in the latter case, we have supporting evidence (in the form of letters of support) that the potential payoff for such a system is huge.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F033559/1","grantId":"EP/F033559/1","fundValue":"413817","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  1. It influenced the PhD project and IsaScheme system of Dr. Omar Monta?o Rivas on the automated conjecturing and proving of the lemmas needed in inductive proofs. The PhD project was supervised by Dr. McCasland.\n2. IsaScheme is now playing a key role in the AI4FM project, which is a joint EPSRC project (EP/H024204/1) between Edinburgh, Newcastle and Heriot Watt, to improve the automation of proof obligations arising in formal methods. In particular, IsaScheme is a key enabling technology, in the PhD project of AI4FM project student Mr. Yuhui Lin, to provided missing lemmas in invariant proofs.\n3. Dr. McCasland has initiated discussions with the developers of ACL2, which is a world leading formal verification tool, on the speculation and proof of missing lemmas using MATHsAiD.

In particular, MATHsAiD 2.0 was able to conjecture and prove a key theorem from one of their papers. This key theorem was just one example of a theorem that relates two different theories, of which MATHsAiD 2.0 has proved several. It is unusual for automated theorem provers to prove theorems that relate multiple theories, but they are a common aspect of modern mathematics. We continue to develop the MATHsAiD system using funding from our Platform Grant and in the personal time of the, now retired, RA, Roy McCasland. We will continue to promote its use as a practical tool to assist the working mathematician, increasing their productivity and accuracy.\n\nMATHsAiD is specifically aimed at working mathematicians, but some of the techniques may find application elsewhere, e.g., in formal methods.
