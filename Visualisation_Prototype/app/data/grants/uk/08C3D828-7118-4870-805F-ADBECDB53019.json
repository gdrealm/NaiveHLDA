It needs a dye molecule to be added to cells, or genetic modification of cells to produce fluorescent proteins, so is intrusive and perturbs the function of the cell. Furthermore, these fluorescent ?tags? can only be attached to a small fraction of molecules within the cell. Raman spectroscopy is able to identify different molecular bonds by exciting vibrations with laser light, and as molecules contain various bonds, each molecule has its own ?fingerprint? spectrum. The only drawback with this technique is the low signal levels, but a new form of Raman imaging which is in its infancy in the UK, produces about 100,000 times more signal. This enables high speed chemical imaging tuned to any molecule. So now all types of molecules can be identified within the cell ? this promises to be more revolutionary than fluorescence imaging.\nThis technique will be applied to the study of stem cells. These cells have massive potential in medicine, as they can divide endlessly, and can turn into any of the 200 types of cell in the body. This project will concentrate on the production of liver cells from stem cells, offering life saving potential as an alternative to liver transplants, which are limited by availability of donor organs. We will use spectroscopy of light to identify types of cell, and monitor in real time how stem cells turn into liver cells with the new high speed Raman (chemical) microscopy. By understanding how stem cells turn into other cells, we can control this process and make it more efficient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802632","grantId":"G0802632","fundValue":"102422","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Richard Downes","coPersons":["James Alexander Ross"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
