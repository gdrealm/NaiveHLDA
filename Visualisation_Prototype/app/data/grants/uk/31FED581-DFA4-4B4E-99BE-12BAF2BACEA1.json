In order to do this, Prof Miller's chemistry team (Imperial) with expertise in nanoparticle technologies, will collaborate closely with Dr Maya Thanou's pharmaceutical sciences team (Kings) in the design, formulation and characterization of MRI-responsive thermosensitive drug carrier nanoparticles (theranostic ABC nanoparticles) that have the capacity to accumulate in cancerous lesions (fibroids or tumours), in real time post administration in vivo (as observed by MRI). Thereafter, we will collaborate with and make use of the expertise of the research teams of Prof Gedroyc and Dr Stebbing (Imperial, Medicine) to demonstrate that these nanoparticles can then be activated by means of magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) to release drug locally at sites of nanoparticle accumulation within the relevant lesion. This combined process should be able to deliver a powerful anti-cancer effect that also improves radically on local drug bioavailability (specific only to tumours) and drug efficacy while minimizing systemic drug toxicity. Nanoparticle modelling and fluid dynamics studies will then be performed by the team of Prof Xu (Imperial, Chemical Engineering) in order to improve our understanding of the delivery barrier and drug release and uptake process. Thereafter we shall seek to take this understanding to optimize MRgFUS-activated theranostic nanoparticle mediated drug delivery of actives in vivo provided by our healthcare partner Antisoma. We anticipate that Antisoma and our other healthcare partners [the Focused Ultrasound Surgery (FUS) Foundation and MacMillan Nurses] will assist us with the commercialization process thereafter including providing some of their novel anti-cancer compounds for local delivery, to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001700/1","grantId":"EP/I001700/1","fundValue":"1257090","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from the work carried out in this study are currently in the final stage of being submitted for determination of intellectual property rights.

We have proved that we can release such combinations using heat from focused ultrasound which is delivered completely noninvasively. We have proven that such drug release has significant anti-tumour activity within the body when it is delivered under these circumstances and the work has also optimised the delivery to local tumours in the body so that we can achieve very substantial increases in drug concentration in tumours in comparison to conventionally delivered chemotherapy. These new combinations need to be tested in early human studies in the 1st instance once early toxicity and safety results have been carried out . Early human work will have to be carried out carefully to demonstrate that cell death can be induced in a controlled manner at the desired site of action in the body. This process is currently in development with our collaborators and partners. Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
