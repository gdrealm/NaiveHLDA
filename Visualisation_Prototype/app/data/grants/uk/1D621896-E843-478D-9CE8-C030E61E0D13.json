In the ideal case, the method could provide critical diagnostic information for the diagnosis of major diseases such as Alzheimer s disease long before symptoms may appear. The methods also can be used to help better ensure that the right dose of experimental drugs are used in clinical trials, increasing the likelihood of successful completion of the trials. However, while the UK has equipment that could allow a high level of this activity at several major academic hospitals, there are not enough chemists specially trained to develop and produce the radiotracers. This proposal would create a novel 4 year training programme- really a world first - to equip two chemists with the skills and experience to become UK leaders in this area. In addition, the grant will bring together centres that previously have not worked together, allowing them to begin to pool resources for common good.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900897","grantId":"G0900897","fundValue":"599998","fundStart":"2010-08-09","fundEnd":"2014-02-08","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul M Matthews","coPersons":["David  Nutt","David James Brooks"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
