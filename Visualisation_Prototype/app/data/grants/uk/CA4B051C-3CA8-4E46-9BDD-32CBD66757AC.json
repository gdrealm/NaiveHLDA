{"id":"CA4B051C-3CA8-4E46-9BDD-32CBD66757AC","title":"Acoustic Measurements of Swirling Jets","abstractText":"This project aims to develop a facility for generating and measuring the acoustics of round jets in air. The project will use a variety of fluid velocity and visualisation techniques to reveal the underlying structure and dynamic processes in the region close to the jet exhaust. This will be conducted with simultaneous acoustic measurements. It is expected that a detailed knowledge of this area and the way the flow rotates will lead to more effective methods for controlling noise.The effect of swirling motions on the noise generated by the jets will be investigated. A mean swirl around the jet axis occurs in a variety of important practical situations, such as at the exhaust from a commercial jet engine. However, the effects of swirl on the resulting structure and noise produced by the jet are not well understood.Additionally, techniques for controlling the amount of swirl will be studied using small synthetic jets. These are pulsing flow actuators that can be used to disturb a flow without net mass addition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D046440/1","grantId":"EP/D046440/1","fundValue":"126985","fundStart":"2006-04-27","fundEnd":"2008-06-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Edward Cater","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
