{"id":"CEFB39E2-1FDC-4230-9AB7-D33C4E7FF456","title":"Structural analysis of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein","abstractText":"Drug resistance is one of the greatest medical concerns we currently face and manifests in areas such as the use of antibiotics to fight infection and the ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in treating cancer. Resistance to drugs involves a number of defence mechanisms within cells and one of the most important is the expression of efflux pumps on their surface. Drug pumps such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) prevent accumulation of anticancer drugs in many types of cancer cells thereby contributing to treatment failure. The ability of transporters such as P-gp to interact with a diverse array of chemically unrelated anticancer drugs remains a biochemical mystery. Despite intensive investigation over the last three decades, many questions remain. For example, what is the nature and location of the multiple drug binding sites? How is the drug binding to P-gp linked to energy production and what regions of the protein comprise the translocation pathway? Structural studies using electron microscopy have stimulated significant progress toward answering these questions; however the maximal resolution of this technique is too low to provide definitive information. A high resolution, or atomic scale, structure for P-gp would provide the missing pieces to the intriguing mechanism of multidrug transport by P-gp.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400631","grantId":"G0400631","fundValue":"236244","fundStart":"2005-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Callaghan","coPersons":["Stephen  Prince","Bob  Ford","Christopher  Higgins","Yvonne  Jones"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
