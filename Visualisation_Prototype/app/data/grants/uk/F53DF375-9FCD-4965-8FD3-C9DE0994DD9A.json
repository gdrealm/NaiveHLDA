{"id":"F53DF375-9FCD-4965-8FD3-C9DE0994DD9A","title":"Education for 'national' citizenship in the context of devolution and ethno-religious conflict","abstractText":"<p>There is currently worldwide interest in citizenship and citizenship education in ethnically and religiously diverse societies, with governments making efforts to reassert the relevance and the significance of 'national' (or state-level) citizenship, in the context of forces of perceived internal division&nbsp;- eg, devolution, and in more extreme situations, ethno-religious conflict. For example, in the UK context of increased devolution, and concerns about community cohesion and security threats, there have been citizenship policy developments including the statutory introduction of citizenship education into schools in England in 2002 (QCA, 1998), with recent revisions focusing on&nbsp;'Britishness' and 'shared values' through examining 'identities and diversity in the UK' (Ajegbo, Kiwan and Sharma, 2007); in addition, we have also witnessed the recent introduction of new requirements for the acquisition of British citizenship and settlement (Home Office, 2005; Home Office, 2006).&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>This interdisciplinary seminar series aims to examine such national framings of citizenship in contexts that are perceived to challenge such framing below the nation-state level by juxtaposing three areas as mentioned above that have not previously been brought together before: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>citizenship education in schools</li>\n\n <li>citizenship in the 'legal' sense - naturalisation requirements for those applying for national citizenship (citizenship tests and courses), examined in 'challenging' contexts of internal division</li>\n\n <li>devolution and ethno-religious conflict. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This series explores these theoretical issues in an international perspective, applied to policy and practice. <br />&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0577","grantId":"RES-451-26-0577","fundValue":"15274","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dina Jane Kiwan","coPersons":["John  Annette"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
