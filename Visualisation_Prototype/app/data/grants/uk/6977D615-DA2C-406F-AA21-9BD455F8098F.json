In the UK, the Energy White Paper cited micro-CHP as one of the means by which UK carbon emissions could be significantly reduced. However, it is still unclear whether micro-CHP can meet the twin demands of meeting end-user requirements while also reducing domestic sector carbon emissions. This proposal is for travel funds to enable the University of Strathclyde to continue its participation in the International Energy Agency's Annex 42, which is being run under its Energy Conservation in Building and Community Systems programme (ECBCS). The fundamental objective of Annex 42 is to undertake technical, environmental and economic assessments of micro-CHP technologies using simulation modelling backed-up by laboratory testing and field trials. The major contribution of the University to Annex 42 is to lead activities in model development and testing. Funding will allow the University to participate fully within the Annex and assist in the delivery of a validated model of an internal combustion engine micro-CHP device and assessment of the performance of micro-CHP technologies in typical UK dwellings.Funding will also allow the University to disseminate the outcomes of the Annex (particularly model development and assessment results) to the research community and industry groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D043948/1","grantId":"EP/D043948/1","fundValue":"5204","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Kelly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" EPSRC travel grant EP/D043948/1 allowed Dr Nick Kelly of ESRU to attend four working meetings of the Annex and also allowed his participation in the final dissemination conference of the Annex's work. The funding proved crucial to the eventual success of the Annex in that it was during the period of the grant that the main software outputs from the Annex's work were refined, validated and integrated into simulation tools used by thousands of engineers and modelling practitioners worldwide. ESRU was directly responsible for contributing to and managing this activity and would have been unable to do so without funding. Associated deliverables were as follows.- A validated generic model around which the Stirling engine SE and internal combustion engine ICE device models were developed. - The models were implemented within three well-known building simulation software tools: ESP-r (UK), TRNSYS (US), EnergyPlus (US), which are used by thousands of engineers and researchers worldwide.- Two simulation studies were undertaken using the models. These dealt with the optimisation of thermal storage for micro-CHP in UK housing (Beyer and Kelly, 2008) and assessing the impact of micro-CHP and other microgeneration technologies on the UK electricity network (Kelly et al, 2008). - A total of 10 publications have emerged directly from ESRU's participation in Annex 42. These cover topics ranging from the development of the software models through to their use in practice. Of the publications listed, 7 feature international co-authors and 2 feature collaborators from Supergen HDPS.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
