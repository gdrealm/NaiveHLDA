In order to determine why this protein is so important for human health we performed experiment to determine how this protein functions. We subsequently discovered that LIMD1 interacts with a subset of proteins the function of which is to regulate a critical cellular process called endocytosis. Thus LIMD1's ability to regulate cell growth and proliferation could be through novel interactions with key regulators of endocytosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F006470/1","grantId":"BB/F006470/1","fundValue":"327975","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this work have uncovered key new data on the basic molecular biology of disease.
