Heavy use was made of eScience methodologies. See exploitation routes. Estimations of systems behaviour in the presence of variability have tended to be overly pessimistic. By showing how correlated and uncorrelated variability can be better modelled, the degree of pessimism is much reduced. Hence this is of significant interest to the integrated circuit design community. There is also interest from design tool vendors. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
