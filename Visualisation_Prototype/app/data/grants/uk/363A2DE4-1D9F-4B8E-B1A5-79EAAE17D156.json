Auctions - economically speaking, any mechanism involving structured, competitive bidding - provide a simple, transparent mechanism by which to allocate goods and services, particularly in environments where bidders have potentially idiosyncratic tastes over complex or heterogeneous objects. Consequently, auctions are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications of practical and policy interest: online platforms such as eBay, housing and auto markets, corporate control markets, and markets by which public agencies procure essential goods and services, among others too numerous to name. This in turn has motivated extensive academic research on auction design and performance, yielding insights relevant both for private individuals and companies participating in auction markets and for public agents and agencies entrusted with oversight of public procurement.\n\nWhile the literature has made tremendous progress in understanding auction markets, empirical research to date has focused on two broad paradigms: standalone single-object auctions and multi-unit auctions for many identical objects. Unfortunately, these paradigms say little about a problem widely encountered in applications: how should a policymaker allocate many different objects, especially when bidders view objects as complements or substitutes? One common solution to this problem is to run many separate sealed-bid auctions, with bidders competing for many objects simultaneously. Auctions based on this design are widely seen in public procurement applications, including markets for highway maintenance contracts in most US states, snow-clearing contracts in Montreal, recycling services in Japan, cleaning services in Sweden, oil and drilling rights in the US Outer Continental Shelf, and waste management in Italy among others. In such cases it is known that bidding for multiple objects can create &quot;exposure problems&quot; which substantially distort bidders' strategic incentives, potentially leading to much worse revenue and efficiency outcomes than would be predicted by the standard single-object model. Yet despite the prevalence of simultaneous sealed-bid auctions in a wide range of policy-relevant applications, virtually nothing is known about the scope of such exposure problems in practice. \n\nIn this research, we study how interaction between auctions in applications such as highway contracting affects revenue and economic value created in procurement markets. Toward this end, we first develop an empirical model of bidding in simultaneous sealed-bid auctions, to our knowledge the first such in the literature. Crucially, this model supports estimation of the degree to which bidders view auctioned objects as complements or substitutes, a critical parameter for policy design in multi-object auctions about which virtually nothing is presently known. Our model is applicable in a wide range of public procurement settings, including those listed above. To illustrate our proposed methodology, however, we focus on a single application for which data is widely available: highway construction and maintenance contracts auctioned by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). We apply our model to estimate bidder preferences and cross-project synergies in the MDOT market, with preliminary results suggesting that bidders view small projects as complements and large projects as substitutes. Building on these estimates, we aim to provide new insight on two objects of substantial policy interest: to what degree current practices maximize value and minimize public-sector costs in the MDOT market, and whether other possible multi-object formats (e.g. simultaneous ascending auctions) could improve outcomes in this market. We thus aim to provide new insight on optimal design of multi-object auctions, helping resolve an important class of policy questions arising in a wide range of procurement contexts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N000056/1","grantId":"ES/N000056/1","fundValue":"296087","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pasquale  Schiraldi","coPersons":["Matthew Loren Gentry","Tatiana  Komarova"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
