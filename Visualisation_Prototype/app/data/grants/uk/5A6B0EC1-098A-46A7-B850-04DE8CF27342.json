{"id":"5A6B0EC1-098A-46A7-B850-04DE8CF27342","title":"PeriTune - a clonal optimisation platform","abstractText":"A variety of micro-organisms including E. coli and S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast), are used in commercial bio-production processes to manufacture a number of products, ranging from high-value low-volume products, such bio-therapeutics (e.g. recombinant insulin), to mid-value products, (e.g. biocatalysts and specialised chemicals), to low-value bulk commodity products (e.g. succinic acid and biofuels). This project will seek to develop a robust clone optimsiation platform for the potential use and application in the above industrial sectors, and so would be of great benefit in a number of applied and fundamental areas of biological and biomedical R&amp;D.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M011259/1","grantId":"BB/M011259/1","fundValue":"121512","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
