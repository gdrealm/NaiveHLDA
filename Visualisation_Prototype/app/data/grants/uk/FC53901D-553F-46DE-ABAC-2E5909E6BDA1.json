Changes like digitisation are shaping our whole cultural heritage so we need to understand their impact. Digital technologies have made it much easier for readers to participate in a wide range of activities around their reading, including connecting with other readers and even writing stories themselves. Online communities and fan forums present researchers with a wealth of data not only on what readers are reading, but how they are reading and engaging with texts. This data is potentially invaluable, especially in a context where reading is supposedly in decline, and where new devices such as ereaders are threatening to supplant the printed book. This project will investigate the implications of these changes, and how they may potentially benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including those working in education and in the creative industries, as well as academics interested in readers and audiences. \n \nThe PI and Co-I will use our unique position as literary experts teaching in our University's Media School to: \n- Analyse reader responses to literary texts in online spaces (blogs, reviews, fanfiction)\n- Monitor the ways in which our students use digital and electronic devices for reading\n- Use online questionnaires and focus groups to seek out the views and opinions of readers about the effects of digitisation on their reading habits and practices. \n\nThe research will also use data from workshops and interviews designed to collaborate with multidisciplinary researchers working on studies of readers to: \n- Develop new approaches and insights into the practices of readers in both literary theory and pedagogy\n- Reflect on the ethical responsibilities that come with this type of research\n- Build on existing scholarship to critically assess appropriate methodologies for future research. \n\nBenefits and outputs include:\n- New information on reading practices that benefit industry and academia\n- Contribution to existing knowledge through evolving theory\n- Enhancing the teaching of literature in a digital age\n- Providing a roadmap for future teaching and research in these areas to benefit UK educational and research institutions. \n\nThese will be disseminated through our network of academics and practitioners working in these areas; through workshops and publications; and to a wider audience (e.g. reading groups) via the creation of a dedicated website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012696/1","grantId":"AH/J012696/1","fundValue":"15360","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used in public engagement events, academic conference papers and workshops.

We discovered that the research uncovered many ethical issues which need further exploration, and that many of the changes we explored need to be tracked over a long period of time. Our findings have been made available via our website and through conference presentations. Future publication of findings will also ensure that they are used and taken up by others in the field.
