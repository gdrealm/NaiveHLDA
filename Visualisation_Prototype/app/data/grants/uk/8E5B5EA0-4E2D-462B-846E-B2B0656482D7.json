These techniques have been published in top quality international journals. The group would like to extend these ideas and realize these techniques to offer enhancement to all localization systems. The Australia China Research Centre for Wireless communications has also been very active on the world stage in developing novel positioning and localization solutions. Building a collaboration between the two groups will benefit UK, European and Austrialian industries and enhance academic standing. The theoretical ideas will be demonstrated and optimised for practical systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004832/1","grantId":"EP/K004832/1","fundValue":"4526","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Harold Kemp","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The key things which was developed was alignment of research objectives between CSIRO and the WSN group at the University of Leeds, UK.
