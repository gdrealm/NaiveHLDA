{"id":"374D2630-3345-4713-A470-91839DE48C8C","title":"Building a mentoring Scheme to Support Professional Women in Aviation and Aerospace","abstractText":"This collaborative project aims to tackle an existing problem faced by female professionals in aviation and aerospace in the UK - a lack of suitable mentors to assist with career progression and provide general support and guidance. Academic research identifies role models and mentoring as having a positive impact upon career progression and the lack of mentors as a significant barrier to women's career progression. Research already conducted by the PI at Airbus Group identified a requirement for a formal mentoring scheme for female professionals that addresses their career progression needs and offers social support to what is a significantly under-represented group within the workforce. Through analysis of the requirements of female professionals in relation to a mentoring scheme, the PI and co-investigator (Co-I) will work collaboratively with key personnel at the RAS, RAF and Airbus Group, to build a robust mentoring scheme that will meet this critical need. \n\nThis project offers the potential to share academic research, knowledge and expertise on the careers of female professionals in aviation and aerospace and the factors that may lead to their under-representation in the sector as well as their propensity to either leave the profession or to not return post-childbirth. It also offers the potential for the female professionals themselves, senior managers and HR practitioners to share knowledge and best practice to build upon what organisations are currently doing to attract and retain female engineers. The key working relationship will operate between the PI and at least two key senior personnel from each partner organisation, to bring together the academic expertise and practitioner experiences of staff at the University of the West of England (UWE) and the partner organisations to optimise the potential outcomes. \n\nThe project will be designed around a project group comprising academics from UWE (the PI and Co-I) and professionals, human resource practitioners and senior managers at the partner organisations, to both share best practice and work collaboratively, to build a mentoring scheme specifically for female professionals. This group will meet for half a day on a monthly basis, to review the priorities of the partner organisations and discuss the progress of the project, where appropriate, as well as identify other key people to assist with the design and delivery of the project. Alongside this, the project group members will have the opportunity to network with senior key industry members and enjoy unprecedented access to information about other organisations' strategies for tackling the under-representation of women in aviation and aerospace, along with access to academic knowledge and research. \n\nThis project group will evolve as other aviation and aerospace companies within the industry are contacted and invited to become part of a wider mentoring scheme. Key stakeholders will also be drawn into the group, at different stages, to discuss the needs of their own female members, e.g. Rolls Royce, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Augusta Westland, AJW Aviation and Little Blue Private Jets Limited, who have expressed a strong interest in participating. \n\nThe intended outcome of this project will be a robust and sustainable mentoring scheme for female professionals within the aviation and aerospace industry, which extends beyond the boundaries of the participants, to impact on the sector at the national level. The mentoring scheme will be run 'on-line', and hosted by the RAS in London. The on-line service will offer information about the scheme and training materials and potential mentors, each of whom will be fully profiled. The RAS will host two networking events per year, to bring mentors and mentees together, to review the scheme and put forward ideas for its development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M004775/1","grantId":"ES/M004775/1","fundValue":"64861","fundStart":"2014-10-27","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Durbin","coPersons":["Ana Catarina Lopes"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
