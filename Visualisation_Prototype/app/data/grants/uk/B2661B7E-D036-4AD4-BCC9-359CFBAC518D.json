{"id":"B2661B7E-D036-4AD4-BCC9-359CFBAC518D","title":"Patterns in Project and Programme Management","abstractText":"<p>Patterns, in this context, are not a decorative design or motif, but are a structured description of behaviours or problem-solving approaches. The patterns approach was picked up by the software engineering community who also had the problem of capturing and passing on the skills that made the difference between a raw Computer Science graduate and an experienced programmer.</p>\n\n<p>The great thing about patterns is that they bridge the gap between theoretical, general, academic models of systems and behaviour, and the individual cases or war stories. They help to draw out the lessons learned through experience, with a richer description and understanding of the context within which problems have occurred and how they might be solved or avoided in the future. The goal of this project is to develop a collection of patterns that can be used to capture the lived experience of project and programme managers (PPM). These can then be shared, developed and discussed within the PPM community, leading to a better understanding of the pitfalls and problems, together with the ways to avoid or recover, and their consequences.</p>\n\n<p>We will conduct six workshops to find the most effective ways to elicit patterns from practitioners, and create a professional website to enable them to be shared by the community.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001985/1","grantId":"ES/L001985/1","fundValue":"14038","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet Helena Smart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
