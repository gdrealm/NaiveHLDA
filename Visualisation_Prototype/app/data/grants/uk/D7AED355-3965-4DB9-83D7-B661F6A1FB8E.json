The series, entitled 'Behaviour change' past, present and future: interdisciplinary responses to behaviour change in policy and research’, has three aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>in response to the limited effectiveness of communication of research insights between academia and government, the seminars will provide a platform for improved dialogue between these groups</li>\n\n <li>based on concerns about the lack of rigorous evidence around some behaviour change approaches, the seminars will provide a forum for exploring research innovation</li>\n\n <li>given the need for interdisciplinary responses to ‘behaviour change’ challenges, the series will provide a structured forum for different disciplines to develop an interdisciplinary agenda.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The three hour seminars will commence with an introductory session highlighting a range of key topics at the forefront of behaviour change research, policy and practice. Thereafter, seven seminars will focus on a particular topic of high social interest. These are obesity, food and physical activity; alcohol, drug and smoking; sustainable behaviours; corporate ‘behaviour change’; mobility behaviours; civic engagement; online security/ privacy. The final seminar will synthesise cross-cutting issues and set future plans for research, application and publication.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001055/1","grantId":"ES/L001055/1","fundValue":"30393","fundStart":"2014-04-04","fundEnd":"2017-04-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  To date, it is not possible to say how the findings have been used as it is very early into the project.

Each seminar tackles a different area. We have had two seminars to date; and introductory one and one focusing on food, obesity and physical activity. One of the key findings so far is that the nature of 'evidence' in behaviour change needs to be reconsidered. There is a tendency to require positivist, quantitative (often RCT-style) data to underpin behaviour change interventions, but this has skewed the type of interventions that are used towards more individualist, downstream types. This is because researchers tend to measure what they CAN rather than what is actually required for large scale behaviour - or even culture - change. This has become a theme in the discussions, as have related discussions around the need for different types of research (including ethnography), different methodologies (including discourse analysis) and different theoretical bases (including social practices theory). The 'systems approach' to behaviour change has also cropped up a lot in discussion, meaning that activity at an upstream as well as downstream and midstream level is required for change to occur, and this may not have immediate results, yet be required to lay the foundations for change in the future. The discussion, captured in the synthesis documents from each seminar, might be used by speakers and delegates in their behaviour change activities.
