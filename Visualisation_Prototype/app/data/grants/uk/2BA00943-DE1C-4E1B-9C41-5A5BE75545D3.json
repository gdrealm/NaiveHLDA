However, it is often not possible to provide this experience for objects which are rare, fragile, and thousands of years old. The project aims to show how touch experiences can be provided for even the most challenging ancient artefacts. Most museums' presentations of archaeological artefacts are dominated by displays behind glass; vision dominates the sensory experience. The emotional connections built by more multisensory engagement with artefacts offers a better appreciation of the ancient objects and an enhanced museum visit. In particular, some artefacts call out to be touched, yet, for reasons of preservation, touch cannot be allowed. The project will specifically focus on icons of identity which are too precious to allow handling and items which are too fragile to touch, such as ancient clothing. The modern audience is shifting its expectations from passive viewer to active participant and the project will offer ways of adapting to this change using digital technologies to connect past and present and overcome the emotional and physical distance between ancient objects and their modern audience. \n\nThe project will develop a range of installations to deliver touch experiences within a museum setting. The approach is multi-disciplinary and will involve installations developed with museum professionals. The solutions and ideas developed will be tried out as part of a development phase and then form part of a final public 'please touch' event housed within the National Museums Scotland who are a project partner. The focus will be specifically on the physical sensation of touching an object rather than touch systems to inerface with a computer. The porject will focus on the ancient objects with the technology in the background because this is what museum curators want. The installations planned by the project participants are innovative and use a combination of old and new technologies with theatre tricks. The key to all of the installations is to provide sensory cues deploying modern technology but to retain the focus on the object in the case. The relationship between the location of the 'touch experience' provided, with the location of the original objects manifested itself in two ways. In both locational arrangements there seemed to be interesting reactions from the public. At their heart lie issues of authenticity and our emotional connection with physical objects across time and space. What makes a touch experience in a museum authentic if the visitor is dealing with physical or digital replicas, and how can the physical divide be bridged. These are the questions that the project will investigate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00638X/1","grantId":"AH/K00638X/1","fundValue":"80099","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Academic impact: \nThe research has achieved international and interdisciplinary impact at an academic level. A published peer reviewed paper on the research has won the Golden Award at the Human Computer Interaction conference, Crete 2014 as the best paper from c 1,500 papers involving researchers from 77 countries working in a range of fields.\nHeritage impact: \nFor the museum world the installations created as part of the research have not just been used for the public trials conducted by the project. The work has generated a lot of interest from heritage centres in the UK and abroad. The impact is relatively new since the research grant ended in December 2013 but some of the replicas generated by the project have become part of other exhibitions. Project replica artefacts were used within a case containing the original at a special exhibition, 'Vikings!' at the National Museum of Scotland which ran until May 13th 2013. Installations are also being used by Bute Museum with special needs groups and 'museum in a bag' outreach in schools and community events. Other objects are in use at the Sanday Heritage Centre, Sanday, Orkney. In 2014 some project artefacts were loaned to the Viking Ship Museum, Denmark for use as interactive elements within their Viking exhibition. They now want to use these objects on a permanent basis. \nThe research has been presented at international museums and conferences. The portable exhibition entitled 'Touching the Past' has now been seen in Museums in Netherlands, Finland, Spain and the UK and taken to British and European conferences. The PI Dr Linda Hurcombe is receiving many requests for further information on the project and being asked for advice and collaborative research. The project has led directly to the first display of touchable 3D prints alongside the ancient object and craft replica at Plymouth City Museum as part of a 3 month exhibition. Further opportunities for collaboration are coming in from the UK and abroad so that the impact will continue to grow.

The proxy touch experiences can be delivered by a variety of different media with crafted replicas conveying different aspects of the ancient object than 3D prints. The proxy sensory experiences are accepted by the visitors because of a concept we have termed 'borrowed authenticity'.\nauthenticity can be 'tn The research has resulted in new kinds of installations in the UK and Denmark with further collaborations and advice requested by a variety of heritage organisations from National Museums to Open air Museums and small heritage centres.
