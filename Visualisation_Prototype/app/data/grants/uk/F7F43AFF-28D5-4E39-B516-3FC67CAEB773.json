White blood cells called a Th2 lymphocyte are thought to be the ultimate cause of allergic disease and the work outlined in this proposal aims to understand some of the key mechanisms that determine how Th2 lymphocytes develop and predispose to allergic disease. We have found that two suppressor proteins called SOCS2 and SOCS3 appear to counteract each other in the development of these allergic Th2 cells. We have obtained genetically engineered mice that lack SOCS2 and will use this model to determine whether these mice develop asthma infections and other allergic disease. We will also address whether they can clear worm infections more efficiently, another key feature of these Th2 lymphocytes. These mice and other key models outlined in the proposal will also allow us to determine whether drugs that target these SOCS in Th2 cells will have the potential to cure allergic diseases","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001795","grantId":"G1001795","fundValue":"435999","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrien  Kissenpfennig","coPersons":["James  Johnston","Liam  Heaney"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
