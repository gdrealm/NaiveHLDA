{"id":"BE0032FD-230B-4689-AAF0-E93C331F8279","title":"Improving brain repair by neural stem cells using engineered scaffolds","abstractText":"Clinical trials are not too far away for neural stem cells in neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke and Huntington's Disease. Neural stem cells are immature brain cells that have the capacity to replace mature brain cells that have been lost following disease or injury. These stem cells have now been successfully isolated and grown in culture, first from mouse, but more recently from human tissue. If neural stem cells are transplanted into the brains of experimental animals with lesions that mimic these degenerative disorders, they repair brain structure and restore function. Human neural stem cells have now been grown to clinical grade, so if they prove safe, clinical trials can be undertaken to discover whether they actually work for real patients. Although we are approaching clinical trials, the fact is that we do not yet know how best to transplant the cells. In the animal studies, we simply inject them as a suspension, hoping that they will integrate efficiently into the damaged brain. Apart from the fact that this approach is inefficient, it is difficult to justify in human patients because it requires us to inject the cells into undamaged tissue next to the areas of damage, rather than into the damaged areas themselves. The danger is that the injection will do further damage. We have to learn how to inject cells into the damaged tissue itself. The problem is that following a stroke, for example, this damaged tissue looses all structure and becomes largely fluid filled. Our studies indicate that cells do not work very well if injected into such an environment. Almost certainly we can do better by supporting them in a matrix scaffold that will insure that the cells go precisely where we need them and holds them in place while they work their way into the damaged tissue. We also hope we might be able to achieve more fundamental tissue repair by giving the cells structure right from the start. In this project, tissue engineers and neurobiologists will work together to develop cell-scaffold combinations that will optimise the repair potential of neural stem cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014808/1","grantId":"BB/D014808/1","fundValue":"400790","fundStart":"2006-05-22","fundEnd":"2009-08-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michel  Modo","coPersons":["Kevin  Shakesheff","Jack  Price"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
