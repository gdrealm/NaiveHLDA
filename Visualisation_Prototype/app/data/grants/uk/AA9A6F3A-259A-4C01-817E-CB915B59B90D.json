We will do this using a Consortium of eight of the leading members of the UK's Distributed Institute for Atmospheric Composition, utilising the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement's BAe 146 research aircraft, the resources of the UK's University Facility for Atmospheric Measurements, the Malaysian Meteorological Service's Global Atmospheric Watch station at Bukit Atur, Sabah, Malaysia, and the Royal Society of London-supported Danum Valley Field Centre. We will bring significant added-value to NERC resources by the active participation of international collaborators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D002389/1","grantId":"NE/D002389/1","fundValue":"157785","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Nicholas Hewitt","coPersons":["Claire  Reeves","John Maurice Plane","Paul  Palmer","John Adrian  Pyle","David  Fowler","Alastair  Lewis","Mathew John Evans","David  Oram","Brian Matthew Davison","JÃ¶rg  Kaduk","Lucy Jane Carpenter","Brian James Bandy","Nick A Chappell","Dwayne Ellis Heard","Eiko  Nemitz","Nicola  Carslaw","M  Pilling","Hugh  Coe","Hans Friedrich Graf","Thomas William Choularton","Paul Steven Monks","Martin William Gallagher","A.
