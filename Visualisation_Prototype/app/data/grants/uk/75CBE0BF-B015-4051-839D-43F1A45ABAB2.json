Injury to many tissues stimulates a process of natural repair that involves mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs resident in the tissue receive signals released from damaged cells that stimulates them to divide, migrate towards the damage and then differentiate in specific types of cells needed to repair the damage. We have shown that a source of stem cells that are mobilised following tissue damage are located on the outside of blood capillaries (pericytes) and these cells are able to differentiate into different types of specialised cells needed to repair damage. This suggests that upon tissue damage, signalling molecues are released that initiate a chain of events whereby pericytes are stimulated to leave the blood vessels, proliferate (increase in number), are attracted to the site of damage whereupon they differentiate in specialised cells to mediate repair. The attraction of pericytes as a source of MSCs is their ubiquitous location on blood vessels that means they are present in almost all tissues of the body, ready to be stimulated. \nMSCs are an important source of adult stem cells for use in many different clinical applications. There are currently over 150 clinical trails underway to evaluate these cells for a wide range of therapeutic uses. The main defining characteristic of MSCs is their ability to differentiate into multiple different types of mesenchymal cells when stimulated to do so in laboratory cultures. These include, bone cells. cartilage cells and fat cells among others. Recently, evidence has started to emerge that suggests that although MSCs isolated from different tissues are all derived from pericytes, they exhibit fundamental differences in their differentiation capacities. Thus when grown in non-stimulatory conditions, MSCs from muscle will only form muscle cells and MSCs from bone will only form bone cells. Moreover, tantilising results from tissue transplantation experiments suggest that MSCs from different anatomical sites within one tissue, eg. bone, are inaffective at repairing the tissue when transplantated to the other location. These results suggest that MSCs (pericytes) retain a knowledge of their origin that in turn affects their behaviour (pregramme). This makes biological sense since it may be a way of the body ensuring that MSCs dont differentiate into the wrong type of cell. However it has important implications for using these cells in tissue repair.\nThe aim of our research is to understand the biological nature of this MSC &quot;programming&quot; so that ways can be devised to reprogramme the cells to enable cells isolated from one tissue can be used to efficiently and safely repair another tissue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K018035/1","grantId":"MR/K018035/1","fundValue":"484825","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Sharpe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
