{"id":"DC58EBBF-A402-4C83-A567-50AEEE8D63EC","title":"The Impact of Price and Information on Water Consumption","abstractText":"<p>The Southern Water region has been classed as an area of severe water stress and the pressures of climate change and population growth are putting further pressure on resources. Last year Southern Water launched a universal metering programme (UMP), which is aimed at installing nearly 500,000 new meters in the households of South-East England by 2015. The UMP has been created to meet the challenges that water stress may impose on households in the South-East.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the research project is to evaluate the behavioural response of consumers to the different elements of the UMP. In particular, this project will produce vital empirical evidence on how households respond to changes in the price of water and whether this change lasts over time. The evaluation will include the dynamic impact of metering, tracing the behavioural response through time, and will be segmented along geographical and demographic lines. At the same time, the project will investigate the effectiveness of the information campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the ecological impact of water consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The findings of this research will have major impact on shaping the government strategy on how to tackle the problem of water stress throughout the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K01210X/1","grantId":"ES/K01210X/1","fundValue":"274578","fundStart":"2013-09-29","fundEnd":"2017-03-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  NA as we have not started the analysis of the data  ","person":"Carmine  Ornaghi","coPersons":["Mirco  Tonin"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" We have been collaborating with Southern Water since September 2013 to construct a database that will be used for the econometric analysis.
