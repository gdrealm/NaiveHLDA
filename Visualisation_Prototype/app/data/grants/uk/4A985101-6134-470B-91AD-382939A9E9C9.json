In this research, we will use unstable particles called muons to probe a catalyst which releases hydrogen. Muons react with our metal-containing chemicals in much the same way as hydrogen, but because of their characteristics of radioactive decay, it is possible to monitor the evolution of their spin when implanted within a sample, and thus gain information such as the addition site and reaction mechanisms. In these experiments, we will add muons to two of our catalysts in solution, which will enable us to gain new insight into how these molecules behave.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M011879/1","grantId":"EP/M011879/1","fundValue":"11007","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joseph Alexander Wright","coPersons":["Christopher John Pickett","Upali Abhaya Jayasooriya"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
