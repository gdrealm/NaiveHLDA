Ageing results in the decline of both physical and cognitive abilities and the most widespread cognitive decline is a reduction in memory ability. Recent research has found that when information is consistent with an individual’s knowledge and experience, it is easier to remember than abstract information and older adults appear to benefit from this effect more than do young adults. For example, when people are asked to remember an association between two words, age differences in memory performance are smaller for related word pairs (article-book, &nbsp;fatigue-sleep) &nbsp;compared to unrelated word pairs (article-lapel, &nbsp;fatigue-glass). It may therefore be possible to improve memory, particularly for older adults, by encouraging individuals to use knowledge and information that they are familiar with to support memory processes. The project will use a range of memory tests to investigate how people can use knowledge about the world to distinguish between different information in memory during retrieval; improve the chances of thinking in the same way when encoding information and when retrieving information; and reduce the amount of effort required to successfully encode and retrieve information.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002732/1","grantId":"ES/K002732/1","fundValue":"242600","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The current research is in the early stages of dissemination. Interactions with academic researchers in conferences and published data will have conveyed new ideas and insight into cognitive ageing and will therefore influence ongoing academic research. There are also several studies under review in academic journals and when published those results will also influence the cognitive ageing literature in general. The investigators on this grant are currently using the data to explore new avenues of research with colleagues in the hope of establishing a clearer image of cognitive ageing and to investigate means of helping older adults function successfully in life with diminishing cognitive resources.

It has often been found that older adults can perform much better in memory tasks that involve existing knowledge. For example, when memorising pairs of words, older adults improve more than young adults when the words within each pair are related (e.g., paw-foot, fox-dog) compared to unrelated (e.g., campus-foot, company-dog) and this reduces the general age deficits found in memory.\n\nThe research conducted so far indicates that this widely accepted pattern does not always occur. Thus, we have found several circumstances in which knowledge and experience help young and older adults similarly (i.e., both age groups benefit from prior knowledge in memory tasks). These seem to be when the prior knowledge is based on frequency. That is, things that have been frequently experienced are generally more easily remembered than things that are novel or new for all age groups. Interestingly, where knowledge and experience seem to differentially benefit older adults is when that knowledge provides logical insight into processing of to-be-remembered material.\n\nAs highlighted above, words that are related are more memorable, especially for older adults. This may be because the relations form part of a unified concept (e.g, fox and dog are both canine words). The research conducted so far found no age differences in the benefit of knowledge and experience on memory tasks when that experience was based on frequency. For example both age groups similarly remembered ‘a man sitting on a bench’ better than ‘a man sitting on a wall’, with the former being more commonly encountered. However, with sentences such as ‘The teacher marked the mock exam papers’ and ‘The teacher caught the train to London’, the age deficit in memory was particularly reduced for the former. Older adults seemed to particularly benefit from the logical relation between the parts of the sentence (‘the teacher’ and ‘marked the mock exam papers’) because the action is one that is mainly linked to being a teacher. In the prior example of ‘a man sitting on a bench’, there are many more things that a man might do, even if sitting on a bench is more common than sitting on a wall. To reiterate, when pre-existing knowledge provides logical insight into memory stimuli and supports deeper encoding, older adults’ memory benefits more than does young adults’ memory. However when pre-existing knowledge is based on how common something is, both young and older adults benefit similarly. The most immediate beneficiaries of this research will be academics working in the field of cognitive ageing. Researchers are generally focussed on finding tasks that older adults can do well and tasks that older adults struggle with. This helps to classify cognitive processes that are spared or impaired, respectively, by cognitive ageing. Understanding age-related cognitive decline can benefit research in two ways. Firstly, it will allow researchers to pinpoint areas of the brain that are physiologically more susceptible to ageing (for example by repeating the research in a neuroimaging study) and identify cognitive processes that are more susceptible aging. This will help to focus age-related palliative and preventative research on the most affected areas of age-related cognitive decline. Secondly, by highlighting processes that are most affected by ageing, the research may allow further insight into the most fragile cognitive processes. These fragile processes are likely to be the most complex or to be processes that require an ideal physiological environment in which to operate. This may provide insight into understanding human behaviour and cognition in general (for example, processes less vital to survival may be more susceptible to failure). Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
