{"id":"F2E1050A-4B64-4FC3-BFD8-BD8E341FCA13","title":"G-Sense","abstractText":"The project consortium: M-Solv (a process developer), Thomas Swan (a graphene manufacturer), Printed Electronics Ltd\n(an inkjet ink formulator) and the University of Surrey, aims to bring innovations to capacitive touch sensor (CTS)\nmanufacture. In a typical consumer device, CTS comprises of structured transparent conductors (TC), which sense the\ncapacitance variations when fingers approach. Conventional CTS are made of indium tin oxide (ITO). However, indium is\nknown to be scarce and hence expensive in the near future. This project will explore the use of silver nanowire (AgNW),\ntogether with graphene to replace ITO for fabricating CTS at a much lower cost. We have developed optimised silver\nAgNW films and made functional CTS based on such coatings. We also have recently filed a patent for depositing\ngraphene platelets (GP) onto networks of very low density AgNW to change its sheet resistance by orders of magnitude\nfrom Mohm/sq to less than hundreds ohm/sq. The project takes the idea further and aims to revolutionise the technical\napproach of CTS manufacture by printing GP onto AgNW networks to directly form electrodes for CTS, while the industry is\ncurrently manufacturing CTS by depositing large area of transparent conduct and subsequent patterning to structure\nelectrodes. Two printing techniques, inkjet printing and relief printing, are chosen to demonstrate the idea of the project; the\nlow cost AgNW/graphene structured film, the material-on-demand approach, and the rapid selective deposition techniques\ncan provide massive cost advantage (~10x) to CTS manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507775/1","grantId":"EP/M507775/1","fundValue":"59336","fundStart":"2015-05-11","fundEnd":"2016-05-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Brian Dalton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
