For example, Rolls Royce provides airlines with 'Power By The Hour': it sells jet engines with services to maintain and upgrade them over many years. While many firms have achieved success in creating standardised and modular products, they have experienced difficulties in obtaining similar improvements in services. Some firms, such as IBM, are attempting to improve their service offering by emulating replicable approaches found in the development of product platforms. </p> \n<p>This proposal aims to understand how project-based firms in three different capital goods industries (IT, telecoms services and the built environment) are developing complementary product and service components – forming components of a platform or integrated system – that can be easily combined and recombined to provide innovative solutions to each customer’s problem. The research is designed to answer these questions through an in-depth study of the experiences of three large project-based firms and a survey of projects undertaken by firms in the three sectors.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-180-25-0011","grantId":"RES-180-25-0011","fundValue":"261539","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Colin Davies","coPersons":["Annabelle  Gawer"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
