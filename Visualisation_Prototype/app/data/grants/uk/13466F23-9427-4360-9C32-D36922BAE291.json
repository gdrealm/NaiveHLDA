CD4+ T lymphocytes can differentiate to functionally distinct subsets and classified based on their cytokine secretion profiles as well as other properties. Proper regulation and balance between various lymphocyte subsets is central for the appropriate function of the immune system and required e.g. for host defence against pathogens or cancer as well as protection from autoimmune diseases. Recently, a new effector CD4+ T cell subset Th17 was discovered and named according to the main cytokine they secrete, IL17. Besides being involved in host defence to extracellular pathogens, Th17 cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases in human and experimental mouse models. The recent discovery by the Stockinger group links the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor widely studied in the toxicology field, and the Th17 system, which provides new hypotheses on the potential mechanisms underlying the well-established connection between the environmental factors and autoimmune diseases. The cellular response to an external stimulus is mediated through a series of overlapping networks that include the signalling network, the epigenetic and transcription factor control mechanisms at genome level, and the gene regulatory. In this project we will study these control mechanisms during the differentiation of Th17 cells by combining genome-wide experimental and computational approaches. We expect that our project results in the identification of the key regulatory components of each of the networks involved, as well as provide insights into the nature of molecular interactions between them. Such regulatory hubs, or the pathways that they participate in, provide targets for rational chemotherapy either for the immune-mediated diseases described above, or for enhancing protective immunity against infectious agents. Our multidisciplinary consortium provides cutting-edge complementary expertise to achieve the goals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004114/1","grantId":"BB/I004114/1","fundValue":"351063","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brigitte  Stockinger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC National Inst for Medical Research","findingsText":" This was a collaborative EU Framework 7 grant coordinated by the Institute for Biotechnology in Turku with participation of bioinformatics groups from the Netherlands and Finland. The aim was to obtain a detailed kinetic comparison of transcriptional changes comparing mouse and human Th17 cells.\n\nWorkpackage 1 with 4 milestones was completed according to schedule and NIMR contributed the samples of mouse Th17 cells generated by culture in four different conditions and comparing also cells expression different affinities of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor that is functionally important in Th17 cells. 312 RNA samples were subjected to Illumina deep sequencing. The two bioinformatics labs are still in the process of finalising the comparative analysis, but a study on detailed kinetic changes of gene expression profiling of human Th17 cell differentiation was published (Tuomela et al, Blood. 2012 Jun 7;119(23):e151-60. Epub 2012 Apr 27). This study led to identification of over 1000 genes differentially expressed during early human Th17 differentiation. Within these genes, many of them are new players identified from our study. With publication of this study, the dataset is now publicly available which provides the starting point for constructing the gene regulatory network and identifying new candidates possibly regulating the Th17 differentiation in human not only for us but also benefit for all researchers interested in this field. Th17 cells are major contributors to inflammatory pathologies in human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or psoriasis. Understanding the developmental processes for generation of these cells as well as the potential contribution of environmental factors that act via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor might open novel windows for development of therapeutics to intervene in the development of pathogenic Th17 cells.
