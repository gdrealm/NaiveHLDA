Recent evidence suggests that when the cncentration of this chemical is increased by dietary means muscle works more efficiently and requires less oxygen. We will investigate why this occurs. Heart muscle is another type of muscle and we will investigate whether nitrite has a similar effect in heart muscle. Finally we will investigate whether this can be exploited as a treatment in conditions such as blockage of the arteries of the leg and the heart.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001536","grantId":"G1001536","fundValue":"1030550","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Frenneaux","coPersons":["Thomas  Redpath","John  Horowitz","Colin  Selman","Dana  Dawson","John  Speakman","Matteo  Zanda","Andy  Welch","Martin  Feelisch","JULIE  Brittenden","Melanie  Madhani"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
