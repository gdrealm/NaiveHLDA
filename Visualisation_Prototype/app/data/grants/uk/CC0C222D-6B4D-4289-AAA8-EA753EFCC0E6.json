In adult humans, they reside in the bone marrow from where they replace short-lived mature blood cells throughout life. Thus, they are essential for our survival. They are the active component of bone marrow transplants that are used to re-establish blood formation (haematopoiesis) in patients that have lost their blood system due to blood disorders, accidents or medical treatments. \n\nTo develop new therapies, we need to be able to generate HSCs in vitro and to maintain and expand their numbers. To date, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that control these processes. \n\nWe study zebrafish embryos with the aim to reveal these mechanisms. While we can identify the earliest potential HSCs by gene expression, we currently lack an assay to test them. Therefore, we are generating a transgenic fish line in which these cells express a green fluorescent protein. Fluorescent cells will be transplanted from a transgenic to a wild-type embryo to see whether they participate in long-term haematopoiesis. This assay will be an invaluable tool for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that control HSC biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601134","grantId":"G0601134","fundValue":"338112","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Gering","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
