A group of researchers in Medical Physics and Engineering from the University of Edinburgh will demonstrate and explain these techniques through hands-on activities. The activities will include the basics of sound waves, a live demonstration of ultrasound with the identification of hidden objects, a display allowing you to see the inside the body with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and exploration of the principles behind X-ray. In addition to the scientific techniques, current research in the fields of ultrasound and MRI will be described and demonstrated with some associated activities and displays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D507456/1","grantId":"EP/D507456/1","fundValue":"5252","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Norman McDicken","coPersons":["Ian  Marshall"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
