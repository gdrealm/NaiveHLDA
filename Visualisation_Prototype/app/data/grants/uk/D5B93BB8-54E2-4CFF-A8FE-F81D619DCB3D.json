{"id":"D5B93BB8-54E2-4CFF-A8FE-F81D619DCB3D","title":"Remembered Places and Invented Traditions: thinking about the Holy Land in the late-medieval West.","abstractText":"The Latin Christian kingdom of Jerusalem was established by Crusaders in the Holy Land in 1099. European noblemen, clerics, pilgrims, converts and others quickly established a state based around the conquest of Jerusalem, with new castles and fortresses, cathedrals and cities. The Latin Kingdom endured for fewer than two hundred years; Jerusalem was taken by Saladin in 1187, and the last possession of the Crusaders, the coastal city of Acre, was gained by the Mamluks in 1291. The proposed research explores the European memory of the Crusades, and cultural consequences of the loss of the Latin Kingdom, in the centuries after 1291. As Jerusalem and the Holy Land once more came under Islamic control, European culture had to re-imagine its relationship to holy sites and especially to Jerusalem, the 'centre' or 'naval' of the known world. \nFar from abandoning its desire for Jerusalem and the Holy Land, Western Europe - Christian and non-Christian - besieged the Holy Land with an array of cultural and imaginative artefacts in the post-crusade era. These artefacts will the focus of this research project and include:\n-travel narratives: these may be based on genuine Crusader-era accounts, post-Crusader pilgrimage accounts, or 'fake' accounts, constructed from liturgical, cartographic, scientific or other sources. One of the key-texts behind the current proposal is the Book of Travels attributed to Sir John Mandeville, a fourteenth-century narrative of a journey from England to Jerusalem and beyond. Mandeville's book emerged in northern France and southern England in the 1350s, but proved a remarkably popular compilation of oriental and occidental learning and fantasy about the East. How far do texts like Mandeville's, along with popular crusader romances and more ambivalent texts rewrite the Holy Land, and how far do they represent a memory of the Crusades?\n-pilgrimage itineraries: these may be seen to construct the Holy Land according to its utility in terms of pilgrimage. Mary Carruthers has described such itineraries as providing a 'map for remembering', and others have described the late medieval vogue for 'armchair pilgrimage' and 'virtual travel'; according to such ideas, the Holy Land represented a mental, intellectual space, rather than an actual one, to which one could travel through cognition. What purposes did the intellectual production of the Holy Land serve, in what forms were they found, and what can this tell us about medieval perception and imagination? Latin Christians and European Jews did continue to visit the Holy Land and, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a flourishing Christian pilgrimage industry had been developed, largely under the auspices of the Franciscans. The Christians pilgrims who made the journey often commented on the vestigial, ruined remains of the Crusader kingdom, allowing us to see memory at work. Some later medieval accounts also urge a renewed crusade, to regain the Holy Land.\n-maps: these represented both the Crusader states and the 'Saracen' usurpers, yet also represented the changing nature of the Holy landscape. We will also consider the development of 'practical' seafaring maps, as the Holy Land was encountered in new ways through pragmatism and international trade, and the Islamic sources of many Western maps.\n-images and discourses of Islamophobia, antisemitism, nationalism, and prehistories of 'Orientalism' and 'Occidentalism': in what way, in the post-Crusader era, did Christendom renegotiate its relationship with the non-Christian world? How do travellers represent themselves?\n-architectural copies and simulacra: Jerusalem and Calvary were remediated in a wide range of occidental productions (e.g the fifteenth-century Jerusalem chapel at Edington (Wiltshire), the Holy House at Walsingham (Norfolk), the Jeruzalemkerk at Bruges), including archaeological and 'new' relics from the Holy Land and invented pilgrimage sites in the Holy Land and Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002704/1","grantId":"AH/J002704/1","fundValue":"29271","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Bale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
