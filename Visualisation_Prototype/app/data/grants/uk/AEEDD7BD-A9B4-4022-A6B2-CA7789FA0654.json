{"id":"AEEDD7BD-A9B4-4022-A6B2-CA7789FA0654","title":"Combining Digital Print Technologies with 18th Century Underglaze Ceramic Printing to Retain an Industrial Heritage Process","abstractText":"This bid seeks to build upon previous research undertaken by Hoskins into the combination of the digital capabilities of flexographic printing technology and the earliest printing process first developed for the ceramic industry in the 1780s. In order to achieve this it seeks to collaborate with Burgess Dorling &amp; Leigh (Burleigh), the last company to print underglaze tissue commercially, based at its Grade II listed Middleport pottery in Stoke on Trent. \n\nThe Princes' Regeneration Trust acquired the pottery in June 2011 saving it from imminent closure. The Trust's involvement has already saved 50 jobs, is maintaining the traditional manufacturing skills unique to Middleport, and preserving the historic buildings, collection of moulds and machinery. The Princes' Trust has specified that pottery production should remain at Middleport for the next 25 years. However there is a long-term issue with both the maintenance and production of printing rollers and plates, which in the past have been hand engraved. \n\nThis bid seeks to redress that issue by introducing the potential of printing traditional potters underglaze tissue, both printing and applying it in the same way as the 18th Century process, but creating the plate from a digital file. Thus reducing the time taken to engrave a roller from one month to less than a day to create a digital equivalent roller, whilst retaining the integrity of the final product. Burleigh requested the collaboration with the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, due to our expertise in the practical application and marriage of 19th Century printing processes, with digital technology.\n\nCFPR aim to investigate the recreation of underglaze intaglio printing rollers and plates using the flexographic process. Our previous research indicated it was possible to create an intaglio plate for research demonstration purposes and some practice based creative uses. This project seeks to create a visual taxonomy of existing underglaze tissue printed examples from museum collections in order to create a benchmark against which the major part of this new research can be undertaken empirically. It aims to recreate the qualities and visual aesthetic of underglaze tissue using contemporary digital technology whilst retaining all of the craft and artisan skills inherent in the application of underglaze tissue printing . It will do this by creating a methodology for the creation of practical examples using flexographic rollers and printing plates. The physical results can then be compared and tested against the benchmark. The methodology will ensure that the results are both of a commercial standard and commensurate with the 18th and 19th Century examples highlighted within the visual taxonomy. In parallel and as a further benchmark standard, an investigation will take place into the potential of recreating hand engraved rollers. \n\nThis project offers the potential to retain important skills within the pottery industry and make sure that an extant and working Victorian Pottery remains a viable part of the community and the nation's industrial heritage. Academically this project seeks to capitalise on a unique research opportunity to retain, in full working order, an important part of Britain's industrial heritage concurrent to bringing that heritage in-line with the 21st Century. The project needs to be sensitive to the historic context of Burleigh's process in order for future historians to gain tacit understanding of an industrial process as it was practiced in the 19th Century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003186/1","grantId":"AH/K003186/1","fundValue":"95943","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-02-03","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We collaborated with designers and engineers from Burleigh to develop a method of producing intaglio printed underglaze tissue transfers onto ceramic tableware, using contemporary technology to accurately replicate the traditional process. As a result of the project Burleigh will change their factory processes to use laser engraved rollers to support the use of the traditional hand-engraved roller. This will enable the company to increase their product range more quickly and cheaply in order that they remain competitive, whilst retaining and recording all of the traditional craft skills and attributes that are essential, both to this process and to the unique historic context that applies both to the company and the process.
