{"id":"687933A9-E6FB-4CEE-AB85-B45D6A3B36D8","title":"AHRC Leadership Fellowship for the Connected Communities Programme, stage two (renewal)","abstractText":"The Connected Communities Programme is an Art and Humanities Research Council-led funding initiative that has sought to extend dialogue and collaboration between academic researchers and partner organisations outside universities. Over the past five years the programme has funded over 300 projects working with well over 500 community partners and organisations. A partner could be a museum or a cultural organisation, a freelance artist, a voluntary or advocacy groupâ€”the programme seeks to be definitionally open. Connected Communities aims to be both interdisciplinary (hence the fact that although led by AHRC, its award holders are also funded by other research councils such as Economic and Social Research Council), and at the same time to have a core arts and humanities presence. The academic leadership of the programme is given by two Leadership Fellows, each appointed for three years from 2012. The purpose of this grant application is to renew the Leadership Fellowship of Prof George McKay for a further three years, 2015-2018. It includes an administrator, two postdoctoral researchers, and key activities include working with academics and community partners on their funded projects, liaising with the AHRC and other funding bodies, a new set of activities and events collaborating with the Leadership Fellows for other AHRC themes (Care for the Future, Digital Transformations, Translating Cultures, and Science in Culture), as well as undertaking personal research work related to the programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504488/1","grantId":"AH/N504488/1","fundValue":"620503","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"George  McKay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
