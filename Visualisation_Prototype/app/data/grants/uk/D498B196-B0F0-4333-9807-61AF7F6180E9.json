Of these compounds the diorganotetrylenes R2E [E = tetrel element: Si, Ge, Sn, Pb] are perhaps the most intriguing since, in addition to fundamental questions regarding their electronic structures and stabilities, these compounds are also potential ligands for transition metal centres. This project aims to build on a remarkable preliminary result from the applicant's laboratory which suggests that dialkyltetrylenes R2E (R = alkyl) may be significantly stabilised by weak E'-H...E interactions [E' = B, Si; E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb]. The project will exploit this new agostic stabilisation paradigm for the synthesis of a wide range of dialkyltetrylenes. It will explore how the stability of the dialkyltetrylene is related to the nature of the tetrel centre, the type of agostic donor , and the steric and electronic properties of the organic substituents. Detailed structural and spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations will be used to gain insight into the nature of the agostic-type interactions and to provide quantitative information on their contribution to the stability of the tetrylenes. The application of these compounds as ligands for transition metal centres will be explored, with the aim of elucidating their sigma-donor/pi-acceptor properties. We confidently expect that this project will yield numerous examples of previously inaccessible types of dialkyltetrylene and that these will have unique and novel properties as ligands.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E02226X/1","grantId":"EP/E02226X/1","fundValue":"280884","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Izod","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The isolation of stable low-coordination number and low oxidation state derivatives of the group 14 elements (i.e. formal analogues of carbenes, alkenes, alkynes and related species) remains one of the most exciting and challenging areas of contemporary main group chemistry.

During the course of the project we exploited this new &quot;agostic stabilisation&quot; paradigm for the synthesis of a range of dialkyltetrylenes. The stabilisation of these compounds by this method enabled the synthesis of examples of dialkylstannylenes and plumbylenes, R2Sn and R2Pb, with relatively small substituents which remained monomeric both in the solid state and solution, where equivalent compounds lacking B-H...E interactions dimerise to the corresponding alkene analogues. \n\n\n\nDetailed structural and spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that these are genuine B-H...E agostic-type interactions which stabilise these compounds by between 30 and 40 kcal/mol. In spite of this stabilisation, these compounds undergo reactions, such as oxidative addition, which are typical of tetrylenes. Although we have yet to explore extensively the application of our dialkylstannylenes and -plumbylenes as ligands for transition metals, early experiments suggest that they will act as both E- and BH3-donors, forming stable chelate rings, and that the agostic-type B-H...E interactions are lost on coordination of the tin or lead centre to a transition metal.\n\n\n\nIn summary, this project has successfully yielded a range of previously inaccessible types of dialkyltetrylene which are significantly stabilised by agostic-type B-H...E interactions; preliminary studies indicate that these compounds have the potential to act as novel ligands to the transition metals. This project was of a fundamental nature and so has limited potential for non-academic impact. This work will largely be of interest/use to the academic community and so dissemination was via publications in academic journals. Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
