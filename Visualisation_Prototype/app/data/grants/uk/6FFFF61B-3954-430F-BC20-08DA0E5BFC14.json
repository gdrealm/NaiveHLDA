Thinking about counterfactual possibilities in middle-childhood","abstractText":"When we miss trains or have to work late to meet a deadline, thoughts of how the world might have been otherwise often come to us. These are called counterfactual thoughts. This research will explore counterfactual thinking by children aged 5- to 9- years-old. There are two key developments:\n<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n <li>Holding in mind multiple possibilities. At around 5 years children understand that an event in the past could have possibly turned out differently.</li>\n <li>Comparisons between possibilities. Later between 7 and 9 years, children start to understand counterfactual emotions, such as regret and relief. These emotions rely on a comparison between reality and what could have happened.</li>\n</ol>\n<br />The relation between these developments and basic cognitive processes will be investigated using simple tasks that tap different aspects of childrenâ€™s reasoning ability, language abilities and their executive functioning: working memory (holding information in mind), attention shifting (switching between ideas), and inhibitory control (ignoring irrelevant information).\n<br />\n<br />The aim is to combine these results with those from a previous ESRC project to provide a comprehensive cognitive developmental account of counterfactual thinking in 3- to 9- year olds.\n<br />\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1114","grantId":"RES-062-23-1114","fundValue":"177083","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our results have informed further studies of children's and adults' cognition.
