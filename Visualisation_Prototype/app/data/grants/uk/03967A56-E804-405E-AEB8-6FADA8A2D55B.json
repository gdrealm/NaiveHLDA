It is typically delivered in daily doses (fractions) over a period of several weeks using multiple high energy X-ray (and now proton) &quot;beams&quot;. The beams are individually shaped for each patient and designed to overlap at the precise location of the target disease. The intention is to give maximum dose to the cancer cells while minimising dose to nearby healthy tissues. Usual practice is to plan the arrangement and shape of these treatment beams based on CT images taken before treatment begins. \n\nEnsuring that the patient and their tumour target are in the correct position for treatment on each day of their therapy is challenging. Small changes (more than a few millimetres) could invalidate the pre-treatment planning leading to the target receiving too low a dose of radiation (and hence reduced chance of cure) or healthy tissues receiving too high a dose of radiation (and hence increased chance of side effects). \n\nThe use of cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging within the treatment room to check patient position, pose, and anatomy just before the radiation beams are switched on has recently become widespread. However, changes in patient shape can be complex, making it difficult to calculate whether the resulting change in radiation dose received will be significant - that is, will it be necessary to alter the pre-planned treatment to take account of the change?\n\nOur aim is to simplify this decision process. We will develop a computerised method that uses a patient's CBCT image to calculate changes from their prescribed and planned dose. Currently this is not possible because calculation of radiation dose requires accurate data on tissue density within the patient, in order to determine how X-rays (or protons) will interact with their anatomy. Unlike CT images, which are used to generate the initial treatment plan, CBCT images do not give accurate information on tissue density.\n\nThis project will develop a method to &quot;correct&quot; the CBCT images so that the tissue density information that they contain can be used to directly compute delivered doses. This will be of significant benefit to radiotherapy patients since staff we be able to quickly check that the correct dose will be delivered, or if it is necessary to take action to avoid incorrect doses. Currently this process is very time consuming - tissue boundaries have to be manually drawn onto CBCT images and assumed density values assigned to each region. The technology we propose to develop will accelerate such assessments, estimated to be necessary for about one fifth of CBCT images. A further benefit is that our correction method not only restores accurate CBCT density values, but also markedly improves visual image quality. This makes images easier to interpret and more suitable for automatic analysis, with potential for further time savings.\n\nThe project builds on our previous work, where we have developed a correction method that appears to be effective for pelvic or head and neck images. We have acquired a UK patent for this invention, ensuring that benefits and value to the NHS can be maximised. In this project we propose to extend our method for use in lung images. This site is challenging due to the large differences in tissue densities present (lung, soft-tissue, bone), and the inherent respiratory motion. We will additionally investigate the suitability of corrected CBCT images for the planning of proton radiotherapy, a looming challenge as we move towards the opening of the first high-energy proton therapy centres in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L023059/1","grantId":"MR/L023059/1","fundValue":"285887","fundStart":"2014-10-06","fundEnd":"2017-10-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Marchant","coPersons":["Gareth James Price","Christopher John Moore"],"organisation":"Christie Hospital NHS Trust","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
