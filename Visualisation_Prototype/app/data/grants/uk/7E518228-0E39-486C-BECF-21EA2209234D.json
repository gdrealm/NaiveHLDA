A particular focus is legalisation introduced in December 2003 prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion. One of the aims of the research is to establish how religious discriminations interact with other equality rights such as gender and sexual orientation equality. It assesses the circumstances in which religious discrimination should be allowed, and how and clashes of rights should be resolved. In order to address these issues, the experience of other jurisdiction which has had religious discrimination protection for longer is explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113172/1","grantId":"113172/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2007-01-17","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucy  Vickers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":" The project considers the extent to which religious interests are protected in the workplace, with particular reference to the protection against religious discrimination provided by the Employment (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003.
