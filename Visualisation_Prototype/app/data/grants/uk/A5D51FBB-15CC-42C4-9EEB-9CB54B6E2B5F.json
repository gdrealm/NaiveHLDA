{"id":"A5D51FBB-15CC-42C4-9EEB-9CB54B6E2B5F","title":"Global Seismic Imaging of the Oceanic Plates","abstractText":"The outer layer of the earth is composed of rigid tectonic plates, like a cracked eggshell. These plates slide around the surface of the planet over a weaker, hotter layer below. The transition from rigid plate to the mantle below is fundamental to plate tectonics and our existence on the planet. However, the definition of the plate, i.e., their thickness, defining mechanism, and degree of coupling to the layer below are not well-known.\n\nI will use global seismic imaging to understand the thickness and defining mechanism of the Earth's oceanic plates. The ocean plates cover 70% of Earth's surface, yet are rarely mapped at high resolution given the remoteness, and the difficulty and cost of deploying seismometers to the bottom of a 4 km deep ocean. I have developed a new methodology to map the plates in locations where station coverage is sparse, as it is beneath the oceans. I use the SS waveform, which is an S wave that has bounced once at Earth's surface. Subtle variations in the character of the SS wave give information on the depth and character of the base of the tectonic plate in the region of the bouncepoint.\n\nI will use a newly compiled global database (1990 - 2011) which is nearly 4TB in size, and represents about four-times the data in my previous investigations. The significance is that I will be have nearly perfect resolution across all ocean basins, enabling global comparisons and a unified view of the tectonic plate.\n\nThe definition of the plate has implications for many processes that impact human existence. It has a fundamental control on how plates move. This includes the generation of earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis. Therefore a better understanding will lead to better hazard assessment and mitigation of natural disasters. In addition, plate thickness and strength directly affects uplift and subsidence of the tectonic plate. These forces impact mountain building and sea level rise, and are therefore important factors in understanding climate change. \n\nThe results from this study will change text books, and clarify fundamental questions. I will develop a better understanding of the definition of a tectonic plate, including its formation and evolution. Understanding the ocean plates is fundamental to any tectonic setting in that they likely play a large role in the formation of the continents. Overall, this work will deepen our understanding of plate tectonics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K000985/1","grantId":"NE/K000985/1","fundValue":"58079","fundStart":"2013-07-03","fundEnd":"2016-07-02","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine A Rychert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" compiled global database\nbegun inversions for the LAB  Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
