Part of this challenge involves managing rapidly changing situations, where prospective collaborators join and existing collaborators leave a coalition, without compromising security requirements.\n\nThe aim of the EUSTACE project is to develop a decision-making framework and tool support for rapidly evaluating the security implications of ad-hoc collaborative work. We propose a framework that reuses existing models in Security, HCI, and Computer Science and makes these amenable to automated analysis and tool support.\n\nThe framework describes how formal specifications of implied behaviour are generated from existing usability and system models (such as personas and use cases) and combined with formal specifications of security requirements (derived from existing policies and requirements). A model checker is then used to analyse these specifications for failures and contradictions. These are then visualised in a collaborative work model that captures elements of the system, its users and their activities. The failures and contradictions are then highlighted in this model, providing the means of rapidly evaluating whether a proposed collaboration is likely to create security problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J020591/1","grantId":"EP/J020591/1","fundValue":"120779","fundStart":"2012-05-30","fundEnd":"2013-05-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To our knowledge, these findings have not been used elsewhere.

This is useful in helping to explore possible security violations systematically. We have shown how it is possible to merge formal methods and HCI design techniques to harness the strengths of both. More work in this area needs to be done to identify what other aspects of HCI design techniques are complemented by the strengths of formal verification techniques, and this work can be built upon to achieve this.
