{"id":"37EB44B7-3B13-407D-8DAD-07BEBB296AD0","title":"A New Approach to the Chemical Modification of Antibodies via Maleimide Bridging of Disulfides","abstractText":"We are entering extremely exciting times in the development of the next generation of therapeutics, as scientists have turned their attention to the manipulation of part of nature's own defense mechanism; antibodies. Antibodies can now be designed in the lab to target a variety of diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases. They represent the fastest growing class of therapeutics, with a market value estimated to be around $50 billion. Currently however, a limiting factor in the area is the lack of reliable chemical methods that will allow the modification and optimisation of the properties of antibodies. We are proposing here to exemplify a new class of chemical reagents that will allow the highly effective modification of antibodies for the first time. This exemplification will enable us to establish partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to facilitate the optimisation of future antibody-based therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J010448/1","grantId":"BB/J010448/1","fundValue":"140099","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In this project we demonstrated new methods for the generation of homogeneous anibody fragment and full antibody conjugates. These methods are extremely promising for the generation of superior antibody conjugates for therapeutic applications. This possibility is currently being explored by us (and others) for use in the area of antibody-drug conjugates, as highly targetted 'magic-bullet' therapeutics.

Antibodies represent the fastest growing class of therapeutics, with over 30 approved for clinical use to date and\nover 150 in clinical development. It is estimated that the global market for antibody therapeutics is currently around $50 billion. Aparticularly promising class of antibody based therapeutics are antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs), commonly referred to as 'magic-bullet' therapies due to their ability to seek and destroy just diseased cells\nwithin the body (e.g. cancer cells). However, a major hindrance to the area is the lack of suitable chemical methods for the\nconstruction of homogeneous, well defined, antibody conjugates. \n In this project we developed a new platform for homogeneous antibody conjugation, which we expect to offer major advantages in the construction of next geneation antibody conjugates as therapetics. This was achieved by the design, synthesis and successful application. of a range of new reagents which target specific amino-acid residues present in antibodies. The development of defined antibody conjugates by this research provides an improved method for generating antibody conjugates as therapeutics and also diagnostics. This should lead to improved healthcare products e.g. better tolerated therapies, improved therapeutic index, more sensitive diagnostic methods and more reproducible/economical products.
