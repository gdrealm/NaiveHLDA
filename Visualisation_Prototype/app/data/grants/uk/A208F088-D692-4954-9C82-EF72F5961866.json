If realized it would allow for much faster computation and would for example threathen the security of current cryptographic schemes for secret communication. It also offers the potential many novel communication schemes including novel cryptographic schemes that are unconditionally secure, even against quantum information processing. A variety of candidate technologies, such as ion traps, optical lattices, quantum dots, superconducting devices and in particular photons, are currently being explored as candidates for the experimental implementation of quantum information processing and quantum communication. In this context photon based implementations play a particularly important role as they represent ideal carriers of quantum information. Any quantum communication network or distributed quantum information processing device would require the ability to manipulate photonic degrees of freedom coherently at the single photon level. For longer distance communication the unavoidable noise and absorption processes would require the use of quantum repeaters to refresh the quantum information. Repeaters for such a photon-based system would require the ability for small scale photon based quantum information processing.The proposed project aims to implement the required technology employing highly integrated optics devices rather than the more traditional bulk optics approach where one arranges individual optical elements on an optical table. This approach avoids many of the problems that bulk optics suffers and also permits more general ways to code and manipulate information. We aim to explore the use of this novel technology for quantum information processing both experimentally and theoretically to develop novel methods for quantum information processing and to demonstrate the feasibility of basic quantum information processing in such arrangements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C013956/1","grantId":"EP/C013956/1","fundValue":"303738","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter George Smith","coPersons":["Neil  Broderick"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" Within the project we demonstrated that phase controlled photonic circuits offered a reliable route for creating quantum circuitry, showing NOON state interference and non-classical results. Within the work significant challenges were met and overcome in terms of coupling multiple optical modes into circuitry, and it advanced the state-of-the-art. Planar waveguide circuitry of the sort developed within the project has found application at the Southampton University spin-out Stratophase and we have recently supplied circuits to a Japanese technology major and into a European space agency project. Following on from the project we have continued to collaborate, resulting in new work with National Institute of Standards and Testing at Boulder and our collaborators in Oxford. This has led to new grant applications and to the first demonstration of photon counting detection 1550nm with an on-chip detector. Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
