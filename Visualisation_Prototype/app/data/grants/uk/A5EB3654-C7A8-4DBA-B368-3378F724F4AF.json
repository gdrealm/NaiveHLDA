{"id":"A5EB3654-C7A8-4DBA-B368-3378F724F4AF","title":"Tagore, pedagogy and contemporary visual cultures","abstractText":"The Tagore, pedagogy and contemporary visual cultures network aims to bring together a group of leading international academics and visual arts practitioners to discuss and explore the legacy and continuing relevance of Indian poet and polymath Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) for contemporary art practice and visual culture. The group made up of artists, academics (both senior and early career researchers), curators and a political scientist, from Europe and India, have come together because they share an interest in exploring Tagore's legacy and influence from different disciplinary backgrounds, often taking idiosyncratic, unorthodox approaches in order to think outside of the established conventions of Tagore scholarship. This network not only offers new opportunities for cross-disciplinary research, but proposes an original and as yet uncharted approach to Tagore's work and its continuing relevance.\n\nWe will meet twice in London, once in the Netherlands, and once in Santinikatan, the community school set up by Tagore in India in 1901.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006669/1","grantId":"AH/L006669/1","fundValue":"32503","fundStart":"2013-11-23","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrea  Phillips","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
