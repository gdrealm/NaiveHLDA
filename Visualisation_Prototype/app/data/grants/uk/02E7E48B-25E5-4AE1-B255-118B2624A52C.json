This concern is to a large extent derived from model-based predictions on how future climate change will affect European biodiversity. Current species distribution models suggest that climate change will cause habitats to shift or contract northwards, and will result in high rates of extinction for the coming 100 years. However, such predictions are controversial, due largely to the uncertainties in how species respond to changes in habitat availability. Central to this problem is the habitat tracking hypothesis, which states that populations will respond to changes in habitat availability by altering their distributions accordingly. Here, we propose a novel and multi-disciplinary approach to investigate the underlying mechanisms that determine the probability and extent of climate-induced habitat tracking in European mammals. We will combine recently developed ancient DNA approaches with species distribution models to construct a detailed investigation of habitat tracking in nine model species in real time through the last 40,000 years. This will allow us to establish the tempo and mode of population response to climate change, as well as to evaluate, adjust and employ existing forecasting models to more accurately predict future responses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G00269X/1","grantId":"NE/G00269X/1","fundValue":"295238","fundStart":"2009-05-18","fundEnd":"2013-05-17","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Chiefly by academics, through publications, and through public presentation as a means of linking museum collections to climate change.

However, such predictions are controversial due to uncertainties in how species respond to changes in habitat availability. Central to this problem is whether populations will respond to environmental change by chasing new habitat; the alternative, however, is that populations are unable to move to the north when temperatures increase, or vice versa when it gets colder, and that these populations instead become extinct. One way to address this question is to investigate what happened during the last Ice Age, when dramatic changes in temperatures resulted in large-scale changes in the distribution of many species. The CLIMIGRATE project has investigated this by using ancient DNA analyses on fossil material from the last 40,000 years to examine the extent that these populations were able to move in concert with climate change. The results from these analyses provide us not only with a better understanding of how the European fauna was established, but could improve our predictions of how global warming will affect European mammals over the coming 100 years. A future goal is to investigate the role of museum collections in climate change research, and we are working with the museums community to develop this.
