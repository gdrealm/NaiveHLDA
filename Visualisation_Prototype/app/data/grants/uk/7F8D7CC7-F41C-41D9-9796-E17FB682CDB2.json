As part of treatment, these babies may be exposed to a range of pain stimuli ranging from brief but frequent procedural interventions such as blood tests, through to major surgical procedures to treat complications or correct birth defects (eg. congenital heart abnormalities). Even the youngest babies respond to painful stimuli, but as the nervous system is not fully mature, the response to pain, surgical injury and different analgesics can vary from that seen in older children and adults. Different treatments are available to reduce pain, but we need more evidence to confirm which are the safest and most effective for these vulnerable patients. Many years following neonatal surgery or intensive care, changes can still be measured in children: sensitivity to temperature and pressure is different; they are more sensitive to painful stimuli; and they need more analgesia if further surgery is needed. \n\nIn order to understand how pain and injury in early life produce persistent changes in pain sensitivity, we are evaluating the impact of surgical injury (plantar hindpaw incision) in newborn rats. This incision produces longterm changes in sensory processing and an increased sensitivity to repeat surgery in later life that mirrors the changes we have seen in children. As almost one third of post-surgical patients treated by our Acute Pain Service at Great Ormond Street Hospital are undergoing surgery for at least the second time, determining why the developing nervous system responds in this way will help us identify children at risk of increased pain sensitivity and improve their treatment. As our laboratory studies show that changes in sensitivity are permanent, learning how to prevent these effects has an impact that extends beyond the healthcare of children and could help explain why, despite having the same operation, some adults develop more severe and prolonged pain. \n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The spinal cord is an important site for modulating pain inputs, but pain signaling here is not fully mature at birth, and sensitivity can be altered by high levels of pain input in early life. Based on our previous work, we propose that factors contributing to the longterm increased pain sensitivity include; i) effects on the sensitivity of nerve cells (neurons) and circuits within the spinal cord; ii) an excessive loss of nerve cells that would inhibit pain signaling at later stages; or iii) interactions with microglial cells which which can retain a long-term &quot;memory&quot; of this early injury and communicate with neurons to alter their level of sensitivity. \n\nObjective 1. How widely distributed to other parts of the body is the increased pain sensitivity following neonatal surgery?\nObjective 2. Does increased death of nerve cells (neuronal apoptosis) in the neonatal spinal cord increase pain sensitivity? Can these long-term changes be blocked by different types of analgesia?\nObjective 3. Do spinal microglia contribute to the increased apoptosis in the neonatal cord and subsequent pain hypersensitivity in adulthood?\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS: Results from these experiments will help us in two ways: \ni) identifying patients at risk of increased pain sensitivity so we can adjust their treatment accordingly. Improved understanding of how surgical injury in early life alters pain sensitivity, and if these changes are generalized from surgery at different body sites, will determine which groups are at risk of persistent post-surgical pain throughout later life and into adulthood.\nii) determine which analgesics are both safe to use in neonates and are most effective at preventing long-term changes in sensitivity. Demonstrating beneficial effects by reducing microglial reactivity has the potential to lead to new treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K022636/1","grantId":"MR/K022636/1","fundValue":"338767","fundStart":"2013-11-18","fundEnd":"2016-11-17","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Suellen Monica Walker","coPersons":["Simon  Beggs"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
