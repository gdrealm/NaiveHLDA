Both may be adversely affected if economic pressures overshadow social and individual concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the series are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to understand the WLB challenges for employees, employers and policy-makers posed by economic recession and austerity measures</li>\n\n <li>to provide a forum for employers, unions, policy makers and academics to discuss how to meet these challenges. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Discussions will focus on a triple agenda of enhancing employee WLB, sustaining or enhancing organisational effectiveness, and contributing to social justice. Seminars will examine the implications of the economic environment for gender equality, health and well-being, care and care giving, employment relations and workplace innovations, and explore the impacts on individuals, families, organisations and wider society. International contributors will highlight experiences in other national contexts, especially those in which there have been similar severe cuts to the UK, as well as innovative workplace and policy initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars will contribute to current policy debates on WLB, and on the quality of working life, happiness, social justice, equalities and care arrangements.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000423/1","grantId":"ES/L000423/1","fundValue":"23822","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2016-04-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Suzan  Lewis","coPersons":["Clare  Lyonette","Grace  James","Jonathan  Swan","Deirdre Anne  Anderson","Nicole  Busby","Stephen James Wood","Roberta  Guerrina","Nicola  Payne","Colette  Fagan"],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
