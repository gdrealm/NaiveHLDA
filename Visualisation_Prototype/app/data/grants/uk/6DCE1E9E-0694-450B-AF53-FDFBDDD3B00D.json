However genetic basis is complicated, involves an interplay with environmental stress and is , so far, not well understood at a molecular level. This study aims to identify genes involved in susceptibility to depression.It will have important implications for the future discovery of novel targets for new safer, more effective medications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701420","grantId":"G0701420","fundValue":"1168360","fundStart":"2008-03-26","fundEnd":"2010-03-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  McGuffin","coPersons":["Ian  Craig","Michael Robert Barnes","Gerome Daniel Breen","Pierandrea  Muglia","Cathryn  Lewis","Anne  Farmer"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
