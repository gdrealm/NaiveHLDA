So far we have engaged very positively with UTS in Australia. We have hosted a senior PhD student for 3 months enabling him to learn new techniques and take them back to Australia. We have applied for funding to the Australian government (ANR as collaborator). We have produced a joint poster for the 3rd Prato Conference on the Pathogenesis of Bacterial Diseases of Animals in Prato, Italy, October 2014. This won first prize. Finally, we have hosted Prof Steve Djordevic (named on the Partnering Award) at RVC for a research seminar and held useful discussions on future collaboration and research opportunities.
