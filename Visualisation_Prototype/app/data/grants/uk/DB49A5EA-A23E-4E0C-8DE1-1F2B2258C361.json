Controlled growth and differentiation of ES cells in the lab can be directed to generate large populations of specific types of cell. The advent of ES cells derived from human embryos has raised the exciting possibility that tissues required for human transplantation therapies could be grown in the lab, and circumvent the requirement for donor cells that are otherwise very difficult to source. This is particularly true neural transplantation that is currently being pioneered to treat disorders such as Parkinson?s and Huntington?s (HD) diseases, but is currently dependent on rare tissue, derived from elective aborted fetuses. One problem is that specific brain regions are characterized by the presence of different types of neuron, therefore to treat different disorders the right kind of neuron must first be generated. In this proposal we aim to control the differentiation of human ES cells to acquire the characteristic of the striatum, the region of the brain worst affected in HD, and the target for cell transplantation therapy. We will then test whether the derived cells will integrate and develop alongside host striatal tissue in animal models of HD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300331","grantId":"G0300331","fundValue":"321908","fundStart":"2004-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Allen","coPersons":["Siddharthan  Chandran","Anne Elizabeth  Rosser"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
