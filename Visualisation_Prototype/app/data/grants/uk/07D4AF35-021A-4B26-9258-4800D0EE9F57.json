{"id":"07D4AF35-021A-4B26-9258-4800D0EE9F57","title":"Soldiers of Democracy: The Great War and the Culture of the New Negro","abstractText":"The project examines the enormous impact of the Great War on African American Culture in the 1920s and after. The cultural importance of the transatlantic movement of 2000,000 black servicemen, their contact with the French people, culture and language, mass testing, and new ideas about representing the body are discussed, as are the strategies and forms used by black Americans to remember and commemorate the conflict. In doing so the book examines the tension between nationalism and transnationalism, patriotic pride and national betrayal, ideas of masculinity and ideas of race, and remembering and forgetting which marked the African American cultural response to WW1.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112642/1","grantId":"112642/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Whalan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
