{"id":"63FD1CCB-C971-41EB-B29F-56426EDCF01B","title":"MSSL PATT linked grant","abstractText":"The next two years of research in MSSL's Astrophysics group will continue the intensive exploitation of data from XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift and Herschel to study accreting binaries, neutron stars, star forming galaxies, AGN and gamma ray bursts. We will need to complement these programmes with ground based preparatory and follow up observations. All of our research is dependent on ground based observations to provide multiwavelength extensions or follow up in order to get the full science return. This proposal is for the continuation of our current PATT linked grant, and requests travel funds to allow group members to travel to PATT and PATT-approved telescopes to conduct these observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J004723/1","grantId":"ST/J004723/1","fundValue":"10542","fundStart":"2012-09-24","fundEnd":"2014-09-23","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mathew James Page","coPersons":["Mark Scott Cropper","Ignacio  Ferreras","Kinwah  Wu","Daisuke  Kawata","Graziella  Branduardi-Raymont","Silvia  Zane"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" This grant did not fund research, only travel to telescopes for research.
