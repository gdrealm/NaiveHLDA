Therefore the aim of the current research is to develop a proper account of the development of mental imagery.</p>\n\n<p>In four studies, this research examines how children ranging from 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 14-years of age and adults:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>generate mental images (Study 1)</li>\n\n <li>maintain mental images (Study 2)</li>\n\n <li>scan mental images (Study 3)</li>\n\n <li>transform mental images (Study 4).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Together, these studies will help us to understand how children visualise scenes, objects, or events in their mind and how this differs from adults in everyday-life. Once we know how and when mental imagery develops, the findings can be implemented in an educational setting to aid thinking and remembering on a day-to-day basis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I003479/2","grantId":"ES/I003479/2","fundValue":"39204","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marina  Wimmer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
