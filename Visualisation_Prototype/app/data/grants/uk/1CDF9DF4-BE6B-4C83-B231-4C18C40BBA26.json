The method of the project will involve bringing together the following key health and educational stakeholders from both jurisdictions: Department of Health Social Services and Public Safety, NI, Public Health Agency NI, Council for the Curriculum Education and Assessment NI, The Health Services Executive Crisis Pregnancy Programme RoI, and the Department of Education and Science, RoI to develop learning resources.</p>\n\n<p>The learning resources will include an interactive video drama which will ‘bring to life’ a case scenario of an unintended pregnancy from a teenage man’s perspective and invite participants’ reflections and anticipatory thinking on such a situation in their lives. The key educational aim is to help young men as well as young women consider the consequences of their choices and develop educational strategies for future or present relationships.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0300","grantId":"RES-189-25-0300","fundValue":"83850","fundStart":"2012-04-30","fundEnd":"2013-04-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impacting on policy \nLeading civil servants in NI have identified the importance of the resource in meeting key government health policy targets. For example, the Chief Medical Officer of NI has stated:\n\nThe DHSSPS considers that this project is supportive of the aims and objectives of the Sexual Health Promotion Strategy and Action Plan 2008-2013. The Department is particularly supportive of this research as it is relevant towards delivery of the objective of providing opportunities for young people in school and youth settings to develop the skills they need to appropriately manage their relationships.\nDr Michael McBride, Chief Medical Officer 18/04/2013\n\nChanging Educational Practice \nThe intervention will be rolled out to schools beginning September 2013 (initially in a selective way to facilitate evaluation, as planned from the outset). The statutory stakeholder support (from the Dept. of Education in IE and the Council for Curriculum Authority in NI) will facilitate universal access to the resource for adolescents attending schools in NI (N= 216) at Key Stage 4 of the curriculum, (approximately 2,400 pupils) and in IE (N= 582 schools who have a transition year programme, approximately 3,200 pupils). \n\nAn Australian version of the educational resource developed from our joint research with Flinders Unversity is already being distributed to 86% of State schools (117 schools with approximately 6,300 pupils at age 15 years) in South Australia. This was achieved in 2012 by developing a partnership with SHINE, the primary provider of RSE education to state schools. See Future Impacts below.\n\nImpact on Adolescents\nThe results of a separate research study conducted with a sample of male adolescent users of the educational resource in Ireland and South Australia demonstrates that it is achieving key educational and health promotion effects. For example, 85% of users in Ireland and 72% in Australia agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that it 'helped me understand the effect an unplanned pregnancy would have on a guy like me' (Lohan et al, 2012). \n\nImpact on Teachers &amp;amp; Teacher Trainers\nTeachers are already being trained in using If I were Jack and have expressed a strong desire to use this innovative resource (see www.qub.ac.uk/IfIWereJack/Podcasts/).\n\nSecondary Impact\nThis project facilitated the Department of Education IE and the Council for the Curriculum Education and Assessment NI, for the first time, to work together on RSE curricula. This co-operation led to shared learning between specialists and supports the implementation of the Belfast Agreement (see www.qub.ac.uk/IfIWereJack/Videos/).

This project has helped address this need by developing an educational resource on teenage men and unintended pregnancy which is being integrated into the Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE) curricula of post-primary schools in Northern Ireland (NI) and Ireland (IE). The resource, entitled 'If I Were Jack...' is based around an interactive video drama (IVD) and includes a training package for teacher trainers and educational materials for teachers, pupils and parents, built around four detailed lesson plans. A number of strategies have been utilised to maximise the impact of the resource. These include: 1) developing a credible, evidence-based, theory-informed resource which can be feasibly implemented in schools in both jurisdictions, and is amenable to rigorous evaluation; 2) ensuring acceptability by involving key health and educational statutory stakeholders in resource development and using an educational modality that engages young people; and 3) optimizing universal access to the resource by ensuring that it is part of the statutory curricula for all adolescents at Key Stage 4 of the curriculum attending mainstream schools in Northern Ireland (N= 216, reaching approximately 2,400 pupils) and in all schools in Ireland who have a transition year programme (81% of schools reaching approximately 3,200 pupils), in addition to utilising new technologies such as video and the internet to extend national and international dissemination. The application of this intervention model \nThe educational resource we developed was based around an interactive video drama which is designed to immerse participants in a health care risk situation (such as avoiding an unintended pregnancy) and to imagine how they would think, feel and act.\n\nThe core methodology of developing half hour interactive films for the purposes has been replicated by other research teams in Australia and Canada\nExample 1.\n\nThe Knowledge Translation Model Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
