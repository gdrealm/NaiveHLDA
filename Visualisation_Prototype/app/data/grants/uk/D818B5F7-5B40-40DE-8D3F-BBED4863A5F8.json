This will combine the functionalities of a high-efficiency cooking stove, an electricity generator and a refrigerator (cool box), referred to as SCORE, and may be fuelled by burning a range of biomass products. The partnership brings together four UK universities, a leading US research centre (Los Alamos National Laboratory), a multi-national electrical goods manufacturer (GP Acoustics), an international charitable organisation (Practical Action), and numerous universities in Africa and Asia. It will also collaborate to ensure that the devices are acceptable at a technological, economic and social level and that there is sufficient scope for the communities to develop numerous businesses from the manufacture, repair and innovative applications of SCORE.The operation of the electricity generating and refrigerator parts of the proposed device will be based on a novel application of thermoacoustic processes. Fundamentally, these rely on the interaction between an acoustic field and solid boundaries, leading to a range of fluid- and thermo-dynamic processes, which do not require harmful working fluids or moving parts in the traditional sense; the electrical power extraction is accomplished by a linear alternator.The concept of the device is based on the proven thermoacoustic Stirling engines and refrigerators developed by Los Alamos, NASA and the US military for applications including: cooling of satellite systems and radar arrays, gas liquefaction and cryogenics, use of waste heat for air conditioning, separation of binary gas mixtures and many others. There is a significant level of innovation in the proposed work in three respects: 1) research into the combination of the thermoacoustic engine, linear alternator and cool box in a single device, powered by a biomass stove, which has not been attempted before,2) design of a rugged and inexpensive linear alternator that could be easily mass-produced, 3) the overall system design from the viewpoint of low cost, application of indigenous materials, use of local manufacturing skills and simplicity of assembly, which are major research issues compared to the high-cost and high-tech thermoacoustic systems produced so far. These challenges form the backbone of the proposed scientific and technological work programme.Within the overall 5-year duration, there will be two stages to this project: the first 3 years will mainly focus on conducting the necessary social and scientific research, while the last 2 years will broadly focus on technology hand-over, including representative field trials and a wide dissemination among target communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E044468/1","grantId":"EP/E044468/1","fundValue":"251605","fundStart":"2007-06-12","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to design efficient smoke free cook stoves for rural communities in Kenya and Nepal in association with collaborators on the project Practical Action.

A smoke free stove operating from wood was successfully developed and independently tested without engine in rural developing countries. The stove with engine was tested in the laboratory as a world first demonstration of an atmospheric thermoacoustic engine operating of a wood firing stove. The development of the stove was a useful outcome in that this design can be used without the engine and the underpinning research can be used for further development of low cost cookstoves for developing countries. The thermoacoustic engine was demonstrated in the lab and in Bangladesh and can be taken forward to a commercial design with further investment. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
