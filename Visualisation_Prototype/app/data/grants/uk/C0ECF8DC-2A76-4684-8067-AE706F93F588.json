This project will explore the development of two enzymes that catalyse important bond forming reactions in the synthesis of an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient and their suitability for use as industrial biocatalysts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010736/1","grantId":"BB/N010736/1","fundValue":"93738","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Turner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
