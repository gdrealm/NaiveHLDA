{"id":"A898CC52-400E-4737-92EA-BC0C239E56A7","title":"Control of feline immunodeficiency virus infection - resubmission","abstractText":"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infects approximately 500 thousand domestic cats in the UK. Infected cats may develop numerous infections, tumours and display neurological signs. In our survey to find out what happened to infected cats, 53% died or were euthanased, 25% suffered recurrent episodes of illness and 22% remained healthy. To control FIV infection requires a safe, effective vaccine. However there are many obstacles to developing a vaccine, particularly because the virus continually changes its outer shell and thus hides from the immune system. Moreover, infected cats do not recover from infection; whereas influenza virus triggers an immune response that clears virus from the body, FIV infection persists. We aim to devise laboratory techniques that can determine whether an infected cat is likely to remain well for some years or whether it is more likely to become terminally ill and require euthanasia. This information will assist veterinarians and owners to manage each infected cat and will assist in the re-homing of infected animals. Our second aim is to determine why some virus isolates cause more serious disease than others. If we can identify the main characteristics of a strain of virus that are associated with disease in infected cats, we will be able to structure therapy and management more appropriately.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D008425/1","grantId":"BB/D008425/1","fundValue":"225411","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings have informed new avenues for vaccine development against feline immunodeficiency virus(FIV) and we are collaborating with a pharmaceutical company to develop an improved FIV vaccine Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Margaret Jane Hosie","coPersons":["Brian James Willett","Hayley Ann Haining"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" We demonstrated that feline immunodeficiency virus variants emerge that escape neutralisation and show altered receptor usage.
