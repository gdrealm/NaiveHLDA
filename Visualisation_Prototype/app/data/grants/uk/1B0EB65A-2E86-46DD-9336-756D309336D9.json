Despite this clinical significance, most of our knowledge of how cell motility is regulated stems from artificial assays that involve watching isolated cells migrate on 2 dimensional plastic substrates. While our ability to watch these cells move by creating high-resolution microscopic movies has been informative, it is likely that these 'in vitro' assays do not tell us the entire story. This proposal will increase our understanding of cell movement and begin to extrapolate what we have learned from watching isolated cells migrate on plastic, to physiologically relevant events. To address this issue, I have been using the fruitfly's (Drosophila Melanogaster) inflammatory response as a way to study cell motility. The fly contains a 'blood' cell, analogous to our white blood cells, that responds to wounds and infections in a similar manner to our inflammatory response. Aside from the clinical significance of directly studying the fly's inflammatory response, the movement of these cells can be imaged using high resolution microscopy live within the animal, which allows us to watch cells move in their natural environment. Along with the ability for high resolution imaging within the animal, the fly has further advantages. Drosophila has been a biological model system widely used for nearly 100 years due to its rapid generation time and genetic manipulability. It is therefore easier and much faster than more complex models, such as the mouse, to pinpoint a function to one's gene of interest. In the first objective of the proposal, I will further enhance this motility assay and develop novel tools that will allow me to live image the intracellular machinery important for cell movement. These tools, which will be extremely useful to the Drosophila research community, will allow me to expand the scope of this assay and examine the exact requirement of various candidate migration regulatory genes during cell movement. In the next objective, I will investigate the requirement of a gene that is thought important during the spread of cancer cells throughout the body. Fascin is a gene that is expressed in a number of cancers and is correlated with a poor clinical outcome. However, all of what we know about this gene during cell movement has come from the analysis of isolated cells. Fortunately, Drosophila blood cells express high levels of this gene and fly mutants exist. Therefore, using the fluorescent tools created in objective 1, I will dissect the requirement of fascin during the migration of macrophages by analyzing pre-existing fly lines that contain mutations in the fascin gene. Next, I will investigate the regulation of fascin activity within the cell during migration. How this gene is activated and deactivated during cell movement has also been widely studied in isolated cells and is thought to involve modification of critical regions within the protein. Mutations in the exact same region of Drosophila fascin will be created and analyzed within migrating Drosophila blood cells. In the final objective, I will undertake an approach that will allow for the identification of novel migration regulatory genes. During embryonic development of the fruitfly, blood cells undergo a number of changes where they transition between a non-migratory and a migratory cell type, which is analogous to the metastatic spreading of cancer cells. Using a technique called microarray analysis will allow me to compare all the genes that are expressed at each stage of blood cell development. The ability to compare the non-migratory to the migratory stage will elucidate the genes that may be regulating their motile potential. The role of candidate genes during cell movement can then be easily examined in this system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F020635/2","grantId":"BB/F020635/2","fundValue":"390513","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by a number of groups that are examining the regulation of migration in both a basic science and clinical context.

These tools are useful to other laboratories that also use this model, but will also be extrapolatable to other systems (we have had numerous requests for reagents that we have generated through this work).\n\nAn additional focus of this proposal was to examine the function and regulation of the actin regulatory gene fascin. This gene is highly correlated with metastatic cancers and work from this proposal has led to increased information regarding the role of fascin in the movement and dissemination of cancer cells. Indeed, we have extended our work in the fruitfly to the human protein , which unveiled novel regulatory mechanisms of this gene. Our work on Drosophila and human fascin has uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms of the protein that could be extrapolated to the clinic as fascin function is highly correlated with cancer cell motility.
