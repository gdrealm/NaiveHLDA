Differences in cell types (e.g. neurons as compared to muscle cells) arise because different parts of the genetic material are selectively read out. RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are a crucial part of the molecular machinery involved in this selective reading mechanism. To understand normal and pathological cellular conditions better we need to gain an improved insight of the molecular mechanisms underlying RNAP function. Such knowledge will result in more specifically targeted therapeutic applications, new diagnostic tools and help with the development of novel types of antibiotica","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501703","grantId":"G0501703","fundValue":"376266","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert O.J.
