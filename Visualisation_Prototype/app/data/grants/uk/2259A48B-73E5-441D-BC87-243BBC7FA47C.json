This project explores whether, and how, these Rising Powers change the 'rules of the game' and with what consequences. We focus on a key agenda in global trade relations - labour and social standards. Meeting such standards is increasingly important in the world of global production.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the growth of manufacturing firms and middle class consumers from the Rising Powers there is a fear of a 'race to the bottom' with declining labour standards and diminishing concerns with working conditions. this will be examined through research in Brazil, China, India, the UK and the EU. Using the analytical framework of global production networks, our international and multi-disciplinary research team will study:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how Rising Powers firms engage with labour and social standards in their globalised production arrangements</li>\n\n <li>how civil society in these countries shape local attitudes and norms on working conditions</li>\n\n <li>how Rising Power governments define and implement labour standards and interact in global institutions where such standards are formulated</li>\n\n <li>consider the implications for other developing countries, for firms and consumers in UK and the EU, and for the future governance of globalised production arrangements.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J013234/1","grantId":"ES/J013234/1","fundValue":"646163","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Khalid Mahmud Nadvi","coPersons":["Peter  Knorringa","Chris King-Chi  CHAN","Rudolf R Sinkovics","Keshab  Das"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
