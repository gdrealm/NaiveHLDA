{"id":"8FE1B44D-2D44-4591-8070-D4905F9B360C","title":"Intelligent Condition Monitoring for Civil Nuclear Structures","abstractText":"Building on its successful feasibility study, where a potential 25% time-saving for machine fault diagnosis was\ndemonstrated, the consortium aims to achieve Intelligent Condition Monitoring (ICM) for the civil nuclear industry. This\nproject will enable Beran and EDF Energy to extend health monitoring to a wider range of machinery, structures and new\ncivil nuclear plants.\nThe technology adopted is derived from a physical understanding of non-linearities arising from degradation of\ncomponents, utilising expertise in prognostic algorithms from the University of Bristol. The analysis tools will utilise methods\nalready used extensively in the aerospace and medical sector, which will be adapted for use within nuclear power plant\nsystems. Industry benefits include increased accuracy, reliability and safety, greater availability of plant through predictive\nmaintenance, improved operator intelligence, resulting in enhanced plant performance and reduced operating costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L504713/1","grantId":"EP/L504713/1","fundValue":"121087","fundStart":"2013-06-17","fundEnd":"2016-05-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Lieven","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
