A crucial feature of models applied in such settings is the constancy of their parameters despite the changes in the distributions of other variables. This property is called invariance. A failure of invariance renders a model useless for the policy analysis in question. Consequently, tests of invariance are a key requirement in model building. Despite considerable research to date, all existing tests need to be specially tailored to the situation. Moreover, most existing econometric models are linear, as it has proved difficult to develop tests for, and modelling of, general classes of non-linear functions relevant in economics, given the practical sample sizes available in macro-economics. In economic forecasting, itself a key ingredient of policy, non-linear functions are a two-edged sword: forecasts can go badly wrong if an incorrect functional relation has been estimated. We have invented a feasible class of tests that are not situation specific and can be automatically computed to test these fundamental aspects of model specification, and guide modelling thereof. The research aims to analyse their properties to ensure that their implications are a good guide to the underlying reality.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0061","grantId":"RES-062-23-0061","fundValue":"222387","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David Forbes Hendry","coPersons":["Jennifer Louise Castle"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
