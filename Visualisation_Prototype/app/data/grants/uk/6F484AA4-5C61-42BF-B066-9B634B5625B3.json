This topic is of great importance for China given the dominant role of capital accumulation in driving economic growth, technological progress and structural change. The proposed empirical research will be based on a relatively new and unexplored microeconomic dataset. Three specific research questions will be explored. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, is there evidence of investment misallocation owing to the inadequacy of the Chinese financial system? </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, is there evidence of 'overinvestment', thus threatening the Chinese economy? If so, which firms' characteristics are likely to be associated with this behaviour? </p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, is there evidence of rapid and dramatic structural changes in the industrial sector in China, with considerable divestment as well as heavy investment, and how can this be explained?</p>\n\n<p>Careful and thorough answers to these questions are expected to provide insights into the determinants and patterns of investment of Chinese firms, and to inform current debate on various types of risks and policy challenges stemming from China's remarkably high investment.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G02071X/1","grantId":"ES/G02071X/1","fundValue":"72900","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sai  Ding","coPersons":["Alessandra  Guariglia"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
