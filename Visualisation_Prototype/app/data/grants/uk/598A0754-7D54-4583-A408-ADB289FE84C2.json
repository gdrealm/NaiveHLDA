{"id":"598A0754-7D54-4583-A408-ADB289FE84C2","title":"REsearch on Changes of Variability and Environmental Risk (RECoVER)","abstractText":"This project aims to develop, and to provide a range of mechanisms to support interdisciplinary collaborations that use and develop new mathematics for understanding climate variability and impact on resilience. Focusing on three scientific themes the project will nurture connections between mathematicians, statisticians, environmental scientists, policy makers and end users working in impact areas to help to identify high-risk and high-return research that will develop collaborations in the areas of the themes. \nWe will do this by a range of tools, including a series of managed events (workshops, sandpits, study groups and e-seminars) that will focus on specific problems to end users as well as promoting novel collaborations in the areas of scientific focus. We will provide a mechanism to solicit, evaluate and fund proposals for feasibility studies that work across this area. This will be informed by an expert panel of researchers as well as an advisory panel taken from national and international groups and end-users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M008495/1","grantId":"EP/M008495/1","fundValue":"510723","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Ashwin","coPersons":["Timothy Michael Lenton"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
