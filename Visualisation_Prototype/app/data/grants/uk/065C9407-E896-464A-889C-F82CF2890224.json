As images of crime, harm and punishment proliferate across new and old media there is a growing recognition that criminology needs to rethink its relations with the power of spectacle. In this seminar series we propose a focussed exploration of the role played by these images in reframing criminological inquiry, which will significantly advance thinking on the topic in and beyond the discipline.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars aim to consolidate, systematise and further explore an emerging field of inquiry, ie 'visual criminology' by focussing on a number of interconnected themes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>‘The Image, Accused' and ‘The Image, Accusing'</li>\n\n <li>'Images of Criminal Space' and 'The Movement of Deviant Images'</li>\n\n <li>'Images Explaining Crime' and 'The Criminal Image Explained'</li>\n\n <li>‘The Uses of the Image in Crime Control and Criminal Justice’</li>\n\n <li>‘Images of Crime Control and Criminal Justice’.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J022381/1","grantId":"ES/J022381/1","fundValue":"18081","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronnie  Lippens","coPersons":["Anthony Thomas Kearon","Yvonne  Jewkes","Eamonn  Carrabine","Chris  Greer"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
