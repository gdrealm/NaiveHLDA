{"id":"6698C0A2-2990-4B17-9FCF-518356CDC704","title":"Developing bilingual learning strategies in mainstream and community contexts","abstractText":"<p>This project will explore ways of facilitating childrenâ€™s bilingual learning in order to raise educational achievement. Bilingual children have the potential to draw on conceptual and linguistic knowledge from more than one language to accomplish a task. Research suggests that these multiple resources can enhance understanding, but the process of bilingual learning requires further investigation. This study will look particularly at the following aspects: conceptual transfer, translation and interpretation, linking new material to familiar worlds, and increasing knowledge about how language works.</p> \n<p>The project will examine bilingual learning strategies used by children at Key Stages 1 and 2 in Tower Hamlets primary schools participating in the EAL Pilot of the Primary National Strategy. Twelve children will be videorecorded undertaking activities in language and mathematics in their primary school classes, using Sylheti/Bengali and English. The children will also be observed doing tasks bilingually in their after-school Bengali community language classes. </p> \n<p>Children will be asked to view the videorecordings and comment on strategies they found useful. Mainstream and community teachers and bilingual assistants will be brought together in joint seminars to examine the data and reflect on how children are learning bilingually. Their ideas will be combined with analysis by the research team, to identify how strategies could be refined and extended. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1528","grantId":"RES-000-22-1528","fundValue":"44491","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charmian  Kenner","coPersons":["Eve  Gregory"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
