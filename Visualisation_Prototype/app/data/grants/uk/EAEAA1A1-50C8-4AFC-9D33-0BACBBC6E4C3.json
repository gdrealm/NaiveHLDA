He hasmade seminal contributions to the semantics of programming languages (bothdenotational and operational), he conceived the idea of a logical framework anddeveloped the first example of one, and he has made other important contributions incomputational learning theory, theorem proving, and recently systems biology.In September 2006, Gordon Plotkin celebrates his 60th birthday. To mark the event,a symposium in his honour will be held in Edinburgh. This research proposal seeksEPSRC support for the scientific aspects of the symposium.We request: 1. Funding for two overseas invited speakers (Professor Dana Scott andProfessor Eugenio Moggi).2. Support for attendance by 16 UK-based PhD students.3.

The talks were on ongoing research. The grant funded PhD-student participation, and some invited speakers. The Symposium was a lively and well-attended meeting with attendees spanning all levels of research from PhD students to leading international researchers, including participants and speakers from the United States and many European countries. Its scientific focus in the context of celebration and appreciation of a leading British computer scientist provided an invigorating stir to the research communities involved.
