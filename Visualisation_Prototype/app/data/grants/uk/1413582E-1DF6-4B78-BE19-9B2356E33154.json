Science uses them to predict and analyse how greenhouse gases such carbon dioxide influence climate systems. For members of the general public, understanding of these specialist images can be difficult, as they require specific knowledge of the functioning of ecological systems, underpinning maths and the graphical conventions used to represent phenomena. This proposed research network brings together a dozen researchers in science and art and design from the British Antarctic Survey, Universities of Westminster, Cambridge and Melbourne, industry specialists and public art platforms to find ways of representing this climate data through the production of art and design works. Despite the importance of Climate Models as contemporary visual forms, very little research that combines artistic and scientific research has previously been attempted that seeks make this material more publicly accessible and understandable. \\n\\nThe network provides a unique opportunity to do this by running a series of hands-on practical workshops and seminars in which art and design artifacts will be produced and the theoretical and public implications of research discussed over a 12-month period. These events culminate in a public exhibition and discussion of produced art works. Through these activities the network aims to:\\n\\n- Bring art approaches into scientific research processes in order to enhance understanding of how art and design methods can help scientists produce more comprehensible images and animations of climate data. \\n\\n- Gain understanding of how scientific Climate Models can be used as art media to inform digital arts practices concerned with producing art and design projects exploring the changing environment.\\n\\n- Explore how Climate Models can function as expressive visual, narrative representations of environmental change beyond their original scientific purpose. \\n\\n- Develop methods for exhibiting this work in ways that enable public access to it.\\n\\n- Connect art and science, theory and practice to share expertise, and develop ideas and methods. \\n\\nAt completion a number of objectives will have been reached including: the construction and public exhibition of prototype artworks derived from climate data, the development of interdisciplinary methodologies that integrate scientific and art and design practices; academic papers detailing the methodological and theoretical insights produced by the network and a further substantial funding bid building on research leads. Lastly the network aggregates a substantial amount of multidisciplinary expertise that has the potential to act as an intellectual focus for further art-science collaborations in the field. \\n\\nResearch is expected to be of interest to a range of audiences including Art and Design scholars/practitioners, science, media, geography and other academics. Additionally research is expected to benefit public art institutions, science and outreach organizations interested in environmental change, curators and journalists working in the creative industries; members of the public interested in the arts and science and government and policy groups.\\n\\nTom Corby an artist from the University of Westminster and Nathan Cunningham, a data scientist from the British Antarctic Survey, manage the network, design workshop and seminar materials, and plan dissemination activities in conjunction with a part-time administrator. A steering group that includes Corby and Cunningham will meet during the course of the project to ensure the smooth running of the project and delivery of aims and objectives.\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039198/1","grantId":"AH/H039198/1","fundValue":"24446","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Data Landscapes project led to a number of digital artworks cumulatively called The Southern Ocean Studies; a series of hand-rendered watercolours derived from the geo-data of climate science; 2 peer-reviewed papers, 1 book chapter and 5 conferences and symposia. I was also selected to participate in the AHRC symposium on climate change and the humanities at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and the Centre for Contemporary Studies in Bangalore.\n\nThe main project outcome was a large-scale, real-time animated digital installation (also called The Southern Ocean Studies), derived from climate model data. As a development from Cyclone.soc, the project produces modes of representing environment with a highly patterned sensibility; a poetics that reveals site not as a spatial/temporal continuum but a configuration of systems in constant motion. This poetics derives much of its sensibility from the sensation of ‘presence’ or ‘liveness’ that is expressed when the work configures its data as an expression of the interconnected systems referred to in the original data which was supplied from climate model outputs contributed by the British Antarctic Survey. \n\n\nAndrew Brown includes the project in a major overview of contemporary practice Art and Ecology Now, (Thames &amp;amp;amp; Hudson, 2014) introducing the featured artists as ‘operating at the vanguard of art practice’ (p.8). For Brown the Southern Ocean Studies in particular highlights the importance of the public communication of climate science, but emphasises the innovation developed through using climate data and models towards an experiential form that also enables critical reflection:\n\nWhile The Southern Ocean Studies thus simplifies the natural processes at play in the Antarctic waters, rendering them in a direct and accessible form that can be easily read, it also complicates our reading by demonstrating how the same processes are layered and connected to each other. Rather than isolating any of them for investigation, the projection reveals how these forces of nature together form a complex ecosystem of cause and effect. (p.130, 2014)\n\nThe Southern Ocean Studies was exhibited in 7 countries, was nominated for prizes at the Digital Language section of the File Prix Lux, Sao Paulo in 2011, and for an award at Screengrab New Media Arts Festival at eMerge Media Space, Australia in 2010.

In doing so it produces models of art practice that extend and transform scientific knowledge (and data) as affective and critical experience in an arts setting.\n\nThis use of data was explored further in a peer-reviewed paper published at the New Media Caucus in Chicago (2010) which argues for hybrid approaches to the use of data through art practice. This argument was developed further in ‘Systemness: Towards a Data Aesthetics of Climate Change’ published in the monograph Far Field: Digital Culture, Climate Change and the Poles (Bristol: Intellect Press, 2011). These publications contextualised practice in broader critical and aesthetic domains, and paved the way for further research into the potential of data as an artistic medium. Research has already been taken forward into two AHRC funded projects (AH/E503667/1 and AH/M002322/1).\n\nThe subsequently funded DataArt@BBC Backstage (2009-12) explored how experimental practices originating in the digital arts could be applied toward data held by public institutions to produce novel forms of public engagement to produce more than a dozen interactive data visualizations of BBC and other current affairs data that was released via a public website. Selected projects were also published as open source software expanding ways for audiences to engage with the work. \n\nFollowing on from this project, I applied for further ARHC funding to investigate the potential of ‘data documentary’ and was successful with 3 separate applications. In early 2014 I was awarded an AHRC/British Council Fellowship at the National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad, India. \n\nAn additional AHRC grant was achieved this year (Digital Realism: Visualizing the Social Through Digital Art Practice) to collaborate with the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, specifically to explore the documentary potential of big data. The aim of the project is twofold: i) to foreground the experiential and interpretive potential of big data through digital art practices (visualizations, images etc.) ii) to question how coverage of certain types and groups of user presents a problem of representation in big data.
