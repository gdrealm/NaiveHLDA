{"id":"DCB06100-9528-47AF-913C-4F5E661178B2","title":"Sincerity: On Victorian Poetry, Literary Method, and Trust","abstractText":"My research charts the evolution of Victorian ideas about sincerity in relation to Victorian poetry and criticism, and focuses on the work of six poets central to the period (Tennyson, Browning, Clough, Arnold, C. G. Rossetti, and Hopkins). It explores the emphasis placed by a range of Victorian writers on the method of expression, and assesses what a better understanding of that emphasis on method has to teach us about how to conceive of sincerity. Possible etymologies for the word 'sincere' were subject to energetic speculation during the Victorian period, and the possible roots that philologists came up with prove revealing of the kinds of literary questions and cultural concerns that sincerity raises for the Victorians. My work will examine both this shifting etymology and the literary methods that, alongside such philological endeavours, Victorian writers developed through their preoccupation with sincerity, in order to show what those methods are and how and why they evolve within Victorian poetry and criticism in particular. By attending to the formal details and vocal register of Victorian poets' and critics' writing, my work will analyse the ways in which these authors' transform earlier ideas about sincerity through a range of creative linguistic forms and cultural and critical debates. It will also explain the significant bearing that such literary methods have on our ideas of sincerity today.\\n\\nThe period of AHRC research leave would be used to complete a monograph entitled 'Sincerity: On Victorian Poetry, Literary Method, and Trust'. This would require writing up two out of five chapters, and a conclusion:\\n\\nChapter 2: 'A Metaphor's Metaphor: Browning' (12,000)\\nChapter 4: 'Arnoldian Correspondence' (12,000)\\nCoda: 'You must not be frightened by words...' (5,000)\\n\\nPrior to this, in a period of research leave awarded by the University of Bristol, I will have written the introduction and the other three chapters (1: 'Tennyson's Promise', 3: 'Clough's Particular Forms of Sincerity', and 5: 'Hopkins, Rossetti, and Original Sincerity'), plus two related publications ('Hopkins's Original Sincerity' and 'Vowing insincerity in Tennyson's Idylls of the King'), while another article will be with readers ('Knowing Words: Matthew Arnold and Literary Knowledge'). This last article, and a paper I have been invited to give (in Cambridge, on Browning), will provide interim feedback and constitute drafts for the chapters listed above, thus leading to the successful completion of the monograph within the period of research leave. Further outputs related to the monograph during this period include a book chapter on Arnold and a paper on Rossetti.\\n\\nCollaborative projects to grow out of this work in the future include a proposed guest-edited issue of Victorian Poetry, published by University of Virginia Press (on Matthew Arnold's work), and an international conference on 'Browning's Manner', planned for the bicentenary of his birth in 2012, which would further result in a volume of collected essays.\\n\\nThe monograph will contribute primarily to knowledge of the aesthetic and affective workings of Victorian poems, to recent discussions of poetic form in the field, and to our understanding of the history of sincerity and its relation to literary language, interest in which last has undergone a renewal in the early years of the twenty-first century. It will additionally be of value to scholarly, postgraduate, and undergraduate audiences working across a number of interconnected fields, including Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist literature, history of ideas, cultural history, poetry, poetics, criticism, reader response theory, philosophy, and aesthetics.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H006435/1","grantId":"AH/H006435/1","fundValue":"23379","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
