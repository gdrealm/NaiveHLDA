Vascular networks subsequently invade the embryonic forebrain as newly born neurons migrate to form the six layers that will comprise the adult cerebral cortex. While it was previously believed that blood vessels only have a supportive role during development, it is now widely accepted that they provide instructive signals to regulate the generation and migration of cortical neurons. More recently, defective blood vessel development has been suggested to contribute to cortical pathologies of neurodevelopmental origin. We have found that blood vessels secrete Reelin, a protein which has a crucial role in the formation and connectivity of the rodent and human cerebral cortex, and which has also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. While Reelin has been detected in human and rodent blood plasma, little is known about its significance and function in the formation of the cerebral cortex. Here, we propose to use genetic strategies in mice to remove Reelin specifically from blood vessels and analyse how the formation of the cerebral cortex is affected. Further, we will use mouse models in a strategy aimed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which blood vessels secrete Reelin and communicate with neurons in the developing brain. Thus, the proposed research programme will explore novel mechanisms that underlie the secretion of a key molecule, Reelin, by blood vessels and the communication between vasculature and neurons during the formation of the cerebral cortex. This work is likely to enhance our understanding of the aetiologies of developmental disorders of this area of the brain such as schizophrenia and autism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N002105/1","grantId":"BB/N002105/1","fundValue":"476267","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John George Parnavelas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
