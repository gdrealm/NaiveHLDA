Originally, that project did not include Northern Ireland, as the debate was not a 'live' one at the time. Since that grant was completed, the public need for an internationally and legally informed contribution on the relationship between amnesties, non-prosecution and dealing with the past in Northern Ireland has become increasingly apparent. Together with the partner organisation, Healing Through Remembering, this proposal seeks to address that gap.\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe overall aim of this 12-month project is to facilitate a process of knowledge exchange between the academic team, the project partner and key local actors on the role of amnesties and prosecution in dealing with the past in Northern Ireland. To achieve this aim, the project objectives are:\n1. To engage in a process of gradual knowledge exchange through a carefully sequenced pattern of engagement with key local actors, including victims, former Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, security force members, politicians and civil servants, and civil society representatives. This engagement will move from a series of private briefings for key constituencies during months 1-3; to a series of invite-only roundtables in months 4-8 that will explore themes identified on the basis of the Beyond Legalism project research; to a public conference at which local and international scholars and practitioners will explore the project themes in month 11.\n2. To disseminate the Beyond Legalism findings and inform public debate through strategic interaction with print, broadcast and online media, and the creation of a project website.\n3. To reflect upon and disseminate the knowledge produced in a project report and a fully theorised academic article (which will focus explicitly on this style of knowledge transfer).\n4. To work with our project partner to enhance the organisation's technical capacity.\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS\nThis project will benefit a range of non-academic audiences. Within Northern Ireland, beneficiaries will include the project partner, other local civil society organisations, relevant government departments, policing organisations (PSNI, HET and Police Ombudsman), human rights groups and legal institutions (especially Public Prosecution Service). These groups will benefit from the private briefings, invite-only roundtables, and public conference. For NGOs, this engagement will again enhance their knowledge of the international legal framework concerning amnesties and of how other jurisdictions have grappled with these challenges. For governmental actors, the project will contribute to greater evidence-based policymaking and, potentially, impact on the operational and organisational culture of relevant institutions. For all local users, the project will create a space for informed and debate on highly sensitive topic.\nElsewhere, the project will benefit policymakers within the United Kingdom, Ireland, and internationally who work on transitional justice. The proposed programme of knowledge exchange and dissemination will provide a transferrable methodology and will contribute to evidence-based policymaking among international actors, and raise international awareness of the complexities of balancing immunity, truth and prosecutions.\nThe project will also be of interest to academics working in the fields of political science, criminology, international relations, anthropology, sociology, peace studies and conflict transformation. The project will develop and refine the theoretical contributions of the Beyond Legalism project and will propose a methodology designed to address critiques of international comparative work as rarely offering tangible benefits for the local community","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013897/1","grantId":"AH/J013897/1","fundValue":"95999","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2014-11-11","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This was a project designed to provide technical information on the intersection between amnesties, prosecutions and the public interest in dealing with the past in Northern Ireland to interested parties in Northern Ireland. The project was conducted in partnership with a local NGO - Healing Through Remembering (HTR). It was originally envisaged that it would involve a series of bilateral briefings with victims groups, ex-prisoners, and others in civil society, three round tables, 1 conference, a series of blogs and a project report. As is detailed below, due to the widespread political and civic society interest in the project (not least because it coincided with intense political negotiations on a range of matters including dealing with the past), the project far exceeded its original intentions. \n\nThe project briefed all of the political parties involved in the negotiations as well as, producing papers and blogs on topics as requested by civil society groups. One project report was envisage in the original proposal, in fact five were produced. One of these, a submission document from the project PI and senior CI on the highly controversial issue of trading truth recovery for immunity from prosecution was adopted by the parties and is contained in the final draft agreement. Although the agreement was ultimately rejected by the two principal Unionist parties (not on this issue), negotiations have recommenced in the autumn of 2014. \n\nIn addition to the project conference in the original proposal, the team developed a partnership with the Commission for Victims and Survivors in Northern Ireland (the statutory organisation tasked with looking after the interests of victims) and together with HTR organised two further major conferences. \n\nThree Roundtables were proposed in the original proposal. In fact, the team organised and took part in ten such events, including five with former IRA prisoners in different venues in Northern Ireland, three with former loyalist prisoners, one with former RUC Special Branch and CID officers, and another involving representatives from 56 different victim organisations. \n\nThe project also had an extremely high media profile, producing a range of op-eds and feature articles in print media in Northern Ireland and the Republic, almost a dozen radio and television interviews (including the lead story on Radio 4 PM with Eddie Mair). The models submitted to the negotiations by the PI and senior CI were featured in a front page exclusive, two page inside spread and editorial in Northern Ireland leading newspaper 'The Belfast Telegraph', including the model ultimately adopted by the negotiators. Towards the end of first year of the project the Post-Doctoral Research Fellow secured a permanent lectureship. The team decided to use the salary saving to employ one of Ireland's most respected journalists (Susan McKay) as a consultant. Ms McKay wrote a number of feature articles in print media outlets (the Guardian, Irish Times and Irish Independent) on themes related to the project, as well as making a number of TV appearances. Ms McKay also provided assistance in editing the project reports to make them as 'user-friendly' as possible and chairing a number of the project outreach events. \n\nThe project website was extremely popular. For example, between April 2013 and September 2014 it received a total of 130,806 hits involving 7,456 unique users and a total of 19,466 visits. Most of users came from the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland), but the website also had considerable traffic from the Republic of Ireland, the United States, France, Australia and Canada.

Complex political negotiations on sensitive matters need the assistance of technical academic experts capable of producing such information in accurate but accessible formats. Academics can reach a diverse audience, particularly if working in partnership with respected civil society interlocutors. On the specific subject matter of this project (dealing with the past), we have made clear that such efforts must be lawful; bespoke in terms of the local political and social conditions; must involve mechanisms designed to achieve truth recovery, acknowledgement, apologiesand reparations for victims.
