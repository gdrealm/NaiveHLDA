{"id":"B1F0CB71-B2FC-4AE8-85D5-AA52E44EAA2F","title":"Discipline Hopping - Catalytic Organic Synthesis in Sub-, Near- and Super-critical Water","abstractText":"This Proposal aims to advance both the engineering and the chemistry of reactions in high temperature and high pressure water (scW). It is builds on the current expertise of the applicants in water based chemical reactions and continuous reactions operating at high temperatures and pressures. Bath has a solid background in the development of enantiopure ligands, catalyst supports and catalytic organic synthesis whilst Nottingham has a reactor that that can control pressure and temperatures inside the reactor as well as present the optimised method of mixing for two different fluids at variable temperatures. This collaboration presents an exciting new opportunity to open up the whole area of chemistry in high temperature, high pressure water and provides a springboard for us to develop a more fundamental understanding of how these processes can be controlled. We seek funding for travel, consumables and replacement teaching costs. In summary, the Project will act as a road map for synthesis in sub-critical, near critical and supercritical Water.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D500982/1","grantId":"EP/D500982/1","fundValue":"54017","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Lester","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" There is plenty of scope for taking bench scale multi-stage batch reactions done by organic chemists and converting them to continuous scale, using cleaner solvents.
