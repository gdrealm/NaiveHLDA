The ESRC funds were used to fund seminars at which existing academic studies were discussed and placed into the practitioner context.</p>\n\n<p>Further seminars were focussed on particular practitioner issues and resulted in the establishment of closer links and understanding between academic researchers and emergency planners and responders. A major international conference was run as the last seminar which opened the membership of the seminar as well as shared research findings from a much broader range of perspectives and research traditions. Additionally, a world expert (Professor Bill Starbuck) was brought from the USA to explore the central problem of uncertainty and risk in crisis response.</p>\n\n<p>The outcome was a well developed inter-disciplinary network which has already been successful in collaborating on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>securing three funded projects and developing two additional proposals</li>\n\n <li>making a proposal to the International Standards Organisation between members of the seminar</li>\n\n <li>members being invited to be keynote speakers as a result of the contacts made. </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0546","grantId":"RES-451-26-0546","fundValue":"18410","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Duncan  Shaw","coPersons":["Patrick  Tissington"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
