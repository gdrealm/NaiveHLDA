{"id":"006B26C9-9698-4D00-A813-15DCA338F1EC","title":"The virtual seed (vSEED)","abstractText":"The aim of the vSEED project is to provide a dynamic mathematical description of seed dormancy, after-ripening and germination focussing on the key seed compartments the radicle and endosperm. This interdisciplinary project will analyse the comparative biology of the closely related Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis thaliana and Lepidium sativum, using engineering, imaging, modelling and post-genomics approaches to develop a virtual germinating seed. We propose that germination is an ideal exemplary subject for the integration of new technologies and for developing molecular plant biomechanics in conjunction with dynamic mathematical modelling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G024898/1","grantId":"BB/G024898/1","fundValue":"303782","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2012-08-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Understanding of the modulation of cell wall structures in a specific process - seed germination will have implications for understanding of cell walls/plant biomass in general.

The focus was on the cell wall structures and cell wall remodelling that are important for seed germination. \n\n\n\nAn important discovery was that the cell walls of endosperm cells varied between the three species. The arabidopsis and L. sativum endosperm cell walls are similar and cellulose-, xyloglucan- and arabinan-rich and do not display any spatial heterogeneity. In contrast, tobacco endosperm cell walls are mannan-rich and cellulose-poor and have a tissue level heterogeneity relating to the micropylar region. This has implications for understanding the hormonal and genetic networks that underpin endosperm cell wall remodelling and germination in the three species. Work was published in the journal Plant Physiology in 2012 and also in subsequent publications Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
