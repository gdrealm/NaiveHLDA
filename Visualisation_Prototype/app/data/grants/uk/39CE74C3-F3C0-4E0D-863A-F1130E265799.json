Discourses of German Wartime Suffering' (2005-2008). In that project, Taberner and Cooke established a more nuanced narrative of the German experience of confronting the Holocaust since 1945 than had previously been available in the scholarly literature. We identified a dialectic between Germans' desire -- varying in intensity over the decades -- to repress the past and Germans' efforts to face up to the crimes that had been committed in their name, and we evidenced the way in which German debates on German wartime suffering (the bombing of German cities, the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe, the mass rapes of German women, etc.) were never distinct from debates on the country's historical responsibility for the Holocaust but were always implicit within them, and vice versa. Further to this, we traced the way in which the German confrontation with the Holocaust has in recent years come to be seen as a model for how other nations, globally, can confront other dark pasts, for example, slavery, colonialism, apartheid, recent genocidal massacres such as Rwanda in 1994, and dictatorship in South America. We discovered that the German experience of confronting the Holocaust is 'usable' in these contexts precisely because it (often even ambivalently) provokes reflection on issues of 'owning up to the past', apology, reparation, restitution, and the difficult balance to be struck between understanding and condemnation.\n\nOur follow-on impact project aims to use stimulus materials drawn from the original research -- historical images of key moments when Germans were forced to confront the crimes committed in their name, and original films -- as the basis for a series of four workshops with a writer (Anthony Haddon, of the Theatre Company Blah Blah Blah), the director and dance tutor at RJC Dance (the leading Black dance organisation in the North of England), and RJC's young dancers, who mostly come from a Black background. Following this period of knowledge exchange in December 2015 and January 2016, we will work with the writer, director and dance tutor to co-produce a dance performance for the RJC's Youth Division. The performance will translate the historical images and films used as stimulus materials -- and the issues of confrontation with the past, silence and denial, acceptance and reparation that the images reveal -- into a dance performance. This dance performance will be rehearsed over three months from January 2015 to April 2016. It will then be staged at the University of Leeds in late April at two twilight performances for students and pupils from local schools, with a third performance at The UK National Holocaust Centre. Two student interns from the University of Leeds will also be involved in the workshops, creative process, and performances, and highlights of our engagement with partners and of the performances will be filmed. In May 2016, the final month of the project, a post-production workshop will take place and a short film will be edited and released as a record of the different interactions and engagements that have taken place.\n\nOur aims are: 1) to engage new audiences, and young Black people in particular, with the Holocaust and the German experience of confronting the Holocaust; 2) to produce an original piece of dance performance based on our research and our collaboration with a Black dance organisation; 3) to encourage Black audiences -- but also other diverse audiences at the University of Leeds performances and at the UK National Holocaust Centre -- to reflect on the relevance of the German experience of confronting the Holocaust for other forms of prejudice; 4) to record our work, to provide researchers, educationalists and teachers, and interested organisations with a model that can be developed further.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003195/1","grantId":"AH/N003195/1","fundValue":"23629","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart James Taberner","coPersons":["Paul  Cooke"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
