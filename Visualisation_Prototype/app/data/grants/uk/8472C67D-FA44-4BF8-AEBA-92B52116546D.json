The incorporation of soluble redox mediators is one of the most promising approaches to develop lithium-oxygen batteries that can reach their full potential. Redox mediators can not only enhance the kinetics of the reactions but also overcome key issues such as electrode passivation, electrolyte degradation and electrode corrosion. This project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the role of soluble redox mediators in lithium-oxygen batteries that will found the basis for the rational battery development. Enhancement in battery performance will also be sought by exploiting the synergistic effect between the redox mediator in solution and the composition and structure of the solid electrode.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M02041X/1","grantId":"EP/M02041X/1","fundValue":"98603","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nuria  Garcia-Araez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
