We will investigate a possible new method for mitigating this difficult problem, through the use of the language-theoretic notion of cover . The method we aim to develop should have general applicability, but we intend to target in particular models obtained using game-semantic techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010180/1","grantId":"EP/E010180/1","fundValue":"5403","fundStart":"2006-08-09","fundEnd":"2006-09-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dan R Ghica","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Our findings were negative: language covers cannot be used to improve the efficiency of model checkers, as far as we could see.
