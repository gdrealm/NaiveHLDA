Intelligibility is often a major problem for many children. Communication difficulties can make friendship formation difficult and impede both educational progress and social inclusion; overall quality of life may also be adversely affected. \n\nEPG is a technique based on a customised dental palate with 62 tiny implanted electrodes. These record the timing and location of tongue contact with the roof of the mouth during speech. This information is displayed ‘live‘ on a computer screen, allowing the child to ‘see’ where his or her tongue is when trying to say a given word and to correct any errors being made. \n\nThis research aims to pinpoint the precise nature of differences in speech in children with Down’s syndrome and will evaluate the potential role of EPG-based therapy in reducing their articulation difficulties. Findings will be relevant to speech and language therapy provision, as well as contributing more generally to theories of speech-motor planning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401388","grantId":"G0401388","fundValue":"347938","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William John  Hardcastle","coPersons":["Jennifer Grant Wishart","Sara Elizabeth Wood"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
