However, only recently true public engagement and education initiatives aimed at communities beyond the academic sphere have been addressed in the development of digital Classics applications. \nThe use of animation to visually render famous mythological scenes and bring to life paintings on ancient vases for use in the classroom has been implemented with some success. But while animating well known stories with defined plot lines can have a didactic effect, it raises a larger question about the potential relationship between animation and the study of the ancient world in general. Can the artistry of animation be integrated with ancient manuscript studies to resurrect performative voices preserved only in fragmented papyri? \nWe now propose to bring together papyrologists from the University of Oxford and a team from Acme Filmworks, an Academy Award winning animation studio based in Los Angeles, to reconstruct the broken scene from a Greek Mime preserved in P.Oxy. 5189, a fragmentary papyrus from VI century Egypt. We aim to incorporate scholarly concerns and practice in the methodology of animation production and produce an animated short film that has synchronic and diachronic cultural impact in the context of human joking and staged play. \nThe idea underwriting the project is that the practice-based art of animation can help scholars of ancient manuscripts not only reconstruct fragmented performances for further study and teaching, but also produce an artistic creation that invokes a larger human experience. In the case of P.Oxy. 5189, the aim is also to resurrect a genre that, although wide-spread in the Greco-Roman world, as a popular form entertainment did not make it into the familiar channels of the mediaeval transmission (a process in which selected authors were copied by scribes and scholars). Mime does not only lack the scholarly attention bestowed on Greek Tragedy and Comedy, but also any artistic reception on the modern stage. The fragmentary condition of the extant mimes is certainly an obstacle to such an enterprise, but their supposedly 'low' literary value may also have something to do with the comparatively scarce attention. And yet in their lower literary pretenses these works suggest a strong focus on the performative aspect more than on the text itself, which makes them far more indicative of ancient approaches to actual performance than, for example, a play of Sophocles that was transmitted as a piece of literature to be read instead of acted. \nIn P.Oxy. 5189 we find a moment of slapstick physical comedy and joking in the form not of a script, but of a narration and description of the staged action, with quotations of the words to be uttered and indications of entrances and exits. Due to the fragmented nature of the text, the literal holes in the papyrus and the fact that only fifty-nine broken lines are preserved, targeted philological work is required to isolate and define the characters, their movements, what text belongs to narration, and what actually constitutes spoken lines. But even once scholars produce that data and set the scene, the result is very much incomplete. This was never a text to be read, it was meant to be acted. \nAnimation, as an art form embracing digital technology and the practice-based skill sets of drawing and staging, is an ideal artistic medium to not only complete the scholarly reconstruction of the text, but also to input its own creative talents and produce a work of art capable of visually informing, teaching, and inspiring non-academic communities. And since we have only a small number of broken lines, the genre of the animated short film, a three to five minute product, is best suited for the task.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M010031/1","grantId":"AH/M010031/1","fundValue":"39725","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Dirk  Obbink","coPersons":["James  Brusuelas"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
