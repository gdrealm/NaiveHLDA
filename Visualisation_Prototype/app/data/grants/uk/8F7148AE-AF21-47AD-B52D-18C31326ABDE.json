This research will address issues of memory and myths of place amongst those who have left the city. It brings together a new body of work on nostalgia and memory with the study of counter-urbanisation and the use of city space. Drawing on interviews and mental mapping techniques this research project will investigate how memory and nostalgia shape both the representation of the city and the way it is accessed and used by ex-residents. In summary the research aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To investigate how memories and forms of nostalgia shape attitudes to and geographical use of the city amongst long-term ex-residents of Tyneside now living along the Tyne valley.</li>\n\n <li>To investigate the social differentiation of the relationship between memory and geographical imagination and spatial use in terms of class, age and gender.</li>\n\n <li>To collate an archive of audio oral histories on the theme of memories of place and migration for deposit in the Regional Resource Centre at Beamish Museum.</li>\n\n <li>To engage and draw together current debates on nostalgia, loss, and memory with those on mobility, migration and counter-urbanisation.<br /></li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3833","grantId":"RES-000-22-3833","fundValue":"70068","fundStart":"2010-01-25","fundEnd":"2011-01-24","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research tied two emerging themes (nostalgia and migrant experience) together, offering a new, more integrated and sympathetic understanding of the 'memory work' and attachment to memories of place that so many people share in a highly mobile society. The research team have written one academic journal article, one book chapter and one book , that will provide an interview and mental mapping led study of the way memory and loss shape representations of the city (identified in B below). These academic papers demonstrate: \n1. that ex-residents' nostalgia for the city shapes how they use the city today; \n2. that ex-residents' memories of the city are active and forward-looking (that they employ nostalgia to structure their ideas about how the city should be changed and develop in the future).

Contrary to the image of ex-residents of the city as 'escapees', whose nostalgia for the city reflects only detachment and alienation, the research found that interviewee's sense of loss and yearning also produces active attachment and engagement with the city; \n2. The research found that state conservationism is feeding into this active nostalgia, personal and state nostalgia being intertwined (a point that contrasts with a recent focus in memory studies on 'counter memory' vs. state sanctioned nostalgia); \n3. The research found that nostalgia shapes the way the city is used by ex-residents, guiding their destinations and shaping the routes they take through the city; \n4. Methodologically, the research has shown the productive nature of mental maps that overlay the past and present (interviewees' mental maps overlay past memories onto present uses of the city). \n\n1.
