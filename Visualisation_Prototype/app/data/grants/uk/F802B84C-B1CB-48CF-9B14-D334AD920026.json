{"id":"F802B84C-B1CB-48CF-9B14-D334AD920026","title":"Parametric Artificial Phase Conjugation Media With Automatic Evanescent Wave Amplification Properties","abstractText":"We wish to analyze the EM scattering of the field produced by an incident plane wave then by an electric line source suspended above a double periodic infinite wire array with nonlinear inclusions in the presence of a pumping signal. In doing so we permit the possibility for phase conjugation of the transmitted signal as well as concurrent automatic proportional amplification control of the evanescent modes presented to the array. This investigation would permit the possibility of the construction of an ultra-thin lens with perfect or near perfect focusing capability and in refined methods for the creation of self-tracking antenna arrays. In addition the conditions under which the energy normally lost to specular reflection can be converted into energy in the phase conjugated signal, as well as the conditions for energy loss due to grating lobe formation under harmonic pumping conditions will be investigated. The proposed architectures represent a new class of phase conjugating artificial electromagnetic materials with potential for application in advanced microwave and millimeter wave systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D045835/1","grantId":"EP/D045835/1","fundValue":"208840","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  Fusco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" This project allowed a number of significant breakthroughs in the area of active nonlinear artifical electromagnetic surfaces which are capable of providing phase conjugation. Major advances in the underpinning theory design and experimental characterisation of these structures lead to very innovative and novel structures for subwavelength imagaing into the near and far field. The work lead to several technical solutions in the imaging domain, medical, security where increased resolution and resilience to loss are important.
