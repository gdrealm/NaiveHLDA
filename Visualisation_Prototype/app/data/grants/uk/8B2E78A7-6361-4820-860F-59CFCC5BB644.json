However, there are conditions such as in cardiac surgery or the treatment of a heart attack where these same mitochondria can become killers, initiating irreversible damage to the heart. Calcium and ?reactive oxygen? (ROS) play critical roles in the bad functions of mitochondria but calcium also plays the role of a good guy in the healthy heart. Our research aims to increase understanding of the interactions between calcium, reactive oxygen and mitochondria and how this information can be used to protect the heart from damage and improve its function. In order to do this we need to develop a way of measuring these parameters in the whole beating heart and this is the focus of the present application. Proteins have been engineered by others that respond specifically to changes in calcium and ROS by emitting fluorescent light. The heart can be made to express these proteins in specific locations within the cell, such as the mitochondria, and this provides an experimental model in which to perform our experiments. Detection of the light requires the development of special equipment that brings light to and from the heart using light guides and measures rapid changes in the intensity of the fluorescent light at multiple wavelengths in real time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801237","grantId":"G0801237","fundValue":"385043","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Philip Halestrap","coPersons":["Elinor  Griffiths","Philippe  Pasdois"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
