{"id":"D9AE3E42-A412-4F6B-BD09-C8A88F6B991F","title":"Kinetic Switches: Exploiting Feedback in Enzyme Microparticles","abstractText":"Many biological processes require a rapid transition from one chemical state to another following a supercritical stimulus. These kinetically-controlled cell switches are driven by feedback such as autocatalysis, when a reaction is catalysed by its product. Feedback also lies at the heart of synchronisation of activity in cellular systems such as bacteria and yeast. There has been great interest in the design of reaction networks that produce feedback-driven behaviour, for example, genetic circuits were developed to create a toggle switch, chemical oscillations and synchronisation of oscillations in E. coli cells. \n\nThrough computational studies and experiments, we will design bio-inspired switches combining two components: feedback in the reaction kinetics and compartmentalisation of the reaction in microparticles. This research will provide insight into biological self-organisation as well as having potential applications in analytical or &quot;smart&quot; materials science. \n\nThe first component of the research involves designing novel reaction networks for chemical feedback and for this we will use nature's catalysts: enzymes. Enzymes offer specificity, efficiency and biocompatibility for widespread applications such as sensors, drug delivery devices and bio-reactors but the wealth of behaviour associated with autocatalysis has yet to be exploited. We will investigate possible advantages such as such as a fast, robust response to a chemical signal in the presence of noise. \n\nIn order to create a cellular switch, the enzyme catalyst for the reaction will be immobilised in microparticles. When immersed in a bath of reactants, the microparticles obtain chemical &quot;fuel&quot; from the surrounding solution, naturally maintaining the system far-from-equilibrium in a similar manner to cells. By manipulation of the kinetics, exciting features such as a chemical switch, hysteresis, chemical pulses, patterns or self-motion of the microparticles are possible. Groups of enzyme microparticles interact with each other via the release of chemicals into the surrounding solution, thus creating a new opportunity for the examination of collective behaviours and self-organisation in bio-inspired cellular systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K030574/1","grantId":"EP/K030574/1","fundValue":"287678","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Fiona Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Particles with immobilised enzymes have widespread applications, such as sensors, drug delivery devices and bio-reactors, and enzyme reactions have also been proposed for logic gates in microfluidic reactors or bio-fuel cells. Feedback in enzyme-loaded particles offers potential advantages such as amplification of a chemical signal above a threshold (transistor) or an irreversible response to a signal (one-way switch). Some time ago, it was suggested that feedback might be obtained in enzyme catalysed reactions in non-buffered environments as a result of the bell-shaped rate-pH curve. A bistable pH switch and hysteresis was obtained in mm-sized urease-loaded alginate beads immersed in urea and acid solution. In the bistable regime, the final pH of the bead was low (unreacted) or high (reacted), depending on the initial state of the bead. A threshold amount of enzyme and substrate was required for beads to switch to the high pH state. The results illustrate that feedback-driven behaviour is possible in enzyme reactions in beads and may have important consequences in the use of enzyme-loaded particles for biotechnological applications. The development of enzyme microparticles will impact on chemists driven by a desire to mimic the complex structure and function observed in biology for useful applications. The research will demonstrate how far-from-equilibrium chemistry might be exploited in analytical or &quot;smart&quot; materials science. The potential advantages are faster, most robust devices that overcome external/intrinsic noise in the system and synchronisation of activity in multiple devices. Our results will aid engineers in understanding the activity of enzymes in microsystems and in the development of enzyme particle technology by creation of methods for the production of the enzyme microparticles for applications.
