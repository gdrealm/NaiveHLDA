The centralaspect of the MGS is the training of PhD students in the mathematical foundations of computing, by means of a yearlySpring School that provides a series of technical courses on introductory, advanced and emerging topics.This application is to seek continued EPSRC support for the MGS -- which it has enjoyed in recent years via threesuccessive grants -- by means of funding twenty places for PhD students at the 2010 event, together with support for the invited lecturers, and (as required under full economic costing), the local organisers and thedirector of the MGS. This application will secure the future of the MGS for the next year, and hence contribute tomaintaining the leading position of the UK in theoretical computer science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I000887/1","grantId":"EP/I000887/1","fundValue":"4703","fundStart":"2010-03-28","fundEnd":"2011-03-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There have been no scientific findings; but the school has high societal and economic impact. \n\nPhD training is an essential component in transforming the UK into a country with a highly skilled workforce, in particular in comparison to continental Europe and Asia, where education standards are higher.
