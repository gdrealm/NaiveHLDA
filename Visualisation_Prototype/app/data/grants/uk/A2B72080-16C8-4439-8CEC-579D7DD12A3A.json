However, the deformation behaviour of small volumes of material is not well understood, in particular the effect of the measured hardness increasing as the size of the indentation (and hence of the volume of materials deformed) decreases. Our interdisciplinary approach to this problem is unique internationally and uses techniques and concepts developed in semiconductor technology to solve fundamental problems in materials science and metallurgy.The key aims are to unify the very different theories that are used to explain the mechanical strength of nanostructures in different contexts. Critical thickness theory is highly developed as a way to understand the strained layers used in semiconductor technology. Strain gradient theory has been developed to explain the size effect in which small stressed volumes appear to be stronger. The work at QMUL has introduced two new concepts. The first is that the initiation of plasticity starts throughout a finite minimum volume. The second is that there is a minimum rate of relief of elastic strain energy required to initiate plasticity. These four ideas are undoubtedly different expressions of a single underlying principle, and our central aim in this proposal is to identify that principle through experiment and theoretical development.At Queen Mary, we will design structures to be grown at the Central Facility in Sheffield. We will carry out mechanical tests - nanoindentation, bending, at room temperature and high temperature - and we will use the results to guide theory. Through collaborators at Cambridge, we have access to unique facilities for looking at, for example, the material under a one-micron indent. Through collaborators in industry, we have access to the latest Xray techniques, for analysing, for example, the strains in a bent beam specimen.The total cost of the programme will be about 600000. This is worthwhile and timely since Nanoscale applications need to be underpinned by fundamental research in materials, where EPSRC observe that there are rich new areas for uncovering novel materials behaviour. This proposal falls under the themes of Nanostructured materials, and Materials phenomena and properties, in EPSRC's research priorities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C518012/1","grantId":"EP/C518012/1","fundValue":"106931","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The observation that the micropillars could be plastically deformed without cracking led to the micropillar compression being investigated as a technique for studying plasticity in brittle materials without the requirement for high confining pressures. Work, in collaboration with the group of J. Michler at EMPA, CH, showed that such behaviour occurred below a critical pillar size and that this could be quantitatively explained by a decrease in the crack driving force in small pillars, consistent with observations in a range of systems. It was also shown, for the first time, that in single crystals individual slip systems could be interrogated, whereas in indentation multiple slip systems are required, that tests could be carried out over a range of temperatures, again for the first time, and that size effects in hard materials are much more limited at the length scales investigated than they are in soft metals.

While there must inevitably be a scale at which this happens, for instance as the sample size approaches the activation volume, the sample sizes here tended to be larger than this. An assumption of the initial analysis was that the yield stress did not vary with the In concentr The techniques developed here enable the study of plastic flow in brittle materials. Normally such materials would break rather than plastically deform. However, the plastic flow behaviour can be of great importance both at low and high temperatures in structural applications, in hard coatings for cutting tools and even in electronic materials. This work is now being developed in a range of other projects, some with industrial funding and others with academics in the UK, Europe and the US.
