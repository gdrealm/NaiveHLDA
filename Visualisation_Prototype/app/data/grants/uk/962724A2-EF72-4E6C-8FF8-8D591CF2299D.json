The project will deepen anthropological understandings of the neoliberal state through a detailed ethnography of two domains of expert knowledge in which modern state power is simultaneously consolidated and undone through its articulation with global or international arenas of knowledge, circulation and value. The first of these arenas is law, and more specifically the international treaties and conventions that regulate how nation states govern indigenous populations and the environment. The second arena is infrastructural engineering, more specifically the metrics, techniques and standards of engineering works that frame the ways in which modern states transform public space and infrastructural systems.. By developing methods and theoretical frameworks for the comparison and analysis of these two domains of state authority, the research explores,\n(1) how collaborative ethnography can better inform our understandings of the state as a\n'multiscalar' or 'translocal' entity, \n(2) how the idea of &quot;the state&quot; acquires political and affective force at the interface between local, regional and transnational modes of practice. A ten-month ethnographic study in Cusco will be conducted in collaboration with local agencies and two research assistants. The ethnography will focus on controversies surrounding technical practices, legal interpretation and expert knowledge in a World Bank funded public works project that is both administered by the Regional Government of Cusco and subject to international indigenous, environmental and regulatory laws. Research will trace these controversies as they unfold in relationship to two specific activities within the project: the construction of a by-pass around an important archaeological site, and a territorial mapping program designed to reorganize and rationalize urban and rural land.\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project contributes methodological and theoretical innovations to cultural anthropology and to theoretical work on neoliberalism, through its novel combination of perspectives drawn from the anthropologies of law, and of science and technology. Methodologically, by tracing parallel domains of expert practice across different layers of the nation state, the collaboration will expand and refine anthropological capacities for comparative thinking across the multi-scalar and dispersed domains of practice and life that make up the modern state. As an anthropological contribution to interdisciplinary discussions of the state and state power, the project will provide detailed empirical accounts of how the neoliberal state deploys and relies on expert knowledge. The project contributes to theoretical work on affect and politics by exploring how the idea of 'the state' acquires political and affective force within ambiguous spaces at the interface between local, regional and transnational claims to expertise. Finally, the project will contribute to Latin American studies as the first ethnography to focus on the workings of regional governance and decentralization in Peru.\n\nBroader Impact: The research will advance models for collaboration between academic institutions and research centers in the US, Britain and Peru. Research findings and methodologies will be shared and developed in workshops held with academic, government and civil society (NGO) researchers in Peru, including the Regional Government of Cusco,\nPlan Copesco , and the Centro Bartolome de Las Casas . The workshops will generate journal publications that will advance anthropological research on the modern state. Non-specialist publications based on project findings will contribute culturally sensitive, anthropological insights to public debate and concern in Peru about the workings of regional government and state decentralization. Findings will also be disseminated through a project website on which we will post details of research findings and further research resources in both Spanish and English. The project will contribute to the professional formation of a female anthropologist in Peru, and to the career development of a young research professional in the UK. Both these young researchers will acquire international networks in addition to new research skills and experience of research management. Finally, the research will enhance and expand the PIs' graduate and undergraduate teaching with new materials and literatures on collaborative ethnographic methodologies, visual and legal technologies, affect, and the state.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I500669/1","grantId":"AH/I500669/1","fundValue":"175658","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Penelope Margaret Harvey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
