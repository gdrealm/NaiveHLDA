As with a positive, adaptive experience, a problematic transition to motherhood can have long-lasting effects on both women and their families. This systematic review will gather, describe, assess and integrate qualitative and quantitative research exploring the experiences of first-time mothers. Considerable research on women's experiences of motherhood has been undertaken over the past 30 years, whilst women's lives and maternity services have changed dramatically. Synthesizing the literature on women's experiences about what helps and hinders becoming a mother will contribute to our understanding of life course transitions, and the sociology of reproduction and family life. It will have the capacity to inform practice about how best to support new mothers. This review will also advance the methodology of research synthesis in the social sciences, a main challenge confronted by researchers endeavouring to inform the policy-making process.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2250","grantId":"RES-000-22-2250","fundValue":"76665","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ginny  Brunton","coPersons":["Ann  Oakley","Meg  Wiggins"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
