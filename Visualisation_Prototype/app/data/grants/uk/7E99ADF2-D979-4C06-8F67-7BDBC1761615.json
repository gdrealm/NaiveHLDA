{"id":"7E99ADF2-D979-4C06-8F67-7BDBC1761615","title":"Dramaturgy and Telematic Performance","abstractText":"Telematic performance refers to events in which performers, audiences, or both, are separated from each other in space and interact at a distance. Performers and audiences are brought together, in various configurations, through internet or satellite technologies to create virtual, or mixed virtual and physical events. Performance can be generated through and transmitted by a wide range of communication technologies. Video streaming of live performance has, however, largely been restricted to dance, with theatre being limited to broadcasts of staged dramatic productions to audiences in other locations. The aim of my research is to develop models of theatre that exploit the possibilities and potentials of being distributed across the world in real time, and to find ways they can be used by artists without ready access to well-equipped and expensive studios in institutions.\\n\\nAs theatre, the aim is not to focus upon the active communication between the users of the telematics - the performers - after all, theatre deals with the miscommunication between the protagonists as much as communication. The aim is more to use the physical nature of the telematic situation - physical (and cultural) distance, and failure as well as success in the technologies of communication (whether language or the internet) - to explore the relation between the physical and psychological distance of the self to the other.\\n\\nOne essential is to establish the equality, the equivalence, of the participants, whether they be physically present or mere images on a wall. There are two issues here - one, establishing functional equality so that performers have equal effectiveness wherever they might be located, and can be aware of each other in useful ways, and two, to be seen to be equal. The first requires a technological solution, while the other is more complex, and revolves around the need to establish the possibility of a sculptural presence for the physically absent. That is, to embed the visual and aural information about people and spaces on the other side of the world into the physical presence of the room where the audience is, to turn electronic impulses into more than a purely visual or aural experience.\\n\\nTo this end I am proposing three projects for the rest of my fellowship. \\n\\nProject One, 'Nowhere', brings two remote locations together as revolving video 'windows' into their worlds, projected across the walls of the viewing spaces surrounding the audiences and merging and contracting their spaces into a single complex space. This created a new kind of performance space. This will be developed practically in an online studio connecting two locations in London and workshops and productions planned with locations in Chichester and Beirut.\\n\\nProject Two, 'A Haunting', was first developed as a single project for the foyer for the Barbican, where it is still under discussion. However, the idea encompasses a wide range of environmental and sculptural video-based performance specifics which will be researched at Central as a series of full-scale elements. 'A Haunting' is anticipated to be a series of synchronised and connected video situations combining to make a single installation, with a repeating cycle of 15 minutes, using multiple cameras, mirrors, video projection and live relays.\\n\\nProject 3 will explore the construction and use of an extended filmic space that extends over various distant locations and may be encountered either physically at a single location as a sculptural installation or via a website where a more extensive but virtual representation will be accessible. By filmic space I mean an architectural, spatial environment presented at least partly as video. As an installation, the physical presence, visual contact, and images of remote spaces interact in different ways, while the on-line presence functions as a repository of all available spaces irrespective of, and omitting reference to, physical distribution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I025670/1","grantId":"AH/I025670/1","fundValue":"30016","fundStart":"2011-02-14","fundEnd":"2014-09-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Contribution to the wider appreciation and discussion of networked performance through public engagement with performances, workshops, symposia and conferences (as listed in Engagement Activities, Artistic &amp; Creative Products, and Spin Outs) Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Julian  Maynard Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Central Sch of Speech and Drama","findingsText":" THE INITIAL AIMS\n\n This award funded the development and production in years two to five of the fellowship of practical performance pieces and an updated telematic system for video-streaming that could be tested in performance conditions. The context concerned the technology required for two-way video streaming in a performance environment, that is flexible, reliable, affordable and low-latency, and the emergent aesthetics and dramaturgies for a telematic theatre.\n \nThe questions asked were:\nWhat arrangement of technologies provides a robust, accessible and portable platform for telematic performance? \no In what ways can telematics serve as a conduit for dramatic performance and exploit the nature of this new medium? \no What new understandings of space (global, virtual, cultural, personal) arise from performances made through telematic production? As the project develops, it will address the following questions: \no How may one make a coherent, global space that is recognisably 'tele- present', yet absolute to its participants and spectators? How may one occupy this space? What manipulations of it are possible? \no How may temporal and architectural innovations such as changes of scale, delay, continuity and connection challenge the nature of Euclidian space while retaining its relation to the physical bodies of the occupants/performers and audience/viewers? \no What is the nature of 'identification' (with character or persona) in telematic performance, and what are its limits? \no What could be the implications for drama when performers in different locations are seen to be equivalent and isomorphic - as if they are the same character? \no How does telematic space enable (or inhibit) representation of the absent other as a projection of personal fear or desire? \no Performatively, how might telematic theatre dramatise mis- representation and mis-understanding\n\n\n\n\nTHE RESEARCH\n\nThese primary aims led to the following areas of research in the technology and dramaturgy:\n\nA) Technical: 1. An assessment of the current situation.\n2. An exploration of the constraints of video-streaming, what the trade-offs are, and how they interact. How to achieve optimal real-time interaction and reciprocity, using domestic consumer connections, as well as academic institutional ones\n 3. Other telematically linked mechanisms.\n \n \nB) Aesthetics and Dramaturgy: \n 1. What is meant by 'presence'. 'telepresence'?\n 2. The video-conferencing model: the abolition of distance, the illusion of spatial coherence.\n 3. The absence model: to use the characteristics of the medium and the technology to find new representations of space and time, including appearance and disappearance, remote action/control, latency, spatial manipulation - visual and aural, distance, absence.\n 4. Practical issues of long-distance collaboration.\n 5. The emergent politics of networked performance: physical space and virtual space, \n\n\n\n\nA1. The current situation is that high quality video streaming remains difficult to attain when required to operate in real-time with very low latency, as is necessary where performers need to respond to each other across a two-way connection. Single-direction streaming (eg by the National Theatre, or productions such as Katie Mitchell's 'The Forbidden Zone' recently at the Barbican) employs significant latency in order to ensure good quality images.\n\nVideo conferencing systems provide the low-latency, but at the cost of limited image quality (restricted to talking heads against plain backgrounds) and constrained institutional and physical set-ups. \n\nSo what in this situation suggests itself as a useable idea for performance-making that is equally distributed across space in terms of both audience and actor, one that acknowledges (and valorises) the technological environment in which the event takes place? Furthermore, given the evident fact that virtual presence is not and perhaps artistically should not be confused with physical presence, what are the characteristics and potentials of virtuality and absence in performance and where do they lead?\n\nMuch of the most successful networked performance forgoes full video in favour of less data-heavy media to provide instant feedback and interactivity. With ever increasing bandwidth and compression techniques, how should video streaming position itself in the future of networked performance? \n\n\nA2. In years three to five of the fellowship I developed with my technical director Damien Wiles an improved streaming system that is portable, flexible, focussed on the spatial and site-specific, scalable, and affordable. To this end, we researched a system that maximises the available bandwidth to utilise multiple and manipulable video streams, assessing the relative advantages of matching hardware, software and ISPs. We investigated the strengths and limitations of working with proprietary systems and institution-based resources with the aim of finding practical solutions for independent theatre- and performance-makers.\n\nThe systems developed were tested over extended periods in performance conditions - at RCSSD, Buckingham New University, Trinity Buoy Wharf, Beaconsfield Art Gallery, Sophiensaele (Berlin). \n\nA3. I have also begun research with Rob White and David McLellan into the technology of the 'internet of things' to employ physical (electromechanical) interactivity, and crucially reciprocity, between distant locations in the creation of linked and synchronised physical structures. This led to the development of the telematically reciprocating motorised doors used in The Doors.\n\n\n\nB1. This question is encountered by all who work with mediatised representations of human beings. \nMy practice with telematics has concentrated on finding effective structures for video-streaming distant performers, without pre-defining what those effects might be. The work focussed on the spatial, sculptural and architectural character of mediated representations, rather than their graphic, iconographic or linguistic potential. I was interested in the relation between the perceptions of the viewer or spectator as a physical person in a space and the absent performer also understood as a presence with actual location and form in the space. Each of the three primary outcomes of the research found a different solution to the problem, but all contributed to the overall aim of establishing a shared space for performance that could be understood physically and spatially, rather than purely as images on a projection screen.\n\nExperience of these projects suggests to me that there are many kinds and graduations of 'telepresence'. The sense of someone leaving the room when you terminate a connection. The degree to which you agree to mutual dependency/co-operation - that is, the degree you share your fate with the distant person - is the effect they have on you direct or indirect, sensory or imaginative, physically causal or detached, moral or dispassionate? The degree you are aware of the physical position or action of the distant person in real time, in relation to some spatial orientation of your own body. How the distant space and the local one are related perceptually. \n To what degree can 'telepresence' operate in the same way (have the same affect) as the actual physical presence? \n And what about absence? Awareness of the physical absence of a person in some way is a measure of their virtual presence, in whatever way that is conceived or felt. \n\n Primarily, there is a sense in which presence is revealed or even learnt: exposure to a telematic practice opens new perceptions to what presence feels like and can be. A door opening or closing by itself is a curiosity, until you learn that it signals the arrival or departure of an active, causal agent, or a videographic one. Or, the location of a distant object's image consistently at, or superimposed upon, the location of a local object creates a persistent, functioning relationship where none existed before. Change the objects into people and the effect is amplified. \n\nB2. The industry aim for video-streaming has been for a low-latency, high resolution functionality, allied to efficient data-manipulation tools. The notion of the desirability of creating an audio-visual illusion that is next-best to the real thing seems unexceptionable, and has been taken on by many in the artistic community. This is a next step in the accelerated flattening of the world that is the prime feature of globalisation. However it may be maintained that as an artist it is part of one's job to re-configure available technologies away from their nominal functions when they suggest ways to achieve a purpose that is not necessarily for what they are designed for. Research into affordable video-conferencing technologies revealed systems highly focussed on small-scale, rigidly controlled environments - typically a speaker's head-and-shoulders against a plain background. Under these restrictions, it is possible to attain a seemingly good quality result - the illusion of an illusion. Such systems do not deal well with the transmission and representation of large or complex spaces, or site-specific spaces. They are also proprietary systems that are difficult to customise. \n\n\nB3 The research aimed to uncover alternatives to a model of telematic space that effectively denied the existence of distance in its construction and that inevitably raised questions about the point of attempting to create an illusion of normal spatial and dramatic coherence. It aimed at ensuring that distant performers retain the integrity of their own performance, and distant spaces the integrity of their own physical location, thereby insisting on a physical presence providing the root for whatever telematics could offer. In this way, by unavoidable comparison with the local, the physical presence of the distant, in its own place, could be experienced empathetically from afar, in a form appropriate to its status as distant, via a close communication with the physically present. \n\nTwo pieces under development in my AHRC research address these themes. These projects create telematic spaces that are inherently different from coherent representations of material space, and attempt to seek out characteristics that bring the two locations cognitively or perceptually into accord and/or collision with each other, thereby creating understandings of presence and absence, agency and virtuality, that are cognisant of the physical facts of distance and the technical means of illusion and representation. The research used workshops and studio-based experimentation to provoke and analyse the relations of streamed video imagery to physical space in terms of appearance and disappearance, remote action/control, latency, spatial manipulation - visual and aural, distance, absence.\n\nB4. Through practical experiments and workshops in academic, semi-public and public and professional contexts, estimates were made of the relative success and failure of the working practices adopted. The nature of creation and collaboration over internet links, sometimes across national borders, was explored: \nat RCSSD, linking two rehearsal rooms in the same building. This allowed participants to experience and gain comprehension of the technical set-up and artistic process, which encouraged an informed input and discussion to off-set the naturally fragmentary experience of the whole event that comes from working with other performers (and often the workshop leader) who are not in the same room. A similar set-up enabled development on the piece Dissolved at the extensive studios of the Blackhole Factory company in Braunschweig, Germany.\na) Workshops in studios at Peckham which took place in a single large space, exploring the dramaturgy and choreography of linked work with all participants able to monitor the whole process\nb) Workshops using internet links between Bucks New University and RCSSD, Stockwell studios and studios in Berlin, and studios at Trinity Buoy Wharf London and Sophiensaele, Berlin. These built on a perceived problem with the practice of telematic theatre experienced by Station House Opera in the company's work 2004-2008 linking theatres in England, Brazil, Singapore, Germany and Holland, relating to the encouraging and ensuring of common artistic, cultural and economic goals between the participating groups, who through the working process were not able to directly share space or communicate face-to-face. Emphasis was laid on clearly identifying potential partners as being able to share common goals and stating what these were before commencement, developing personal and professional relationships, extending development period, and allowing regular social time using the video links as well as work time. \nThe results of these experiences were collated into a general Best Practice paper. \n\nB5 Working with students and others from various ethnic and national backgrounds, it became clear that the frame of telematic theatre holds various and different meanings. While remaining located practically within a Western European context, based at RCSSD in London, two linked interests developed during the period of the fellowship that sought to develop ideas relating to the interaction between physical and virtual space in a) the politics of national independence and borders, and b) the expansion of online space and the shrinking of accessible physical space (especially in London). \n\n\n \nTHE OUTPUTS\n\nFour main outputs were achieved during the fellowship, along with subsidiaries (workshops, symposia, conference papers, a publication): a technical platform and three performance/theatre pieces.\n\n1) A technical platform for researching and producing telematic theatre.\n\nDue to the rapid change in the technical field over the past five years, I updated the system I developed in year one to accommodate High Definition video. \nThe platform avoids proprietary streaming systems and resources such as Access Grid, as it was clear that the way to achieve the aims of the research - a robust, stable, flexible, mobile system that was useful, accessible and affordable by the independent artist or theatre-maker - was to develop a system that was flexible and non-redundant, one that was able to control as required, video, lights, sound, electromechanical devices, in any physical situation/location, on whatever link was available, without booking or institutional allegiances and red tape. It would be possible to leverage the standards pertaining to any particular situation, where the institution could act usefully as a broker or technical resource, but should be free of the obligation to work through institutions. \n\nThe system uses commercially available hardware encoders coding rtsp streams, decoded by VLC, up to a possible 1080p, via Teradek Cubes. \n\nA technical guide has been compiled, including how to maximise the available networks and match equipment to network.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, I have led innovations in two technological areas: \n Dissolved: Mixing video rtsp streams locally or remotely using simple keyboard controls. \n As part of a complete Linux-based video streaming and mixing system, technical design by Damien Wiles. \n Dissolved/Project 3: Telematically-linked reciprocally controlled electro-mechanical system for operating doors. Technical design Rob White and Dave McLellan.\n\n\nPerformances.\n\n\n2) Dissolved is a performance developed through workshops and through a collaboration with Berlin-based artists Florian Beigl and Christopher Hewitt to a full production at Beaconsfield Gallery, London and Sophiensaerle, Berlin (March 2014).\n\n'Dissolve' superimposes two physical spaces statically upon each other, in such a way that performers facing in any direction may be aware of how this shared space is inhabited by distant performers as well as local ones. \n\nA basic set-up consists of a space, or a corner of a space, bounded by white walls that corresponds in terms of floor line and replicated objects exactly with another in another location. A camera in the same position in each space presents identical views that are then superimposed on a screen. Each space contributes 50% of the combined image, but as both basic images are identical, this fact becomes invisible, and what is presented to the eye is apparently a single space.\n\nPerformers, both local and distant, are seen as transparent entities apparently occupying a solid and coherent space - except when a performer in one space intentionally occupies the image of a performer in the other, at which point a solid, combined performer emerges. This combined character has agency in this combined world, able to interact physically with objects in a coherent manner, and often a third identity, when two physically dissimilar people combine to create the image of an uncanny new person. \n\nThe performers mutually creating this entity are in a position where with co-operation they achieve telematic solidity but lose independence, and the piece revolves around the unstable relationships built up between shifting pairs of performers, each one alternating between conflict leading to isolation, and co-operation leading to lose of self-determination. \n\nFor the performers, this leads to a strong sense of being inhabited, or of inhabiting another, physically and spatially. The three-dimensional space itself acquires the characteristics of doubleness, as if it is haunted by ghosts. If set up to enable it, this nature can be experienced by the viewer as well, whereby a member of the public in place A finds themselves occupied by someone else in place B. In this situation the opportunity arises to play the game, joining in and while gaining the opportunity to affect events at the same time losing the opportunity to assert the will. This leads to a paradoxical but real problem of physical existence that echoes real life situations and allows the space to become a place where such problems can be represented.\n\nApart from these dramatic qualities inherent to the telematic space, it has extended characteristics unlike normal physical space that contribute to a tangible but phantasmogorical quality of doubleness. A door may be both open and closed, a wall both exist and not exist. Thus aspects of distant locations that are peculiar to those locations - views of the outside, specific events and people - may appear in the telematic space uncompromised by being made obviously transparent, viewed in glimpses through a door, or revealed in entirety by the presence of a wall in the other space which by dint of being featureless disappears from view.\n\n\n3) The Doors was presented as part of the symposium The Spaces of Telematic Theatre: Julian Maynard Smith held in September 2014 at RCSSD connected online with Buckingham New University. It comprised the set for the symposium and for performances by Jem Kelly's students at Bucks that were interspersed between and integrated into the presentations and discussions of the symposium. It also represented an ambitious project for the technical team, Damien Wiles for the network, streaming and video design, and Rob White and Davis McLellan for the interactive doors.\n\n'The Doors' is the result of the research proposed in the Case for Support for my application for Project Costs for years 2-5 of my Fellowship, named there as &quot;Project 2, 'A Haunting'&quot;. It is based on a proposal for the foyer of the Barbican Arts Centre, which would render one of the very large columns there 'transparent' and inhabited by people, via video projection. \n\nAt RCSSD, two constructions were seen in the space. The first was a small room, 2.8m by 1.5m by 2.6m in height, open on three sides and bounded only by a steel frame, while the fourth side contained a door. Next to this was an identically-sized box composed on three sides by video screens, each of which showed a full-size view of one side of the room. This created a sculptural representation of the room-like space, into which the viewer 'look', and through it to the space the beyond. In Bucks was a similar set-up with a open-framed room and a video box. On each video-box could be projected the views into the room at either RCSSD or Bucks, or a mixture of the two dissolved together - in any combination. \nThus in each space there was a videographic, sculptural representation of the space and events in the room in either one of the locations, separated or merged together. In addition this structure allowed a view into the distant space from any direction. The audience was free to walk around the space and look at the room and the box from different angles.\nThe doors in each of the small rooms at RCSSD and Bucks were linked so that when a door at either location was moved the door at the other moved in synchronisation. They were controlled by motors that reciprocally followed each other through changes of speed and direction, so that when one was pushed open or slammed shut in one location the door in the other echoed its movement. The two could be seen to move together when the video streams were merged on the video box projections.\n\n\n\n\nDISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS \n\n\nProgress and results of the research have been disseminated via conference papers, two symposia and a book. Workshops were held at periods throughout the fellowship, open to the public, both at RCSSD and elsewhere. Numerous students and others have expressed interest in the work both academically and practically. Both these avenues for dissemination and knowledge exchange will be maintained in the future.\n\nOf the main outputs, Dissolved has so far been the only one so far to reach a major public production, aided by funding from the Arts Council of England, the British Council, and the cultural fund for Berlin Capital City. \n\n\n\nTAKING THE FINDINGS FORWARD\n\nDevelopment and Production\n\nThe collaboration with Dr Jem Kelly at Bucks New University is ongoing and there are plans for continuing development of the technology and the artistic practice. The research might be continued at the university, but it is also intended to continue the work through practical development to public production. This will be facilitated by continuing the working relationships with Damien Wiles and Rob White in the technical field, and continuing artistic development of the crucial results of the research through commissions and residencies. \n\nCurrently, Julian Maynard Smith has been accepted for a 6 - 8 week residency in Copenhagen run by Hotel Pro Forma in March 2013 in order to pursue the artistic development of The Doors, while a new production of Dissolved in autumn 2015 is under discussion with Festival Bo:m in Seoul and Yokohama.\n\nDiscussions are under way for the creation of a new company to be affiliated with Julian Maynard Smith's company Station House Opera, but with a specific focus on two main areas: \na) taking the technical research in the design of video for telematic performance forwards to the production of a practical system for the company's own use but also available to others needing the advantages it would offer in video streaming and design, and \nb) producing theatre and performance projects in designed telematic environments\nThere would be advantages for a company with a clear artistic and technical focus in a new field, establishing a practice in telematic architecture and performance on a tested but innovative technical base. \n\nIn particular, I intend to seek further funding to support part a) and in part b), to take The Doors forward to production, over the coming 12 months. Artistically, the results of the research have been and will be experienced both through the workshops and through public productions and so will be able to influence ideas and practices in the professional and academic fields. \nThe development of a technical platform for video streaming and design will enable practitioners, both independent and academic, to produce their own work in the field, as well as being open to assessment by those with technical interest in the field.
