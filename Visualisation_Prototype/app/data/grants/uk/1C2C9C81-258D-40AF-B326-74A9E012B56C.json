The study is grounded in case study methodology:&nbsp; Questionnaire and Interview data from both teachers and pupils will be collected across a sample of secondary schools in the UK, along with a thorough analysis of current health policy materials within selected schools. </p>\n\n<p>The study will form part of a wider international collaborative research project with partner institutions in New Zealand and Australia. Collectively, these sociological studies will provide a unique contribution to emerging international debates on obesity, health policy and young people.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2003","grantId":"RES-000-22-2003","fundValue":"82248","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma  Rich","coPersons":["John  Evans"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
