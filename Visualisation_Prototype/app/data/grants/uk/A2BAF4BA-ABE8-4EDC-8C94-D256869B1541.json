{"id":"A2BAF4BA-ABE8-4EDC-8C94-D256869B1541","title":"Innovating for a Low Carbon Economy","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series&nbsp; adopts a multi-dimensional and multidisciplinary perspective to address six different but interrelated topics to discuss the challenges and major choices for environmental innovation in the next four decades as the UK undergoes a green transformation.</p>\n\n<p>It is, now, widely acknowledged that the transition to a low carbon economy is unlikely to occur unless radical changes take place on the policy and technology fronts as well as within the organisational structures and how companies see their relationship with the environment. Yet, the presence of various market failures suggest many radical low carbon innovations will not efficiently materialise unless there is a better coordination within the private sector driven by an efficient environmental and innovation policy; as well as significant public support.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series consists of six seminars. The first two seminars concentrate on the technological and organisational environmental innovations while the following two seminars focus on the central role of government policies and the public's consumption attitudes towards environmental matters. The final two seminars investigate the role and characteristics of the environmental sector's SME section in driving the UK's clean technology innovations and the financing needs of the environmental sector. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000628/1","grantId":"ES/L000628/1","fundValue":"28448","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The ESRC Seminar Series on 'Innovating for A Low Carbon Economy' is half way through its planned timeline and has already generated a significant impact through acting as a platform that facilitates communication between academic members, professional practitioners and policy makers. The debates taking place in the seminars are informing academics' research agenda, policy makers' decision-making processes and green companies' growth strategies. The links being created through this platform are being used to integrate the agenda of environmental sustainability in policy actions as well as academic research and teaching curriculums. \n\nThe seminar series community acts as a strong support platform for junior academics and post-graduate students working on the issues of sustainability. The debates are informing the direction of their research whilst the feedback from the seminars are used to enhance the quality of their work. The collaborations built through the course of this project have already benefited taught postgraduate research programs as the students actively participated in the debates and took the outcomes of the debate with them to their work places.\n\nThe collaborations between academic and non-academic partners are already proving very beneficial with various plans for future research projects that involve government organisations, NGOs, academic and company partners are initiated as a result of the contacts made at the seminars.\n\nBased on the first three seminars in the series, the seminar team has put forward two proposals for editing two special issues at two management journals that have extensive reach amongst the academic community. When these special issues can be completed, the sustainability debates in the seminar series will inform the academic research agenda in the seminar series. Additionally, British Academy of Management's Special Interest Group in Innovation has agreed to align their capacity building workshops aimed at early career researchers with this ESRC seminar series in 2015. This will allow us to join efforts with BAM to reach out to a broader group of early career academics as well as informing a broader group of academics under the umbrella of British Academy of Management.

Our participants have consistently noted that they benefited most from the diversity of the parties present at the seminars and making contacts with them as well as being able to hear about different opportunities and similar challenges.\n\nA second area where the seminars have shed light is the urgent need for changed business models that can support the emerging environmental technological innovations in the UK. While more recent emphasis has been placed on organizational environmental innovations, it was argued that clearer direction from the regulators could be instrumental for the diffusion of environmental business models and management systems.\n\nFinally, the series highlighted recent findings which indicate that UK consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious in their purchasing decisions in the recent years and that, there is a big opportunity to use this change to alter the direction of the economy if the correct policy tools are used. Based on the debates in the seminars, academic participants have identified future avenues for research and potential non-academic research partners in the area of environment and clean energy. Similarly, companies working in the field of energy and environment were able to discuss the opportunities, challenges and prospects of their businesses with the participating academics and policy makers to receive different perspectives and utilise these for further progress in their businesses. We can already identify a range of strong research and consultancy partnerships emerging based on these seminars and expect these to lead to broader projects that will deliver further research and economic value that benefits the UK's low carbon economy.
