This area has been studied through observations and by numerical simulations for many years but it is our belief that well characterised quantitative experiments will play a decisive role in resolving a number of outstanding scientific issues. The proposed research will strongly advance the development of the novel research area of Laboratory Astrophysics, which seeks to enhance the understanding of the physics governing the behaviour of astrophysical objects via scaled laboratory experiments, combined with computer modelling. This proposal outlines an in-depth programme of research in this rapidly emerging area and focuses on the study of magnetized supersonic plasma jets. These jets will be formed in our MAGPIE plasma facility at Imperial College and will be studied using a variety of diagnostics including the use of intense proton beam imaging where the protons are formed using a short-pulse laser-produced plasma source adjacent to the jet. The use of proton beams as a diagnostic will allow us, for the first time, to diagnose the magnetic field structure within the jets. The understanding of the complex plasma processes involved in the formation and evolution of these jets involving high magnetic fields will, through our large-scale computational models, be transferred to plasma jets which form in a variety of astrophysical situations. Indeed plasma jets are observed in many astrophysical contexts and it is widely believed that magnetic fields play a crucial part in their structure and evolution. Moreover, it was recently suggested that magnetically driven jets play important role in gamma ray bursts and supernova explosions. This proposal will enable a decisive breakthrough in Laboratory Astrophysics, achieved by combining the three key ingredients which are now in place: a) a unique experimental approach allowing for the first time the creation of high Mach number (M&gt;20) magnetically driven plasma jets with magnetic field topology relevant to astrophysical jet models; b) recent developments in laser technology and in plasma diagnostics to provide means for accurate diagnosis of the plasma parameters; c) 3-D MHD simulation codes developed by the laboratory plasma and astrophysics communities that are now mature enough to provide a strong connection between experiment, astrophysical models and observations. The timeliness of this proposal is also underlined by the growing interest in this field internationally with major efforts in USA (Rochester, Livermore, Cornell, San Diego, Reno). The combined expertise of the authors of this proposal and the involvement of international collaborators from Astrophysics community will allow us to create an unprecedented capability for the Laboratory Astrophysics research and provide both breadth and depth to the programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G001324/1","grantId":"EP/G001324/1","fundValue":"1901810","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The experimental work carried out during and after this award at Imperial College has been used to benchmark and stress-test advanced 3-dimensional numerical simulations of high energy density plasmas. The ability to model matter accurately under extreme conditions of pressure, temperature and radiation flux is extremely challenging. The degree of confidence in simulation accuracy gained by testing computational tools such as Imperial College's GORGON code enables it to be applied to other important problems. It has for example been used to investigate the performance of fusion ignition experiments conducted in the US on the ~$3.6 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) and on the Sandia Z pulsed power machine, two of the world's largest and most complex experimental platforms. This acts to link scientific programmes of strategic importance between the UK and the US.\n\nThe ability to conduct advanced high energy density experiments and to train young research scientists to the very highest level provides a mechanism to link UK science to major international efforts, e.g. the search for fusion energy underpinned by investment at the &pound; multi-billion NIF in the US and Laser Magajoule in France.

The laser delivers beams for Thomson scattering, x-ray radiography, Faraday rotation and proton probing to study the formation and properties of magnetically driven supersonic plasma jets, reproducing the physics of astrophysical systems. The key goal of this program was to study the formation, propagation and stability of magnetically driven supersonic plasma jets in conditions scalable to astrophysical scenarios. The project has been highly successful and has led to a number of very significant advances in this area. It has also leveraged significant funds at ? Million level both for future laboratory astrophysics experiments (US DOE via Rochester University) and for the further upgrades of the laser system (AWE and Imperial College). \n\nWe have found that formation of highly collimated jets can occur via two very different scenarios.\n\nIn conditions when the driving magnetic field is strong and the magnetic pressure is comparable to the plasma pressure, the jets produced have significant variations in the density and flow velocity due to the development of MHD instabilities. We have also demonstrated, for the first time, formation of episodic jets, when several subsequent jets are formed, a scenario hinted at in nature in data from the Hubble space telescope. The key condition for a high degree of the outflow collimation is the presence of sufficiently strong radiative cooling of the jet material. We have performed measurements of the energy balance during the formation of magnetically dominated jets, and demonstrated that ~25% of the injected Poyning flux energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the jet. \n\nWe have also demonstrated that formation of highly collimated jets can occur in conditions when the magnetic field is smaller and distributed over the formation region. In this case the MHD instabilities do not disrupt jet formation, the jet is laminar and has a small opening angle of ~2-5 degrees. Key jet parameters including flow velocity and temperature were measured with high temporal and spatial resolution at multiple points simultaneously using Thomson scattering. These measurements show that collimation of the jet formed in this configuration require a lower density halo plasma to support the necessary magnetic field configuration.\n\nWe have performed extensive studies of jet interactions with ambient media, modelling the propagation of astrophysical jets. We have observed the formation of bow shocks in the ambient media, the working surface separating the jet and ambient material, and the reverse shock in the jets. We have investigated the dependence of the properties of these shocks on radiative cooling rates by varying the atomic number of the ambient gas (He, Ar, Kr, Xe), and demonstrated that for strong radiative cooling (Kr, Xe) small scale instabilities rapidly develop on the working surface and in the reverse shock. In related work we have used laser heated cluster gases to investigate radiative loss and cooling instabilities. \n\nWe have developed improved numerical tools and performed computer simulations of experiments using the advanced MHD code GORGON and astrophysics code ASTROBEAR. The well benchmarked ASTROBEAR code was then used to simulate several scenarios of astrophysical jets formation, providing predictions for future observations. Results of the experiments provide quantitative information which is already used for verification of computer codes used in both astrophysics and in laboratory plasma physics research. \nInvestigations of the collimation and stability of the magnetically dominated plasma jets in laboratory suggest that episodic generation of jets could be a key element in generation of astrophysical jets, and this finding is being contrasting with the astrophysical theories and simulations.
