{"id":"B5BFF179-2682-4F04-BA59-25C72419B746","title":"Early Jewish Scripture in Light of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran","abstractText":"This project focuses on the 'Dead Sea Scrolls' that were recovered from caves around Khirbet Qumran in 1947-1956. These ancient Jewish Scrolls only became fully available in 1991, and so this research concentrates on what the whole collection now tells us about the nature of the Bible or scripture in Early Judaism (i.e. before 70 CE). Central questions include whether\nJews at this time had a 'Bible' or a more open-ended 'scripture' and whether some texts lost after 70 CE but rediscovered among the Scrolls (e.g. 4 Q Visions of Amram purportedly from Moses' father) were deemed biblical or scriptural.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113064/1","grantId":"113064/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan G  Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
