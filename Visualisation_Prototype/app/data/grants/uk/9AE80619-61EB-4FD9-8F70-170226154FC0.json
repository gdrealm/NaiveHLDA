{"id":"9AE80619-61EB-4FD9-8F70-170226154FC0","title":"Increasing Student Competence and Confidence in Algebra and Multiplicative Reasoning","abstractText":"This project seeks to increase student engagement and achievement in mathematics education by focusing on the two topics at Key Stage 3 (KS3) that are central to the current mathematics curriculum: Algebra, and Multiplicative reasoning. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a large-scale survey of attainment and attitude at KS3 involving both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, based on a representative sample of schools and students in England. Phase 2 will consist of a collaboration with a group teacher-researchers and schools in a design research study. This will focus on how formative and diagnostic assessment can be used to improve student confidence and competence, and thus participation, engagement and attainment. Finally the approach will be trialled with a larger group of schools in order to assess its wider applicability. Specific outcomes will include 1. A detailed survey of student understandings and attitudes in the areas of algebra and multiplicative reasoning. 2. A comparison of current attainment in England with that of 30 years ago. 3. A theoretically and empirically based understanding of formative assessment in mathematics. 4. A collaborative intervention with teachers proven to be successful in improving students' competence and confidence.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025483/1","grantId":"ES/F025483/1","fundValue":"643364","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Hodgen","coPersons":["Margaret Louise Brown","Robert John Coe"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
