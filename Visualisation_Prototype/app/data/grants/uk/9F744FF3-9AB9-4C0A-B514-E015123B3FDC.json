Brisset to Hull during a sabbatical. The aim is to continue the collaboration of the two materials groups and direct research towards a new exciting common goal The mutual complimentary expertise, that of Prof Brisset in the design of new materials for advanced uses in inkjet printing and that of the Hull group in mesomorphic systems is to be utilised to arrive at a new class of printable self-aligning semi-conducting materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F003862/1","grantId":"EP/F003862/1","fundValue":"11744","fundStart":"2007-10-05","fundEnd":"2008-02-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The compounds prepared and the analysis of the solid state properties fed into the design of novel materials Chemicals,Electronics,Energy ","person":"Georg Hans  Mehl","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":" Twisted and bent conjugated polyaromatic groups can form liqiud crystalline phase behaviour and show in the LC phase advantagous conduction behaviour The design of organic semi-conductors and photoconductors Chemicals,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
