{"id":"A354F948-2AF7-4884-89A9-12AD80EA3256","title":"Vacuole segregation and mycelial development of Candida albicans","abstractText":"Candida albicans is the most common fungus that is associated with life-threatening infection. It is one of many fungi that can grow either as an ovoid yeast that grows by forming expanding buds or as a mould that elaborates branching tubular cells to form a mycelium. Because infections are associated with transitions between these two forms the process of yeast-to-hypha transition has been heavily studied in recent years. However, most of these investigations have focussed on the signals that stimulate the transitions rather than the growth of the primary germ tube and its associated branches. This is important because mycelial growth may be vital for tissue invasion, and because it has become clear that the process of hyphal C. albicans is unusual and enables novel hypotheses to be tested about the physiological requirements for cell division of eukaryotic cells in general. Consequently we will investigate how mycelial cells grow and divide both from the point of view of its role in fungal disease and the insights it can provide into the cell biology of the cell cycle. We have observed that during the growth of germ tubes, a large vacuole forms behind the growing tip that fills up most of the cell. Although the overall dimensions of this cell are similar to other cells, it has less cytoplasm. We propose that it does not have sufficient cytoplasm to progress through the cell division cycle. At a specific point in the cell cycle called START, cells must achieve a certain minimal cell size. We therefore hypothesise that the large vacuole left behind after cell division prevents these cells from passing through START in the division cycle. We have also shown that the vacuole is not equally divided between the two daughter cells formed after cell division, and that the younger daughter cell acquires most of the cytoplasm and the mother cell retains most of the vacuole. Vacuole division and inheritance is a carefully regulated process about which we have learned much from the related yeast-like fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To test out hypothesis that vacuole inheritance and distribution determines whether growth or growth arrest of cells occurs within the mycelium, we will make defined mutations in genes that regulate vacuole partitioning at cell division. We can predict from studies in S. cerevisiae exactly what mutations we will need to make to be able to alter the normal vacuole pattern in cells. These mutants will enable us not only to find out how vacuoles control cell division, but also to address questions about how the cell cycle in regulated in higher eukaryotic cells. With a range of mutants we will be able to dissect the regulatory pathways through which hyphae and branches of mycelia grow. We will also be able to assess whether normal branching is important for the ability of this fungus to establish diseased lesions in animal tissues. Importantly, many other important fungi, including many plant pathogens, control the type of growth they undergo by forming a greater or lesser amount of vacuole. We will therefore be able to advance the field of fungal physiology, by undertaking the first in- depth study of the genetic links between vacuolation and fungal growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D011434/1","grantId":"BB/D011434/1","fundValue":"219410","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  As series of primary publications and reviews have been generated.

It is one of many fungi that can grow either as an ovoid yeast that grows by forming expanding buds or as a mould that elaborates branching tubular cells to form a mycelium. Because infections are associated with transitions between these two forms the process of yeast-to-hypha transition has been heavily studied in recent years.

This is important because mycelial growth may be vital for tissue invasion, and because it has become clear that the process of hyphal C. albicans is unusual and enables novel hypotheses to be tested about the physiological requirements for cell division of eukaryotic cells in general. Consequently this project investigated how mycelial cells grow and divide both from the point of view of its role in fungal disease and the insights it can provide into the cell biology of the cell cycle. \n\n\n\nWe observed previously that during the growth of germ tubes, a large vacuole forms behind the growing tip that fills up most of the cell. Although the overall dimensions of this cell are similar to other cells, it has less cytoplasm. We hypothesised that it does not have sufficient cytoplasm to progress through the cell division cycle. At a specific point in the cell cycle called START, cells must achieve a certain minimal cell size. We therefore suggested that the large vacuole left behind after cell division prevents these cells from passing through START in the division cycle. We had also shown that the vacuole is not equally divided between the two daughter cells formed after cell division, and that the younger daughter cell acquires most of the cytoplasm and the mother cell retains most of the vacuole. \n\nIn this grant we tested the hypothesis that this mode of vacuole inheritance determines cell cycle progression and therefore the branching of hyphae. We constructed mutants that we predicted would affect vacuole inheritance at cell division and then determined whether cell cycle timing, manifest as a change in branching frequency, was affected. Eight tetracycline-regulated conditional mutants were constructed that were affected at different stages of the vacuole inheritance pathway. Under repressing conditions, vac7, vac8 and fab1 mutants generated mycelial compartments with more symmetrically distributed vacuoles and increased branching frequencies. Repression of VAC1, VAM2, and VAM3 resulted in sparsely branched hyphae, with large vacuoles and enlarged hyphal compartments. Therefore, our central hypothesis was upheld by our experiments. \n\n\n\nIn addition, we used time lapse microscopy to carefully characterise the pattern of vacuolation in the yeast, pseudohyphal and hyphal forms of C. albicans. Some novel observations were made of unusual patterns of vacuole inheritance and cell division in these cell types. We also characterised a gene (ABG1) that we had established previously affected vacuole inheritance and branching and showed that the defect lay in the mechanism by which cell membrane is recycled in a process called endocytosis. By the end of this project we were able to accomplish all the major objectives listed in the original project proposal. The outputs were primarily of academic importance. The work was communicated however in outreach events as described. As stated below, the work is primarily of academic importance, although the mutants generated have the potential to define drug targets for the future.
