{"id":"673F172F-42A2-4C02-8DE1-74B18EABF113","title":"The Apostates: A Qualitative Study of Ex-Muslims in Britain","abstractText":"<p>This study explores the phenomenon of Muslim apostasy from the perspective of self-described Muslim apostates. Drawing on life-history interviews with a group of ex-Muslims in Britain, it will provide a detailed qualitative account of what it means and what it is like for apostates to disaffiliate from Islam. It will also conduct interpretive narrative analysis of ex-Muslim published and online personal testimony, as well as semi-structured interviews with politically active Muslim 'career apostates'. The main focus of the study will be on the leaving-process and its ramifications as they are experienced and understood by apostates themselves. </p>\n\n<p>The key aims of the study are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to provide a close understanding of the experiences and narratives of Muslim apostates living in Britain </li>\n\n <li>to illuminate the dynamics by which individuals become Muslim apostates </li>\n\n <li>to describe the ramifications of apostatizing from Islam for the apostate and to document the various responses which the apostate's leave-taking provokes</li>\n\n <li>to map the political activities of Muslim 'career apostates', and to offer an account of their role.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This study will be of interest not only to a broad range of sociologists, but also to policy-makers interested in the question of religious freedom, and social cohesion more broadly, in contemporary multicultural societies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I018468/1","grantId":"ES/I018468/1","fundValue":"69931","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Cottee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
