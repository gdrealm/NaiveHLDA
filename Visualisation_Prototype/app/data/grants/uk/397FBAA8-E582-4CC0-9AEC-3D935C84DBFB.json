This is essentially what happens during a heart attack. It is essential therefore that the flow in the blocked coronary artery is rapidly restored (reperfusion) if the heart muscle is to survive. During ischaemia and reperfusion toxic forms of oxygen (free radicals) are produced that damage crucial components of the cell, including proteins. We have developed several new methods that allow us to identify heart proteins that are oxidised by free radicals during ischaemia and reperfusion. The identification of these proteins will help us understand the mechanisms of injury during ischaemia and reperfusion and identify possible therapeutic strategies to combat injury during a heart attack.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600785","grantId":"G0600785","fundValue":"337066","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Eaton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
