This step enables the cell to 'mark' certain proteins so that their behaviour can be later controlled. Ubiquitin (Ub) and Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) form a family of proteins that are chemically attached to and removed from proteins in order to modify their function. SUMOs are involved in three important processes within the cell: they play crucial roles in regulating cell multiplication; are involved in how cells respond to damage to their genetic material (DNA); and control which genes are &quot;switched on&quot; or &quot;switched off&quot; in response to the environment. Diseases such as cancer arise when a series of unwelcome changes occur in some of these cellular processes, causing the cell to multiply out of control. Before we can identify what goes wrong in cancers it is necessary to understand exactly how our cells normally work. \n\nIn this proposal two teams of researchers from the groups of Prof Steve Matthews (Imperial College) and Ron Hay (Dundee) have linked up to decipher how poly-SUMO protein chains are recognised and the downstream effects are elicited. The focus is on characterising the mechanism of substrate recognition by RNF4. RNF4 is a small protein that specifically recognises poly-SUMO chains on proteins and then attaches Ub to these substrates, which subsequently targets them to the proteasome for degradation. Regions of RNF4 contain SUMO interaction motif (SIMs) that 'fish-out' poly-SUMO chains. By using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the shape and flexibility of protein complexes will be imaged in solution. Insight from these structural studies will be used to understand the features that control poly-SUMO recognition. This will shed light on the mechanisms that underlie fundamental aspects of cellular regulation, and the aberrant pathways that can lead to disease and cancer. In turn, this could lead to new ways of treating many types of cancer, for example, by developing drugs that block the activity of certain molecules that regulate SUMO activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J016799/1","grantId":"BB/J016799/1","fundValue":"344999","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Matthews","coPersons":["Peter  Simpson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) can form polymeric chains that are important signals in cellular processes such as meiosis, genome maintenance and stress response. The SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 engages with SUMO chains on linked substrates and catalyses their ubiquitination, which targets substrates for proteasomal degradation. Here we use a segmental labelling approach combined with solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and biochemical characterization to reveal how RNF4 manipulates the conformation of the SUMO chain, thereby facilitating optimal delivery of the distal SUMO domain for ubiquitin transfer The new detailed molecular images reveal how the disordered part of RNF4 can recognise and deliver SUMO chains to the ubiquitin-attachment site Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
