This research project analyses the impact credit constraints have on how firms structure their dealings with their partners in the supply chain; and hence how imperfect capital markets can impact consumer surplus through the real economy. </p>\n\n<p>The investigators will embed the leading understanding of credit constraints into a supply chain contracting model and so aim to address:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do credit constrained firms with investment opportunities charge too high prices?</li>\n\n <li>Do credit constraints allow larger firms to agree lower per unit input prices? And to invest more?</li>\n\n <li>Does tight money (high interest rates) raise consumer prices while also lowering investment levels?</li>\n\n <li>Do credit constrained firms exposed to market risk wish to outsource or insource operations?</li>\n\n <li>Should credit constrained firms seek 'slotting fees' or risk sharing partnerships?</li>\n\n <li>What is the optimal way for such contracts to be structured?</li>\n\n <li>Do credit constraints make firms vulnerable to exclusive deals?</li>\n\n <li>Do such exclusive deals bundled with a risk sharing partnership lower consumer welfare (via higher prices), or raise it (via increased investment)?<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G037566/1","grantId":"ES/G037566/1","fundValue":"69570","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Ernest Thanassoulis","coPersons":["Volker  Nocke"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
