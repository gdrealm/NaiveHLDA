{"id":"F8A49212-CF3F-460B-A374-F069F9B9F026","title":"HyperNet: Hypercomputation Research Network","abstractText":"The interdisciplinary Future Trends in Hypercomputation workshop was held in Sheffield from 11-13 September 2006. We request funding to establish a Follow-On Network to promote and coordinate research in the novel area of Hypercomputation. The network will initially comprise three main centres in the UK (Sheffield, York and Cambridge) with affiliates at a further 7 sites worldwide: 2 in Europe, 3 in the USA, 1 in Australia and 1 in New Zealand. We will coordinate with our European affiliates to promote a further bid for FP7 funding. Our American affiliates are likewise actively discussing the formation of a NSF-funded sister network.We will hold five Network meetings, at 9-monthly intervals, and fund up to five individual research exchanges each year. We will actively engage with postgraduate research students, and provide bursaries to support their attendance at the meetings. Since many of our affiliates are based outside the UK, we will make full use of internet technologies to promote a high valued-added web site with interactive communities, downloadable resources and a carefully annotated historical archive. To encourage continued collaboration on a day-to-day basis, all members and affiliates will be provided with virtual-conferencing equipment and software.In addition to publishing in the academic literature, we also recognise the need to engage with the general public. We have been granted affiliation as an independent body under the general Grand Challenge 7 (Non-Classical Computation) umbrella, and will endeavour to generate examples of practical engineering benefit to the wider community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E064183/1","grantId":"EP/E064183/1","fundValue":"61073","fundStart":"2008-01-17","fundEnd":"2011-01-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Paul Stannett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
