The project responds to the call for harnessing entrepreneurship and innovation, by the UK and Chinese governments, as the engine for economic and social prosperity, and the call for greater UK-China cooperation in science and technology. The main challenge for the UK is not about how to increase the supply of scientific discovery, as reported in the Lambert Review, but how to exploit innovative ideas and develop new products. The UK’s challenge reflects its philosophical and cultural traditions that purport originality and the contribution of self, in contrast with the Chinese culture that stresses continuity of past and present and the harmony of individuals within a collective entity. This cultural aspect frames the project’s key argument: UK and Chinese firms differ in their values of promoting organisational diversity and shared vision that influence their entrepreneurial capacity. The project will collect 300 questionnaires (consisting of quantitative and qualitative data) from publicly listed high-tech firms headquartered in the UK and mainland China.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000243/1","grantId":"ES/F000243/1","fundValue":"156283","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine L.
