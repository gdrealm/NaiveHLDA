{"id":"400D8936-AE0C-4AC8-81ED-935A68363489","title":"Innovative cell-based technologies for bone regeneration (REGENBONE)","abstractText":"Our technology will provide new methods of stimulating bone fracture repair that will shorten healing times and improve quality of care. This is particularly relevant for difficult to heal wounds such as non-union fractures. The development of consistent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) based therapeutic protocols is a major step that would enable Cell Therapy strategies to be used in routine clinical application. We will combine our well characterised human MSC preparations having known bone-forming potency with two novel systems of cell stimulation: (1) we have developed a novel technology allowing application of an electric field (EF) to control cell migration and enhance osteoblast differentiation; (2) Smith &amp; Nephew plc have developed a low-energy ultrasound system that accelerates healing of bone fractures by 38% in humans. These innovative approaches of stimulating new bone formation from MSCs are proposed for bone regeneration in preclinical and clinical settings","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000786/1","grantId":"TS/G000786/1","fundValue":"590483","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings from this study have been published, presented at conferences, and have led to further grant applications related to the findings. \nThey have also been important in informing the Industrial Partner of opportunities of stem cell technology in relation to their existing technology. \nThe technology has potential uses in cell therapy, particularly in the delivery of autologous or allogenic MSCs for bone repair Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Iain Ronald Gibson","coPersons":["Colin  McCaig","Cosimo  De Bari"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" Project findings have identified:\n\n- a tissue and passage dependence on Mesenchymal Stem Cell migration in electric fields. \n\n- high cell-seeding efficiency of Mesenchymal Stem Cells on scaffolds.\n\n- a tissue source dependence on ectopic bone formation by Mesenchymal Stem Cell-seeded scaffolds.\n\n- donor dependence on ectopic bone formation by Mesenchymal Stem Cell-seeded scaffolds.\n\n- specific gene expression profiles identified for Mesenchymal Stem Cells derived from different tissue sources. Potential uses are in cell therapy, particularly in the delivery of autologous or allogenic MSCs for bone repair. Stem-cell based products for bone repair show high growth rates in the USA, but their use compared to autograft/allograft/synthetic bone grafts is still small. Most are based on allograft tissue containing a population of Mesenchymal Stem Cells. Stem-cell products are currently being evalutaed in clinical trials in the USA.\n\nExploitation routes have been evaluated and are highly dependent on balancing the cost of development and gaining regulatory approval to the commercial returns.
