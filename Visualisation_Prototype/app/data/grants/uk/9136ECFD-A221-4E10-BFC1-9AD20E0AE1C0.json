{"id":"9136ECFD-A221-4E10-BFC1-9AD20E0AE1C0","title":"Biology of patrolling monocytes in inflammation","abstractText":"The proposal addresses a novel and important question in physiology and disease: how do white blood cells help maintain a healthy blood vessel during responses to danger signal that may signify infection or inflammation. The endothelial cells are the first layer of cells that form the inside of blood vessels. They are submitted to various forms of stress, such as infection or damage in the underlying tissues. Endothelial cells causes blood vessel dysfunction and may result in clotting and increased inflammation, which in turn will compromise the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues.\n\nWe have discovered that a subset of white blood cells called &quot;Ly6C-low monocytes&quot; (1) and their human homologues (2), continuously crawl on the endothelium of blood vessels (3). We also found that the nuclear receptor Nr4a1 is critical for the development of these Ly6Clow monocytes in mice (4). After some extensive work, we found that these monocytes survey endothelial cells, scavenge debris from the endothelial cells, and monitor their health. When the endothelial cells signal a 'danger' that could signify either cell death or viral infection, via a receptor that detects nucleic acids, the monocytes recruit and activate another type of white blood cells called neutrophils, which kills the endothelial cells. The monocytes then clean-up the endothelial cell debris. These findings are entirely novel and suggest important roles for monocytes in human diseases.\n\nTherefore, we propose in this project to test this hypothesis, identify the underlying mechanisms, and investigate the role of Ly6C-low monocytes in kidney diseases or the growth of tumors, using mouse models and also investigating human monocytes. \nThe three aims of our projects are independent but complementary and should inform each other. We will investigate at the cellular level and at the molecular levels in vivo (aim 1 and 2), the mechanisms responsible for endothelial cell surveillance, orchestrated killing, and removal of endothelial cells by murine ly6C-low Nr4a1-dependent monocytes. Comparison will be made with human cells, to help identify conserved mechanisms. \nThe third aim of our study is to test the roles of ly6C-low Nr4a1-dependent monocytes in mouse models of kidney disease and tumor growth. \nAlthough we currently hypothesize that Ly6Clow monocytes favour the renewal of the endothelium in a steady state, it is also possible that depending on the model, and on the magnitude and duration of the stimuli monocytes could also contribute to pathology via an increase in vascular or tissue damage.\n\nThe results from this programme of work should identify novel mechanisms of importance in the various diseases where the endothelium of blood vessels are affected, and thus original therapeutic approaches.\n\n\n1.
