Investigating Renaissance gossip and nonsense in both well-known and less famous works will provide a unique perspective onto the past, an insight into part of our cultural heritage which would otherwise remain hidden. It will also shed light on concerns of the present day as gossip and nonsense still play a part in everday life, ranging from the gossip columns of tabloids to incomprehensible official jargon. \\n\\nGossip and nonsense have a particular power in the historical context of Renaissance France because they mark the point where the contemporary style of linguistic excess, seen in abundant lists, fulsome praise, and overflowing rhetoric, seems to go too far, in terms of either morality or meaning or both. Indeed, the great Dutch humanist Erasmus, whose guidebooks on how to write copiously were enormously influential throughout Europe, was also one of the foremost theorists of the dangers of an unbridled tongue. \\n\\nNeither gossip nor nonsense has been much studied as far as French Renaissance literature is concerned, yet they demand sustained enquiry. Gossip has an important role to play in Renaissance stories, given its unusual capacity both to reinforce links between those sharing gossip and undermine social networks, by casting damaging aspersions on individuals. Indeed, gossip became a literary genre of the time, as male writers expressed their political views through works purporting to transcribe the gossip of women of all social classes. Nonsense can pose even more basic questions, as the chapters of nonsense penned by Rabelais call interpretation itself into question. Yet, like gossip, nonsense can serve political or moral purposes, mocking the kind of legal and medical writings and practices that sought to order the messiness of human experience. Hence our research will uncover the wide range of social, political and moral uses made of nonsense and gossip in French Renaissance literary texts. \\n\\nDr Hugh Roberts (University of Exeter) and Dr Emily Butterworth (King's College London), will manage the project which involves the following activities:\\n\\n1. 2 monographs, on nonsense and gossip respectively.\\n2. A PhD studentship, for a thesis on comic sexual euphemism in French Renaissance literature.\\n3. A symposium and workshop for a team of international specialists with a view to producing a special issue of a refereed journal.\\n4. 2 peer-reviewed articles co-authored by Butterworth and Roberts.\\n5. Collaboration with 2 artists, Dominic Hills and Clare Qualmann, who will produce in interaction with the researchers a blog documenting the creative process, and artwork, to include, for example, iPhone applications which give animated versions of Renaissance stories (Hills), and a performance as well as flyers/posters (Qualmann).\\n6. A website presenting the project, incorporating the project blog and a database of obscenities as an example of excessive Renaissance language.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J001325/1","grantId":"AH/J001325/1","fundValue":"195603","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh Gerald Roberts","coPersons":["Emily  Butterworth"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
