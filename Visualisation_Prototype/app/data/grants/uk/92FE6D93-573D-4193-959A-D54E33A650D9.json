Like Dante's, his poetry is underpinned by a complex and wide-ranging system of thought whose contours are clearly visible in his verse and in the prose works he published or prepared during his lifetime. But the full extent of Leopardi's philosophical reflections first became apparent with the publication in 1898 of the four-and-a-half thousand pages of his notebooks or Zibaldone.\\n \\nThe Zibaldone was written between 1817 and 1832, with peaks of particularly intense composition in the early 1820s. It can best be described as a kind of philosophical diary. Virtually every page sees Leopardi wrestling with the phenomenology of a modern world which he perceives as utterly distinct from what has gone before and which he commits himself to understanding. The Zibaldone is not a simple collection of thoughts and quotations. The almost daily writings sustain a complex structure in which different threads overlap and interweave to answer fundamental questions concerning language, belief, happiness and perfectibility, the organization of human societies, history and culture; they anticipate many critics of modern Western culture, from Baudelaire to Nietzsche to Benjamin and beyond. Steeped in his encyclopedic reading, Leopardi makes the classical heritage, the Christian tradition and the rationalist philosophy of the Enlightenment measure up against each other and compete. Out of this confrontation emerges a wholly original view in ethics, aesthetics and metaphysics. The entries of the Zibaldone - which range in length from a few lines to many pages, sometimes true essays - deal in unfalteringly lucid prose with crucial aspects of the human sciences as they were emerging in the early nineteenth century. The whole work can be read as a kind of hypertext, any of whose observations can point in several directions at once and make links with others for which Leopardi himself supplied some partial indexes. The Zibaldone retains all its power and richness for readers of the twenty-first century; its ambition of scale and multifacetedness foreshadow and feed into our own present's rejection of grand narratives, the need to rethink fundamentals, and the cross-fertilization between disciplines.\\n\\nOur edition gives the complete text of the Zibaldone in English translation (with â‚¬122k already secured for the translation as such). It will include all significant variants, erasures and additions. All passages in languages other than Italian will be given in the original language and in English translation. The edition will include the following editorial apparatus: notes and commentary specifically written for the English-language edition, aimed at facilitating and contextualizing the reading of the text itself; analytical indexes which will provide a detailed map of the contents; Leopardi's own partial indexes and related matter; a listing of Leopardi's sources (including the specific editions used by him); an extensive Introduction written by the editors covering the major structural, thematic and critical issues raised by the Zibaldone in the context of Leopardi's work as a whole and in relation to his contemporaries and successors. The editorial work, over and above the translation per se, will adapt, extend and modify the existing scholarship, provide the necessary support for the English-speaking reader coming to the text for perhaps the first time, and place Leopardi's work in a wider European perspective which sometimes escapes purely Italian readings of the Zibaldone. In addition it will underline the modernity of Leopardi's work, both in the wholly original structure of the work and in its approach to the construction of a philosophical system which its author knows cannot be 'systematic'. \\n\\nThe edition will be published in 2011 or 2012, Two pre-publication symposia will address specific research themes and papers will be published separately in the period 2009-11.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F017340/1","grantId":"AH/F017340/1","fundValue":"154187","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Caesar","coPersons":["Franco  D'Intino"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
