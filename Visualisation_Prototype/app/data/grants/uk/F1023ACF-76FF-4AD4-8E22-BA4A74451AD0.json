{"id":"F1023ACF-76FF-4AD4-8E22-BA4A74451AD0","title":"Development of a Met Office NERC cloud model (MONC)","abstractText":"Very high resolution (~10 to 50 m) modelling of clouds, precipitation and cloud feedbacks is one of the tools that is used very effectively to further our understanding of the interactions of aerosol, clouds and radiation processes.\n\nWithin the UK one tool that is regularly used to conduct such research is the Met Office Large Eddy Model (LEM). The LEM and data generated by the LEM has been fundamental in the development and testing of the core functionalities in UK's main weather forecasting software, the Unified Mode (UM). As well as having a direct impact on the further development of the UM, over the past two decades the LEM has been regularly used by the Met Office and NERC scientists to conduct fundamental research into turbulence, clouds, convection and radiation.\n\nThe aim of this project is to use the LEM as a basis for the creation a Met Office/NERC cloud model (MONC). The development of MONC will address any shortcomings of the LEM, as well as upgrade and modernise its current structure with a view to enabling it on modern supercomputers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L01338X/1","grantId":"NE/L01338X/1","fundValue":"131393","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michele  Weiland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
