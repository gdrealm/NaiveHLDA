The model is based on a modification of the traditional Rayleigh-Benard thermal convection model established nearly one century ago and is now used in a nanoscale system for the first time. Anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) is a common template for preparing nanomaterials including nanowires. The formation mechanism of its highly ordered pores has been investigated for more than 50 years. Our ionic nanoconvection model has several advantages in comparison with the previous ones because we may reveal the nature of the formation of the ordered pores in AAO and elucidate the various effects on this process, such as anodic voltage, anodic current density, anodic time, concentration of the acid solution used as electrolyte, etc. We expect that the anodization of Al plates will become much more controllable after the establishment of our model. We will investigate the microstructures of Si nanowires made in AAO and focus on some new types of defects, e.g. thick boundaries of twin defects, superstructures, detailed structures of surface coating layers and surface recrystallization. Raman scattering of the Si nanowires will also be investigated. This research will allow us to have a better understanding of the formation mechanism and properties of Si nanowires.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E00802X/1","grantId":"EP/E00802X/1","fundValue":"107946","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The first paper published in Advanced Materials in 2008 has been cited over 100 times.
