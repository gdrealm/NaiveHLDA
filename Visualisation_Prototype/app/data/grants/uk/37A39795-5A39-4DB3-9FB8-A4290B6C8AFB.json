The Coalition government's policies envisage that more needs can be met through community initiative, relying on voluntary effort. This project looks at volunteering between 1981-2012, a timeframe which includes two times of economic adversity and one of relative prosperity. It combines qualitative data from the Mass Observation Project, where people freely write on topics such as voluntary unpaid work, welfare, volunteering and the state, with existing quantitative data on individuals’ engagement, as found in the British Household Panel Survey/ Understanding Society, the General Lifestyle Survey and the British Social Attitudes Survey.</p>\n\n<p>This innovative mixed methods longitudinal research investigates trajectories in and out of volunteering, motivations for and barriers to volunteering, individual and community capacity for engagement, and views on the roles and responsibilities of the State, local communities, and the individual in meeting social need. The project will contribute to theoretical understandings of attitudes towards volunteering; build capacity in mixed methodological innovation; and contribute to key user group debates on recent legislative and policy changes relating to localism, and welfare reform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project has received ethical approval from the University of Southampton’s Ethics Committee.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003550/1","grantId":"ES/K003550/1","fundValue":"159713","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are still in the process of producing and publishing our findings. \nHowever, at a recent presentation to the VSSN conference we were informed that the project's findings on routes into and out of volunteering were providing new ways of conceptualising volunteering and 'pushing forward our understanding of volunteering'. The paper attracted considerable interest and provoked discussion during and after the presentation. We hope that publishing these findings, both in a book and through our website will create further impact.\nWe aimed to build capacity and contribute to mixed-methodological innovation through our use of the Mass Observation Archive as a source of panel data. Through presentations at the PSA, Research Methods Festival, and our widely advertised interactive day workshop, we have seen increasing interest in the archive and its use in mixed-method and longitudinal research, Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Rose  Lindsey","coPersons":["Rosalind  Edwards","John  Mohan","Sarah Louise Bulloch"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" We are still in the process of producing our findings. \nHowever, one key finding relates to individual trajectories in and out of volunteering. We have identified that motivations and barriers hold great importance in understanding why people volunteer. Our work on volunteers views on the 'Big Society' suggested that existing volunteers felt disenchanted by this initiative, and felt that their considerable individual contributions over time were not being valued. \nFrom a policy and practitioner perspective, we have found that considering how long people volunteer for, and when in their lives they do this has the potential to reframe the way in which we think about volunteering. \nOur findings on how long and how often people engage in long-term volunteering, and individual exit and entry points into and out of volunteering, have great potential for policy-makers and practitioners interested in the recruitment and retention of volunteers. Our findings have the potential to be of use to policy makers and practitioners who are keen to recruit and retain volunteers.\nOur findings on attitudes towards voluntarism and views on whether the state should provide for social need will be of use to political scientists and politicians.\nOur work on theories of the life-course and the use of mixed-methods in investigating the life-course are pertinent to existing academics, furthering thinking on concepts and methods, and will be relevant to upcoming doctoral researchers.\nOur work on the Mass Observation Archive - the donation of digitised and transcribed material to the archive is less of a finding, but nevertheless likely to be used by academic and lay researchers. We have also built on work with the archive and carried this into a further project, due to be funded by the ESRC, which will widen access to the Mass Observation Project.
