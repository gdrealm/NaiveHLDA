In the 2011 tables, the Government:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>introduced a range of new school performance measures to attempt to better measure how schools are performing for all their pupils, not just the average pupil</li>\n\n <li>introduced a new government target that defines schools that fail to meet ‘floor standards’ in these new measures as ‘underperforming’</li>\n\n <li>made it a government priority that all schools narrow the performance gaps between the most disadvantaged pupils in their schools and their peers. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These changes have important implications - ‘underperforming’ schools will risk being placed in ‘special measures’, take-over, or even closure - and it is therefore imperative that they are critically reviewed and that innovative techniques are developed and applied to explore potential improvements to the accuracy, usefulness and communication of school performance tables.</p>\n\n<p>This grant will do this by pursuing a programme of methodological and substantive research using multilevel modelling, and based on secondary analyses of the Government’s highly detailed pupil and school level performance data which underlie their tables.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000950/1","grantId":"ES/K000950/1","fundValue":"150602","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"George  Leckie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
