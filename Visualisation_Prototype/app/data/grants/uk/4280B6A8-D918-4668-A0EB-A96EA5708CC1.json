While this is clearly essential to prevent excessive and life-threatening bleeding, abnormal stimulation of blood clotting can be catastrophic, particularly if this leads to the clotting of blood within an artery or vein. This is a condition know as thrombosis, and when this happens in arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood it can cause a heart attack. Thrombosis also commonly occurs in the blood vessels that supply the brain with blood, and in this case it causes strokes. Both of these conditions are very common in the UK and are frequently fatal. The cause of thrombosis in these situations is often underlying diseases such as the formation of fatty lesions in the wall of blood vessels that are liable to rupture, but platelets are ultimately responsible for triggering a dangerous clot to form. The use of drugs to dampen down the responses of platelets has been successful in many ‘at risk’ patients in the prevention of thrombosis, although many patients gain no benefit and may even suffer side effects such as bleeding. In order to develop better drugs that target platelets to prevent thrombosis, scientists need to know more about how platelets recognise injury, and then stimulate the blood to clot. In this research project we will investigate some proteins that we have found to be released by platelets when they encounter tissue injury. We know that once released some of these molecules attach themselves to the platelet surface and somehow enhance the platelet clotting activity. The purpose of this study is to work out which of the proteins that are released are important to control platelets and how they work. We will also determine whether these molecules contribute to thrombosis using new experimental procedures. It is anticipated that this project will equip us with a new understanding of how platelets regulate their functions the identification of the molecules involved. This knowledge may lead, in future studies, to the development of more effective drugs to successfully prevent thrombosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701399","grantId":"G0701399","fundValue":"500003","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Martin Gibbins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
