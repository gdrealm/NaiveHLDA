{"id":"CE418973-F878-4CCB-8292-8A2EA00C4DDF","title":"Corporate Governance - New Actors, Processes and Interdependencies","abstractText":"<p>Historically, corporate ownership in the UK has evolved from concentrated family-based ownership, to wider dispersion among individuals, and finally toward institutional investors such as pension funds. The recent emergence of new actors (eg hedge funds) and new instruments (eg hybrid securities) is now fundamentally changing the playing field of corporate governance (CG). Both patterns of ownership and the conduct of owners have become more diverse in terms of the investment strategies, time horizons, and forms of financial intermediation among institutional investors. This diversity challenges our conventional understanding of 'the shareholder', 'shareholder-value', and 'shareholder influence' in the governance of corporations. </p> \n<p>The empirical part of the project will start with a mapping of the 'new actors' involved in corporate CG in the UK. Our second objective is to conceptualise how these changes in ownership relate to UK CG issues more broadly. Here we will review the available theoretical frameworks from a variety of disciplines for understanding the interdependence between ownership and processes of CG. Thus we aim to provide longitudinal and interdisciplinary insights which </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Can advance theory in core areas and go beyond conventional approaches and stylised facts </li> \n <li>Provide potential correctives in terms of public policy and practice. </li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018262/1","grantId":"ES/E018262/1","fundValue":"76303","fundStart":"2007-01-03","fundEnd":"2007-07-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  De Cock","coPersons":["Terence Hugh McNulty","Gregory  Jackson","Glenn  Morgan","Howard  Gospel","James  Kirkbride"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
