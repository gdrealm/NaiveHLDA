This highly efficient transformation is essential for all life, occurs in all cells and is most obvious in the heart and in muscles involved in breathing and locomotion. At the molecular level, energy transformation consists of the breaking down of ATP by the muscle proteins actin and myosin. This chemical reaction is associated with a movement of myosin. The nature of this movement, and the details of the link between ATP break-down and movement of the protein is the subject of investigation in this project. We plan to use unique techniques which allow us to measure chemical changes (using fluorescent signals from specialised probes), physiological changes and also structural changes (using x-ray diffraction). The purpose of the study is to gain detailed understanding of the mechanism by which the relationship between ATP breakdown and movement is altered, depending on the demands made on the motor. This relationship determines the efficiency of the molecular engines. The relationship depends on the type of muscle and can be altered by training, age or disease. We plan to use our expertise to investigate changes in muscle fibres of the diaphragm that accompany chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when breathing becomes difficult with a view to developing strategies to help patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501704","grantId":"G0501704","fundValue":"686849","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Alan Ferenczi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
