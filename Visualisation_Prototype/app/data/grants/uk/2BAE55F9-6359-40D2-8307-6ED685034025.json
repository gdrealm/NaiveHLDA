In this respect, it will push current thinking and research around cultural value beyond the generally predominant focus on a celebration of the various benefits that have been attributed to engagement with the arts and culture (and the value thus generated for both individuals and society) to encompass the more problematic and less savoury aspects of the cultural value problematic.\n\nThe project's intellectual starting point is the adoption of a social-critical approach to the study of the arts and culture predicated on a focus on the social production of the aesthetic and of the value attributed to it. Key to the understanding of processes of cultural valuation as socially produced is the corollary that the same goes for the nature of processes by which cultural value is denied. More interestingly, this project will explore the extent to which cultural value works in ambiguous ways, so that the same cultural artefact might, on the one hand, generate a variety of positive benefits for the economy, for certain groups or individuals and, on the other, create 'negative value' in the form of symbolic violence and stigmatisation of other social and/or ethnic groups. The project, therefore, aims to grapple with these profound tensions at the very heart of cultural value which of course have important implications both for the development of a rigorous cultural value research agenda and for the public policy discourses that are closely linked to processes of valuation.\n\nThis project therefore aims to be field-building, in opening cultural policy studies to the as of yet underexplored area of the ways in which cultural policies can be envisaged as part of a genuinely emancipatory political project. It builds on the work of social theorist Erik Olin Wright (2010) on the development of 'real utopias' that can map the way to a more just future, and aims at 'rebuilding a sense of possibility for emancipatory social change' by considering what a cultural policy perspective might offer to this endeavour. \n\nThe question of how the authority to bestow or deny cultural value is socially stratified will be explored through a combination of theory building work and a case study, which will test the explanatory efficacy of the new theoretical framework, as well as its relevance to policy making and current professional arts practice. The case study at the heart of the project is Our BIG Real Gypsy Lives, a participatory arts project in Lincolnshire that has just concluded. Its aim was the recognition of the value of Gypsies' and Travellers' tangible and intangible heritage in the face of the systematic stigmatisation and cultural value denial this group has endured via highly popular and successful reality TV programmes such as My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. It was produced and delivered by Cultural Solutions, a Lincoln-based independent cultural consultancy, which are a partner in this project. This choice of case study allows for the research to focus on the case of Gypsies and Travellers living in England, who are a very interesting social group to look at in relation to both cultural value and social justice concerns. Qualitative empirical work will be carried out in the form of semi-structured in-depth interviews with the team and local charity that delivered the project, its funders and key Gypsy and Traveller participants.\nThe case study, and the focus on an ethnic group widely identified as 'cultural value-poor', will allow the project to explore what thinking on cultural value might contribute to the goal of a redistribution of cultural authority and the power to bestow value, alongside more traditional forms of emancipatory politics focusing on economic redistribution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005115/1","grantId":"AH/L005115/1","fundValue":"39304","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is too recent for impact to have fully emerged. However, the project included a workshop towards the end of the award that brought together the PI and sector partners, socially engaged artists, academics from a range of disciplines (arts and social sciences), arts policy makers, cultural managers, charity workers and postgraduate students, and participants reported that the discussion encompassing so many different perspectives was illuminating.

However, the project has successfully pointed out ways in which recent development in the social sciences (in particular political theory and sociology), media studies and cultural policy studies can be merged in order to develop fresh thinking on the impact that arts policies and funding can have on strategies for the tacking of misrecognition and social injustice. Findings might be of particular use to community artists and organisations working with the Gypsy and Traveller community, and to policy makers and funders who support this kind of work. \n\nMore generally, the research contributes to research and public and policy debates around cultural value and the rationales and criteria for arts funding, which is currently very lively.\n\nI was able to develop and disseminate many of the insights via gained through the project via my involvement in the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value, for which I am one of two Director of Studies. This is a large scale public engagement and impact project, working with senior cultural leaders to bring insight from research into the process of developing fresh policy thinking (see http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/futureculture/) Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
