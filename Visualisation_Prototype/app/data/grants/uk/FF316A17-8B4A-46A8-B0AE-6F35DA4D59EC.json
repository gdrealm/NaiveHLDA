New forms of care will be personalised to individual needs representing a cultural shift in the approach to care with a greater focus on recovery, health and well-being.</p>\n\n<p>The focus is away from a one size fits all approach to one which recognises people’s differing needs and preferences. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women are invisible in cancer services and their help-seeking behaviours are not widely understood.</p>\n\n<p>This project builds on the Coming Out about Breast Cancer study which revealed distinctive experiences of treatment and care: heterosexism in cancer services, interactions with health professionals and accessing support. Working from a user involvement perspective, the project aims to exchange knowledge between cancer organisations and the LB women’s voluntary sector.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the project will embed sexual orientation equality in organisational cultures and practices through a learning event and practice guidance; to influence health policy through government and relevant bodies and to develop wider knowledge economies about LB women’s health.</p>\n\n<p>The project links to the ESRC goals of promoting healthy ageing and delivering interventions to enhance physical and psychological well-being.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-192-22-0111","grantId":"RES-192-22-0111","fundValue":"7904","fundStart":"2011-05-09","fundEnd":"2012-05-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Fish","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":" This is a knowledge exchange project which translate the findings of a previous study into policy and practice. Key learning points from the seminar evaluation include:\n\n\n\nUnderstanding of distinctive needs of LGBT cancer service users\n\no Awareness of isolation for LGBT\n\no That LGBT patients have the same needs as all Cancer patients and asking sensitive questions will enhance care\n\no Equality and inclusion for partners when terminally ill. Being aware of family and cultures) and overlapping partners at time of death\n\no The need for services to be more aware of LGBT issues when delivering care\n\no Listen to what partners/ carers want and need\n\no Examples given by service users of good and poor practice - makes it easy to translate the experiences for the unaware in terms of the impact.\n\n\n\n Attitudes and assumptions of cancer professionals\n\no Getting it wrong is OK as long as we acknowledge our limitations and accept responsibility for mistakes and apologise\n\no Be mindful of how you address people\n\no Do not make assumptions\n\no Stating neutrality at start of consultation and not making assumptions - giving permission\n\no Do not assume, everyone is different and don't assume they want to come out! \n\no Continue to be non judgemental and inclusive as a clinician\n\no Any queries try and ask rather than avoid\n\no Learning about various methods/ ways of improving your ability when dealing with LGBT people\n\n\n\nAccess to information and support\n\no Great awareness of support voluntary services\n\no Look for collaboration with local LGBT groups to provide support for this group\n\no Need for more information about needs and experiences of LGBT people \n\no There are resources though limited available through Macmillan\n\no Planning LGBT specific support groups\n\no Learning about so many services being provided by Macmillan and other orgs.\n\no Publications and inclusive information\n\no Keep trying to identify funding to set up an LGBT cancer support network!\n\no There's lots of support and resource out there to help us to take this forward\n\no Dissemination widely our sexual orientation monitoring info to the delegate list\n\n\n\nDeveloping the wider team\n\no Feedback to immediate team evidence/ ideas/ suggestions\n\no Identify as a team priorities for action\n\no Implement and evaluate\n\no Needing to get buy in from others\n\no Thank you it has been a very informative thought provoking day - now need to translate thoughts into action.\n\no Educating my team on the importance of this issue as clearly the LGBT voice has not fully penetrated the mainstream\n\no Offer LGBT training to breast care staff \n\no The need to think about action plans for taking this forward\n\no Empower staff to feel more confident and to ensure services and materials are inclusive and tailored\n\n\n\n_ Breast Cancer Care used the policy briefing in cancer inequalities campaigns work and it was widely disseminated by them to Breast Care Specialist nurses in England and Wales, the NHS, and cancer charities. Staff at BCC developed web-pages about the project on their website. Other outcomes for BCC include:\n\n\n\no Disseminated the briefing widely and used in policy/ campaigns work around inequalities in breast cancer;\n\n\n\no Equality and Diversity Strategy: User audits of BCC services, more inclusive imagery and language, working with other organisations, case studies, develop training on understanding the impact of discrimination on health and confidence to access services and increase the diversity of Our Voices;\n\no BCC collect sexual orientation data for volunteers and plan to do so for everyone that uses BCC's services;\n\no Identify patterns of service usage and examine whether differences can be attributed to equalities issues;\n\no Using recommendations in BCC's policy work.\n\nA key learning event was delivered in February 2012 in collaboration with Macmillan for 40 cancer and social care professionals to enable staff to feel more confident in delivering care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people with cancer. \n\nSupporting LGBT people with cancer is a resource which was subsequently developed with the involvement of service users and professionals. Macmillan has been key to disseminating the practice guidance to 4,000 Macmillan cancer professionals; it is available through their Learn Zone site; as an information resource for events; and at Macmillan's national professionals' conference event in November 2012.
