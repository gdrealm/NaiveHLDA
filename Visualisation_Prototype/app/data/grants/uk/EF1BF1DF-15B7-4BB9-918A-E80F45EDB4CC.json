Sleep is vital for human and animal health, and lack of sleep leads to mental distress, poor cognitive ability and mood, and in the long term, to mental illness. In the body, a lack of sleep can produce immune and metabolic disorders. In fact, it seems that sleep is so important that no animal has yet been discovered, whether insect, fish or mammal, that does not sleep at some point in the 24 hour cycle. Yet, we do not know either why, or how, we or animals sleep. We wish to study the mechanisms used in the brain that cause us to sleep. For many years, researchers in this area have been proposing that two urges or drives cause humans and animals to sleep. These are the &quot;sleep homeostasis&quot; (from the Greek, h&oacute;moios, &quot;similar&quot;, and st&aacute;sis, &quot;standing still&quot;) and &quot;circadian&quot; (Latin for &quot;about a day&quot;) drives. Sleep homeostasis is a process that may allow repair of the cellular &quot;wear and tear&quot; on the brain that builds up while the animal is awake. We all know the feeling that the longer we have been kept awake the worse we feel until we reach a point where we can no longer stay awake. This feeling has been called the homeostatic drive. It is envisaged as negative feedback in proportion to the amount of time awake, and it is assumed, although not proven, to be restorative. After sleep deprivation, we and animals sleep proportionately longer, and when we enter sleep, we also sleep proportionately deeper. The idea is that the longer we are awake, some metabolite(s) builds up in the brain in proportion to how long we have been awake. After a time, this metabolite (it might be adenosine or a prostaglandin) is at high concentrations in the brain and induces sleep. While asleep the metabolite is degraded, and the process then starts over again during waking hours. On the other hand, and on top of this homeostatic drive to sleep, the circadian drive ensures that, even if we have had enough sleep, we still always feel awake or eepy at certain regular times (which vary with individuals and species). It might be 10 pm for one individual, midnight for another, or 4 AM for a mouse, but at these times we have an urge to sleep independent of how much sleep we have already had. Various other physiological functions also have different rates depending on the time of day, such that temperature, reaction time, thinking ability, metabolic activity of muscle, liver and heart all cycle, and have some optimal point(s) during the day or night. For sleep, the classical proposal is that the circadian and homeostatic drives add or subtract from each other to determine the overall amount and depth of sleep. These two things converge with shift work (working at the wrong time) and sleep loss. It has been widely accepted that the two sleep drives are controlled by separate mechanisms. However recently, it has been found that mice with changed circadian drives also have altered homeostatic sleep drives. Researchers are beginning to question the independence of these two sleep processes. It has also been discovered that most cell types in the brain and body have their own circadian clocks. We wish to examine one cell type in mice where the classical circadian and homeostatic sleep drives seem to converge: these are specialized neurons that release histamine (an excitatory neurotransmitter) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) during the day, but not the night, and which help keep us and animals awake. We are going to use several genetic methods to disrupt the circadian process only in histamine neurons, and not other types of cell, and then examine the consequences of this using mild sleep deprivation tests. We predict the homeostatic sleep process might be disrupted, because, in fact, the two components previously regarded as distinct mechanisms (homeostatic and circadian), may not really be separate. This work will be a step in helping us understand more about how we sleep.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K018159/1","grantId":"BB/K018159/1","fundValue":"515202","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work would provide basic knowledge that contributes to improving and maintaining general health and healthy ageing. &quot;Sleep is the most important predictor of how long you will live - perhaps more important than smoking, exercise or high blood pressure&quot;. This quote is widely attributed to Prof. William C. Dement (Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford University), the scientist co-credited with discovering REM sleep. Whether one agrees with this statement or not, there is no doubting that we humans, our companion animals (pets) and our farm stock all require sleep for full health and wellbeing. Disturbed sleep is a major co-morbidity in ageing, neurodengerative disease and psychiatric conditions [Foster RG &amp; Wulff K, Nat Rev Neurosci, 6, 407 (2005)]. Yet, from an academic perspective, and surprisingly to most people, there is a great deal that we don't know about the sleep process. Prof. Clifford Saper (Harvard Medical School) thinks that &quot;the way in which sleep is restorative and why brain function is impaired in its absence remain among the most enduring mysteries of neuroscience&quot; [Saper, C.B. et al. Neuron 68, 1023 (2010)]. Thus achieving an understanding of how sleep is caused and maintained is an important research endeavour, which would contribute, ultimately, to novel ways to manage and regularise sleep which are more sophisticated and appropriate than current approaches. Our work will also enhance the research capacity and knowledge of private sector organizations.
