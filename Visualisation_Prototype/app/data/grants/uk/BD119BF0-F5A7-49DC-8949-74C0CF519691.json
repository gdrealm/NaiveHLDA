{"id":"BD119BF0-F5A7-49DC-8949-74C0CF519691","title":"School Supply and the Effectiveness of Conditional Cash Transfers","abstractText":"<p>Many poverty alleviation policies in low income countries aim to increase education levels of children. To achieve this aim, there has been widespread implementation of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes for education, which provide cash to households conditional on their sending their child(ren) to school. Their evaluation has brought about a general consensus that such policies are effective at increasing school enrolment.</p> \n<p>Much less is known about the importance of school provision in the success of such policies and about how far CCT policies go towards changing the amounts of time that children spend in school and at work. This research will address both of these issues. A theoretical framework will be developed to analyse how a CCT programme for education is likely to affect the allocation of a childâ€™s time between school and work.&nbsp;This framework will also show why the effect of the programme might vary depending on the availability and quality of schools. The model will be estimated using data from a CCT programme in rural Colombia, both to assess how easily children switch between hours in school and work, as well as to see whether the impact of the programme varies according to local school conditions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000920/1","grantId":"ES/D000920/1","fundValue":"40205","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice Marie Mesnard","coPersons":["Emla Olivia Fitzsimons"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
