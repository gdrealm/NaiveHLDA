This proposal considers the extent to which, and the leading dimensions along which, the returnee can impact positively on the source country, and in turn how the sending country can maximise its benefits from temporary migration by supporting the returnee. Hence, resulting in a win-win-win situation for migrants, sending countries and receiving countries.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to highlight the determinants and impacts of return migration by focusing on two North African countries, Egypt and Morocco, which share similar domestic labour market problems such as high youth unemployment and lack of jobs, but have different migration profiles in terms of gender, education and destination.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0678","grantId":"RES-167-25-0678","fundValue":"326361","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jackline  Wahba","coPersons":["Christian  Schluter"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
