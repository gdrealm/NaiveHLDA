Working closely with participating services and national policymakers, the research will seek to develop insights into the infrastructural support and professional development needs of the career guidance profession in the 14-19 sector.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F029039/1","grantId":"ES/F029039/1","fundValue":"81438","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Colley","coPersons":["Cathy  Lewin"],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
