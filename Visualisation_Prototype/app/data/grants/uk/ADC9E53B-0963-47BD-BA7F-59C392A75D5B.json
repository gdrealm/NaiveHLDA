This proposal focuses on understanding and then reducing coupled hindcast bias errors at a range of lead times. It will exploit hindcast sets already performed or planned at ECMWF and the Met Office, making modifications to the assimilation increments or bias schemes. Full-field hindcasts will be used where the model is forced as close to the observations as possible. The lead-time dependent climate drift contains potentially important information about the model process errors. This proposal will develop and test several methods to analyse and reduce this lead-time dependent drift, including matching initial condition drift to perturbed physics drifts, matching atmosphere-ocean initialization increments to coupled model covariances, modifying covariances to focus on longer lead time predictions, and modifying already used bias schemes within operational systems. This diversity of approaches, focused on reducing coupled bias, is a strength of the proposal allowing promising results to be developed more fully. This approach, the experience of the team, and the focus on modifications to already existing operational coupled systems will also allow this project to operate effectively as an integrating project for the whole NGWCP program, allowing promising results from other funded projects to be brought through and tested within operational model environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J005894/1","grantId":"NE/J005894/1","fundValue":"608499","fundStart":"2012-07-09","fundEnd":"2017-04-08","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Haines","coPersons":["Rowan Timothy Sutton","Peter Jan  Van Leeuwen","Edward  Hawkins"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" We have shown how shocks (sudden changes) arise in coupled atmosphere-ocean forecast models that are used for longer term weather predictions, due to the methods chosen to start the forecasts.
