This failure of grafts is largely due to poor 'sticking' to the damaged area to be treated, commonly termed the wound bed. One of the reasons these 'bad' wound beds are difficult to adhere to is due to the lack of naturally occurring sticky molecules. Therefore one approach might be to use a glue that introduces some of these proteins into the wound or that can bind strongly to the few that are present and form a bond between incoming grafted cells and the wound bed to be treated. One of the proteins that is present in the bad wound beds is a molecule called Type 1 collagen. \n\nIn this project we plan to use a novel approach to produce a 'bioglue' that will promote sticking of skin grafts to bad wound beds via type 1 collagen. This project will take advantage of the fact that several human infecting bacteria produce small molecules that bind strongly to collagen 1 which they use to stick down to human cell surfaces such as the airways or skin. Our idea is to engineer a selection of these small protein molecules into a protein fibre- also produced by bacteria, called the flagellum. \n\nThe approach to engineering these protein fibres will follow the philosophy of an emerging biological field known as synthetic biology. At its core synthetic biology aims to design or re-engineer biological parts into often novel combinations in a modular manner that allows easy re-use and re-engineering of these parts for use in alternative applications. One can consider an analogy with Lego in which the same component parts can be used to produce a car, a house or a crane. To this end the bacteria flagellum is amenable to this kind of manipulation. The sections of this protein that direct formation of a fibre form can be thought of as two modules at each end of the protein which in isolation would form a fibre forming protein device with a central section that can be replaced with another module. We have engineered such a device to accept sticky protein modules in place of this section and so display thousands of these sticky proteins along the length of the fibre. In our initial studies we have placed one of these type 1 collagen molecules and shown that it can bind type 1 collagen and improve sticking of skin-like cells in a laboratory setting. \n\nThe aim of this project is to produce a range of these type 1 collagen binding sticky flagella and test their ability to stick natural skin cells to surfaces and also improve adherence of these cells in a laboratory based skin grafting assay that we have developed.\nAs well as applications to skin grafting these bioglues may also have other medical applications in situations where improving adherence of human tissue is required. In addition these easy to manipulate flagella display devices will be of great use to this emerging synthetic biology community for a range of future applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J016322/1","grantId":"BB/J016322/1","fundValue":"95174","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2014-01-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  While the larger impacts have yet to be realised this work has allowed us to have a presence in this area and establish a collaboration with Fujifilm Diosynth as outlined elsewhere, that will ensure a route for impact.

The project succeeded in scaling up and standardising production of the synthetic chimeric bioglue proteins and showed in model lab systems that they bind the target human proteins showing these molecules have potential for use in the adhesion of skin cells to surfaces that might ultimately have applications in skin grafting or implantation of cultured primary skin cells into 'bad' would beds.\n\nWe have also been addressing the issue of improving production of the chimeric flagella proteins (and other biotechnological important proteins in E. coli), a task that has involved performing a quantitative proteomic assessment of global protein expression during expression. We are currently analysing these data and will use this information to forward engineer the strains to produce more protein- data that will improve understanding of production of proteins in E.coli and aid our efforts in collaborations with biotechnology companies. This data willl support a new collaboration with Fujifilm Diosynth aimed at adressing this issue in an industrial biotechnology situation and which is funded at PoC level by the BBSRC NIIB CBMNet. In the longer term the outcomes of this work have the potential to help in the treatment of patients in the NHS and for the production of novel bioglues by the biotech/ healthcare sectors.\n While this technology is early stage we are well placed to exploit both the flagellin bioglues (via contact with Smith and Nephew- MacNeil) and secretion system (through Lonza- Wright).\n\nIn addition our dataset on the proteome of proteins expressing large amounts of flagellin will reveal bottlenecks in the proteome that can be engineered to improve production of flagella chimeras and other proteins to aid in our work on protein secretion and production that has now moved on to a collaborative effort between Sheffield (Stafford, Wright, Dobson), Birmingham (Henderson) and Fujifilm Diosynth (Dr Bo Kara). These data will thus have direct impact on the UK Biotech sector to potentially produce novel IP for this area of the economy.
