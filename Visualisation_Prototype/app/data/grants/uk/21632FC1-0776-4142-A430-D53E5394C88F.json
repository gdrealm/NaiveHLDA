The Programme consists of two basic elements, a core Programme and individual research council activities. Each Research Council has a budget for e-Science projects within its remit; the role of the Core Programme interacts orthogonally with the Research Council programmes; amongst its major aims are development of generic Grid middleware (developed in the Research Council activities and provided for the Research Council activities), engagement of industry in e-Science activities, development of a working UK e-Science Grid and support for and coordination of the various Research Council programmes. The EPSRC, on behalf of all the Research Councils, is managing eSCP in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The programme has been a widely acknowledged international success, and has continued under SR2002 and SR2004. The programmme has been aided by the success of the annual All Hands E-Science Meetings (AHM) which has gathered leading innovators and application scientists together from across the UK, and from related application retreats and technology meetings. These meetings aid the functions of co-ordination and dissemination of the core programme to all UK e-Scientists and raise the profile of UK e-Science internationally.This proposal seeks to provide the means to continue these activites in support of the core programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D054605/1","grantId":"EP/D054605/1","fundValue":"507745","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Clarke","coPersons":["Anna  Kenway","Malcolm Phillip Atkinson"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
