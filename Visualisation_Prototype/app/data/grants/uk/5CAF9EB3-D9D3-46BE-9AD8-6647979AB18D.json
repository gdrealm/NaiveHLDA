Furthermore the recent developments in terahertz technology and photonics systems highlights the need for an ultra-fast photodetector with a bandwidth well beyond 60 GHz and increased electrical power output capability.The photodetector developed at UCL during the EPSRC PRINCE project demonstrated a -3 dB electrical bandwidth of over 108 GHz, with record breaking power handling. It also achieved record breaking output power by direct electrical connection or from an integrated antenna at frequencies ranging from 100 GHz to 1.5 THz, power outputs ranging from 10 mW at 110 GHz to 25 uW at &gt;900 GHz.This Follow-on programme propose to use this pioneering work and its attached intelectual property, and develop it for commercial exploitation. One of the key parts of this work will be to developed the packaging of the device for two main applications that: high data rate optical communication and continuous wave terahertz signal generation. The potential for commercialization will then be tested by using the packaged devices as prototypes for evaluation by a group of subsystem manufacturers, who are potential customers. The work will also include an investigation of the commercial routes to market and optimum product offerings by using questionnaires and doing a market scoping study with the London Business School.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007768/1","grantId":"EP/H007768/1","fundValue":"71750","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alwyn  Seeds","coPersons":["Cyril  Renaud"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
