{"id":"41966006-2490-4541-8DDF-098B7A3418A6","title":"Dynamics, Stability and Control of Highly Non-Keplerian Orbits","abstractText":"Families of highly non-Keplerian orbits devised and developed by the applicant have been a principal driver in the recent development of solar sail technology. These new families of novel orbits provide a range of compelling near-term applications for solar sailing and have led to rapid advancement of the technology in Europe and the US. This project will employ a single postdoctoral research assistant for 3 years to conduct a systematic analysis of highly non-Keplerian orbits for spacecraft with low thrust propulsion systems using the methods of modern dynamical systems theory. It is expected that this analysis will uncover new families of orbits for solar sails and solar electric propulsion, again with exciting new practical applications. The UK has a strong industrial interest in low thrust propulsion which will ultimately be strengthened by this programme of fundamental, curiosity-driven research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D003822/1","grantId":"EP/D003822/1","fundValue":"165583","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  McInnes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
