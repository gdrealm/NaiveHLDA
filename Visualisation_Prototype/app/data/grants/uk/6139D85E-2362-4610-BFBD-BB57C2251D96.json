Factors or ‘determinants’ from three categories: individual and household level (eg. age, gender, household income); service levels (eg. expenditure on health and social services; number of nursing home beds); societal level (eg. willingness to pay for long-term care) will then be entered into the explanatory models and statistical software will determine how important each is in predicting the use of informal and formal care. The analysis will also show how changes in these factors have affected the utilisation of informal care and formal services and the relationship between both over time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2261","grantId":"RES-000-22-2261","fundValue":"26599","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Demi  Patsios","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
