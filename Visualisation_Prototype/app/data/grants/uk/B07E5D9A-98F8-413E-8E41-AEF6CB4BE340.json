This late event in HIV-1 replication requires the resolution of a membrane tether by specialized cellular proteins, namely the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery. Importantly, there is a growing list of pathogenic viruses that also require the ESCRT machinery for replication, including Ebola virus, Hepatitis B virus, Herpes Simplex virus type 1, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Lassa virus and Parainfluenza virus 5. Hence, the pharmacological inhibition of the ESCRT machinery may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity to treat a broad range of pathogenic viral infections. However, there are obvious toxicity mechanisms for future inhibitors of the ESCRT pathway as it is primarily involved in essential aspects of cell biology, including the resolution of a membrane tether that connects the daughter cells at the final stage of cell division. The general aim of this research grant is to delineate specific mechanisms within the ESCRT machinery that are required for HIV-1 replication as opposed to this machinery?s role in cellular functions. These studies are needed to understand essential mechanisms of HIV-1 replication and cell biology and they will also contribute to determine the therapeutic potential of the ESCRT-machinery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802777","grantId":"G0802777","fundValue":"967648","fundStart":"2011-01-06","fundEnd":"2015-07-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan  Martin-Serrano","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
