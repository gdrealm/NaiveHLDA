{"id":"94C98E85-4DA1-410E-91F7-988D47297D57","title":"A Cognitive Perspective on Analogy-based Project Estimation","abstractText":"Analogical or case-based reasoning (CBR) is a knowledge management technology based on the premise that history repeats itself, but not exactly. This leads to problem solving can be based upon episodic memory and retrieval by similarity. CBR has been used for many software engineering problems including support for software project management in prediction and lessons learned. Unfortunately results from using CBR are varied often for no obvious reason. Consequently we cannot predict a priori when CBR will aid problem solving.The origins of CBR lie in psychological studies from the 1980s. Since then, much work (including our own) has espoused a 'black-box' approach to understanding problem-solving in software engineering. Recent interest in CBR, as a knowledge management tool, has resulted in a large literature. However, this has emphasised algorithmic approaches typically used for well-defined problem solving. To solve non-trivial or ill-defined problems, such as those encountered by software project managers, experts use other cognitive strategies (e.g. creative thinking), yet we have sparse evidence about cognitive processes in software professionals using CBR tools. Personality has been found to impact cognitive processes. Therefore it will affect problem solving ability and strategy. The proposed project aims to address the limitations of previous research by exploiting cognitive psychology and computer science to investigate the cognitive aspects of software engineering when using analogy-based tools to improve problem solving effectiveness. This project is intended as a pilot study for this novel approach. We will investigate the cognitive processes and personality of software professionals using CBR to support problem-solving (specifically cost estimation) in situ.. This will yield insights into the effective use and appropriate development of CBR tools.It is a joint proposal between Brunel University (who will provide software engineering expertise and the CBR shell), Southampton Solent University (who will provide cognitive psychology expertise and manage the RA) and EDS (who will provide expert practitioners, real world problems and research feedback). We plan to submit one journal and four conference papers, maintain a project website, a wiki, and publish post-prints of papers in our university open research archives. We will run a workshop for collaborators, academic and industrial researchers to disseminate findings and generate ideas to lead to a collaboratively authored publication. Feedback from the workshop will help develop an agenda for follow up research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G007683/1","grantId":"EP/G007683/1","fundValue":"71548","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Development of reflective practice tool Education Societal","person":"CAROLYN  MAIR","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Southampton Solent University","findingsText":" Overall our pilot study revealed the importance of including an understanding of the cognitive behaviour of software professionals when studying the usefulness of software project management tools. Failure to do so results in an inability to understand the variability in the tools' problem solving performance. From our empirical analysis we now know that the large variations in individual performance can be explained in terms of personality and other individual differences and not just in terms of the problem and tool /method characteristics.\n\nMore specifically, we conducted an exhaustive, cross-disciplinary review of the research literature and found very few studies of professionals solving non-trivial problems in real-world settings. This implies our research is even more distinctive than we first appreciated and will hopefully trigger further studies of this nature, both by ourselves and other groups. Given the ubiquity of software, research that aims to better support professionals manage its development is clearly of value to society. This research is useful because we proposed a novel perspective from which to study professionals working in situ using existing (CBR) software tools for real-world problem-solving and prediction. By better understanding the cognitive aspects of this process we believe it will (i) be possible to design better tools and (ii) easier to match analogical reasoning to appropriate tasks.\n\nAS above, the project benefits EDS (now HP) because it could help develop more effective project estimation processes based upon the use of CBR technology. It will also be useful for tool developers aiming to improve their understanding of the professionals using such tools.\n Research that aims to better support software professionals manage product development is clearly of value to society.
