Research alsoshowed that only 13% of the pregnant women in the UK position their seat beltcorrectly. Incorrect positioning of seat belts can indeed lead to fetus mortality in motorvehicleaccidents. The present innovation, SeatBeltPlus, is a novel car restraint systemdesigned for the protection and comfort of pregnant occupant and her fetus. It offers alow-cost and effective safety restraint system, which is applied to hold the conventional,three-point seat belt in the correct position continually. SeatBeltPlus can also provideimproved protection to male and non-pregnant female occupants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I50091X/1","grantId":"EP/I50091X/1","fundValue":"100586","fundStart":"2011-03-14","fundEnd":"2012-03-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Behice Serpil  Acar","coPersons":["Memis  Acar"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
