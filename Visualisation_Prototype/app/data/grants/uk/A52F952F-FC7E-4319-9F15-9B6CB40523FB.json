{"id":"A52F952F-FC7E-4319-9F15-9B6CB40523FB","title":"The Virtual Seismic Atlas Project","abstractText":"The Virtual Seismic Atlas (VSA) Project will generate an independent, free-to-use, community-based internet resource, which will capture and share the geological interpretation of seismic reflection data in picture and workbook format. Seismic data are expensive to acquire and process, yet give key insights into geological structure and processes. They have revolutionized understanding of Earth surface processes, structural geology, submarine hazards, and shallow crustal processes such as basin fluid migration. They can be used to track hydrocarbons during production and CO2 during subsurface sequestration. Seismic data are a core geoscience resource. Their interpretation, however, needs substantial experience. The skills and knowledge gained in the interpretation of seismic data and the advances in data processing that permit modern studies are dispersed through industry, universities, and government organisations (e.g. British Geological Survey). The aim of this project is to draw these communities together, capturing examples of the geological use of seismic data, and creating a comprehensive common heritage from which to launch future developments in research and training. VSA data, including seismic data and their derivatives, will be searchable and downloadable. Users will be able to search for seismic images, interpretations, data samples and related documents using various geological, geophysical, geographical and technical criteria. The VSA will therefore provide a platform for the community to find seismic examples and analogues, and to compare interpretation strategies and experience. It will generate new research opportunities and will provide an image library for public understanding of science activities. The VSA will be built on the industry-leading getknowledge data management/ knowledge transfer software, developed by BHP-Billiton and Blue Fish Development. Capacity will exceed 10 million documents and will allow 500 synchronous users. The preliminary content of the VSA is being developed with Veritas DGC and BGS who will provide sample 3D and 2D data from diverse settings (including UKCS). In addition, the project will incorporate relevant copyright material from the Geological Society of London. These initial collections are designed to promote other data/interpretation owners to add their material to the site as it grows. Community support is further indicated by the guiding involvement of our patrons, the senior petroleum geologists David G. Roberts and Richard Hardman, and of the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain. Our project partners (Veritas DGC and BHP-Billiton with Blue Fish) are providing in-kind resources worth several million pounds. We request that NERC support the additional development costs of the VSA, namely: 1) a PDRA to engage in geological/interpretation of seismic data, building content and leading new research into geological uncertainty in seismic interpretation, and; 2) travel/subsistence costs for visits to data providers (Veritas, BGS) and 3) computer hardware plus VSA web server installation and support in Leeds. Beyond the VSA website, Knowledge Transfer objectives will be met in several ways: the PDRA will act as act as KT facilitator; personnel will be exchanged for short periods (BHP-B staff will come to Leeds to work on web design and Leeds staff will work with industry geophysicists in seismic data libraries); representatives of the different communities of academic, public sector and industry geoscientists will meet through the project management structure. The legacy will be a self-maintaining digital resource to serve a broad range of user communities in the oil industry, the associated science base and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E002803/2","grantId":"NE/E002803/2","fundValue":"146145","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Extensive use of this KE product (the VSA) by industry, media and education/research organisations globally. \nIt is used extensively by Oil and Gas training companies.

The Virtual Seismic Atlas is a knowledge exchange vehicle that shares the geological interpretation of seismic data. The project designed and, with partners (Blue Fish, Endeca), has delivered a content management, database and image-retrival system together with uploading capabability, and has now populated this with &gt;1000 images from around the world. Images include outputs from publically-funded research together with hitherto inaccessible seismic images owned by companies. Content management and data-retrival systems are designed to maximise serendipitous discovery of images hitherto unknown to the searcher, creating a novel environment for finding geological analogues. The data and images continue to generate new research papers and support graduate research (including NERC CASE PhDs). Future content will in part be driven by republication agreements with key earth science publishing houses (SEPM, EAGE, Geological Society of London) so that the VSA can become a hub for subsurface know-how and geological interpretation. VSA content is accessed by 10sK individuals each month, with users equally split between academic and business IPs. Images are widely used for training - by oil companies in-house and by independent professional training companies (e.g. Nautilus). Images are used extyensively by new-hires to find analogue geological nstructures and to link to published literature,. They are also used for product deisn, for example, structural restoration software (by Midland Valley Ltd) and for marketting existing software solutions (e.g. ffA). The VSA is delivered through a bespoke website, hosted in the School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds. \n\nAccess to images is free and open, without passwords. Use of images for training and research is acceptable, subject to acknowledgement. Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
