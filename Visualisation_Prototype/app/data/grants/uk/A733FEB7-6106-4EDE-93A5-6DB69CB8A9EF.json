The research will explore the similarities and differences in the experiences of this hidden group of young carers.</p>\n\n<p>It aims to develop an understanding of children’s everyday experiences of unpaid care work in families affected by HIV/AIDS:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the push and pull factors influencing whether and why they take on care-giving tasks; the outcomes for children and families</li>\n\n <li>the factors that can reduce children’s vulnerability to negative outcomes and promote their ‘resilience’</li>\n\n <li>caring relationships within families</li>\n\n <li>how young carers can best be supported in terms of policy and social welfare practice. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The child-focused methodology acknowledges children’s active roles in constructing their caring roles and the social determinants which influence these. The experiences of young carers, parents/relatives and key professionals will be explored using in-depth interviews and participatory methods with children.</p>\n\n<p><br />The study builds on Prof Becker’s pioneering and long-standing research on young carers in the UK and Dr Evans’ research on children and families’ resilience in relation to HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000041/1","grantId":"ES/D000041/1","fundValue":"33329","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Saul  Becker","coPersons":["Ruth Mary Evans"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
