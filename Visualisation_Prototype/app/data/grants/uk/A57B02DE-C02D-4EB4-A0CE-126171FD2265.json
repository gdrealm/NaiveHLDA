Accurate non-destructive investigation of this nature has proved almost impossible until recently. However, with the advent of new X-ray scanning machines, both available at a reasonable cost and relatively easy to use, a new world of investigation is opening up. These machines are very similar to computed tomography (CT) scanners one finds in hospitals. However these machines are constructed to be particularly suitable for scanning of materials such as soils, concrete, rock and some metals. \n\nThis proposal seeks funding to set up a new XRCT scanning facility for researchers in civil engineering, bioengineering, manufacturing, geology, archaeology and biological sciences. based at Durham University. The new facility will primarily serve groups working at Durham, Newcastle and Sheffield Universities. However it will be possible for other academics and industry to use the facility as well.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K024698/1","grantId":"EP/K024698/1","fundValue":"759340","fundStart":"2013-06-28","fundEnd":"2023-06-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John DeeksP  Hussey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
