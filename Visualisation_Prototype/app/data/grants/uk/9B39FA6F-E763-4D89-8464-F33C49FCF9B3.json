{"id":"9B39FA6F-E763-4D89-8464-F33C49FCF9B3","title":"DNA Synthesis at the Norwich Research Park","abstractText":"We propose to set up a DNA Synthesis facility at the Norwich Research Park (NRP) with the aim to support the design, generation and exploitation of high-value compounds and bioactives obtained from plants and microbes. These are areas of strength within the Norwich Research Park (NRP) which hosts a number of research institutes with strategic programmes that are recognised as international leaders, in particular in areas around the generation of novel antibiotics and other valuable secondary metabolites such as terpenes and anthocyanins. More recently the development of targeted genome editing technologies have emerged as another complementary area of strength within the NRP. The DNA synthesis facility within the NRP will also contribute to enhance the opportunities to develop computational methods in areas relevant to systems biology complementing other technology platforms within the NRP. The focus will be on the modelling of gene networks, which is placed at the interface of systems and synthetic biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M000966/1","grantId":"BB/M000966/1","fundValue":"1903000","fundStart":"2014-06-23","fundEnd":"2015-05-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mario Jose CaccamoDaniel Christopher Swan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Genome Analysis Centre","findingsText":" Not currently applicable Not currently applicable Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
