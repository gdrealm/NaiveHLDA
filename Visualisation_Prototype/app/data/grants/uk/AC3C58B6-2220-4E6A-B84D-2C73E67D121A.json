The brain is composed of two major types of cells: neurons which transmit electrical signals and glial cells which maintain the wellbeing and function of neurons.\nRecent discoveries highlighted the importance of interaction between neuronal and glial cells for many brain functions, like memory and cognition. Glial cells turned out to an active player in the brain. They can communicate with each other and neurons as well. They are capable to release neurotransmitters - small molecules transmitting chemical signals between cells. Glial cells also have receptors to these neurotransmitters - special proteins located in their membrane. One of the most important neurotransmitters that mediate bi-directional communication between neurons and glial cells are glutamate and adenosine-3-phosphate (ATP).\n\nThrough the course of life, glial cells maintain the wellbeing of neurons and protect brain tissue from neuronal over-excitability. Glia malfunction is related to many brain disorders such as ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and even effects of drug abuse. There is growing evidence, including our preliminary results, that the function of glial cells and their communication with neurons can change with age and these changes underlie frailty of the aged brain. Thus, glia-neuron communication may be of crucial importance for brain longevity and healthy ageing. However, age-related changes in astroglial signalling and their impact on brain longevity remain almost unexplored. \n\nResearch teams headed by the applicants have experience of whole-cell electrophysiological recordings and fluorescent imaging in brains of old animals. Our data on age-related alterations of glutamate- and ATP- mediated glial signalling have been recently published in the Ageing Cell - a leading international journal in the field. We have also developed a range of novel optogenetic and molecular tools for the study of astrocyte-to-neurone communication. The power of this approach is illustrated by our recent paper in Science which demonstrates another role for release of ATP from glial cells in the brain control of respiration. We wish to capitalise on this potential and propose a quantitative study of astrocytic control of age-related changes in communication between neurons and glial cells brain signaling.\n\nThe outcome of this research will be a new understanding of the role of astroglial cells in brain function and brain longevity. Results obtained will also contribute to further understanding of the physiology of ageing and will help to develop novel approaches for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders and strategies for promotion of successful ageing","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K009192/1","grantId":"BB/K009192/1","fundValue":"504844","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Although only year passed from the start of the project, \nwe already published a part of our new results in few articles in scientific journals, including top-ranked journals PLOS Biology and Nature Communications.
