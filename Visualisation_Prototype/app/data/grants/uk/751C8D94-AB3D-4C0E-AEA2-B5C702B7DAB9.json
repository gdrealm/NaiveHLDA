We can follow the journeys of the objects and trace their impact on local styles and patterns of consumption, yet we know little about the impact of this global trade on Jingdezhen itself. To what extent was Jingdezhen transformed by global connections, forged by locally manufactured products? The question matters, because it reflects on China's connections to the wider world in the early modern period. Older scholarship tended to dismiss China's ability to engage with outside influences and 'open up' to trade; more recently, global historians have portrayed China as linchpin of the early modern economy and shown how maritime China was linked to the wider world through trade and migration, but we still have little understanding of connections between the outside world and the landlocked provinces of the hinterland.\\n\\nThis project draws on global approaches to history, but combines them with a close reading of local sources. Its innovation lies in this juxtaposition of global history, which looks at the interconnectedness of the early modern world, and local history, which analyses the transformations of local culture. Texts by local residents, literati and administrators will be read next to such documents as the diaries of non-Chinese visitors and the official records of ceramics manufacture for outside markets. Only this combination of global and local history can reveal the extent to which the local cultures of southern China were transformed by their engagement with the outside world through the trade in porcelain. The project focuses on the porcelain city of Jingdezhen. Exploring local responses to the demands and tastes of global consumers will show the growth of local awareness of early modern global connections, which transformed Jingdezhen from local manufacturing town to site of global connections.\\n\\nThe overarching question that informs this project is: how did early modern global cultural connections transform local sites of manufacture? Specifically, it asks how the manufacture of ceramics in Jingdezhen for markets near and far transformed early modern local culture. We know that Jingdezhen produced ceramics for many different markets, but how was knowledge about these markets communicated? Did this global engagement lead to transformations in local culture? By looking at a variety of local sources across a wide spectrum of genres, I aim to construct a global history of a single locality: Jingdezhen. Despite the extensive work on ceramics and global trade to date, no one has attempted to combine disciplines and place such local sites in a global context, or shifted the focus towards the contexts, environments, influences and transformations of ceramics.\\n\\nThis project seeks to reveal ways in which local sites of manufacture were changed by the global markets they supplied and the social and cultural transformations brought about by the impact of Chinese ceramics in different parts of the world. On the basis of the disciplinary work that has been done thus far, we can move in new directions in the study of ceramics that are both multi-disciplinary and global. This project aims to bring together scholars working in different disciplines and in different geographical contexts. In this way, we can enhance our understanding of the global history of Jingdezhen itself, and China's position in the early modern world.\\n\\nThe methodology used here is characterised by the combination of local and global history. Local materials from a variety of genres, including poetry and fiction and local historiography will be juxtaposed with a close analysis of 'global' sources for the ceramics trade such as the travel accounts of foreign visitors. Three public events are planned: at Warwick in collaboration with the Mead Gallery, at the V&amp;A,and in Jingdezhen. All outputs will be concluded during the award period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F019017/1","grantId":"AH/F019017/1","fundValue":"168923","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne Tjerkje Gerritsen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" The project explored the ways in which porcelain formed a connection between local production and global consumption. The key themes of the research included the variety of ways in which porcelain was produced from its earliest times in the fourteenth century, to its flourishing in the Ming and Qing dynasties; the ways in which Chinese porcelains were observed by visitors to the empire, and integrated into new cultural environments throughout the world; and the ways in which the material (porcelain) created and transformed communities at local, regional and global levels. --to explain the importance of materials and objects in understanding the cultural diversity of today's populations;\n\n--to advance understanding and educational use of our material heritage;\n\n--preservation and display of objects;\n\n--advance mutual understand between Europe and Asia.
