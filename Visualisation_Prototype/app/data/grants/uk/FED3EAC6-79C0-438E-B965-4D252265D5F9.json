{"id":"FED3EAC6-79C0-438E-B965-4D252265D5F9","title":"Efficient computation with radial basis functions","abstractText":"The proposal is concerned with developing more effective computational techniques for the reconstruction of information when the data has little structure and may be in high space dimension.Radial basis function (RBF) methods have proved a popular choice for this task. We intend to continue the development of cheap preconditioning methods for RBFs and provide theory and numerical experiments to support efficient computational methods for reconstruction when data is anisotropic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F009615/1","grantId":"EP/F009615/1","fundValue":"4224","fundStart":"2007-06-14","fundEnd":"2008-12-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Oleg  Davydov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
