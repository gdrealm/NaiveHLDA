The first stage in the process involves the creation of 21 'Community Rehabilitation Companies' (from 1 June 2014) that will be owned by the Ministry of Justice for a period of several months, prior to being offered for sale to a variety of potential providers, including private sector companies.</p>\n\n<p>This project examines this ‘devolution’ of the majority of probation services in one case study area.&nbsp; It will look at the process and implications of moving the bulk of probation work (and staff) from the public Probation Service to a Community Rehabilitation Company with an uncertain future.</p>\n\n<p>The project will seek to understand this process from a variety of perspectives, including those of managers involved in running the Company and probation workers engaged in supervising offenders. The researchers will attend and observe management meetings, collect and analyse policy documents and conduct interviews with staff at all levels within the organisation to record this profound development in criminal justice and, more broadly, of the process of 'outsourcing' a public service.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M000028/1","grantId":"ES/M000028/1","fundValue":"146057","fundStart":"2014-03-05","fundEnd":"2015-11-04","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Millings","coPersons":["Gwen  Robinson","Lawrence  Burke"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
