How parents talk to their children about future events is important in shaping the way children feel and think about them. If parents themselves are highly anxious, it is possible that they will transmit their anxiety to their child in the course of discussions about challenging situations. </p> \n<p>We examine the adjustment to school in children whose mothers experience significant social anxiety and children of non-anxious mothers. We will examine the conversations mothers have with their children about the prospect of starting school, how this relates both to the child’s own way of thinking (using doll play) and to the child’s actual experience and adjustment (including shyness) through their first term at school.&nbsp; We will also be looking at how children remember this important event in their lives and the extent to which these recollections are related to independent assessments of their behaviour, as well as to the nature of mother-child dialogues.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0645","grantId":"RES-062-23-0645","fundValue":"229599","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  they have informed an intervention for parenting problems in the context of anxiety disorder Healthcare Policy & public services","person":"Lynne  Murray","coPersons":["Peter J Cooper"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" We have identified several of the processes by which parental anxiety affects children and raises the risk for the child's own anxiety porblems They could serve as an evidence base for developing interventions Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
