A densely sampled corpus of naturalistic interaction between an Irish speaking caregiver and child will be collected over the period of one year. The corpus will be hosted on the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) and will be the first longitudinal Irish corpus on the CHILDES database. A lexically-based analysis of Irish Child Directed Speech (CDS) and the child's speech will then be conducted. The study will build on research by Cameron-Faulkner, Lieven, &amp; Tomasello (2003) and Lieven et. al. (in prep) which investigated the nature of CDS in English, German and Russian. The analysis will be situated in a Usage-based framework where communicative intent is viewed as central to the acquisition process. Consequently the analysis will focus on the types of item-based constructions used in the expression of specific pragmatic events within the input and the childâ€™s speech.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1125-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-1125-A","fundValue":"3495","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thea  Cameron-Faulkner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
