However, whilst revolutionary technologies have enabled the sequencing of thousands of complete genomes, it is more challenging to determine the 3D structures of the proteins. Although the sequence repositories now contain &gt;10 million protein sequences, less than 70,000 protein structures have been determined. Fortunately, in parallel with developments in sequencing technologies, powerful computational methods have emerged to predict the structure of a protein from its sequence. Currently these methods provide putative structures for ~80% of domain sequences from completed genomes, although the accuracy of this data varies from reasonably precise when structures are modelled using templates based on close relatives, through to quite approximate for models based on remote relatives and where proteins have no structurally characterised relatives. This project will bring together 6 internationally renowned UK groups involved in (1) classifying protein domains into evolutionary families (as this facilitates structure and function prediction) and/or (2) protein structure prediction. As regards the first activity - classification of protein structures - the two groups involved (SCOP,CATH) are the only groups, worldwide, providing this data. However, each applies somewhat different methodologies to make their assignments. Collaboration between these groups, in GENOME-3D, will involve comparison of domain structures and family classifications leading to refinements of assignments and/or confidence levels where the methods disagree. Since manual curation of the data is essential and since the rate at which the structures are determined is increasing, collaborations will speed up classification by allowing the groups to share information on the more challenging assignments and to discuss outcomes. For the second activity, structure prediction, the groups involved use technologies that vary in their sensitivity and in their ability to handle large numbers of sequences. Whilst SUPERFAMILY (based on SCOP) and Gene3D (based on CATH) provide greater coverage they are less likely to recognise very remote homologues, where methods such as GenTHREADER, Phyre, Fugue perform better. For each sequence, we will combine predictions from these different resources and assign confidence for each residue position in a query sequence based on the number of methods that agree in their structural prediction. We will provide pre-calculated assignments and also allow dynamic queries on the methods. We will also build 3D models for the sequences with residue positions highlighted according to agreement between the methods. We will develop computational platforms that integrate the information provided by each resource. To distribute this data to the biological and medical community we will build a dedicated web site. We will also establish web servers that link the methods ie run all the methods on query sequences and then report consensus assignments and highlight differences. In addition the consensus classification and annotation data will also be provided via two major international sites - the PDBe and InterPro. The sequence repositories are expanding at phenomenal rates as metagenomics and next gen sequencing initiatives bring in sequences from diverse microbial environments and report sequence variants occurring across different human populations or associated with different disease phenotypes. Structural data will enhance the insights available from this data. For example, known or predicted structures can reveal whether residue mutations occur near sites important for protein function or interaction with other proteins in complexes and signalling pathways. Collaborations within GENOME-3D will lead to more accurate and more comprehensive structural data for use by these initiatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I025050/1","grantId":"BB/I025050/1","fundValue":"294319","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The Genome3D website has only been live for two years and so the web stats are lower than for any of the established resources contributing the prediction data. However, there is clear evidence that the biological community are starting to use the site with a 50% increase in the number of web sessions in 2014 and 56% increase in the number of users (comparing Nov 2012-Nov2013 with Nov 2013-Nov2014). \n\nThe consensus structural annotation data is being used by PDBe to provide information on protein sequences related to structures deposited in the PDB. The SCOP/CATH mapping is being used by InterPro to guide integration of the structural annotations from SUPERFAMILY and Gene3D in InterPro. \n\nGenome3D structural annotations of Pfam families are being used by the NIH funded Midwest Centre for Structural Genomics to guide target selection for structure determination.

However, fewer than 10% of known protein sequences have known protein structures. This project provided predictions of protein structures for structurally uncharacterised proteins from ten model organisms including human, fly, mouse and yeast. These predictions were made on the basis of homology to known protein structures. In order to increase confidence in the accuracy of the predictions, information was combined from five independent resources, (SUPERFAMILY, Gene3D, PHYRE, FUGUE, pDomTHREADER) and the groups developing these resources collaborated to provide this data. \n\nA computational platform was developed for integrating the data from the different resources and a public website was launched one year after the project started. The new Genome3D resource was publicised in the special issue of Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) on databases and presented in a technology track at the ISMB international meeting for computational biology in July 2013. A workshop demonstrating Genome3D was held at UCL in July 2014.\n\nThe coverage of sequences with predicted structures has recently been extended to include representatives from all Pfam families. Pfam families account for nearly 80% of known domains in nature. A further publication in NAR reports the structural coverage of Pfam families.\n\nSince the different Genome3D prediction methods use either CATH or SCOP domain families, a mapping between these resources was developed to determine when methods were predicting that proteins adopted structures from equivalent families in SCOP or CATH. Since fewer than 10% of protein sequences have known structures, Genome3D data is likely to be valuable for a wide range of biologists and structural biologists. For example, the domain structure boundary information will be useful for guiding construct design for protein structure determination. Structural data is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins function.\n\nThe structural data in Genome3D will be valuable for biologists/biomedical researchers seeking to understand the likely impact of a genetic variation or nsSNP in a query protein.\n\nGenome3D data is also useful for target selection by structural genomics consortia. Since Genome3D provides the most comprehensive structural coverage of Pfam families, it will be used by the NIH PSI structural genomics consortia to target structurally uncharacterised Pfam families.\n\nThe structural annotations will also be useful for bioinformaticians and chemical biologists in pharmaceutical companies seeking to determine whether a drug target has structural analogs that could bind the drug, resulting in side effects.
