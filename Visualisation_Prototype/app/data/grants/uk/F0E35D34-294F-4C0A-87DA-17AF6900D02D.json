{"id":"F0E35D34-294F-4C0A-87DA-17AF6900D02D","title":"The Senses of Touch: Affects, Aesthetics and Technologies","abstractText":"Capitalising on doctoral research, this project unites the results of empirical research on touch and touch interfaces with theoretical developments concerning the body, senses and emotion. The resultant monograph is a synthesis of theoretical, historical, and empirical investigation into the varieties of sensory experience. Through cultural history, philosophy and recent phenomenology and psychology, it reveals the historical genesis of our current frameworks of sensory experience, especially touch. A 'felt' phenomenology is developed throughout the book, encompassing the immanent and embodied nature of touch, touch in new media and technology, and the relationship between touch and emotion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113052/1","grantId":"113052/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Paterson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
