{"id":"044AD8AD-86CA-474B-9974-DC5EC377A16F","title":"Enabling environment: Modelling Well-being in Ageing","abstractText":"The traditional view of older people emphasises experiences of loss and decline. However, there is a growing body of work which challenges this view as an inadequate explanation for experiences which older people themselves identify as associated with well-being.\nThe Network on Enabling Environments (Modelling Wellbeing in Ageing) aims to develop expertise to investigate major determinants of health and well-being in later life. It will achieve this by bringing together staff working on health and social care research into wellbeing of older people, a 25 year cohort study of ageing and mathematical and statistical models.\nThe outcome will be a research proposal for a study that will model and predict well-being in older people, better understanding the relationship of wellbeing to social and community environments, to psychological resourcefulness, and to mental and physical health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900012","grantId":"G0900012","fundValue":"49861","fundStart":"2009-05-07","fundEnd":"2010-03-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Laura Clarke","coPersons":["Neil  Pendleton","Jan  Reed","Peter Anthony Bath","Suzanne  Moffatt","Lynn  McInnes","Maia  Angelova","Tony  Hildreth","Pamela  Briggs"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
