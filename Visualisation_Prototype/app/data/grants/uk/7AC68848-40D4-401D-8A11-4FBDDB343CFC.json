{"id":"7AC68848-40D4-401D-8A11-4FBDDB343CFC","title":"Relational and XML Data Exchange: Semantics, Consistency, and Query Answering","abstractText":"Data exchange is one of the oldest data management problems. It arisesevery time two or more legacy databases need to exchangeinformation while their schemas cannot be changed. The main technicalchallenges are in building target database instances that correctlyrepresent information from the source data, and in evaluating querieson such databases in a semantically correct manner.The foundational aspects of data exchange had not been studied untilvery recently. Over the past few years, commercial products have appearedwhich help one manage e-business applications that communicate data yetremain autonomous. Such systems, however, use ad hoc query answeringtechniques, which motivates much of research on foundations of dataexchange. The goal of this project is to contribute towards thedevelopment of solid foundations for data exchange, concentrating onsuch critical issues as managing inherent incompleteness ofinformation in data exchange, using it in query answering, andextending techniques from relational databases to the exchange of datarepresented as XML documents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E005039/1","grantId":"EP/E005039/1","fundValue":"457581","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Data exchange: XML\nOur work on XML data exchange created the standard that others now use in their work, and provided algorithms that are being implemented in research prototypes.\n\nData exchange: semantics\nRegarding the first group of results, prior to our work everyone used a single model of data exchange, while admitting its obvious shortcomings. We explained that these shortcomings come from mishandling of incomplete information that naturally occurs in databases arising in data exchange. We developed a framework for performing key tasks of data exchange based on the semantics of incompleteness, and applied it in the scenarios of open world, closed world, and mixed semantics. Our approach has since been used by many researchers to provide proper data exchange tools in scenarios where previously it could not be done (for instance, handling target constraints under closed world assumption, or dealing with aggregate queries)  ","person":"Leonid  Libkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The key findings can be split into two categories.
