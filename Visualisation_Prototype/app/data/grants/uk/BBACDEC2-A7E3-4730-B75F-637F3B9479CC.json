The archive, beginning in the 1830s, details the manufacture of pigments, binders, mediums and the preparation of tube paint, thereby providing access for the first time to commercial 19**^ century paint formulations as well as insight into the relationship between the artist and his materials. This unique resource is invaluable for authenticity studies, scientific analyses and the care and preservation of historic works of art.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112330/1","grantId":"112330/1","fundValue":"314105","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Patrick McClure","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
