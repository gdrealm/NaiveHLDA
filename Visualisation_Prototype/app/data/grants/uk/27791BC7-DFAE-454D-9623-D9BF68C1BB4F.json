{"id":"27791BC7-DFAE-454D-9623-D9BF68C1BB4F","title":"Enhancing Engagement with 3D Heritage Data through Semantic Annotation","abstractText":"The 1938 British Empire Exhibition was a stunning display of architectural achievement and a reflection of the life and culture of Glasgow, the UK and the Commonwealth. It incorporated over 100 innovative buildings, including the world famous Tait's Tower and attracted over 12.5million people to Bellahouston Park, Glasgow over its six month run. This last public showcase of the Empire was of huge international significance and continues to be relevant to the study of British social and industrial history and modernist architecture. In 2006, Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio ran the AHRC-funded 'British Empire Exhibition, Glasgow 1938' project which consulted as many sources and individuals as possible in order to build an accurate 3D digital model from which the planning of the Exhibition and its architectural style can be examined. 104 individual photo-real buildings and features were reconstructed together with an accurate 3D map showing the relationship of the buildings, pathways, and water features to the topography of Bellahouston Park. As part of this research, DDS collected and digitised a large archive of related cultural artefacts (architectural plans, photos, ephemera) and recorded interviews with people who had visited the Exhibition and architecture scholars. Limited resolution images, videos, and an overview of the 3D model with some interactivity are available on the project website (http://www.empireexhibition1938.co.uk) and higher resolution versions along with some physical artefacts can be viewed at a special Interpretation Centre at House for an Art Lover (http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/news-and-events/news.asp?id=824).\\n\\nThe aim of this project is to improve interpretation of the Exhibition by linking, in a meaningful way, the related cultural artefacts on which the 3D model was based with the modelled data itself. For example, a photograph of a building could be linked to a virtual representation of that building as well as the position from which the photograph was taken. The photograph itself and its relationships will be visualised from within the 3D environment. Other pieces of information, for example comments by architecture experts or video interviews with visitors, will also be linked to relevant features within the 3D model. Researchers and members of the public will then be able to view and interact with the model, either in true, full-scale 3D at the DDS visualisation laboratory in Glasgow, or through an application downloaded to their own computers. DDS will run 'tours' where members of the public can visit not only the digital reconstruction of Bellahouston Park as it was, but also see our state-of-the-art visualisation facility. Researchers will be able to access and contribute to the data and annotations through future partnerships with DDS.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this linkage between the 3D data and related information, this project will develop and test a tool which allows users to 'annotate' the data, and attach those annotations (or files) to points of space within the virtual model, as well as adding relationships between different attached objects (for example, linking all the photographs taken by a particular photographer). This tool will be extensible so that other researchers can make use of it for other 3D datasets in other subject areas and facilities. This will allow both researchers and the general public to virtually experience and collaboratively annotate environments which are inaccessible either because they no longer exist (like the Empire Exhibition) or because they are too far away or dangerous to access.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H036881/1","grantId":"AH/H036881/1","fundValue":"139531","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas  Pritchard","coPersons":["Paul  Chapman"],"organisation":"Glasgow School of Art","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
