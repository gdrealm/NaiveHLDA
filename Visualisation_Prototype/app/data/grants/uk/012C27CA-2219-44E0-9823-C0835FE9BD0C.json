They are under strong human pressure through logging, forest to pasture conversion and exploitation of natural resources. They face a warming climate and a changing atmospheric environment. These factors have the potential to affect significantly the global atmospheric greenhouse gas burden (CO2, CH4), chemistry and climate. A central diagnostic of the state and changes of the land surface is its net carbon balance but currently we do not even know the sign of this balance. Although estimates of fluxes associated with known contributing processes such as deforestation exist, along with evidence for responses of undisturbed rainforests to a changing environment and substantial inter-annual fluctuations, different estimates vary widely. Thus it is very difficult to determine the overall significance of these independent estimates. The uncertainty of the greenhouse gas balances have also made it difficult to assess the realism of future model simulation predictions of the Amazon, some of them predicting alarming fates for the rainforests. Ultimately, the most stringent constraint on surface fluxes of a compound is its accumulation / depletion in overlying air. A major large-scale constraint on the net balance of the Amazon that would resolve the discrepancy in the various carbon flux estimates is therefore an accurate characterization of the 3D carbon cycle related tropospheric greenhouse gas concentration fields above the entire basin. Spatio-temporal concentration patterns can further be translated into surface flux fields using inverse modelling of atmospheric transport. By incorporating the large amount of existing on-ground data on ecosystem functioning from LBA, the RAINFOR network, and the ongoing TROBIT NERC project / and targeted measurements where knowledge gaps remain - into a coupled land-surface land-ecosystem model, we will develop a properly data-grounded model representation of the system. Further, the model will be tested by comparing its predictions with observed atmospheric concentration patterns. In turn this will permit defensible projections of the future of Amazonian vegetation. Human activity climate interactions and the land river link will also for the first time be included in these simulations. Therefore, we propose a project of 5 year duration based on the following five pillars: 1. To obtain large-scale budgets of greenhouse gases top-down, based on atmospheric concentration data and inverse atmospheric transport modelling. 2. To estimate fluxes associated with individual processes bottom-up, based on existing and new remote sensing information (deforestation and fires), tree-by-tree censuses in undisturbed forests, and river carbon measurements. 3. To use existing, and, where missing, targeted new, on-ground measurements of ecosystem functioning and climate response, in order to constrain land ecosystem and river carbon model representation, which will then be combined in an integrated land carbon cycle model. 4. To couple a fully integrated land carbon cycle model (from 3) into a regional climate model and use it (i) to predict current concentrations, and (ii) to calculate the systems response to a changing climate and human population, given a representative range of scenarios. 5. In a final synthesis step we will analyse and combine top-down (1) and bottom-up estimates (2&amp;3) to develop multiple constraint and mutually consistent carbon fluxes over the four-year measurement period. We expect to obtain much better quantification of a major but currently poorly constrained component of the global carbon cycle, based on a new understanding of the underlying processes and their large-scale effect. The project will also provide much improved predictions of the response of the Amazon to future climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F005806/1","grantId":"NE/F005806/1","fundValue":"1251600","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our results on sensitivity of the Amazon forests to a warming climate reported in Nature 2014 have been widely reported in newspapers and news in Brazil, South America, Europe and USA. \n\nSimilarly substantial attention has been paid to our studies on changes of the Amazon climate and hydrological cycle.\n\nUltimately our results give insight on expected changes of climate and specifically climate 'extremes' over the decades to come, what impact they have on livelihoods and on the Amazon humid forests.

Via CO we have also estimated the biomass-burning component of the CO2 fluxes. Our data reveal a range of interesting results of which the most important one is that during the drier than usual portion of the year 2010 photosynthesis of the Basin’s forests stalled. A second important result is that a substantial amount of carbon was released to the atmosphere during the dry year 2010 by fire. In 2010 the forests were neither a source nor a sink and the Basin as a whole a carbon source of ~ 0.5 PgC. In contrast in 2011 the forests were a sink and the Basin as a whole in balance with regards to carbon. Since temperatures were elevated both in 2010 and 2011 our results suggest that drought was the key control for low carbon uptake by the forests during 2010 and not temperature, contrary to recent assertions based strongly on vegetation models (Cox et al. 2013). Independent comprehensive monthly carbon pool measurements at 14 forest plots in the Basin (see also below) show the same result – i.e. a stalling of photosynthesis during the anomalously dry period. This study has recently been accepted by Nature and will be published early this year (likely date February 6).\n\nMethane Cycle\nOur data permit a first Basin-wide estimate of methane emissions. They are comparably small. A manuscript using the atmospheric CH4 data, wetlands models and an atmospheric transport model (TOMCAT, M. Chipperfield) to quantify and attribute Amazon CH4 emissions is in preparation. The manuscript will be part of AMAZONICA special issue of Global Biogeochemical Cycles (an AGU journal). The relevance of this synthesis study is e.g. apparent from a Nature paper by Abril et al. with the title ‘Amazon River carbon dioxide out-gassing fuelled by wetlands’ which has just been published. We are the only ones who can really quantify the net wetland emissions and characterize the seasonal cycle of these emissions.\nForest censuses at a widespread plot network\nLongterm tropical forest carbon sink\nAnalysing forest plot data (~ 150 1 ha plots) over the last 3 decades – with the last four years of forest plot sampling being part of AMAZONICA we demonstrate that the old-growth tropical forest sink in the Amazon is declining over time (the last three decades). We think this is an extraordinary study / result as it is the first (one of the first?) which based on a systematic forest plot observation network has permitted to determine the vegetation change / response to climate / a changing atmospheric environment. This result is consistent with stimulation of the tropical old-growth forest sink by CO2. The cause for stalling of the sink is that tree mortality is catching up with an earlier growth stimulus. Thus the old-growth carbon sink is in a sense ‘demographic’ effect. A manuscript which we will submit to Nature/Science is nearly ready for submission. \n\nA manuscript synthesizing forest disturbance across all spatial scales of the Amazon using forest inventory data, LIDAR data and remote sensing data has also just been accepted by Nature Communications.\n\nSome Dissemination efforts\nTree-by-tree measurement data are available to registered users at the site www.forestplots.net, where they are attract much interest by researchers in South America especially. \n\nReports on the frequent RAINFOR/AMAZONCIA expeditions are posted at http://www.rainfor.org/en/project/field-campaigns\n\n\nEarth Observations\nWe are completing a highly detailed (high resolution in time (monthly) and space) characterization / estimation of land use change and fires in the entire Amazon Basin. We have focussed in the first instance on the state Mato Grosso because it is one of the frontier states and also to develop the methodology. For this region we find that a total of 10.7% of the state area burned at least once from June to mid-October 2010. This corresponds to 32% of the total pristine vegetation remaining in Mato Grosso. The total Carbon loss (Tg) corresponded to 74 to 138, the Gross C emission in 2010 (Tg) corresponded to 46 to 105 and the Committed C emission (Tg) were estimated to be 88 to 109 Tg C. \nSimilar estimates for 2010,11, 12 and for the entire Basin are nearly ready and will be used to obtain complementary information to atmospheric greenhouse gas data and ongoing processes and to obtain more detail on deforestation, land use change and potentially socio-economic drivers. \n\nEcosystem Flux Measurements\nA flux tower in Peru was constructed in late 2011, at the Explorers Inn, Tambopata. The site was chosen because of the ample data on soil chemistry (Quesada et al. Biogeosciences 8, 1415-1440), showing that the site is indeed relatively high in phosphorus and therefore it provides a strong contrast to all other existing other Amazonian flux towers. Measurements have been interrupted by power failures resulting from thefts of solar panels and batteries, and also by failures of the cable insulation on two occasions. It was also found that the energy balance-closure was satisfactory only from one wind direction, prompting the suspicion that the sensors are not high enough above the vegetation to capture all the fluxes. We are currently constructing a 10m vertical extension to the tower using funds from elsewhere. \nAfter one year’s record, it was clear that fluxes of CO2 are no higher than those found at low-P sites; that the C-balance for 2012 was not significantly different from zero; and that the effect of season variation in rainfall is insignificant. The intention is to run the tower for at least five years, measuring climatological variables, CO2, CH4 and H2O fluxes, as well as climatological variables. Methane fluxes are low, and they show an intriguing diurnal pattern (uptake by methane in the day, emission at night). The net CH4 flux is not significantly different from zero.\nA portable flux tower has also been employed in campaign mode Brazil at the River Araguaia campaign, near a permanent flux station run by the. Data from this site are being analysed by a PhD researcher at the University of S?o Paulo.\n\nAquatic Carbon Dynamics\nThe field data collection and analysis has been completed and the focus is on finalising publications. The age of CO2 evasion was radiocarbon dated. Old carbon was observed in the CO2 efflux from the Tambopata site, Madre de Dios, Peru. This is likely to be due to carbonate weathering derived carbon. The presence of aged carbon indicates a need to consider these slow turnaround carbon pools in more detail in future work and include them in the models predicting behaviour of the system under future climate. The results of this study have been accepted for discussion in Biogeosciences. \n\nVegetation Model improvements and predictions\nAs reported earlier we have done and published a ‘classical’ coupled Climate Land Vegetation model study which employs parameterizations of ecosystem function which are more strongly based on observations compared to earlier studies like e.g. Cox et al. 2000 in Nature. Our study which was published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 under the title ‘Simulated resilience of tropical rainforests to CO2-induced climate change’ by C. Huntingford et al. suggests the Amazonian rainforests are more resilient than indicated by the Cox et al. 2000 study. However the architecture of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) exhibits conceptual shortcomings which casts doubts on such prediction results. We have therefore developed/are developing a tree individual-based forest simulator which links directly to forest plot data with many of those plots now characterized by data in much more detail than just by stem growth rate. This new model type includes full demographics (birth, competition fro resource, growth, death) and instead of plant functional types a continuum of tree traits replacing the functional types. Thus artifacts of step switches of one biome to another as is the case with classical DGVM’s is avoided. This new type of model also permits a much closer and more realistic link to data as it avoids the very large mismatch in scale underlying DGVMs. We will assess vulnerability / shifts of the Amazon vegetation using this model at a later stage of model evolution / development. A manuscript explaining the model and applying it to the Amazon is ready for submission.\n\nWe have also developed a Phosphorus Cycle component for vegetation models which is of relevance to the Amazon as parts of it are phosphorus limited. A manuscript on this topic is in preparation. The model is currently being incorporated not JULES, the UK land surface scheme. Insights are important for people living in the Amazon but also for policy making by e.g. the Brazilian government but also generally policy bodies to take measures with regards to climate change, Our results document change in the Amazon which is important for its future resilience and thus for the people living there, the ecosystems but also for prediciting future global warming.\n\n\n\nOur isotope work offers a new route to study and understand the hydrological cycle of the Amazon. The isotope work also opens ways to detect and document changes in the functioning, specifically water use efficiency, of tropical forests in a world with changing atmospheric environment and climate.
