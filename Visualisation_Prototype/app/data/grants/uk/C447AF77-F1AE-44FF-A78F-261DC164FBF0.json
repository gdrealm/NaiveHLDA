The Hub will support the design and conduct of clinical trials throughout Ireland, and will provide training to staff who are designing clinical trials. This will result in better quality trials, which are more likely to produce correct results. In turn, this will lead to more efficient use of funds and improved healthcare for patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901530","grantId":"G0901530","fundValue":"500000","fundStart":"2011-03-10","fundEnd":"2015-03-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Young","coPersons":["Vivien  Coates","Eilis  O'Reilly","Hugh Patrick McKenna","Brendan  Bunting","Frank  Kee"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
