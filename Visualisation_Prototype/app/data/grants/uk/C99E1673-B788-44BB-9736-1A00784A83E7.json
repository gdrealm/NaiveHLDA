{"id":"C99E1673-B788-44BB-9736-1A00784A83E7","title":"Development of a prototype ultrasound imaging instrument for industrial and medical applications","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a prototype laser based ultrasound imaging instrument for industrial and medical applications in collaboration with a UK SME, Precision Acoustics Ltd. The technology is based upon a novel patent-protected optical sensing technology that was invented at UCL and its feasibility subsequently demonstrated under a major 3m EPSRC funded research programme. Having demonstrated proof-of-concept, the technology is now ripe for commercial exploitation. The Collaboration Fund will be used to achieve this by constructing a prototype instrument for a targeted application, namely, imaging the output of therapeutic medical ultrasound devices such as those used to fragment kidney stones or destroy cancerous tumours in order to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Although effort will be focused on this specific application, the concept is regarded as a technology platform which, in the longer term, will form the basis of a range of instruments each targeted at a specific application within the significantly larger industrial non destructive testing (NDT) and medical imaging markets. For example, with additional development, the same technology could ultimately be used to visualise faults in engineering materials or as a medical imaging system for the detection, diagnosis and treatment monitoring of cancer and cardiovascular disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H502300/1","grantId":"EP/H502300/1","fundValue":"99802","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Christopher Beard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
