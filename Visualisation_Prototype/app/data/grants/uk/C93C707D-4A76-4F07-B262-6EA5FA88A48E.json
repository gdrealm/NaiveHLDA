The point of departure for this series is the extent to which the costs of environmental ‘good citizenship’ can be off-set, for first movers, by short-term marketing opportunities as well as the longer-term benefits that may come from anticipating the wider&nbsp; trajectory towards environmental regulation. The ecological redevelopment of universities will be used as the focus for an exploration of this topic. A range of participants including academics, university managers and private sector consultants will be given the opportunity to examine the implications of sustainability for universities. While the technical dimensions of the problem relating to energy usage, construction methods, recycling and ‘campus metabolism’ etc will provide a context for this discussion,&nbsp;an important focus will be on the business/marketing and research/teaching opportunities. Sessions will address issues such as the built environment, logistical systems and procurement, competition in the global HE sector, marketing and&nbsp;eco-branding, funding, and the environment as an integrating theme in teaching and research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4256","grantId":"RES-451-25-4256","fundValue":"12640","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Alexander Quilley","coPersons":["Andrew  Dobson","Charles William Young"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
