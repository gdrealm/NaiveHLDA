Lightweighting will be achieved by development of a sandwich structure comprising a very low density, starch derived, fibre reinforced foam core which is afforded strength by lamination with a highmodulus protein derived thermoplastic. The resulting structure will be entirely bio-based and formed from starting materials which are commercially available. A combination of innovative foaming methods, fast cycle time and low price of starting raw materials indicate that these materials will be both cost and performance competitive with their synthetic counterparts immediately.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F006101/1","grantId":"DT/F006101/1","fundValue":"303928","fundStart":"2008-05-26","fundEnd":"2011-11-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jim  Song","coPersons":["Karnik  Tarverdi"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
