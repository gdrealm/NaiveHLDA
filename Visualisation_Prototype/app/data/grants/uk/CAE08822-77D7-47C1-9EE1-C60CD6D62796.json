However, some people without perceptual or intellectual impairments and without neurological damage find face recognition extremely difficult.</p>\n\n<p>In the past three years, we have recruited a large group of face-blind individuals, and have used EEG-based methods to assess the sources of their face recognition problems. So far, our results have shown that some face-blind individuals have impaired visual memory for familiar faces. For others, access to these face memories is disrupted. We have also found initial evidence that face perception is atypical in face-blindness. We will now test whether this affects specific aspects of face perception, including the perception of salient face parts, the global processing of facial configurations, or the perception of faces from different viewpoints. We will use eye-tracking to study whether face-blind people look at faces differently, and whether they use different parts of a face when trying to identify it.</p>\n\n<p>This research will expand our knowledge of why some people have severe deficits in face recognition. Such deficits can have an enormous impact on their social lives. Many have difficulty maintaining friendships due to perceived snubs and their recognition difficulties at work can be extremely troubling.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002457/1","grantId":"ES/K002457/1","fundValue":"379355","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is surprisingly common and can cause serious social difficulties. Individuals affected by this condition formed contact groups aimed at providing assistance and support, increasing public understanding of DP, and supporting research aimed at uncovering the causes of DP. Our current ESRC-funded project is at the centre of these activities in London and south-east England. The London-based group of DPs involved in our research is the world's largest group, and has become a focal point for formal and informal contacts between DPs, and for a series of initiatives that go well beyond our core research into DP, as listed below. We will further develop and increase these\nand related impact activities in the coming years,\n\n- Organisation of an annual face-blindness Open Day Event at Birkbeck, aimed to provide people with prosopagnosia in the London area with an opportunity to meet each other and to learn about recent research findings. Our first Open Day held on 20 September 2011 was attended by about 40 DPs, representing the largest meeting of DPs ever. See article in the face-to-face newsletter edition: http://www.faceblind.org/links/Face%20to%20Face%20Newsletter%20-%20Winter%202012.pdf \n\n- Contributions to a bi-annual newsletter (&quot;Face-to-Face&quot;), available at faceblind.org (4 issues to date). Its aim is to keep DPs and interested members of the public updated about the latest prosopagnosia research, about our ongoing and planned research studies, and to share stories and experiences. We are currently planning the first edition of our own London-based newsletter.\n\n- Maintaining a dedicated facebook page for London-based DPs: http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=173408949437929&amp;amp;id=100003064768549#!/groups/117013401655030/\n\n\n- Contributing to meetings of the London-based DP support group and hosting it on a quarterly basis at the Henry Wellcome Building. We will provide drop-in and information sessions, which are particularly important for those DPs recently diagnosed so that they meet other people similarly affected and to get a more in-depth understanding of their condition. These sessions will be open to those currently attending the London Faceblind group at its location at the Westminster Pastoral Foundation building in Central London, recently diagnosed participants that were tested in our lab, and other DPs that we will notify of the group via both the faceblind.org website and the DP facebook group.
