The essence of the methods which are to be developed within the project is in applying novel theoretical distributions for explaining macroeconomic uncertainties, where the drastic events are treated as intrinsic characteristics of these distributions. This new class of distributions (often called the tempered stable distributions) allows for flexible modelling of various types of extreme scenarios, asymmetries and odd events. </p>\n\n<p>There are three groups of tasks here. The first group aims at developing technical procedures for the analysis of such tempered stable distributions which are particularly well suited for describing macroeconomic uncertainties. The second group deals with the analysis of time series of data of macroeconomic indicators with the use of tempered stable distributions. Within the third group of tasks new ways of forecasting uncertainties for long horizons will be investigated. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I009957/1","grantId":"ES/I009957/1","fundValue":"421852","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  So far, main findings of the project regarding forecasting and reducing macroeconomic uncertainty, are at early stages of implementation. There is an active interest of the Central Bank of Estonia in our findings and they are being considered, with the perspective of implementation, at the National Bank of Poland, the central bank of Poland. More specifically, one of the members of the research team will begin in November a three months visit to the Central Bank of Estonia, with the aim of implementation of the findings. Possibilities of wider implementation, most notably at the Bank of England, are currently being discussed.

We have found that it is possible to trace and, to an extent, quantify, footprints the economic policy is leaving on the uncertainty. We have developed a new statistical distribution which parameters can tell whether the economic policy is effective in reducing macroeconomic uncertainty. With the use of this distribution, it is also possible to tell whether there is still some room left for strengthening the policy or whether the policy is on its edge and cannot be expanded further. Using relatively simple data (collection of forecast errors) we have found such footprints in macroeconomic forecasts errors for a number of countries worldwide.\nWe also have some negative results. We have found out that some statistical distributions previously regarded as promising for modelling uncertainty are not quite fit for this purpose. Moreover, we have found that in some cases the overzealous economic policy, resulting in frequent interventions, can be counterproductive and lead to an increase, rather than decrease, in uncertainty. Our findings can be applied by various macroeconomic bodies, most notably such which base their decisions on outcomes of the forecasting process. Our findings help in overcoming one of the most notorious problems in macroeconomic forecasting, that the decisions based on such forecasts might change the realisations of the forecasted phenomenon itself. As our methods suggest the way of forecasting as if the policy decision was not made, it can be of a particular interest to central banks and fiscal policy bodies. We are currently in collaboration with two European central banks regarding implementation of our methods. Creative Economy","dataset":"gtr"}
