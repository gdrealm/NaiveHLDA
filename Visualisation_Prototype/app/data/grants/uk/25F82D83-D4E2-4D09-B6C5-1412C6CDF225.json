{"id":"25F82D83-D4E2-4D09-B6C5-1412C6CDF225","title":"MICA: The role of Src in cancer-induced bone pain","abstractText":"Of the 300,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed in the UK every year, nearly 100,000 are from breast or prostate cancer. Both of these types of cancer preferentially spread to bones, where they can cause pain and fractures as well as other disabling effects. Controlling bone pain in cancer patients can be difficult, as not all cancers respond well to radiotherapy, and sometimes the side-effects of strong painkillers like morphine can limit the dose of drug that can be given. Although we know a lot about how pain develops after inflammation or nerve damage, our understanding of pain due to bone cancer is not so good, and this lack of knowledge hampers the development of new painkillers that might be particularly good at controlling bone pain. The aim of this project is to study the pathways in the nervous system that are activated in bone cancer. Initially we will focus on identifying changes in the nervous system that occur in bone cancer, with a view to increasing our knowledge. We will also test a new drug, Saracatinib, on patients with pain from cancer that has spread to bones to investigate whether it is useful as a painkiller. If successful, the project might improve the quality of life of patients with bone pain from cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015052/1","grantId":"MR/K015052/1","fundValue":"993794","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Andrew","coPersons":["K.
