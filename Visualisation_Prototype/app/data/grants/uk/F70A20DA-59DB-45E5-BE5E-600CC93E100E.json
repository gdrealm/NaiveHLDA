This can be achieved due to the large latent heat capacity of CO2 relative to the existing fluorocarbon gas, however the utilization of this requires operating pressures far in excess of the current pressure system. \n\nAs such, with operating pressures in excess of 150bara, it is essential to provide adequate testing of cooling systems to prevent catastrophic failure of the cooling elements. Safety and integrity testing of prototype and final design cooling loops will made possible by the equipment provided by this funding and will demonstrate our strategies to deal with both CO2 coolant leakage and highlight other potential failure sources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001938/1","grantId":"ST/M001938/1","fundValue":"15000","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  French","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
