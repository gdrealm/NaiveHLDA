{"id":"1CC36185-DA56-499A-B1A3-BD43457188BD","title":"Evolutionary Approaches to Culture, Cognition and Communication","abstractText":"<p>Humans are a cultural species - we acquire large amounts of knowledge via learning from others. Culture poses several questions for researchers interested in human evolution. What mental apparatus is required to support cultural learning? What evolutionary consequences has this cultural backdrop had for the evolution of the human mind? What aspects of human behaviour can be attributed to processes of cultural evolution?</p>\n\n<p>This project concentrates on the evolutionary consequences of sociality and culture from the perspective of language. The human communication system exhibits a number of unusual or unique structural properties. Can comparative approaches to the study of communication help explain the putative uniqueness of language, in terms of a uniquely human cognitive apparatus? Can fundamental structural properties of language be explained as a consequence of cultural evolution? To what extent has the human mind adapted to its cultural context? </p>\n\n<p>This project brings together an international group of researchers over a series of four seminars in order to address these and other questions on the evolutionary consequences of human sociality and culture.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4099-A","grantId":"RES-451-25-4099-A","fundValue":"9024","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenny  Smith","coPersons":["Andrew  Whiten"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
