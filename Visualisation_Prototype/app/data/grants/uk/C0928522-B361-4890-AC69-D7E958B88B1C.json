{"id":"C0928522-B361-4890-AC69-D7E958B88B1C","title":"Nottingham Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre","abstractText":"NIMRC's research portfolio is at the heart of the national manufacturing agenda and is active in the generation of patents and the construction of full scale demonstrators to enhance technology transfer. The Centre has strong links with industry in a range of sectors including aerospace, automotive, instrumentation, power engineering, steel, textiles and clothing, and consumer product sectors. With the exception of a small number of blue-skies projects, all projects are driven by industrial need. During the past 3 years, the Nottingham Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre (NIMRC) has continued to succeed in its stated objectives. By exploiting synergies between themes and research strands within the Centre and with other academic groups and industry outside the Centre, NIMRC has continued to expand its world-leading research portfolio and develop new directions. From a start of 8 principal investigators in the IMRC, this year we have an additional 15 investigators participating in current projects within the portfolio, complemented by 22 researchers and 29 research students. In the past 3 years, 9 students have been been awarded a PhD and another 7 are currently submitting their dissertations.The quality, timeliness and novelty of NIMRC's research is highlighted by its publication record. Since the Centre began, staff have published widely in peer review journals and presented at prestigious international conferences.The IMRC status has attracted a wider research community both in the University and without. The NIMRC continues to develop strategic partnerships with research groups outside the University and include many internationally recognised centre's of manufacturing excellence. The Centre also has strong links with other IMRCs. Already, NIMRC has collaborative research projects with Warwick, Bath, Cranfield and Loughborough IMRCs. NIMRC is also participating in the Grand Challenge 3D Mintigration related to the economic Manufacture of 3D Miniaturised Devices . NIMRC has made excellent progress during the last 3 years towards its stated objectives. It believes that the future research strategy it has developed will continue to address both the immediate and longer term needs of the manufacturing industry and it looks forward to providing the enabling research needed to improve the competitiveness of UK plc. The importance of NIMRC's world-class research is demonstrated in the composition of the Industrial Advisory Board which includes 20 senior industrialists from well established UK manufacturing sectors. The Board is impressed with the work of the Centre and the rapport with the Board of PIs. Board members have their own examples of how their company has benefited from the work of the NIMRC. In summary, Rolls-Royce and the Industrial Advisory Board fully support the activities of the NIMRC and will continue to do so. Chair of NIMRC Industrial Advisory Board, Mr Stephen Burgess, Manufacturing Process and Technology Director, Rolls-Royce Plc.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001904/1","grantId":"EP/E001904/1","fundValue":"9815820","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Svetan Marinov Ratchev","coPersons":["Richard  Brooks","Philip Howard Shipway","Andrew  Long","Philip  Webb","Gavin Stuart Walker","Peter  Standring","Ian  Pashby","Andrew  Kennedy","Michael John Clifford","Donal  McNally","Xun  Chen","Christopher Douglas Rudd","Stephen John Pickering","Ivor Arthur Jones","Dragos Aurelian Axinte","Bart  MacCarthy","Nicholas Antony Warrior","Nabil  Gindy"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
