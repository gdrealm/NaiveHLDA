{"id":"CE4ECB1B-1133-48DF-A96F-A00B23CC866E","title":"A computational investigation of early word learning","abstractText":"<p>The goal of this research project is to investigate the kinds of computational mechanisms that are capable of the rapid word learning that is observed in infants and young children by exploring a range of neural network models of vocabulary development. Computer modelling is the focus of the approach because it provides a way to understand the nature of the mechanisms underlying infant development. Neural network information processing systems are the obvious choice to model associative learning processes. They also offer a crucially important feature: the opportunity to examine the process of learning itself and thereby obtain insights into how infant behavior might change over time. Unfortunately, there are currently no neural network models that capture the diverse range of phenomena observed in early word learning. Recent advances in neural network modelling that use hybrid network architectures to simulate learning and integrative processes in different parts of the brain are of direct relevance to our understanding of the type of neuro-cognitive mechanisms that may underpin word learning. The proposed research aims to exploit these recent advances in computational neuroscience to examine the plausibility of associative learning systems from an information processing perspective in an attempt to offer a unified account of infant word learning.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00492X/1","grantId":"ES/E00492X/1","fundValue":"295436","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kim Robertson Plunkett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
