In addition the domains in some natural way will be allowed to shrink to simple limiting structures.\n\nThe specific questions (stated in the Objectives section) will provide details that will be invaluable to the manufacturing process of micro electronics and all the consequences that follow from this.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K024299/1","grantId":"EP/K024299/1","fundValue":"14849","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-07-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  as the basis for a later funding application Education,Healthcare Cultural","person":"B Malcolm Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" the importance of &quot;size of wire&quot; when researching problems of electrical communication a further grant application is being worked on Education","dataset":"gtr"}
