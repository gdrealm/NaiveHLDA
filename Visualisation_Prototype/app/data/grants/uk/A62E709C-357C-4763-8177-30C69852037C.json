Three vehicles will be used to test the OPQOL: a national Omnibus Survey will be used. This is a rolling face-to-face interview survey with adults aged 16+, based on a stratified random sample of postcodes across Britain. People aged 65 and over, who are representative of older people living at home in Britain will be interviewed face-to-face at home to test the OPQOL; and an independent ethnic boost home interview sample (Ethnibus Omnibus Survey) is planned to assess whether the questionnaire is psychometrically sound among ethnically diverse populations. The questionnaire and its domains will initially be assessed with three focus groups reflecting ethnic diversity. Thirdly, in order to test the reliability and validity of the measure dynamically as people age, the OPQOL will be administered in a follow-up of our QoL Survey respondents (baseline funded by ESRC Growing Older Programme).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F015410/1","grantId":"ES/F015410/1","fundValue":"256920","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impact Report RES-189-25-0108\n\nESRC Update September 2014 on Application of the Older People's Quality of Life questionnaire (OPQOL):\n\nIn addition to the update in April 2014-09-16, the use of the OPQOL in the NIHR funded exercise RCT has now been published:\n\nIliffe S, Kendrick D, Morris R, Masud T, Gage H, Skelton D, Dinan S, Bowling A, et al.

It was through their grandchildren that they felt able to play a reciprocal role, and to feel useful and valued.\n\no Many respondents referred to the importance of having social or voluntary activities in the context of the importance of 'keeping busy' - to stop them worrying, feeling alone, or dwelling on the past. The measure produced is well tested and robust, and can be used to evaluate outcomes of health, social and other sectors' policy.\n\n\n\n http://www.ilcuk.org.uk Apart from publication and dissemination this research resulted in a socially-relevant measure of quality of life in older age, that is being used by others in both trials and surveys.
