A challenge for psychologists is to find out what causes dyslexia. Currently, the best developed theory is that dyslexia is caused by an underlying impairment is how the sound structure of spoken words is represented in the brain. This is referred to as a phonological deficit. Researchers believe that this leads to problems in children's awareness of the sounds in spoken words and to delays in learning the mappings between letters and spoken sounds that are critical for reading. The research described in this proposal will test a novel theory recently put forward by Blomert (2011), that the key problem in dyslexia is a lack of automatic activation of speech sounds from visual letters. That is, even when children with dyslexia have seemingly learned letter-sound associations they are unable to retrieve or apply their knowledge of these quickly during reading. Blomert (2011) has put this lack of automaticity down to a difficulty in learning to link objects across different senses such as vision and hearing. Such an underlying difficulty could help to explain other difficulties seen in children with dyslexia; for example, that they find it difficult to learn to pair together symbols and nonsense words and to say the names of a list of objects or numbers quickly. \n\nEvidence that the automaticity of activating sounds from letters is related to reading and that it is impaired in children with dyslexia comes from neuroimaging studies carried out with Dutch children. The findings suggest that the development of automaticity occurs over a prolonged period; while typically developing 11-year olds showed evidence of it, 8-year olds and children with dyslexia did not. However, it is not clear whether the lack of automatic letter-sound activation in dyslexic children is the cause of their reading difficulties or a consequence of their reduced reading experience. \n \nThere remain a number of issues to be addressed before we can be sure that a persisting lack of automaticity in activating sounds from letters is a cause of dyslexia. We need to better understand the development of automatic letter-sound associations in typically developing children and find out how this relates to the other skills that we know affect learning to read. We then need to establish whether automatic letter-sound activation is a predictor of growth in reading in its own right. Once we have done this we can go on to study automaticity in dyslexic children, being careful to compare them to children who have had a similar amount of reading experience. This is important if we are to establish whether a lack of automatic letter-sound activation is the cause of reading difficulties or a consequence of reading experience. \n\nTo address these issues we will carry out three studies. In the first we will find out when automatic letter-sound integration first develops and how it relates to reading and other skills that are important for reading development. The second study will follow a group of young children, looking at how automatic letter-sound integration develops over time and whether it is a predictor of growth in reading. In the third study we will compare dyslexic children to children of a similar reading level on measures of automatic letter-sound integration while looking at electrical brain activity. In this way we will determine whether a lack of automatic integration is a potential cause of dyslexia. \n\nThe findings will tell us when children begin to develop automatic associations between letters and sounds, whether these automatic associations are important for reading development and if poor associations are a cause of dyslexia. If the answers to the last two questions are yes, then we will have opened up new ways to identify children at risk for dyslexia and for designing interventions to help them develop better connections between letters and sounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008270/1","grantId":"ES/L008270/1","fundValue":"347340","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Hulme","coPersons":["Lorna Frances Halliday"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
