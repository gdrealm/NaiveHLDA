{"id":"C244601E-D2ED-4EBB-B2E2-A1B222EA8308","title":"Reconsidering Detachment: building an exploratory network","abstractText":"<p>The aim of the project was to build an international network of scholars working on the topic of &quot;detachment&quot;. Concerns with &quot;engagement&quot; have in recent decades become central to a range of academic disciplines, and to public life more broadly. This shift has arguably led to a more inclusive vision of academic knowledge. However it has also led academics to overlook how detachment can be valuable in various social, religious and scientific contexts.</p>\n\n<p>This project brought together a range of people whose work illuminates these issues. At the heart of this project was a small group of early-career social anthropologists who have been studying detachment in diverse contexts. It enabled us to&nbsp; establish a network involving people working on similar themes in other countries and disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>The project comprised three main activities:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>organising a panel at a large international conference</li>\n\n <li>putting together a larger interdisciplinary conference</li>\n\n <li>building an online network. [note: at the time of application, the strategic challenges had not been defined. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>This project touches on a range of topics, hence our selection of multiple challenges below]</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H007946/1","grantId":"ES/H007946/1","fundValue":"32244","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matei  Candea","coPersons":["Joanna Claire Cook","Catherine  Trundle","Thomas Gresham  Yarrow"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
