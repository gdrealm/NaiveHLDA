{"id":"E5438F5E-A1BB-4166-9DE7-33365658BB5C","title":"Multiple Scale and Multimodal Data and Information Fusion in Human Sensory Discrimination","abstractText":"This is an inter-disciplinary project involving combined psychophysical studies of human uni- and cross-modal sensory discrimination and scene analysis, along with computational modeling of the data using multi-dimensional time series analysis. The psychophysical experiments will provide novel information on the use of multiple haptic inputs as a function of type and relative positions of receptors being stimulated, as well as information on how concurrent haptic and visual input is integrated. The computational studies will evaluate whether copula-based wavelet analyses are able to simulate human discrimination performance, with information being combined immediately across sensory inputs. As an alternative, this will be compared with approaches in which time series (including wavelet-based) analyses are conducted for each input before integration takes place across inputs. The work will provide a detailed account of how sensory integration operates within and across modalities, which can subsequently be used to guide the construction of artificial sensory systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000088/1","grantId":"BB/E000088/1","fundValue":"51369","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Fionn  Murtagh","coPersons":["Glyn  Humphreys"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
