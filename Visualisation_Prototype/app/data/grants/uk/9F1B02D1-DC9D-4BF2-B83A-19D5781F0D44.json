{"id":"9F1B02D1-DC9D-4BF2-B83A-19D5781F0D44","title":"ageing, poverty and neoliberalism in urban South India","abstractText":"<p>The project examines the impact of 16 years of liberalisation and foreign direct investment on the lives of the older urban poor of Chennai, a South Indian city of over 4 million residents that is seen as a neo-liberal success story. This multidisciplinary project addresses economic and demographic issues of concern to developing countries: current trends indicate that by 2030 the overwhelming majority of the global population aged over 60 will be living in developing countries, that 61 per cent&nbsp;of the global population will be urban and 80 per cent&nbsp;of these will be living in developing countries, that integration into the global economy can deepen inequalities and that neo-liberalism aids the commodification of goods and services. What is not known is what impact these trends are having on the capacity of the older urban poor to be self-supporting or to access the support of their families, local networks or the state. This project will be the first in-depth, longitudinal study of the impact of liberalisation on the livelihoods and welfare of the older urban poor in a developing country; its objective is to provide the evidence base and to identify policy measures that would strengthen livelihoods and enhance wellbeing.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F016077/1","grantId":"ES/F016077/1","fundValue":"122136","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny  Vera-Sanso","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
