This enzyme is found in plants, algae and some microbes. It is the main solar converter of photosynthesis, the process by which solar energy is converted to the chemical fuels used for powering life . Nearly all life on the planet runs on energy that came from photosynthesis. \n\nPS2 is important not just as a solar collector; it is the only enzyme that has is able to use water to make fuel. Water (H2O) is very stable; it takes a lot of energy to rip it apart, two molecules at a time, to provide electrons for fuel making. PS2 is able to do this using solar energy. This reaction releases protons (4H+) and oxygen gas (O2) as side-products.\n\nPS2 evolved in bacteria on the primitive Earth when O2 was absent. This was a key event in the evolution of life. The O2 released could be used for respiration, a much more efficient way of using biological fuels than existed previously. This drastic jump in the efficiency of energy use meant that biology could become much more complicated: multicellular life could develop. The O2 escaped to the atmosphere and was converted to ozone by UV radiation. The ozone formed then blocked further deadly UV from reaching the surface of the planet. Overall, PS2 provided the energy for life to flourish, allowed life to come out from under the stones and to develop into life as we know it. It is the enzyme that changed the planet.\n\nThis project is focused on how PS2 works and how the part that reacts with water is built into the part that does the solar conversion. This building-in process is called &quot;photoactivation&quot; and it occurs when the enzyme is first made and when it is repaired. Given that every plant and nearly every photosynthetic microbe has many millions of these enzymes and that each PS2 needs to be repaired about every 30 minutes, then there is rather a lot of photoactivation going on. And yet very little is known about it. It is known that during photoactivation PS2 is particularly sensitive to being damaged by light. Under stress conditions (too hot, too cold, too dry, etc), this can end up killing the cell and this can limit the yields of crops and determine whether the organism lives or dies. We wish to understand what is going on here. The work is likely to be useful to farmers, the agri-science industry, ecologists etc because it should allow methods and processes to be developed for improving yields of crops and improving survival of photosynthetic species in a changing environment. \n\nThe fossil fuels represent the product of eons of photosynthesis converting solar energy to biomass by the capture CO2 from the ancient atmosphere. Humans are in the process of returning the CO2 to the atmosphere in what is &quot;the blink of an eye&quot; on a planetary time-scale and this is changing the planet. Perhaps the biggest challenge to scientists at present is to solve the energy/climate crisis by finding alternatives to fossil fuels. It is becoming clear that solar energy is the only alternative energy source that is big enough to do this. While converting solar energy to electricity is straightforward, to solve our energy needs, particularly for transport, we require fuels. Solar fuel production is a crucial requirement. Natural photosynthesis is the biggest solar fuel producer however it does this slowly and inefficiently and we cannot rely on natural photosynthesis to replace fossil fuels that took eons to accumulate. Artificial solar fuel production aims to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; the best features from natural photosynthesis to make a more efficient artificial version. The water splitting enzyme, the enzyme that changed the planet, is the main focus of scrutiny for these studies. The current research will provide key information on how this enzyme works, how it is made and how it is repaired: information that is key for solar fuel production by artificial photosynthesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K002627/1","grantId":"BB/K002627/1","fundValue":"367556","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The process of photoassembly of the metal cluster in the active site of the water splitting enzyme is one of the remain Big Unknowns in photosynthesis. This process turns out to be the Achilles heal of the enzyme, since light is required in order to oxidise the metal ions and yet the enyme is not yet functional and so charge recombination is the dominant outcome of excitation. Complex redox tuning occurs to minimise photodamage but these processes are not understood. Photodamage of the enzyme is considered to be responsible for limitations in photosynthesis yields and thus crop yields under certain conditions. Understanding how this process works could allow improved yields. \nOur studies of the yields of photosynthesis have important impacts on understanding the limitations of photosynthesis. We have provided advice to government bodies, policy makers and industry linked expert groups on the efficiency of photosynthesis and its impact on policy with regards to biofuel production. This kind of information is crucial to if policy is to be informed by science and thus avoid policies that are misinformed and lead to undesirable outcomes.

The protein is particularly susceptible during assembly of the enzyme since the lack of electron donation results in enhanced charge recombination. In a recent study we showed how redox tuning greatly influences the outcome of charge recombination. We also showed that the standard model for relating thermodynamics to distance and kinetics can be applied to predict out comes. (Sugiura et al 2014 Biochim Biophys Acta DOI: 10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.09.009). We have also studied forward electron transfer between the electron acceptors, QA and QB, in T. elongatus attempting to obtain definitive values for the thermophilic reaction centre for which the crystal structure exists. These studies are still in progress but they have resulted in a good collaboration with Fabrice Rappaport in Paris and we hope to finalise the values in the coming year using the instrument at Imperial which is based on the set up in Paris.\n\nElectrochemical and potentiometric studies of PSII\nWe have immobilised Photosystem II onto a nanostructured TiO2 on ITO (Brinkert et al in preparation) and meso-structured ITO on ITO (Kato et al 2013). Photocurrents were demonstrated and studied as a means of understanding the immobilised enzyme and looking at the potential for using the electrochemical approach for studying photoactivation. Methods were developed for oriented immobilisation (Kato et al 2013 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 10610-10613 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja404699h) resulting in increased photocurrents (studies done in collaboration with the group of E. Reisner Cambridge University). \nFurther studies using monolayers on TiO2 indicated that the rate limiting step for electron transfer was in fact in the TiO2 rather than through PSII. This limits the use of this material approach for studying the enzyme and explains several anomalous results in the literature (Brinkert et al 2014 in preparation). It seems unlikely that this approach will be useful for photoassembly studies unless a different electrode material can be found which has better kinetic characteristics. \nElectrochemical titrations of the quinone electron acceptors before and after photoassembly have been performed. We know from previous work that a significant change in the redox potential of QA occurs as one of the steps of photoassembly. The exact values are disputed and we are attempting to determine which values are correct. We have developed thin layer electrochemical titration methods in our lab. We are also attempting to determine if other components charge there redox potentials during photo assembly. Some of these studies have been done in Marseille collaborating with Wolfgang Nitschke.\n\nPhylogenetic studies\nIn depth phylogenetic studies have been performed on the D1 protein of the PSII reaction centre. Interesting new inights were obtained which related to the evolutionary history of water splitting with interesting repercussions on the evolution of the photoassembly process (Cardona 2014 in revision, Cardona etal submitted) \n\nNew collaboration. \nWe are embarking on a new collaboration with the group of Johannes Messinger in Umea Sweden. This group has unique kinetic mass spectrometry for measuring O2 formation. This method will be invaluable for studying the photoassembly process. The photo assembly process consitiutes the phase in the life cycle of the water oxidising enzyme in which it is most susceptible to photodamage. Understanding these processes could lead to more efficient production of food or products from plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria.
