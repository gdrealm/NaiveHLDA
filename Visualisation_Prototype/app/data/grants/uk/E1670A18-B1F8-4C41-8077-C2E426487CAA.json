{"id":"E1670A18-B1F8-4C41-8077-C2E426487CAA","title":"PP3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC MODEL AND COMMUNITY IMPACT SIMULATORS","abstractText":"There is currently no coherent research structure in place to enable stakeholders to ascertain the full impact of EWEs (extreme weather events) on housing, employment, SMEs, crime, health and emergency services at the local level. While there is now a considerable body of research that has examined the socio-economic impacts of flooding and other weather event outcomes, the existing work either tends to be too narrow in focus (such as the cost of insurance claims), pitched at a macro scale (at the National or European level, for example), limited to the immediate effects of the event (such as insurance claims), or primarily qualitative or descriptive in nature. There is a very real need, therefore, to develop an integrated model that will facilitate the quantitative analysis of extreme weather events at a community level (such as postcode or postcode sector level); consider the direct impacts on a range of sectors; consider the interconnectedness of these sectors and hence the indirect impacts of an extreme weather event; and consider lagged effects as well as the contemporaneous effects. The goal of this project is to develop an empirical model in conjunction with stakeholders that will meet these requirements and provide stakeholders with an integrated decision making framework that will enable them to explore short and long term EWE scenarios.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037716/1","grantId":"EP/F037716/1","fundValue":"263333","fundStart":"2008-03-10","fundEnd":"2011-11-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gwilym Benjamin Pryce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
