Thus, CRC is a major clinical and public health problem. However, available evidence indicates that CRC incidence can be substantially reduced by early detection and prevention using drugs and/or dietary components. Understanding the causes of CRC would enable the rational development of preventative agents, biomarkers of risk and potentially new chemotherapy drugs. Twin studies have shown that there is a heritable contribution to CRC (~ 35%). However, until recently, much of the heritable component remained undiscovered. Over the last 5 years, we have successfully studied many thousands of CRC patients and controls using genomic based (genome-wide association studies - GWAS) approaches. We have discovered 20 new genetic regions that are inherited markers of the risk of developing CRC and have shown that genetic marker data, family history, gender and age can be combined into risk profiling models that can identify high risk subgroups within the general population. Whilst the risk imparted by each of the common variants we have identified is individually modest (~10-20% increase in risk), common variants that impart modest effects on human phenotypes can have major therapeutic implications. One example is that of the cholesterol-lowering agents, statins, which are in widespread use and are attributed with a dramatic reduction in coronary heart disease in Britain. Genetic approaches identified a gene (HMGCR) that influences blood cholesterol levels and it is the gene product of HMGCR (HMGcoA reductase) which is inhibited by statins.\nWe recently discovered a region on the X chromosome that is associated with CRC susceptibility. In pilot studies, we now show that there is a deletion/insertion in the DNA sequence that appears to explain the effect on CRC risk. The region also has a dramatic effect on expression of a gene called SHROOM2 which effects a variety of cell functions. We studied these changes in human large bowel epithelium and showed a very strong relationship between the genotype and SHROOM2 expression, indeed so strong that the DNA sequence explained most of the variation in SHROOM2 expression in the colon. SHROOM2 is also involved in pigmentation of the human retina. Intriguingly, we have shown an association between retinal pigmentation and CRC. We now link these retinal pigment effects with genotype at the SHROOM2 region. Finally, we show that altering the level of SHROOM2 in CRC cell lines substantially reduces cancer cell growth.\nThe rationale is compelling for study of SHROOM2 as a gene responsible for susceptibility to a common cancer killer (CRC). The research aims to shed new light on cancer biology and susceptibility. Our pilot studies already suggest SHROOM2 (and related pathway components) is a drug target for developing cancer prevention agents. Hence we plan to:\n- Identify the causative DNA sequence variant(s) on chromosome X and define frequency and effect on CRC risk by comparing CRC cases and controls.\n- Elucidate the specific molecular mechanism by which SHROOM2 impacts on CRC risk and on gene expression in human large bowel epithelium and the retina.\n- Identify genes downstream of SHROOM2 in the pathway that are indirectly affected by variation.\n- Define the effect of modifying SHROOM2 expression (knockdown &amp; over-expression) on cancer-relevant cell biological phenotypes in: cancer cell lines, human large bowel epithelium. \n- Generate in vivo models to describe the phenotype of Shroom2 deletion and to study the role of Shroom2 in tumour initiation and progression.\n- Identify targets for chemoprevention and biomarkers of CRC risk in humans.\nAbove we outline a coherent body of work that will allow us to understand the role of SHROOM2 in large bowel cancer and to apply this in the future to prevent the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K018647/1","grantId":"MR/K018647/1","fundValue":"867835","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Mary Farrington","coPersons":["Ian  Jackson","Colin  Semple","Malcolm Graham Dunlop"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
