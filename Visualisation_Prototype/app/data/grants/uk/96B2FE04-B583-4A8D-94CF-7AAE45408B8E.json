The participants were women planning to have children. They had diets low in vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) and their newborns were at high risk of low birth weight. The aim of the trial was to test whether improving the micronutrient quality of their diet for a sustained period of time before conception, and throughout pregnancy, increases birth weight and improves the children's long-term health. Women were offered, in addition to their usual diet, a specially designed daily snack made from (treatment group) micronutrient-rich foods including green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk, or (controls) low micronutrient vegetables such as potato and onion. On average the treatment snacks contained 10-23% of the WHO recommended Reference Nutrient Intake for beta-carotene, folate, vitamins B2 and B12, calcium and iron.\n \nThe trial was unusual in two ways: (a) in supplementing women before pregnancy and (b) in using local micronutrient-rich foods rather than pharmaceutical micronutrient supplements. The primary outcome was birth weight, but it was powered to enable the study of longer term outcomes in the children. We pre-specified that we planned to test the effect of starting the intervention at least three months before conception, and we expected greater effects on birth weight among thinner women. The first women were recruited in January 2006 and the last baby was born in May 2012. We enrolled 6513 women, of whom 2291 became pregnant, resulting in 1962 singleton live births; 1826 of the 2291 women started the supplement at least three months before becoming pregnant and had 1562 live births.\n \nAmong all the women who gave birth, the intervention had a positive but non-significant effect on birth weight (+26 g [95% CI -15, 68 g], p=0.22). There was a greater effect among women who started supplementation at least three months before pregnancy (+48g [95% CI 1, 96 g], p=0.046). In these women, the intervention reduced the rate of low birth weight babies (Treatment: 34%, Controls 41%; OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.59, 0.98], p=0.03). The birth weight effect increased with maternal pre-pregnant body mass index: -8g, +79g and +113g in the lowest, middle and highest thirds of maternal BMI respectively (p for interaction=0.001). An unexpected benefit of the intervention was that it reduced the prevalence of diabetes in the mothers during pregnancy (Treatment: 7%, Controls: 13%, p&lt;0.01).\n \nIn the proposed study, we now aim to assess the effect of the intervention on outcomes in the children (N~1800) at the age of 6 years. We will measure a range of growth, functional and health outcomes, including height, body composition, risk markers for later diabetes and heart disease, and brain function. \n\nThe study has already started (from Sept 2013) in order assess children in a narrow age window. Ethical approval was obtained from the JJ Hospital, Mumbai. Families are visited by a health worker to explain the study. As close as possible to the child's 6th birthday, the child and both parents are asked to attend a research clinic at the Centre for the Study of Social Change in Bandra, Mumbai, after an overnight fast. Detailed body measurements of the parents and child are performed. A fasting blood sample is taken from the child for glucose, insulin and lipids. Further blood samples are drawn at 30 and 120 minutes after an oral glucose load. Blood pressure and hand grip strength are measured. Cognitive (intelligence) testing is carried out using tests validated for Indian children. The children have fat, lean and bone mass measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry at a local hospital. In parents, a full blood count and fasting glucose are measured. DNA and RNA samples for future genetic and epigenetic analyses are collected from the children and parents and frozen. The study will take 3 years to complete.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M005186/1","grantId":"MR/M005186/1","fundValue":"398861","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Fall","coPersons":["Ramesh  Potdar","Sarah Helen Kehoe","Kalyanaraman  Kumaran","Sirazul Ameen Sahariah"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
