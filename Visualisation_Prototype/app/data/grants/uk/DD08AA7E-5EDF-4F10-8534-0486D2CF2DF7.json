{"id":"DD08AA7E-5EDF-4F10-8534-0486D2CF2DF7","title":"Cellular Biology of the Gastrointestinal Tract and Pancreas in Health and Disease","abstractText":"Gastrointestinal disease is a significant cause of early mortality and places a heavy financial burden on the National Health Service. For example, colorectal, stomach, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers are the 2nd, 5th, 6th and 7th commonest causes of cancer death in the UK. The NHS costs for treating GI disease is #3.03 billion per year. One fifth of short-term absence from work is as a result of gastrointestinal disease, which costs the country #2 billion per year (Gastroenterology in the UK: Burden of Disease. Prism Project 9608. The Wellcome Trust http://www.bsg.org.uk/burden.html).\n\nThe University of Liverpool has a long and distinguished history in gastrointestinal research and currently has nie research groups that focus on the science underlying a number of common gastrointestinal diseases. Specific questions being addressed are as follows. What are the mechanisms of calcium signalling in health and pancreatitis? How is gastric structure and function regulated in health, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer? How is apoptosis (programmed cell death) initiated in colorectal cancer by anticancer drugs? How do dietary lectins regulate proliferation in the normal and cancerous bowel? What are the genes that cause oesophageal cancer? How does dietary fibre maintain the health of colonic epithelium? How do abnormalities of calcium cause pancreatitis? Out of these questions come a number of shared intellectual and experimental themes such as mechanisms of signalling within and between GI epithelial cells, the causes of cancer in the GI tract and mechanisms by which epithelial cells develop specific functions in health and disease.\n\nThe component groups in this proposal already work together to some extent but added value would be given to each group if they were formally brought together into an MRC Co-operative Group. This would facilitate the purchase and sharing of expensive items of equipment and provide a framework to allow fast and efficient flow of ideas and expertise between the component groups. This grant application has two purposes: first to retain MRC Co-operative status; and secondly, the salary for a technician to work with transgenic animals together with modest running expenses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9900432","grantId":"G9900432","fundValue":"481846","fundStart":"2000-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair  Watson","coPersons":["Soraya  Shirazi-Beechey","Robert  Sutton","John  Field","John  Neoptolemos","Mark Thomas Boyd","Graham John Dockray","Jonathan Michael Rhodes","Ole Holger  Petersen"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
