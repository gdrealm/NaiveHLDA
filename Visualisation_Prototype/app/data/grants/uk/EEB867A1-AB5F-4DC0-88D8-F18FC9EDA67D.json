{"id":"EEB867A1-AB5F-4DC0-88D8-F18FC9EDA67D","title":"Neural systems and neurobiological pathways underlying aversive memories","abstractText":"Anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder, involve abnormally strong aversive/fear memories that trigger a dysfunctional and debilitating response. While much is known about individual brain areas and mechanisms that are implicated in fear learning and memory, few attempts have been made to draw these elements together. This programme of research will probe the brain systems and pathways that are important in fear learning and memory. Such a global understanding of normal fear memories is necessary for any future identification of biological abnormalities that may contribute towards the anxiety disorders. Recently, the possibility has been raised that the abnormal memories mediating the anxiety disorders might be disrupted as a new form of treatment. Memories are vulnerable to being disrupted for a period of time after they are recalled. However, relatively little is known about the process that restabilises a recalled fear memory in terms of the brain areas and mechanisms that are recruited. This project will add to the understanding of these processes, which will be important for any potential application in a therapeutic setting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700991","grantId":"G0700991","fundValue":"377210","fundStart":"2009-03-02","fundEnd":"2012-03-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joff  Lee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
