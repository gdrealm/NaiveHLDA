{"id":"A77807C5-33F3-49DD-AE56-DA3B360A10F2","title":"Luise Gottsched the Translator","abstractText":"Luise Gottsched (1713-1762) was Germany's first prominent woman of letters. In recent years, critics have paid increasing attention to her oeuvre but have tended to write about her plays and letters rather than her translations. This focus on the 'literary' part of her output reflects more general trends in research on German women's writing of the period: there is a growing number of studies in the field but they almost invariably look at women as novelists, dramatists, letter-writers or even journal editors rather than as translators.\\n\\nYet Gottsched was first and foremost a translator. She devoted most of her life to rendering contemporary French and English texts into German and, in the thirty-year period c. 1730-1760, produced or contributed to over fifty volumes of translations. These texts cover an extraordinary range, from drama and poetry to pedagogy, history, philosophy, and even theoretical physics.\\n\\nThis monograph provides the first comprehensive overview of Gottsched's activities as a translator. It is informed by recent approaches to the study of translation, i.e. by the literary and cultural historians who view the transmission of fictional and non-fictional texts across cultures as a process which can have a far-reaching impact on the development of native literary, political and cultural traditions. The monograph will place Gottsched's translation work in its cultural and historical context for the first time. This seems all the more pertinent if we consider that the eighteenth century was a great age of translation in Germany. Germany in this era was undergoing a radical process of modernisation and reorientation, and translation had a vital role to play in introducing new Enlightened thought from abroad and shaping ideas about language, culture and national identity. Translation was a highly valued activity - and most literary figures in the eighteenth century turned their hand to translation at some stage in their lives. \\n\\nThe monograph shows that translation was central to Gottsched's career. On the one hand, it opened up new possibilities for her, as a woman, to engage in intellectual pursuits. Through her translations, Gottsched was able to add her voice to some of the most significant cultural and scientific debates of the day and played a key role in strengthening her country's position in the European Republic of Letters. On the other, there are crucial links between her translation work and her own writing: translation helped Gottsched to hone her literary skills and provided her with models for her 'original' works. If she had not first immersed herself in foreign literature, she would probably never have emerged as a writer at all.\\n\\nThe study broadens our understanding of the work of a major German woman writer. It is more wide-ranging than most other research on the author to date in that it brings to light a corpus of texts which has been largely neglected in critical studies and offers detailed analysis of these and of their place in her oeuvre as a whole. By demonstrating the central importance of translation to Gottsched's career, it casts the author and her work in a new light. Furthermore, in drawing attention to the significance of translation - both literary and non-literary - for Gottsched, it opens up new fields of enquiry into the history of German women's writing of the period. \\n\\n'Luise Gottsched the Translator' will be a substantial new addition to a growing body of research on Luise Gottsched, and valuable reading for scholars interested more broadly in women's writing, the history of translation, and the literature and culture of the European Enlightenment.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H003231/1","grantId":"AH/H003231/1","fundValue":"23404","fundStart":"2009-09-21","fundEnd":"2010-01-20","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary Jane Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
