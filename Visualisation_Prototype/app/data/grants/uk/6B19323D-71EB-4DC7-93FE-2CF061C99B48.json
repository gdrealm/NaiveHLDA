{"id":"6B19323D-71EB-4DC7-93FE-2CF061C99B48","title":"Towards the development of a vaccine for proliferative kidney disease","abstractText":"This proposal will study an important disease that affects the rainbow trout aquaculture industry, proliferative kidney disease (PKD), with the objective of making significant progress towards the development of a vaccine. The disease is caused by a microscopic parasite known as a myxozoan, which causes a severe immune response in fish characterized by a chronic kidney pathology. Our recent work led to the discovery that colonial freshwater invertebrates known as bryozoans act as a reservoir of parasites infective to fish. Recently we have found that increasing temperatures cause the parasite to proliferate in bryozoans with greater numbers of released spores, suggesting that that the disease is likely to become more problematic in farmed and wild salmonid stocks as water temperatures increase due to climate change. There is already evidence for this effect in wild brown trout populations in Switzerland and wild Atlantic salmon populations in Norway and we are aware that PKD has increased in severity over the past few years in trout farms in Southern England. Currently, there are no current treatments to prevent or control the disease. However, an important characteristic of PKD is that fish that do survive an initial infection with the parasite are resistance to a subsequent exposure, and thus priming of the immune system with a vaccine is expected to be one way to control this disease. The key is to find an appropriate molecule that can trigger a protective immune response. In recent studies we have identified a number of PKD molecules, several of which have characteristics in common with molecules that elicit protection in other host-pathogen models. So in this proposal we will study the effectiveness of these molecules. We will use a recent advance in vaccine technology, and use for the most part DNA vaccines rather than protein based vaccines, since the former are a cost-effective way to screen our vaccine candidates and have been shown previously to work well in fish. Fish will be vaccinated at a commercial rainbow trout farm, that suffers from this disease every year, and the results will be assessed in terms of survival and the immune response elicited. However, we will not assume that the best vaccine candidates will be amongst the genes we have already sequenced, and so will take an alternative approach as well. The second approach will use pathogen material isolated from the fish host, as well as an intermediate host, and using molecular biology techniques we will create 'gene libraries' from this material that will contain many of the genes that can be expressed by this pathogen. In the same way as above, we will use a DNA vaccine approach to screen these gene libraries for vaccine candidates, but in this case will use 'pools' of many genes. Fish vaccinated with these different 'pools' will be assessed for disease resistance as above, and batches that show beneficial affects will be subdivided and retested, to eventually give small numbers of potential candidate molecules to look at in more detail. Since pathogen strain variation can affect the molecular composition of molecules, we will undertake a survey of some of the candidate genes from the initial approach and see if they are invariant and suitable for all strains, or whether they vary and that an eventual vaccine would require to be derived from multiple sources. In this manner, we will take a systematic approach to vaccine development for this disease, based on our past success in discovering parasite genes, and our existing expertise in molecular biology, PKD biology and fish vaccination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003242/1","grantId":"BB/F003242/1","fundValue":"446662","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  A step towards a vaccine against proliferative kidney disease in trout was taken in this programme, using a novel vaccination approach called expression library immunisation. The study is incremental and as such these first steps shaped a subsequent BBSRC programme to elucidate the protective antigens individually rather than as pools of molecules. Since the ultimate goal is for a commercial vaccine, the IP issues restrict to some degree the ability to communicate the results broadly at this early stage.

We also identified molecules possessing features of surface-expressed molecules, which may come into contact with the fish host and elicit a protective immune response. Fish were vaccinated at a commercial rainbow trout farm. A single parasite molecule elicited a very low level of protection. We attempted to improve this by vaccinating fish with the same molecules joined to a parasite gene known to be highly immunogenic in other host-pathogen models. However, we found no improvement in the effectiveness of single molecules. \n\nIn a second approach, we developed new gene libraries constructed from parasite material derived from both bryozoan and fish hosts. The bryozoan-derived parasite gene library was fractionated to produce 17 smaller gene libraries (gene pools), allowing us to determine the effectiveness of 2,500 parasite molecules in each. Two first generation gene pools (SL-10 and SL-15) were found to be effective in reducing disease pathology. Further fractionation of SL-10 and SL-15 (12,500 parasite molecules each) and subsequent testing of second generation gene pools yielded a single protective gene pool (SL-R). SL-R was subjected to further fractionation and 20 third generation gene pools (3,725 parasite molecules in total) for DNA vaccination were created. Only a single third generation gene pool (R-14) was protective against PKD. We have now sequenced the R-14 gene pool and have shortlisted those molecules, which may be conveying protection. Several parasite molecules, some of which are currently unknown in gene databases, have the potential to elicit a protective immune response as outlined earlier. Our shortlist also includes 3 parasite molecules of particular pharmacological interest. \n\nOur new gene libraries have also proved extremely useful in enhancing or understanding of the biology of the PKD parasite. Indeed, from our sequencing efforts, we identified a parasite molecule belonging to a gene family which is only found in an animal group called the cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones). This gene family (minicollagens) are the fundamental building blocks of the stinging cells unique to these animals. This finding provides a link between cnidarians and the cells responsible for parasite attachment to fish hosts. In doing so, we have resolved the long disputed grouping of myxozoan parasites in the animal kingdom. \n\nIn addressing how parasite strain variation can affect the molecular composition of candidate PKD vaccine molecules, we located 5 new infected bryozoan populations ensuring sufficient parasite material for our vaccine work. We found very little strain differentiation between parasites from different geographic regions in Europe. It was not clear whether use of different genetic markers would help to resolve this or if the parasite truly has not differentiated between locations as far apart as Norway and Italy. If such lack of strain variation exists in candidate vaccine genes, there is good potential for vaccine development with broad protection to most parasite strains, at least within Europe. \n\nOverall, we have succeeded in generating new parasite gene libraries facilitating future studies of this disease. The identification and sequencing of a protective gene pool has allowed us to shortlist parasite molecules which may be conveying immune protection. This could be addressed in a follow-on study, which could open up opportunities for commercial exploitation. Ultimately if successful, a vaccine will be available for use by trout fish farmers to protect against PKD. In addition, if successful this approach may be adopted to develop efficacious vaccines to other diseases that have proven problematic to date. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
