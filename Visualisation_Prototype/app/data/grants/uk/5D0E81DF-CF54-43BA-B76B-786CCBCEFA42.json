{"id":"5D0E81DF-CF54-43BA-B76B-786CCBCEFA42","title":"Power Electronics for Adverse High Temperature Environments (PEATE)","abstractText":"This S2B Basic Research Project is focussed on the development of a family of power electronic devices based on SiC technology for application in hostile environments of high temperature and pressure. Compressors for down-well operation in the gas production industry are required to work in the well ambient, which is typically in the range 100 to 200 C at pressures of up to 90 bar. Ratings for the compressor are up to 500 kW, the compressor being supplied through a power electronic drive from a 2.4 kV dc-buss using devices rated at 3.3 kV and 50 A.Conventional Si-based power electronics is limited to maximum operating junction temperatures of less than 150 C, giving a maximum down-hole ambient ceiling of around 105 C. This combination of relatively high voltage, low current and high temperature lends itself to the current and near future capability of SiC and it thus forms an ideal proof-of-concept demonstrator The overall aim of the project is to investigate technologies that will enable the development of a power electronic converter for a DGC that can operate in a gas ambient temperatures of up to 150 C. This aim will be realised through a co-ordinated programme of work that addresses semiconductor technology, packaging technology, heat transfer, converter control and reliability in seven technical work packages. Although the programme is directed at a potential application in a down-well gas compressor (DGC) for pressure boosting in gas wells, the results of this project will find application in all extreme temperature environments in which SiC technology could play a future role including aerospace, military, energy, automotive, transmission and distribution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E005055/1","grantId":"DT/E005055/1","fundValue":"217244","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas George Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" Research in this grant concentrated on new investigations into applying advanced SiC devices coupled with new material fabrication methods to significant systems applications, in particular energy conversion (of crucial importance in all forms of renewable power) and new types of sensors for emerging areas such as real-time pollution monitoring in automobiles. This is in addition to developments in materials technologies (such as the application of new types of dielectric technology) and novel devices (SiC transistors fabricated using such dielectrics). The primary route for exploitation is through our industrial partners - the project has been collaborating with major UK companies such as Rolls Royce and BAE Systems for many years. We have also held open days for SMEs so that they can also understand and benefit from the research results in the project.
