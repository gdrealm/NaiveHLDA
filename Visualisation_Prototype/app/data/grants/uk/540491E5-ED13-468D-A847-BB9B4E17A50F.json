A household-randomised controlled trial","abstractText":"Malaria remains one of the greatest threats to global public health, with 207 million cases of falciparum malaria and 627,000 deaths occurring in 2012, with over 80% of deaths occurring in Africa. More than 80% of malaria is transmitted indoors at night, so the number of malaria mosquitoes which enter a house is critical for getting the disease - with people living in 'leaky' houses being at most risk. We have shown that closing the eaves (the gap between the top of the wall and the roof) and screening a house can reduce dramatically the number of malaria vectors entering a house. Here we propose to find out whether we can protect children against malaria by modifying half the study houses so that they (1) have a metal roof, (2) closed eaves, (3) screened doors and windows and (4) screened-air bricks which allow the warm air to rise out of the house, but not let any mosquitoes indoors. The other study houses will be left with thatched roofs and open eaves and the children in these houses will serve as a comparison group. Over the past thirty years a silent revolution in house design has been happening across Africa. The traditional thatched-roofed houses are being replaced steadily by metal-roofed houses as the continent develops. We hope to ride this wave of cultural change and further improve the design of houses to make them healthier to live in. Improved housing has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M007383/1","grantId":"MR/M007383/1","fundValue":"1665580","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2019-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven William Lindsay","coPersons":["Margaret  Pinder","Balla  Kandeh","Lesong  Conteh","Umberto  D'Alessandro","Jakob  Knudsen","Caroline  Jones"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
