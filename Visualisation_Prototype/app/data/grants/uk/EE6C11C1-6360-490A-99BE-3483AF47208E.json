{"id":"EE6C11C1-6360-490A-99BE-3483AF47208E","title":"Modelling systems for managing bee disease: the epidemiology of European Foul Brood","abstractText":"This project will provide a step-change in our understanding of managed pollinator disease. We will use a combined modelling and molecular approach to investigate the dynamics of European Foul Brood (EFB) as an exemplar of endemic brood disease of honey bee colonies using historic data derived from long-term monitoring of apiaries in England and Wales. We will utilise a program of statistical, analytical and spatially explicit modelling to address the problem. Statistical modelling approaches will be used to identify putative covariates involved in the epidemiology of disease (e.g. land use, weather, management practices) (Newcastle); analytical modelling approaches will be used to investigate the role of transmission processes in determining the epidemiology of disease (Warwick &amp; Bath); and spatially explicit models to investigate spatial spread of disease in the context of investigating the efficacy of different practical control measures (Warwick &amp; Newcastle). The modelling will be parameterised using historic datasets which include the timing and reported incidence of EFB distribution in honey bee apiaries across England and Wales (Fera). Molecular approaches based on microsatellite markers and comparative genomics will be employed to characterise host and parasite diversity (Fera &amp; Bath) for use as additional covariates in the statistical, analytical and spatially explicit models exploring the epidemiology of EFB in relation to host resistance. These data will be used for the testing and validation of the theoretical and spatially explicit models. We (Fera &amp; Bath) have, in collaboration with the Sanger centre in Cambridge, already generated a draft genome sequence for M. plutonius. These data will greatly facilitate the identification of suitable markers for the characterisation of large and representative population samples and will also shed light on the genes responsible for virulence, and how pathogenesis proceeds in the bee host. EFB will provide a paradigm which we can test against other pollinator diseases. For example, developed models will be used to investigate the epidemiology of 14 honey bee diseases collected across 5000 apiaries as part of an ongoing Defra funded monitoring programme (Fera). Dissemination of project results is explicit within the project framework and includes, the production of a list of key end-users, stakeholder workshops, bi-annual project newsletters, reporting in industry literature, a disease management summary document and conference attendance. The modelling analytical and spatially explicit models developed within this project will act as tools to guide strategy in the face of a plethora of disease threats for managed and wild pollinators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I000615/1","grantId":"BB/I000615/1","fundValue":"165362","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project is in collaboration with the National Bee Unit at FERA. As such our modelling advice has directly impacted on control policy. In particular, we have shown the current practice of controlling new invasions of bee diseases is highly effective given logistical and financial constraints. During the project we investigated in detail an American Foul Brood outbreak on the island of Jersey, which provided an ideal test-case for our methodology. Work is now extending these methods to the whole of GB, and extending the scope to both European &amp; American Foul Brood, and Varroa. Our findings for Jersey were directly communicated to the Jersey chief vet and local bee keepers in a range of meetings.

This has been used to generate a mathematical model that can be used to both confirm the parameters (by comparing to the original outbreak) and to explore a range of control methods.\nUsing an outbreak of American Foul Brood on the island of Jersey, we were able to compare the potential impact of different control measures. We were able to show that given logistical constraints, the control actions taken were close to optimal.\nOn-going work is extending this model to data from England and Wales, and to a range of bee diseases. Our methodology is currently being extended to England and Wales (using data from Bee-Base), and will allow us to provide the National Bee Unit at FERA with detailed predictions of future incidence as well as considering the optimal deployment of resources to control endemic and invading infections.
