It focussed on the environmental impact of the measures taken by the state Kolkata Port Trust, as well as on social effects. New perspectives on the liberalisation of the Indian economy were created by analysing state-society relationships and the experiences of the urban poor. It demonstrated that liberalisation has not only led to new capital flows, but has coincided with the imposition of rigid financial regimes on the public sector.</p>\n\n<p>The project resulted in three key findings. First that new relationships between state nad citizens are emerging on the river. Port officials are using entrepreneurial and illicit networks previously associated with personal corruption to generate revenues and cost reductions for the state. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly new meanings for labour are developing that imbue it with ritual, kinship and historical symbolism. Public deficit economics strips labour of its nationalist, paternalist associations and places it within the framework of short-term monetary exchanges. Yet workers have responded to this by claiming a ritual symbolism for the act of labour that asserts inalienable rights to the river and to work on it. </p>\n\n<p>Thirdly the ability to generate value from the Hooghly has become compromised by lack of investment in infrastructure. Although trade on the river is central to globalisation in the Eastern region the work process on the river has become unpredictable as a result of goverment policies.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F029233/1","grantId":"ES/F029233/1","fundValue":"172868","fundStart":"2008-01-10","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Charlotte Bear","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
