This proposal focuses on uncovering the mechanisms driving cell expansion while for the first time identifying the 3D geometrical changes in cell shape. Seed germination will be used to examine cell shape change in plants, as seeds grow only by cell expansion, while their cells do not divide. The genes and proteins that make plant cells grow will be identified using statistical analyses of existing data describing gene expression. This work will uncover the molecular processes that make a plant cell change shape.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J017604/1","grantId":"BB/J017604/1","fundValue":"342698","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Andrew  Wood"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
