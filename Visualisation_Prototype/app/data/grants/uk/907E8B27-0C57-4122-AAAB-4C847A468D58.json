Research suggests that the psycho-social and organisational effects of technologies are contradictory, especially concerning the health, social care and societal participation of older people. Whilst technology potentially enhances access to information/communication and improves quality of life; it can exclude those with no access to equipment or lacking the skills/confidence to use it. Technology could facilitate independent living but equally place older people at risk of harmful unintended consequences, including social exclusion from the benefits that technology could bring. </p>\n\n<p>This preparatory network focuses on three themes;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Autonomy and Independence;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Built and Technical Environment;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Locality, Place and Participation. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It brings together experts from academic, public and private organizations with older people to explore the varied contexts in which technologies are located. The aim is to produce an interdisciplinary research project which will provide better understandings of ways in which older people can be supported to access and use technology, enhancing their quality of life. Issues of life course, culture and gender will be explored, with implications for policy, product development as well as new approaches to commercial activities and training and support services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E020526/1","grantId":"ES/E020526/1","fundValue":"14940","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The work has been used to form a new research proposal which was funded by the Technology Strategy Board.
