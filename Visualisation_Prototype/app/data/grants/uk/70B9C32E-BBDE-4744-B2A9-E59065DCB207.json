{"id":"70B9C32E-BBDE-4744-B2A9-E59065DCB207","title":"The PPP-labels software for quantitative proteomics","abstractText":"The large-scale study of proteins (the functional molecules in cells) is called proteomics and the main technology for identification and quantification is mass spectrometry (MS). There are two popular proteomics methods, called &quot;label-based&quot; and &quot;label-free&quot;. One of the leading commercial software packages for label-free data analysis is Progenesis LC-MS from Nonlinear Dynamics (Newcastle, UK). We previously developed an application for adapting Progenesis LC-MS to analyse data from label-based studies, called the Progenesis Post-Processor (PPP). In this project, we are in the process of commercialising this software in a product called PPP-labels. We have requested support in the lead up to the release of the first version on the open market. We are also going to generate data sets in which we know the abundance of proteins to demonstrate and benchmark PPP-labels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024462/1","grantId":"BB/L024462/1","fundValue":"125876","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Robert Jones","coPersons":["Robert Jeffrey Beynon","Claire Emma Eyers"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
