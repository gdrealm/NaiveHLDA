Clearly poorer populations suffer worse reproductive health, but the mechanisms and extent of the link remain difficult to specify.&nbsp;It is clear that the relationship can work in both directions, at both the macro and micro levels. Some research has been conducted on the effect of poor SRH on poverty, yet relatively little attention has been paid to the effect of poverty on SRH despite the circular nature of causality. </p>\n\n<p>This seminar series aims to bring together leading academic researchers, policy makers and practitioners from across a range of disciplines and organisations in order to further our understanding of the linkages and feed-back processes between poverty and sexual and reproductive health in low resources settings.&nbsp;Strengthening the evidence base will inform interventions aimed at breaking these links. Unravelling the vicious circle related to poverty and SRH is vital if the health of people in developing countries is to be improved.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001832/1","grantId":"ES/H001832/1","fundValue":"18540","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nyovani Janet Madise","coPersons":["Ngianga-Bakwin  Kandala","Zoe  Matthews","Jane Cecelia Falkingham","Paula  Griffiths","Andrew Amos Channon","Tiziana  Leone","Ernestina Elizabeth Coast","Angela  Baschieri","Monica Akinyi Magadi","Sabu  Padmadas"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The key findings from the seminars are summarised as follows:\n\n\n\n• There are wide variations in fertility rates by socioeconomic status, rural/urban residence, and geographical location. Most African countries were unlikely to achieve Millenium Development Goal (MDG) 5b of universal access to family planning.\n\n\n\n• There was a strong link between high fertility and high child mortality so it is important for programmes to acknowledge this link by improving reproductive, maternal, and child health outcomes together.\n\n\n\n• Community-based family planning distribution schemes appear to be more successful in reaching the poorest than static facilities.\n\n\n\n• Poverty makes people more vulnerable to reproductive morbidities. The cost of treating such illnesses can lead people further into poverty.\n\n\n\n• Mental health and postnatal depression are neglected research areas.\n\n\n\n• Cash transfers appear to be effective in delaying onset of sexual activity and marriage among African adolescents. \n\n\n\n• The traditional methods to assess geographical variation in lower income settings do not take account of the potential differences at a very small scale, with the rich and poor living as neighbours.\n\n\n\nThe project identified the following as major gaps in research: \n\n\n\n• Research that shows the direction of causation between poverty and high fertility. There is a paucity of longitudinal data and outside of economics, under-utilisation of methodological approaches that can demonstrate causality. \n\n\n\n• Lack of strong evidence of a relationship between fertility and economic activity of women especially in the African context. \n\n\n\n• Insufficient evidence from interventions. Where this exists, there is a bias in publishing towards positive findings. The research can influence sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programmes by encouraging the review of service distributional modes and tailoring these to the needs of poor marginalised communities. For example, exploring community-based distribution of family planning as an alternative to static delivery points may be needed for rural community where the nearest town is far.\n\n\n\nService providers also need to be aware of mental health issues including postnatal depression which is often not considered in poor settings. \n\n \n\nDelaying the onset of childbearing among adolescents remains a challenge but it may be possible to achieve this by providing incentives to stay in education while at the same time providing SRH services to those who need them. Such solutions require multi-sector approaches combining health, education, social services, and involvement of the local community. The research is influencing government thinking in the global south and multilateral agencies. Through the engagement policy adopted by the project, government policymakers, international development partners, and agencies such as WHO and UNFPA and NGOs such as International Planned Parenthood Federation and Save the Children participated in discussions around the available research evidence and in highlighting areas where there is need for more research. \n\n\n\nThe project has also contributed to discussions around the agenda post MDGs. Ultimately, if the research is acted upon, there should be benefits for poor men and women to enable them to achieve their desired family sizes, to participate in all aspects of community life, and to enjoy sexual lives free from disease.\n\n\n\nWe expect research funding agencies to review the gaps identified by the seminars participants and to fund research which addresses these gaps. We also anticipate that the project findings will challenge and stimulate doctoral students and the wider scientific community to make original contributions that fill the gaps.
