Embryonic Stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to differentiate into any of the 200 different cell types that make up a higher organism. Complex regulatory mechanisms are present to maintain genes important for cell commitment silent in ESCs, but in a metastate which is compatible with activation upon differentiation. Towards devising efficient and safe stem cell procedures, we, and others, are interested in understanding the control mechanisms that maintain important developmental regulator genes silent in ESCs, and the dynamic changes that occur during cell differentiation. Our group has recently shown that an important cohort of developmental regulator genes, including genes that orchestrate commitment into neurons, are poised for activation in ESC. The poised state is characterized by association of silent genes with active and repressive chromatin, and with RNA Polymerase II, the enzyme that initiates the cascade of gene expression by transcribing the genetic information contained in the DNA into RNA molecules that serve as template for protein synthesis. We have found that developmental regulator genes, which are silent in ESCs, are actively transcribed but associated with polymerase II in a novel 'poised' conformation which uncouples the process of transcription from downstream events in gene expression. The presence of poised polymerase II complexes at developmental regulator genes maintains these genes silent in ESCs, but primed for induction in response to differentiation signals. With this proposal, we aim to understand the mechanisms of gene poising in ESCs and the dynamic changes in polymerase and chromatin conformation that accompany gene expression reprogramming during neuronal differentiation, from ESCs to neural stem cells, to fully differentiated dopaminergic neurons. At poised developmental regulator genes, we aim to investigate the activity of molecular complexes known to modulate polymerase II conformation, either by hindering its elongation during transcription, by preventing its phosphorylation, or by actively increasing dephosphorylation. Polymerase II is crucial to integrate events in the cascade of gene expression, as it not only transcribes the DNA sequence, but also recruits nuclear machineries which modify chromatin to make it compatible with transcription and RNA processing activities which promote the maturation nascent transcripts and transport out of the nucleus for protein synthesis. This research will provide important insights into the mechanisms of chromatin regulation that maintain the pluripotent program of gene expression in ESCs, to help understand the mechanisms of induced pluripotency and lineage commitment towards the design of cell therapies. We also aim to elucidate the roles of RNA polymerase II modification in integrating transcription with RNA processing and chromatin states, to help understand the basic mechanisms of gene regulation during differentiation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H008098/1","grantId":"BB/H008098/1","fundValue":"334903","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Impact has not yet been achieved.
