Animals are trained using food reward to co-operate with mild procedures such as blood-sampling, and therefore require less restraint and show reduced stress levels than untrained animals. However, widespread implementation of PRT is hindered by a lack of staff time and training skill (Prescott and Buchanan-Smith 2007). We will develop a fully-automated system and protocols for PRT that can be used within group housing environments. Animals are identified via RFID tags and rewarded automatically with food treats for pressing appropriate colour-cued buttons. Such a system represents a refinement of behavioural neuroscience techniques since initial training can be performed without food/fluid restriction, isolation or restraint. In addition, by pre-selecting animals that respond well to this training, the number of animals required for experiments can be reduced. More generally, demonstrating welfare and operational benefits using a simple, affordable technology with established training protocols would make automated PRT highly desirable in large animal facilities, thus facilitating the uptake of PRT techniques in these settings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100113/1","grantId":"G1100113/1","fundValue":"73513","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Jackson","coPersons":["Jonas  Zimmermann"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
