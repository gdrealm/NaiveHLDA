{"id":"01B6DDDD-A8F6-47C1-A111-57F886F7A11F","title":"Phenotyping root function in wheat","abstractText":"In the UK, approximately 30% of the production of wheat is on soils where insufficient soil moisture decreases yields by (on average) 1-2 t/ha. This costs between &pound;112M and &pound;224M each year in lost production (Foulkes et al. 2001). Studies comprising a limited range of wheat cultivars have shown that genotypes with deep root systems have been associated with high yield in water limited environments, while those with shallow root systems have been associated with increased nutrient uptake when soil water is plentiful. However, there is no comprehensive understanding of what configuration of root system architecture leads to improved resilience of yields, water and nutrient use efficiency, or what the trade-offs, if any, there are with yield potential. This is because roots are hidden underground, and important traits are discovered only by laborious, destructive excavation of roots. \n \nThis project will develop a rapid, non-invasive technique using electromagnetic inductance (EMI) to measure the degree of soil drying at different depths in plots of different wheat varieties. Current EMI technology can be used to profile with changes in conductance with depth, but is not being used to study root activity. A key objective for the project will be to optimise the existing capabilities of EMI, so that they can be used to characterize water extraction profiles beneath different varieties of wheat. We will use electrical resistance tomography (ERT), which is labour intensive, invasive and slow, as a tool to provide high resolution images of soil drying to help with the optimisation of EMI which is rapid, non-contact and efficient. \n \nPatterns of soil moisture extraction through the soil profile as the crop develops, which are related to growth and activity of the root system, will be measured with EMI. These data will be validated using conventional techniques such as root sampling via soil coring, buried soil moisture probes, changes in soil strength via penetrometer mearements, and root pulling strength. Initial field tests will comprise 20 UK &eacute;lite wheat lines, some of which in preliminary data have shown differences in soil water extraction patterns. We will use our new root phenotyping tool kit in field trials with the Avalon x Cadenza mapping population, which has already shown significant genetic variation for nutrient uptake, yield and grain quality. We will determine the correspondence between QTLs identified with our new tool kit and wheat root QTLs already published. We will use soil drying data at various depths to test hypotheses that describe relationships between yield, deep water extraction, soil strength and root placement within drying superficial soil layers. This information is essential for the breeder: for instance, it is not enough to know which varieties can produce deeper roots; confirmation that such a root system translates to greater yield and yield stability across a range of environments is also required before any investment is made in selection for particular root traits. \n \nAt the start of the project we will establish a project advisory panel comprising breeders and other members of industry to help guide the selection of materials for investigation. This project will provide a completely new measurement possibility that can be applied to large field trials to give a spatial map of soil water at different depths over time. With the help of the project advisory panel we will identify existing field trials that can be used to test our new methods. There are numerous laboratory methods available for phenotyping roots in seedlings that have led to the discovery of QTLs linked to various root traits. However, it is rare that any of these QTLs are validated under field conditions because current methods of examining roots in the field are time-consuming and expensive. The proposed studies will fill this gap, and can possibly complement work on wheat roots in the BBSRC-LINK project based at NIAB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019461/1","grantId":"BB/J019461/1","fundValue":"200765","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are investigating a panel of wheats selected by industry.

For the use of EMI and ERT laboratory calibrations between electrical conductivity/resistivity against soil water content were required. These have been competed for both soil types to be used in this project at Lancaster). The calibrations were performed in the &quot;pressure-plate apparatus&quot; which allows matric potential to be controlled precisely. Soil water content was also measured during the calibration procedure using commercially available soil moisture meters. Our calibration data were consistent with the expected results for a conductive clay-loam (Warren Field) and a more resistive sandy soil (Butt Close). We fitted a newly published model to the data. Results from the calibration process indicated that with soil drying in the field, the change in conductivity/resistivity will be greater in clay rich soils, thus the approach is more likely to be effective in more conductive soils. \n\nTwo fully randomised experiments in in four blocks were sown at two sites in Woburn in February 2013 (late due to poor weather). They compared 23 wheat lines agreed with our steering group as well as a fallow plot which was used for comparative purposes. These plots were used to develop protocols to use the newly acquired EMI instrument and to test the use of the penetrometer to distinguish differences in soil strength (a proxy for water uptake) between the soils under different commercial lines of wheat.\n\nWe found that, as predicted from the laboratory calibrations, in the heavier soil of Warren Field there was a greater range in the measured values of soil conductivity. In the lighter soil of Butt Close, there was a greater range in the values of penetrometer resistance. Preliminary statistical analysis has shown that:- \n1. Penetrometer resistance on the two sites for the different wheat lines was highly correlated; indicating that ranking the wheat lines in terms of water extraction was similar in each of the experimental sites. This was confirmed by a rank correlation test (P=0.003). \n2. Conductivity measurements from EMI could not distinguish differences in soil drying by the wheats on the lighter soil of Butt Close, but penetrometer measurements could. However, the conductivity measurements on each site for the different wheats were significantly correlated. \n3. In the heavier Warren field site, statistical analysis of 1/conductivity (i.e. resistivity) provided a good discrimination in terms of soil drying between the different wheats. Penetrometer resistance and electrical resistivity produced the same rank correlation of soil drying on each site (P=0.022). \n4. In Warren field, grain yield was positively correlated with resistivity (percentage variance accounted for 28.4% of the variance (P&lt;0.001). \n\nWith EMI measurements we show that changes in conductivity are consistent with measured changes in soil water content in the root zone of wheat. On a sandy clay loam the changes in conductivity were consistent with expected soil water profiles for water-limited conditions and also consistent with the progress of the crop from a vegetative stage, with high water demand, to a senesced condition with low water uptake. Differences in the inferred depth of water uptake between the four wheat lines studied were observed. On the loamy sand soil, with a cemented layer at a depth of approximately 0.4 m, water uptake appeared to be confined to the surface layers and controlled by soil lithological characteristics. On this site drawing inferences about differences between root water uptake between the wheats or the effect of growth stage is not possible, although the value of EMI as a tool to investigate soil-crop interactions is apparent. The project is not complete, but the objectives planned at this stage in the project have been met. We are now analysing the data from the 2014 experiment including measurements on mapping populations in the field. In the next season we will use a neutron probe to obtain accurate soil water content on all 23 lines in the projects wheat panel which was selected by the steering committee.
