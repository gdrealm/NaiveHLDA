Well publicised instruments aiming at reconciling work with family life adopted in Europe over the past decade have not, for the first time, addressed this issue in terms of women's rights exclusively. Women and men tights alike are concerned because the concept of reconciliation must now be considered with respect to the principle of sex equality, shifting the emphasis from women's only issue to a Human rights requirement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=19030/1","grantId":"19030/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Annick  Masselot","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
