The devices induce profound changes in the heart leading, in some cases, to significant improvements in heart function. It is thought that one of the elements that respond promptly to this treatment is the cardiac cell. In this project we aim to investigate how this cell changes in response to treatment with left ventricular assist devices. We will study isolated cells from the hearts of rats that are exposed to a reduction in mechanical load, in a similar fashion to hearts treated with left ventricular assist devices. Using sophisticated microscopic techniques we will study the response of molecules that are involved in the function of the cells and determine if they are responsible for changes in function. This research will help understanding the mechanisms responsible for poor function of the heart and provide potential targets for the treatment of patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L006855/1","grantId":"MR/L006855/1","fundValue":"463911","fundStart":"2014-01-09","fundEnd":"2017-01-08","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Gorelik","coPersons":["Cesare M Terracciano"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
