Motion between crustal blocks is a result of tectonic processes such as formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges, sinking of old crust into the interior of the Earth at subduction zones and collision between continental plates. \n\nFriction and normal stresses across faults cause them to be inactive, or 'locked' most of the time. Motion between crustal fragments is accommodated by elastic bending of rocks either side of the locked fault. When the stress parallel to the fault becomes sufficient to overcome friction and normal stresses, the fault slips rapidly. Seismic waves are a result of this sudden release of elastic energy. They radiate through the crust and spread around the Earth in a matter of minutes. The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the length of the fault rupture, and the amount of elastic bending since the previous earthquake.\n\nToday the Indian plate is moving north relative to Eurasia, accompanied by widespread seismicity. The Himalayan mountains are an expression of the convergence between these two continental plates since 50 million years ago. Along its eastern margin the Indian plate is sliding sideways past Indochina. More than half the annual motion across this sideways, or 'transform', plate boundary is focussed on the 1500 km-long Sagaing Fault in Myanmar. \n\nSince 1918 there have been 6 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0 to 7.9) along the Sagaing Fault. They were unequally distributed along the length of the fault, and a 260 km-long section remains un-ruptured. It is likely that this section is locked and may fail in a single large earthquake in the near future. The capital city of Myanmar, Nay Pyi Taw, straddles the Sagaing Fault in the centre of the un-ruptured section.\n\nOn 11/11/12, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake ruptured the Sagaing Fault at Shwebo, near Mandalay. The earthquake focus was at a shallow depth of about 10 km. Sixteen people were killed and fifty-two injured by the earthquake. Hundreds of houses, schools and religious buildings were damaged along a 150 km section of the Sagaing Fault. Aftershocks still continue. \n\nThe ultimate aim of this project is to mathematically model the state of stress along the Sagaing Fault. Stress modelling highlights where the fault is relaxed, and where stress is elevated. Earthquakes nucleate in areas of elevated stress. Data about previous earthquake ruptures is required to model the stress pattern along the fault. The 11th November Shwebo earthquake is the first large earthquake since Myanmar became accessible to foreign researchers, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to collect such data directly from the field.\n\nDuring an earthquake like the Shwebo event, the sides of the fault will slide about 0.2-1 m past each other. This displacement will cause a surface rupture, with sideways and vertical displacements. Systematic mapping of the surface rupture quantifies the amount and direction of slip along the fault, and shows whether the fault at depth is a single fracture or more segmented. Mapping the terminations of the fault rupture gives important information about how rupture is arrested. For example, ruptures often terminate across large gaps in the main fault where there is subsidence. \n\nThis research will use surface rupture data collected within 3 months of the Shwebo earthquake to understand how rupture propagates along the Sagaing Fault, and to find where future earthquakes are likely, with particular attention to the fault immediately south of Mandalay, where a long section has conspicuously little historical seismicity. The research will be a collaboration between experts in structural geology, seismology and seismic hazard assessment in Europe and Myanmar. The results will be widely communicated so they may be used to inform development policy in Myanmar and other seismically active areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K016474/1","grantId":"NE/K016474/1","fundValue":"12324","fundStart":"2013-02-11","fundEnd":"2013-07-10","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Mark Watkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":" The Sagaing Fault is a major tectonic structure that cuts through the centre of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), broadly dividing the country into a western half moving north with the Indian plate, and an eastern half attached to the Eurasian plate. The highly active tectonic plate boundary passing through Myanmar means that earthquakes are a significant hazard. In November 2012 the latest large (magnitude 6.8) earthquake caused by the Sagaing Fault struck the Thabeikkyin area 100 km north of Mandalay. An earthquake occurs when stress across a tectonic fault becomes greater than the friction locking the two sides together. The fault fails and the two sides slide past each other, causing seismic waves and damage at the surface. Seismic wave-triggered ground shaking affected much of central Myanmar after the Thabeikkyin earthquake, and a 45 km long tear, or surface rupture, formed along the trace of the Sagaing Fault. \n\n\n\nThe Thabeikkyin surface rupture is not a continuous trace - it is segmented into many separate parts on a variety of scales. The gaps between segments are zones of complex deformation, involving brittle fractures, pseudo-ductile processes and vertical motions. There are two main orders of segmentation. The first is small-scale segmentation that is a reflection of how the rupture propagates upwards to the surface through undeformed surficial sediments from a master fault segment at depth. The second is a reflection of large-scale segmentation of the master fault at depth. Large-scale segmentation is characterised by separation between segments of more than a few tens of metres, and by features associated with repeated slip events in the same position, such as linear mountains and areas of significant subsidence. Fault segmentation can arrest the propagation of earthquake ruptures, in the same way that drilling a hole in a crack in metal can terminate its propagation. The Thabeikkyin earthquake terminated at a 1.5 km wide gap between fault segments near its southern end. \n\n\n\nTwo key findings of this research are that:\n\n\n\n1) Only one large gap (1.5 km) exists along the failed fault section. Although that gap was large enough to arrest the magnitude 6.8 earthquake, previous observations show that earthquakes larger than magnitude 7 are usually terminated only by gaps of 5 km or greater. \n\n\n\n2) The displacement during the earthquake was at least 1.02 m, representing the release of approximately 50 years of accumulated elastic strain.\n\n\n\nWe conclude that insufficient slip occurred during the 2012 earthquake to fully relax the central part of the Sagaing Fault, leading to the possibility of another large earthquake at any time in the near future. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there are gaps between Sagaing Fault segments large enough to arrest a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake. Long, straight faults without large gaps tend to produce much larger earthquakes corresponding to longer failed fault sections than well-segmented faults. The major cities of Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw lie on the Sagaing Fault south of the Thabeikkyin event, and a future large earthquake could easily propagate through those cities, causing devastation on the scale of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. This research can be used to help understand and highlight the seismic hazard posed by the Sagaing Fault to all the major cities in Myanmar. The findings are being widely disseminated amongst scientists and policy makers in Myanmar to ensure that appropriate seismic zone maps and corresponding building codes are developed.
