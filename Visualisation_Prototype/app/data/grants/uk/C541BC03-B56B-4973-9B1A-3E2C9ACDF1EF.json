{"id":"C541BC03-B56B-4973-9B1A-3E2C9ACDF1EF","title":"Analysis of Anisotropic Inverse Boundary Value Problems","abstractText":"Effects of anisotropy are important in electrical, acoustical and optical imaging used in non-destructive testing, geophysics and medical imaging. If ignored these effects can result in a wrong solution to the inverse problem. There are currently very few theoretical results on scalar anisotropic inverse problems with no general approach towards stability and development of convergent reconstruction algorithms for solving these problems. Almost nothing is known about inverse boundary value problems for systems of partial differential equations, especially in the anisotropic case. The aim of this research is to develop analytical and geometric methods to study uniqueness and stability in anisotropic inverse problems and to implement these methods by developing convergent reconstruction algorithms for solving fully non-linear inverse boundary value problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F033974/1","grantId":"EP/F033974/1","fundValue":"287581","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Robert Lionheart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
