However, the utility of these compounds has been progressively eroded as bacteria have evolved to resist their effects. Increases in antibiotic resistance prevent effective treatment of bacterial infections, and are associated with significantly greater illness and death of patients. Consequently, major strain is placed on the healthcare system and the adverse effects are felt throughout society as a whole. This is especially true for what is arguably the most important ?superbug?, Staphylococcus aureus. This organism causes a wider array of infections than any other bacterium, and the number of effective drugs available to treat the infections it causes is rapidly dwindling. Ordinarily, S. aureus becomes resistant as a result of permanent changes to its genetic make-up that allow it to grow in the presence of antibiotics. However, all S. aureus strains frequently display ?pseudoresistance? (PR) to antibiotics, a state in which the bacteria are unable to grow but are not killed, allowing them to resume growth when antibiotic treatment stops. The most important of these PR mechanisms are biofilms and antibiotic tolerance. The former describes films of bacteria growing on biological or inert surfaces (e.g. human tissue, indwelling medical devices), while the latter describes a type of PR which can be achieved by more than one route. These PR mechanisms are extremely important, since they occur frequently (e.g. biofilms occur in two-thirds of human infections, and tolerance is seen in two-thirds of strains isolated from patients with a S. aureus heart-valve infection), and both result in treatment failure with antibiotics. This project aims to understand exactly how these PR mechanisms prevent antibiotics from effectively killing bacteria. This information is essential for guiding the development of strategies and/or drugs that could allow PR to be circumvented. Dissection of the molecular basis of PR will shed light on bacterial processes that can be blocked or perhaps themselves be targeted by new antibacterial drugs. The potential for developing strategies aimed at preventing the formation of intractable biofilms on medical devices such as intravenous catheters, an extremely common cause of hospital infection, will be particularly valuable.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501247","grantId":"G0501247","fundValue":"301004","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex John O'Neill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
