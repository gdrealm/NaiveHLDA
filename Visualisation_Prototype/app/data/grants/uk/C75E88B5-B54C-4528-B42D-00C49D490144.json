Then she will work oninterpreting the generic phenomena in the setting of LT, QEA and QSA.The main applications will be to show the existence of Richardson elementsfor some classes of Lie algebras, in particular for seaweed Lie algebras. Otherapplications include a natural interpretation of combinatorial properties ofroot systems of simple Lie algebras and a new construction of crystal bases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I022317/1","grantId":"EP/I022317/1","fundValue":"91830","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2014-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiuping  Su","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
