{"id":"D0C3B857-5573-4FEE-AF57-F6909563D4BF","title":"Walking Voices: first generation migrants' experiential attachments to urban neighbourhoods","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to investigate perceptions and values of neighbourhoods as described by first generation migrants. Focusing on the spatial, temporal and sensory context of the local environment, the research will address how experience of place contributes to settlement processes and cultural identity. How might memories of homelands contribute to a sense - or absence - of place attachment in the adopted city? Deepening understandings of both motivations and barriers towards engagement in the public realm will help inform initiatives regarding cohesive communities and healthy lifestyles.</p> \n<p>The research uses qualitative and reflective methodology working intensively with a small group. Ten participants from a range of home countries and currently living in north Sheffield, will be loaned mini-disk recorders and asked to make real-time commentaries of walks or journeys in their daily lives. Supported by training from BBC Radio Sheffield, each will make twelve recordings over a three month period. Individual interviews and participant-guided tours will help contextualise the immediate accounts, and will inform an ethnographic and social mapping of the neighbourhood. The research scope includes interviews with environmental and community organisations to relate findings to policy and practice. Outputs include academic papers, a radio programme and interactive website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D005353/1","grantId":"ES/D005353/1","fundValue":"77348","fundStart":"2006-07-24","fundEnd":"2007-11-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare  Rishbeth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
