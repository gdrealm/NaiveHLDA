It has been widely adopted by scientists as a &quot;model organism&quot;, delivering general insights into how bacterial cells function. Working on B. subtilis brings many benefits: it is not dangerous; it can be easily manipulated to allow in-depth studies; many aspects of its biology are very well understood allowing observations to be put into context. Insights obtained from work on B. subtilis are of relevance to a wide range of related bacteria, including pathogens that cause infections in humans and animals, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Clostridium difficile and the anthrax bacillus.\n\nB. subtilis, like many other bacteria, faces an uncertain environment and therefore has to regulate the expression of genes and synthesis of proteins to meet changing circumstances. For many years the central dogma of molecular biology has been that &quot;DNA makes RNA makes Protein&quot;, with the assumption that interactions between proteins and DNA control the production of RNA, which then makes protein. However, we now recognise, from studies on a range of organisms from humans to bacteria, the existence a wide variety of &quot;non-coding RNAs&quot; that are not directly responsible for protein production, but instead regulate gene expression in a number of ways. Small regulatory RNAs are a group of non-coding RNAs that bind to other RNA molecules and regulate their function.\n \nThrough a pioneering study of gene expression in B. subtilis, which was published in the prestigious Science magazine, the applicant and her collaborators have identified over 150 small regulatory RNAs in this organism. This provides us with a timely and exciting opportunity to investigate the function of these newly discovered RNAs, exploiting a range of innovative high-throughput molecular-biology approaches, twinned with access to cutting-edge high-throughput sequencing technologies, to shed light on this new regulatory landscape. This research will fill a significant gap in our current knowledge for an important bacterial species, with the potential to enhance our ability to manipulate the organism during industrial processes and to improve our understanding of related pathogenic organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L020173/1","grantId":"BB/L020173/1","fundValue":"391008","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma Louise Denham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
