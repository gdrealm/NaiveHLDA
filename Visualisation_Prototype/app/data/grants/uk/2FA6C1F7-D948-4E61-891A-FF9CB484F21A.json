{"id":"2FA6C1F7-D948-4E61-891A-FF9CB484F21A","title":"Virtual Increase in Signal Analysis Bandwidth for Wideband Transmitter Optimisation","abstractText":"The development of future wireless communication standards is aiming to offer an increased data transfer capabilities, higher efficiencies and reduced latency. For example, 5G is aiming to deliver 1Gb/s data transfer speed (more for local radio networks), 10 times more than current 4G wireless communication systems. The deployment of small cells solutions working with signals in the millimetre-wave frequency bands is a strong candidate and significant funding and research work are currently taking place. The hardware required to deliver these data rates has to handle signals that exhibit more than 1GHz bandwidth. This hardware consists of transmission and reception analogue architectures based on semiconductor components. In the presence of wideband signals, nonlinear behaviour is exhibited by these semiconductor components which results in corruption of the data and an increase of up to five times in the signal bandwidth. Therefore, linear transmission and reception of signals is essential for reliable communications to occur. Moreover, reducing the power consumption of wireless communication infrastructure goes far beyond the reduction of the deployment and running costs of wireless networks since small cell architecture deployment will massively increase the number of transceiver modules and hence the amount of energy they consume. Therefore it is vital to develop wireless transceiver architecture that is linear, efficient and over wider bandwidths than today, otherwise the deployment of future wireless communication systems is going to face massive sustainability and even feasibility problems. \nThis research project will explore new solutions to enable wireless transmitters exploitation in the presence of wideband signals to sustain the ever growing need for higher data rates capabilities in wireless communications. The new solutions will be in form of new instrumentation architectures that outperform current commercial products, new characterisation procedures and signal processing algorithms that enable wideband transmitters operation in a linear and efficient manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N002709/1","grantId":"EP/N002709/1","fundValue":"98519","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Souheil  Ben Smida","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
