From perspectives such as antibiotic therapy and biotechnological applications, there are obviously numerous opportunities once the substrates and reactions catalyzed by these novel enzymes are established. However, considerable efforts are often required to establish the function of a newly identified enzyme if there is no initial knowledge of the physiological role it plays. In addition, identification of specific inhibitors of its function can also be laborious and involve screening of enormous libraries of chemicals. However, recent years have seen the advent of a novel type of approach to defining molecules that bind to purified enzymes. This fragment based screening (FBS) technology involves analysis of binding of much more limited libraries of small molecules than would be used in typical compound screens as used, for example, in the Pharmaceutical sector. Initial 'hits' from the FBS approach may bind the target enzyme only quite weakly, but with the help of protein structural methods their position of binding can be determined accurately. Once a number of such hits are obtained, the combined information on their binding locations and the nature of the chemistry in these sites and the surrounding environment can provide a basis for 'elaborating' the structure of the molecules such that tighter binding is achieved, or even chemically 'merging' fragments bound at adjacent sites to enable construction of much tighter binding molecules as potent inhibitors of the target enzyme. This FBS method is now increasingly used in industry (in areas such as drug development) as a complementary method to the more typical 'high throughput screening' techniques that involved huge chemical libraries. In the current proposal, we will exploit and develop the FBS technology in studies of a class of enzyme called cytochromes P450 (P450s) from the TB-causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The P450s are enzymes that bind oxygen to an iron atom in a heme group bound to the protein, and then 'activate' the oxygen to enable the insertion of an oxygen atom into their substrates, which are typically lipid molecules that bind in the active site of the enzyme, close to the heme group. A large number (20) of P450s are found in Mtb, and it is recognized that many of these are essential enzymes for bacterial survival and for their infection of the host. However, there is a paucity of information on the substrates and physiological functions of the majority of the P450s. This project will use FBS methods to define fragments that bind to selected Mtb P450s involved in cholesterol metabolism and in other unusual biochemistry, and then define their binding mode using structural biology methods. The identities and positions of binding of the fragments will then be used in further work to chemically join fragments and to add functionalities to fragments in order to create much tighter binding molecules as specific inhibitors of catalytic functions of the P450s, and as probes of their mechanism. Further, we will make new types of libraries that contain fragments of lipids, steroids and other molecules that are typical substrates for P450s, and use FBS in a novel way to identify substrate molecules for 'orphan' Mtb P450s with unknown function - again using a combination of chemical synthesis and structural biology to 'home in' on true substrates for these P450s, and so provide new knowledge on Mtb's complex lipid biochemistry. This application will thus provide important new information on the physiological chemistry of an important bacterium, and drive new applications of FBS in enzyme substrate identification through technical developments in the methodologies used.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019227/1","grantId":"BB/I019227/1","fundValue":"411571","fundStart":"2012-01-03","fundEnd":"2015-01-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work is ongoing - but publications from this joint Manchester/Cambridge collaboration have been produced that demonstrate strong progress in the development of M. tuberculosis cytochrome P450 isoform specific inhibitors.

The P450s are enzymes that bind and activate oxygen - allowing them to catalyze the insertion of oxygen atoms into substrate molecules that bind in the active sites of these enzymes. The substrates bind close to a heme group that binds the oxygen and inserts it into the substrate. There are a large number of P450s in M. tuberculosis, and we (and others) have shown that a number of these enzymes are crucial for the survival of M. tuberculosis and/or for its ability to infect the host organism. By using FBS, we have (in collaboration with Chris Abell's team at the University of Cambridge) been able to identify small chemicals (fragments) that bind to a range of different M. tuberculosis P450 enzymes that have been produced in the Munro lab at Manchester. This process is done using spectroscopic and protein stability methods (NMR and thermal shift techniques), and once fragments found to bind to a particular P450 are identified, work proceeds to quantify their affinity for the target P450, and then to determine their mode of binding to the enzyme using protein crystallography and X-ray diffraction methods. With this work completed, the next phase is to identify fragments bound sufficiently close in space in the P450 protein such that they can be chemically linked or merged (or otherwise chemically extended) to enable the production of tighter binding inhibitors that become more specific for the target P450 enzyme. An iterative process of further improvement of the next-phase inhibitors (following the same steps as above) then occurs until potent inhibitors are generated. In this work, this outcome has been achieved very effectively for the M. tuberculosis P450 CYP121 - which we showed to be an essential gene for bacterial viability and that we know produces an unusual cyclic dipeptide that likely has a crucial role in bacterial survival in the host. Tight binding inhibitors were developed using FBS and are now undergoing evaluation for their potency against the M. tuberculosis bacterium. Earlier stage molecules were evaluated in the same way. Fragments hits have already been obtained against a series of other M. tuberculosis P450s (including cholesterol hydroxylases such as CYP125; and novel P450 enzymes including CYP144 and CYP143). A novel method by which a fragment library of compounds based on fragments of known P450 enzyme substrates was also developed, and used to probe effectively the substrate specificity of the M. tuberculosis CYP126 P450. Substantial progress has been made, and work is continuing in this area to produce a range of specific inhibitors for different M. tuberculosis P450 enzymes that could be effective new antibiotics that are much needed against multidrug resistant strains of the pathogen. The aim is to produce highly specific inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis P450 enzymes that are important for viability and infectivity of the pathogen. Inhibitors developed in this way might be used effectively as antibiotics against the bacterium. Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
