{"id":"FFA403C7-FB03-4FFF-9B3B-75DAF9EA55F9","title":"Evolving the design of unicondylar knee replacement to improve post operative function","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to evolve current unicondylar knee replacement (UKR) design paradigms based on contemporary knowledge of natural knee kinematics. The design concepts shall consider implants specific for knees with varus and valgus deformity, and an all polymer configuration that would remove metal from the replaced joint entirely. To achieve these aims, a large dataset of computed tomography scans of normal, varus and valgus knees will be generated. The geometry and morphology of these data will be analysed using principal component analysis and multivariate statistical methods such that key relationships are identified. These data shall be used to generate implant design concepts for normal, varus and valgus knees that can recreate the natural anterioposterior constraint of the medial tibiofemoral articulation during flexion. Design concepts shall be assessed for implant stress, bone strains and interface micromotion using an experimentally validated finite element (FE) protocol previously generated in our group. Once the FE gives acceptable values, rapid prototypes of the designs shall be manufactured and implanted in cadaver knees by an experienced surgeon. The kinematics during flexion shall be measured using established methods in our laboratory and compared to the natural knee to prove the concept of the prototype design. Successful delivery of the proposal will lead to the development of a UKR with significant advantages over existing devices including more natural kinematics and soft tissue tension, morphology to suit common deformities, and potentially lower cost materials and manufacturing methods. By supporting the final design concepts, the proposed research can be used to support clinical trials of the device or any subsequent regulatory submission. The proposed research is highly likely to succeed due to the close relationship our lab has with orthopaedic surgeons, our track record of commercialising concepts and the support of a well respected industry partner. The environment in which the proposed research will be conducted will therefore allow the project to thrive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010901/1","grantId":"EP/J010901/1","fundValue":"99619","fundStart":"2012-09-13","fundEnd":"2014-03-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Patient satisfaction after knee replacement is poor, and this is a function of the replaced joint not replicating the biomechanics of the natural knee. One aspect of this is the morphology of the replaced surfaces, which partly define the stability and movement of the knee. Our study presented new data on the morphology of the varus (bow legged) knee, and this data will be used in improved implant design.  ","person":"Jonathan  Jeffers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We have demonstrated that for bow-legged knees (a common deformity in active people), the joint alignment can change, but there are specific landmarks that do not change with the deformity, and this can be very useful to make sure knee replacements are aligned properly in this patient population. We have published key geometrical relationships for the bow-legged knee (varus) that could be used in knee replacement design Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism","dataset":"gtr"}
