The project developed as a partnership between the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow City Council, West Dunbartonshire Council and Save the Children, Scotland.</p>\n\n<p>The knowledge exchange activities consisted of a series of five workshops looking at how agencies and families can work together, placement exchanges between the university and local authority partners and five small scale projects conducted in local communities, which focussed on consultation with vulnerable families on how services can be improved. Also, a synthesis of existing evidence on inter-agency working was completed. In total, over 200 service providers participated in events (workshops, projects, placements) and over 100 families took part in projects.</p>\n\n<p>Findings reveal that successful integrated working requires clear vision and leadership from partner agencies, commitment to make things happen, good relationships and mutual respect between services collaborating and a supportive culture of working in multi-agency teams. A shared knowledge exchange agenda is key, with flexibility in relation to different cultures of working, different ‘languages’ and changing priority agendas.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-809-19-0020","grantId":"RES-809-19-0020","fundValue":"76469","fundStart":"2009-10-15","fundEnd":"2011-01-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research has been used to inform multi-agency working in Scotland and provide further improvements in service delivery.

Parents involved also had high expectations, directly related to improvements wanted in service.\n\no Feedback on workshops was consistently high, with participants valuing opportunities to share practice and ideas. Many considered attendance as time well-spent and very valuable for their job.\n\no Work-based, work-related, practitioner and parent-driven projects are more successful and manageable than externally driven initiatives; trust between partners and ongoing fostering of relationships are key to long-term sustainability.\n\no Successful, sustainable KE processes need commitment from all partners and a shared KE agenda, with flexibility for unpredictable changes and willingness from all parties to learn about the different cultures of working, different 'languages' and priority agendas. The findings from the programme can be used to inform future training of practitioners involved in multi-agency working and policy delivery at local authority level in relation to tackling child poverty. Findings can also inform service improvement in relation to expectations from families. This research can inform the setup of similar knowledge exchange partnerships between universities and local authorities/voluntary sector organisations; it provides useful information on the opportunities practitioners find useful for improving service delivery and the views of service users in terms of expectations of front line services.
