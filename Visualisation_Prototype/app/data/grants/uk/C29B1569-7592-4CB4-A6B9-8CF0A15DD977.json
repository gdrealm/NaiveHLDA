They are thought to arise from either contamination of the surfaces during manufacture or various forms of environmental attack. When adhesives are used for safety critical applications the current approach is to undertake extremely careful process control. None-the-less premature failure of adhesive joints still occurs and kissing bonds are the most likely cause. In addition to this, one of the limiting factors preventing the more widespread use of adhesive bonding is the lack of quantitative non-destructive testing procedures capable of detecting kissing bonds. However, despite this need, the physical nature of the kissing bonds and their failure mechanics are unknown. This lack of knowledge acts as a fundamental barrier to progress and inhibits the design of appropriate NDT procedures. This project aims to investigate the phenomena of kissing bonds in adhesive joints and redress this lack of current understanding. The project will take a holistic approach and obtain 1) a detailed understanding of the physical nature of kissing bonds; 2) an understanding of how kissing bonds lead to a mechanical failure and; 3) undertake an nvestigation into their detectablity using both current state-of-the-art methods (high frequency ultrasonics) and using nonlinear ltrasonics which is an exciting emerging technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D055954/1","grantId":"EP/D055954/1","fundValue":"112028","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Felicity Jean Guild","coPersons":["Zofia  Luklinska"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" Reliable and repeatable kissing bonds can be successfully produced using a mould release agent, Frekote, or weakening an electricallly debonding adhesive, ElectRelease(TM) with a low voltage. The surface chemistry and joint mechanics of the wekened interfaces can be analysed using a range of techniques. The strength of the weakened joints can be accurately predicted using numerical techniques (finite element analysis). ElectRelease(TM) adhesive has potential important uses in electronic manufacturing when adhesion is required during one stage of assembly. The chemistry and morpholgy associated with this debonding have been elucidated. This should lead to more confident use of this adhesive in such applications. The detection of kissing bonds from surface strain measurements has been shown to be a future viable approach. This is an important finding for manufacturers of structural bonded parts, including the aerospace and marine sectors. Aerospace/ Defence and Marine,Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
