People with dementia and their families often become disconnected from society through the stigmatizing effect dementia has on taking part in everyday activities. Added to this, the current economic climate has meant reductions in many services, and there is often a lack of meaningful activity available to this population.\nMany people with dementia wish to remain within their communities, in the home of their choice, near their family, carers and friends, with the support of health and social care services. Considering this alongside the challenge of demographic change and the impact of dementia, communities and their resources have considerable potential. To explore this potential, the large project will determine how dementia supportive communities can be created through innovative community based arts interventions. \n\nResearch to date, although limited, suggests a number of potential benefits of arts participation to the quality of life, health and well-being of people with dementia. This project wishes to build on this to address a new area, which will maximise the involvement of, and potential benefit to communities. It will look at how participation in community arts interventions can increase well-being and connectedness between the dementia community and wider society. It will also examine another new area, to further understand the 'active ingredients' that create the connection between arts participation and good outcomes. \nTo realise the aims, the research will be set within four areas of the UK. These consist of ethnically and geographically diverse communities to contextualise the research, with both distinct and common characteristics such as ex-heavy industry, urban and rural contrasts, ex-mining communities, bilingualism. The research will build on existing relationships and develop new ones with community and policy partners, such as arts organisations, museums, galleries, health and social care practitioners, charities and local government, to mobilise existing community arts resources, implement into practice and increase connections between partners. This will ensure full engagement and maximum benefit and impact. It will also contribute towards building sustainability.\n\nThe processes and outcomes of the research will be assessed using a range of quantitative and qualitative approaches, and will use art and film, both as a tool for analysis and for visual, creative representations of the results. This will highlight how and why the arts and connectivity might 'work' and will inform further research, policy and practice. Through development of outreach aspects of the intervention, it will reach communities at risk of access deprivation and existing communities 'not served' by the arts and cultural resources. In aspiring to create dementia friendly communities, the research will facilitate change in societal attitudes and promote participation and inclusion. The contribution to the creation of dementia supportive communities will build community well-being.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011029/1","grantId":"AH/J011029/1","fundValue":"11996","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This was a development grant, which supported R&amp;D activity that lead to securing of ?1.2m research funding.
