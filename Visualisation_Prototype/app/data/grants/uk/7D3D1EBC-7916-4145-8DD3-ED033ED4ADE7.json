{"id":"7D3D1EBC-7916-4145-8DD3-ED033ED4ADE7","title":"Society's Relationship with the Natural World and the Role of the Outdoors in Health and Wellbeing","abstractText":"<p>This project will examine the socio-economic and biological factors that shape individual decision-making regarding the use of the outdoors in order to further our understanding of why people use the outdoors to varying degrees, in different ways and with varying degrees of positive health outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>This project focuses on the 'natural' outdoors where people can engage with nature (from private gardens to wilderness spaces). Previous research has investigated the relationship between health and use of the outdoors but this network provides a new opportunity to connect social scientists with biological and medical researchers. </p>\n\n<p>The network will further inter-disciplinary work, bringing together researchers to collaboratively develop a framework and methods for investigating the relationship between the outdoors and health; laying the foundations for a longitudinal study that will collect the data currently lacking on outdoor use and measured health outcomes and placing greater emphasis on understanding the relationship between health and outdoor use at the individual level. </p>\n\n<p>The project will consist of three types of activity: networking events; project development activities: to assess the value and gaps of social science and health data on the issue of the outdoors and health, and proposal writing for future research. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H006036/1","grantId":"ES/H006036/1","fundValue":"156257","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Tinsley","coPersons":["Michael  Depledge","Richard James Mitchell","Alex  Reis","Sarah-Anne  Munoz","Andrew  Church","Birgitta  Gatersleben","Jung Jin  Park","Jane Catriona Farmer","Sandra  MacRury","Melanie Ann Smith","Catharine  Ward Thompson","David  Uzzell","Peter  Higgins","Neil  Ravenscroft","Margaret Joan Currie","Genevieve  Adkins","Steven Christopher Cummins","Peter Justin Varley","Martin Francis Price"],"organisation":"University of the Highlands and Islands","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
