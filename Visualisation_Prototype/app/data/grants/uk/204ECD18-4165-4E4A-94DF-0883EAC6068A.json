{"id":"204ECD18-4165-4E4A-94DF-0883EAC6068A","title":"Development of HV-CMOS sensor technology for future tracking applications","abstractText":"Integrated technologies will be employed more and more beyond the extremely high performance tracking applications that target the region nearest to the interaction point in collider physics experiments. The UK holds a strong leadership in the development and construction of intermediate and large area silicon strip detectors, with expertise ranging from sensor development and integrated circuit design to the engineering of complete detector systems. Investment in future technologies is essential to maintain this leadership. HV-CMOS is a very strong candidate to become one of the main technologies for high precision particle detection, because of its potential wide commercial availability, its cost effectiveness and its expected layout flexibility. Our proposal focuses on demonstrating these advantages and would be an important step to develop the ability in the UK to design custom detectors. This would be a key element in developing UK leadership in the application of this technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L002361/1","grantId":"ST/L002361/1","fundValue":"160238","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Joost  Vossebeld","coPersons":["Marco  Gersabeck","Anthony Allen Affolder","David M Raymond","Geoffrey  Hall","Philip Patrick Allport","Themistocles  Bowcock","Gianluigi  Casse"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
