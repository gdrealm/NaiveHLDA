A great deal of time and money has been spent globally on sequencing genomes, followed by high-throughput methods for transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic measurement. Cells, however, are complex systems of networks and pathways. A long term goal of molecular biology must be to take a sequenced genome and be able to model the intracellular activities of a cell, and ultimately a complex organism. The availability of accurate and robust models has the potential to enable major advances in a range of activities ranging through pharmaceuticals and health care to food production and bioremediation. Approaches can be top down, bottom up or through accurate definition of limited inputs and outputs whilst ignoring the intervening detail. The goal is an accurate model of the dynamic activities of a cell under a specific set of growth conditions, when many proteins may be present but not active, only interacting with target proteins or DNA when activated to do so (the so-called 'sensome' or 'interactome'). None of the techniques available to date can reliably say which proteins are active when or which interact with which. Even recent developments in, for example, fast through-put guided yeast two hybrid systems tell you what can interact, not what does interact in vivo and when. We believe the best way forward is to initially focus on a limited number of tractable and important biological systems, for example, the bacterial histidine protein kinase (HPK) dependent chemosensory pathway or a defined section of the yeast cell cycle pathway, and to develop a reliable, predictive model for those systems. With, for example the bacterial chemosensory pathway, models can be tested through to species with complex pathways and these then extended to the total complement of HPK pathways in selected bacterial species. The long term goal is to carry these approaches to more complex pathways in higher organisms, and eventually to extend the models to sensory systems in general, with each model tested biologically as the programme develops. These studies will lead not only to an understanding of the complex interactive networks of signalling pathways, but also to the identification of signature motifs, possibly providing new targets for antimicrobials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D020190/1","grantId":"BB/D020190/1","fundValue":"8933400","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Armitage","coPersons":["Anne Elizabeth Trefethen","Mark  Sansom","G  Reinert","Paul  Jeffreys","Philip Kumar  Maini","Christopher Joseph  Schofield","Keith  Gull","Jotun  Hein","David Andrew Fell","Martin Edward Noble","Patrick Eugene McSharry","Neil  Johnson","David  Gavaghan"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
