The principal objective will be to develop strategies that support children and young people's view of the museum to inform design decisions and related research. The workshops, which will be hosted by museums, will explore existing methodologies and approaches that have so far been used in museum spaces to engage children in discussions about decision making around the principles of design. Participants of the workshops will then develop and adapt these approaches in situ. One workshop will involve children and young people. They will work alongside architecture students from the University of Sheffield who will be briefed to act in a support role to encourage the view of the museum space from the child's point of view to be recorded. Design activities on the theme 'the museum I'd like' will engage the children in a valuable process of envisaging the possibilities of museums as spaces for learning, exploration, discovery and research. The results of the workshops will be presented at an open conference at the end of the series and will be valuable to learners, parents, teachers and other educators in the educational and cultural sectors. A journal article will present and discuss the findings by key collaborators from the Museum and Higher Educational sectors.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F001207/1","grantId":"AH/F001207/1","fundValue":"16529","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-07","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Burke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
