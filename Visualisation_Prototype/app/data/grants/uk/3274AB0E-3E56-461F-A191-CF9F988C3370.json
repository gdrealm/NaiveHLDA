The resource is most likely to be of interest to the policy community, cultural heritage and media sectors. The MMP hosted public event to be held in 2015 will enable further conversations about the research the network to take place and opportunities for knowledge exchange to be advanced.

The online learning resource drew directly from existing social science research and reflects the different geographical, disciplinary and methodological approaches of the academic network. In 2015, the MMP will hold a public event to discuss British emigration and key members of the academic network will speak at that event. This will further publicise the project, the online resource and achieve knowledge transfer. The MMP will maintain the online resource, there is possibility for the website to be added to and developed in future and the MMP can draw from the material for any future exhibitions or events. Also, by clearly highlighting the scholarship of the academic network and providing links to further publications and contact details. There is opportunity for the academics in the project to be contacted by members of the public, policy communities and the media. Individual members of the academic network are already exploring opportunities for future collaboration with the MMP. For example, Professor Karen O'Reilly is organising an exhibition about British emigration to be held in Hong Kong in 2015 and has involved the MMP in these preparations.
