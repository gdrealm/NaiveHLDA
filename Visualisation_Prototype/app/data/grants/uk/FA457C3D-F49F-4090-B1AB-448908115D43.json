Indeed, the potentially general usefulness of inorganic systems of this type in anion coordination and supramolecular chemistry has not been realised, despite the fact that inorganic hosts frequently offer far greater affinity for anions than organic relatives (particularly those containing Lewis acidic metal atoms). In establishing a new collaboration, this proposal seeks to harness the expertise of two of the UK's leading researchers in main group chemistry in the development and exploitation of the new synthetic concept of inverse coordination of salt lattices, in which a range of elegant metal-based acceptors will be used as anion hosts. A major area of interest is the rational design of supramolecular main group assemblies using the concept of inverse coordination. In addition to providing the means for the stabilisation of unusual inorganic and organometallic anions, the immobilisation of the anions of simple salts by metal-based inverse ligands provides a novel approach to fast-ion conductors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D077400/1","grantId":"EP/D077400/1","fundValue":"414716","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dominic  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The project was highly successful at the preparation of a braod range of new inorganic materials. The project developed several new strands of research. In particular one which is becoming important is the applications of the original reagent systems as dehydroupling reagents and catalysts for element-element bond formation. H2 storage and the energy sector. In particular cheap environmentally friendly catalysts for H2 delivery in engines. There are exciting new areas for exploitation. It transpired later on in the program and to the current day that the reagents explored in the original program are good catalysts for B-N dehydrocoupling in particular. We are currently exploring the use of these in reversible H2 storage in BN systems. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
