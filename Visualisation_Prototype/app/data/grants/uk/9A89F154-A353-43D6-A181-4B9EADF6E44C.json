Such communication depends upon electrical signals that regulate the amount of calcium that enters cells using cell surface components called calcium channels. Malfunction in calcium channels causes many diseases including heart failure and epilepsy. Recently, a very powerful and safe group of drugs called gabapentinoids have been developed that correct many calcium channel malfunctions, but it is unclear how they work. Very recent studies show these drugs modulate a calcium channel component called the alpha2-delta subunit. Unfortunately, what this subunit does is also unclear. Based on evidence showing that alpha2-delta delivers calcium channels to the cell surface and keeps them there, we think that it gathers calcium channels at sites where cells contact each other and that gabapentinoids somehow affect this process. Using sophisticated microscopes, techniques to measure calcium channel activity and tools we have developed, we now plan to test this notion by looking at how alpha2-delta interacts with other regions of calcium channels and with cell surface components involved in cell contact. By also seeing how gabapentinoids affect these events, we think we will be able to supply the information needed to develop new and better calcium channel drugs capable of treating the large number of, often very serious, diseases they are associated with.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700381","grantId":"G0700381","fundValue":"583652","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2011-04-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Mary Fitzgerald","coPersons":["Owen Thomas Jones"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
