Despite being so different, all our cells carry exactly the same information in their genes. What makes them special is what information they use, that is, which genes they switch on and off. Many diseases -such as cancer- appear when cells use the wrong genes.\nThe information on how to make a cell is stored in the form of a DNA molecule. However, this information cannot be read directly: it first needs to be copied into another molecule called RNA, from which it can be ?translated? into a protein. Proteins are the components that directly build the cell and make it function.\nFrom the moment an RNA molecule is made in the cell different proteins attach to it, directing every step of its life. These proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, modify the RNA so that it can be translated into a protein, decide when it should be destroyed or to which part of the cell it should be transported.\nRNA-binding proteins are important because they regulate the flow of information between DNA and proteins. When RNA-binding proteins do not function correctly, the cell loses control on the production of many proteins, and this may cause disease. For instance, defects in certain RNA-binding proteins lead to consequences such as muscular dystrophy or mental retardation.\nMy aim is to understand how RNA-binding proteins control the fate of RNA molecules. One way to study a complicated process of the human body is to use a model organism: this is a simpler creature, but similar enough to allow us to learn about ourselves. To study how RNA-binding proteins work I will use a simple yeast -made of a single cell- that can acquire different forms. I will remove RNA-binding proteins and see how this changes which genes are used by the cell, and I will study which RNAs are bound by different RNA-binding proteins. This will allow me to understand how cells control their genes in order to become different. I expect this information will be useful to understand how human cells behave and, eventually help us devise cures for disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501168","grantId":"G0501168","fundValue":"324038","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juan Ignacio Mata","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
