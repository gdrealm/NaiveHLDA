{"id":"CBD753D0-7B77-4A00-BD26-7C48275FDF3B","title":"Jacob Wackernagel, Vorlesgungen uber Syntax (Lectures on Syntax)","abstractText":"The proposed research will complete the commentary, introduction and bibliography for a new edition (in English) of the Vorlesungen uber Syntax mit besonderer BerOcksichtigung von Griechisch, Lateinisch und Deutsch ([Lectures on Syntax with special reference to Greek, Latin and German] 2 vols, Basle 1920 6, 2nd ed. 1926 8) by the great Swiss classicist and linguist Jacob Wackernage! (1853 1938). This masterpiece of classical and comparative philology has been out of print in German since 1996. The new edition will be published by OUP.\nWackernagel's Vorlesungen are not merely an important monument of 1ate 19th c. linguistics and classical studies: to a remarkable degree, they remain today as informative and suggestive as ever, indispensable on comparative syntax, and still the best available introduction, in any language, to Greek, Latin and comparative linguistics and, in spite of the title, not only to syntax, but to many aspects of the history and pre-history of the languages, their stylistics and sociolinguistics, and other subjects including the history of grammatical terminology.\n\nThe new edition aims through the introduction, translation, commentary and bibliography to make Wackernagel's text immediately accessible to the modern reader with a background in classical, medieval or modern languages or linguistics, to explain the scholarly context in which Wackernagel was writing and the assumptions that he was making, and to indicate the more significant advances that have been made since the 1920s in investigations of the subjects addressed by Wackernagel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501229/1","grantId":"AH/D501229/1","fundValue":"33067","fundStart":"2007-02-07","fundEnd":"2007-06-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Richard Langslow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
