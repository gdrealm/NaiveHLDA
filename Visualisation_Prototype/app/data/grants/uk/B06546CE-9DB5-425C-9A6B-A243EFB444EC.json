Many different proteins are present in a cell, although their amounts vary according to the stage of the lifecycle of the cell and in response to signals from its surroundings. Unravelling the roles of proteins in the processes that convert general purpose stem cells into specialized tissues allowing the development of multicellular organisms is an example of the type of problem that would benefit enormously from an ability to control the quantities of specific proteins present at a particular moment in time. Here we propose a means for controlling production of a protein by addition of a small molecule of our choice. Protein synthesis begins with the binding of specialized proteins known as transcription factors to regions of DNA adjacent to locations coding for proteins themselves. Blocking the transcription factor from binding DNA prevents the synthesis of the protein(s) coded by the genes that are targeted by that transcription factor. Our hypothesis is that by designing transcription factors that change shape when they bind a specific small molecule, we can flip them from an inactive form that is incapable of binding DNA to an active form that binds DNA and switches on protein synthesis. We will address the challenge of designing a switching transcription factor that responds to a small molecule chosen to display favourable properties in animals including lack of toxicity and good oral uptake. For this purpose we have chosen an antihistamine drug that interacts specifically with a protein involved in the inflammatory response and so exhibits few side effects. As it is difficult to design proteins from scratch, we will create genes encoding a large number of variants of a natural transcription factor that have been chosen to create a cavity in the transcription factor into which our small molecule could bind. Proteins rely on their interiors to maintain a precise shape, and in the absence of the small molecule we predict that the cavity will destabilize the shape of the transcription factor so that it no longer binds DNA. We will place our transcription factor genes into a virus that infects bacteria, so that bacteria produce virus particles which display the transcription factor on their exterior. Using DNA as bait, we will 'fish out' virus particles that bind to the DNA only when the small molecule is present, discarding the remaining virus. Although we may isolate only a very small number of virus particles, these can be amplified by replication in infected bacteria. By repeating the process of selection and amplification a number of times the majority of virus will display transcription factors that are able to switch their DNA binding in response to the small molecule. We will analyse how tightly these transcription factors bind DNA in the presence and absence of the small molecule, and determine information about their three dimensional structures to verify our hypothesis on their mode of action. Our final objective will be to place a new transcription factor into mammalian cells to test its ability to switch on a gene of interest in response to the small molecule. This work will be of interest to researchers involved in the structure and design of proteins, and how proteins interact with small molecules and DNA. There will be direct applications for the study of the roles of genes, by enabling researchers to selectively switch on proteins in cells and then monitor the outcome. This will yield insight into processes such as growth, cell differentiation, ageing and disease progression. Better understanding of these processes, the ways in which they can malfunction, and how to control them, will lead to an increase in the quality of life through enhanced avoidance of ill health in humans and improvements to agriculture and food production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E013503/1","grantId":"BB/E013503/1","fundValue":"297413","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Zinc finger constructs and knowledge generated from this project have been used as a starting point for another Cardiff University project aimed at creation of photo-switchable zinc finger transcription factors.

These proteins were produced on the surface of bacteriophage, a type of virus that infects bacteria. DNA immobilised onto magnetic beads was used to fish out phage that bound to the DNA. The protein consists of three &quot;finger&quot; modules and the middle of these was mutated with a view to creating a sensor for small molecule drugs that operates by switching on DNA binding when the drug is present. The phage libraries and zinc finger constructs that were developed could be adapted to select DNA binding proteins that respond to other stimuli such as light or metal ions other than Zn2+. These could find applications in synthetic biology for switching on gene transcription in response to a stimulus. Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
