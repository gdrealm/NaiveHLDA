{"id":"95C4317F-2CC8-4356-9E85-4BB401BACBEB","title":"Inverse Optimisation in Application to Scheduling","abstractText":"In recent years, the interest in inverse optimisation has increased dramatically. Unlike traditional optimisation models for which all parameters are given and the objective is to find the best solution subject to certain constraints, in inverse optimisation the exact values of some parameters are unknown and they should be determined so that a pre-specified solution becomes optimal. While inverse optimisation has attracted much attention of researchers in different areas of combinatorial optimisation, scheduling problems have not yet been studied in terms of inverse optimisation. The outcomes of this project will advance inverse optimisation research in the area of scheduling and will contribute to the UK's prominence in this newly emerging research direction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D059518/1","grantId":"EP/D059518/1","fundValue":"9960","fundStart":"2006-03-27","fundEnd":"2009-06-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project provided the first theoretical insight into the study of Inverse Optimisation problems in the area of Scheduling.

The project was aimed at extending a new direction of research - inverse optimisation - to the area of scheduling and it has successfully achieved its goal.\n\nAt the time of preparing the project proposal we were not aware of any inverse scheduling results. Throughout our work we have found only one paper by C. Koulamas (2005) on a very restrictive. The research conducted is mainly of theoretical nature. Potential applications are related to scheduling decisions in manufacturing and services. Due to the theoretical nature of our research, the main exploitation route for us is publishing project outcomes in high quality journals and presenting the results at the top international conferences. Our main results are published in the Journal of Scheduling, which is the leading journal in the area of Scheduling.
