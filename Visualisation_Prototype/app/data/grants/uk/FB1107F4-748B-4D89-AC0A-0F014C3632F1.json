Having acquired many top-class researchers and major grants over the past years, we have the resources to significantly increase our research output in core topics in computer, network and software security, as well as more complex topics, which require collaborations across research groups and departments. These include: effectively securing complex systems built on legacy software, support for real-time monitoring on forensics, and many more. \n\nThe Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research will bring together all of UCL's Cyber Security research and coordinate our efforts in addressing the big security challenges facing the UK. Through the ACE-CSR we will expand our existing network of partnerships with government and industry to ensure we tackle the most important problems and that our solutions work in the real world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004433/1","grantId":"EP/K004433/1","fundValue":"50914","fundStart":"2012-08-15","fundEnd":"2017-08-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jens  Groth","coPersons":["Martina Angela  Sasse"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
