This project brings distinguished cellist Matthew Barley together with composers Peter Wiegold and John Croft, with the goal of creating new performance pieces, through a research process that tests and develops new technologies, makes significant use of composer-performer collaboration and seeks the possibility of a 'new' instrument - cello thoroughly integrated with live electronics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E511252/1","grantId":"AH/E511252/1","fundValue":"5432","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Wiegold","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
