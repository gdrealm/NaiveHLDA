There is now evidence that vCJD can be spread from person to person by blood transfusion. There is no test and there is a long silent phase when people are infected but no one knows. A few young patients have been given a drug, pentosan polysulphate, directly into their brains and this seems to slow the disease down. This method was used because it was not thought the drug could get into the brain if it was injected intravenously but we now have some evidence from scrapie infected mice, which is a similar disease, that some may get in by this route as we have been able to extend their lives. We propose to investigate how we can get more of the drug into animals without needing to resort to delivering it straight into the brain and to do this safely.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701068","grantId":"G0701068","fundValue":"286545","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine Forbes Farquhar","coPersons":["Jean  Manson"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
