Getting more from existing resources due to increased energy efficiency (EE) also results in reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhanced energy security. For developing countries, EE could make modern energy services available at a faster pace and at lower costs to those who currently lack access to electricity. This research will investigate EE amongst &quot;New Modern Energy Consumers&quot; in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (also known as GMS: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) in order to improve policy design and implementation of EE measures. New modern energy consumers, i.e. those who are connected to the electricity grid with daily incomes of US$ 2 to 5, are expected to account for a large share of the expected increase in energy demand and thus GHG emissions. However, this target group does not exist in OECD countries and there are therefore few examples of EE policies that can be replicated and/ or adapted to the GMS, yet this target group will be essential to economic development in the region over the coming decades. Furthermore, effective implementation of energy policies remains a key challenge in GMS and other countries of the developing world. \nMECON aims to improve our understanding of the opportunities and barriers to increasing EE amongst new modern energy consumers in the GMS. The research will establish a robust evidence base on energy use, EE technologies and policies in the region and will focus on the energy resources and technologies that are used by new modern energy consumers, including household electricity use for lighting, heating, cooling, and appliances, as well as fuels for cooking and personal transport, such as motorbikes. The research will contribute to knowledge on the design and implementation of EE policy by looking at the opportunities and barriers from technological, socio-economic and institutional perspectives. In so doing, MECON will contribute to higher income levels for new modern energy consumers, since reduced household expenditures on energy through enhanced EE will enable these consumers to focus on other needs. \nAn equally important objective of the research programme will be the enhancement of research capacity in GMS countries in the area of energy, EE and climate change. This will include the development of research links and networks at the international, regional and national level. The participation and dissemination of the research results to a range of stakeholders from government, the private sector, NGOs and academia will therefore be a critical component of MECON. \nThe research is timely since energy demand is expected to increase rapidly over the coming decades, particularly in Asia and in large part as a result of energy consumption from new modern energy consumers. Targeting this important consumer group will have positive development outcomes on household economies, national energy demand and on GHG emissions. This research will also assist the countries of the GMS - Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam - to realise sustainable energy access for all rapidly and cost effectively, whilst reducing the environmental impacts of this increased demand.\nProject partners:\nDr. Milou Beerepoot (Scientific lead), Joint graduate School of Energy and Environment (JGSEE), Thailand\nDr. Pham Hoang Luong, Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam\nDr. Sok Kunthy, Royal University of Agriculture (RUA), Cambodia\nMr. Aung Thet Paing, Myanmar Engineering Society (MES), Myanmar\nDr. Khamphone Nanthavong, National University Of Laos (NUOL), Laos","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L002485/1","grantId":"EP/L002485/1","fundValue":"555807","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabrial  Anandarajah","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
