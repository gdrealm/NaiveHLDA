The goal of this work is to investigate mechanisms for the development of multidrug resistance by using a combined experimental and mathematical modelling approach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701846","grantId":"G0701846","fundValue":"92300","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Giles William Richardson","coPersons":["Cyril  Rauch"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
