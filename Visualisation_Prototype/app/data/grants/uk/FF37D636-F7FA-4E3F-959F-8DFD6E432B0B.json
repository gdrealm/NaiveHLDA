{"id":"FF37D636-F7FA-4E3F-959F-8DFD6E432B0B","title":"Friction Joining - Low Energy Manufacturing for Hybrid Structures in Fuel Efficient Transport Applications","abstractText":"There are clear drivers in the transport industry towards lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions through the introduction of designs involving combinations of different material classes, such as steel, titanium, magnesium and aluminium alloys, metal sheet and castings, and laminates in more efficient hybrid structures. The future direction of the transport industry will thus undoubtedly be based on multi-material solutions. This shift in design philosophy is already past the embryonic stage, with the introduction of aluminium front end steel body shells (BMW 5 series) and the integration of aluminium sheet and magnesium high pressure die castings in aluminium car bodies (e.g. Jaguar XK).Such material combinations are currently joined by fasteners, which are expensive and inefficient, as they are very difficult to weld by conventional technologies like electrical resistance spot, MIG arc, and laser welding. New advanced solid state friction based welding techniques can potentially overcome many of the issues associated with joining dissimilar material combinations, as they lower the overall heat input and do not melt the materials. This greatly reduces the tendency for poor bond strengths, due to interfacial reaction and solidification cracking, as well as damage to thermally sensitive materials like laminates and aluminium alloys used in automotive bodies, which are designed to harden during paint baking. Friction joining techniques are also far more efficient, resulting in energy savings of &gt; 90% relative to resistance spot and laser welding, are more robust processes, and can be readily used in combination with adhesive bonding.This project, in close collaboration with industry (e.g. Jaguar - Land Rover, Airbus, Corus, Meridian, Novelis, TWI, Sonobond) will investigate materials and process issues associated with optimising friction joining of hybrid, more mass efficient structures, focusing on; Friction Stir, Friction Stir Spot, and High Power Ultrasonic Spot welding. The work will be underpinned by novel approaches to developing models of these exciting new processes and detailed analysis and modelling of key material interactions, such as interfacial bonding / reaction and weld microstructure formation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G022402/1","grantId":"EP/G022402/1","fundValue":"406440","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There are clear environmental and economic drivers in the transport industry towards lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions through the introduction of design solutions involving combinations of different material classes, such as steel, titanium and aluminium, sheet, castings, and laminates, in more efficient, multi-material, hybrid structures. Welding such material combinations is a challenging problem for manufacturers owing to the physically different properties of the materials and the strong tendency for interfacial reaction between dissimilar metals. \n\nThe project examined the potential for low energy input solid state friction-based welding techniques to overcome these problems and in this regard it was highly successful. It attracted strong interest from industry and the programme was expanded within LATEST2 a subsequently funded related programme grant 'Light Alloys Towards Environmentally Sustainable Transport: Second Generation Solutions', (EP/H020047/) where it became part of a major research theme. This allowed the work to be substantially increased in the areas of linked process and microstructure models that predict interface reaction kinetics in dissimilar welds, as well in laser welding, and manufacturing hyper-joints for composite metal joining. Solutions to welding steel to aluminium both with and with and without zinc coatings were developed. To our knowledge this is the first time this has been achieved with satisfactory joint properties and with welding times compatible with industrial needs (e.g. less than 1 second). One of the techniques developed, abrasion circle friction stir spot welding' received an innovation award from Raiser - Reibsehweissen (www.raiser.de). We have also shown it is possible to join Al-Titanium. \n\n A detailed understanding of the bonding mechanisms and process factors that affect interface reaction between dissimilar metals under the highly transient conditions seen in welding was developed. This understanding is now being used in LATEST2 to design coating systems that have the potential to sovle this problem in difficult material combinations\n\nThe work on hyper-joint manufacture has been taken up by Airbus and is now under evaluation for industrial implementation.\n\nThe project outcomes were communicated at special joining workshop for the industrial partners (Jaguar -Land Rover, MEL, Constellium, Novelis, Tata Steel and TWI; 80 delegates). Following interest generated by invited presentations at international conferences, visits were also hosted from Honda, General Motors, KTH Parts Industries Inc. Al-Steel automotive parts are now routinely welded using the friction spot welding technique in Japan, although the technology has not yet been adopted in the UK.

However, aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) alloys are more expensive than steel and lack certain properties like formability. Industry is thus moving towards multi-material designs where steel will be used with low density alloys and plastics and composites, so that the best attributes of different materials can be combined in more cost-effective, lighter, structures. It has already been shown that this approach can lead to a reduction in mass by over 40%.\n\nIt is widely recognised that joining is a key challenge for multi-material designs. Dissimilar welding is very difficult because of the different physical properties of the materials and chemical interactions that can occur. For example, with fusion welding, dissimilar metals react in the liquid state to form brittle intermetallic compounds, which results in a low fracture resistance. Dissimilar structures can be joined by fasteners and adhesives, but this has large consumable costs, and is difficult with very high strength steels. In contrast, novel friction-based welding technologies can offer a solution, as they do not melt the materials. Friction joining is also much more energy efficient and can be used in combination with adhesive bonding.\n\nThis project focused on understanding and modelling the materials and process issues required to optimise the novel friction welding techniques of friction stir (FSW), friction stir spot (FSSW), and high power ultrasonic spot welding (HPUSW), for dissimilar joining applications, in the following material combinations; Al to steel, Mg to Al and Ti to Al. The work was performed in collaboration with several industrial end users, and material suppliers (e.g. JLR, Airbus, Tarta, MEL, Novelis). \n\nThe project has been extremely successful in delivering its objectives. Systematic research was carried out on the targeted processes, of the material flow, defect formation, and bonding mechanisms, using advanced characterisation techniques like 3D micro-tomography. The results were compared to process models developed in parallel by Cambridge University. The work gave a new insight into the welding processes and revealed that, when applied to dissimilar materials, they did not behave as had been previously expected, which led to poorer performance and delayed weld formation. In particular, the longer time required to form optimum joint strengths caused more extensive intermetallic reaction than anticipated and gave too long a process cycle for industrial application. \n\nModelling intermetallic formation, coupled to process models, allowed the reaction rates in welded joints to be predicted. Reaction was found to occur much faster in welding than in static heat treatment, due to the high strain-rate deformation. In the case of Zn coated steels to Al, and Mg-Al welds, the presence of low melting point reactions led to liquation at the welding interface, despite the 'solid state' nature of the welding processes. \n\nSolutions were explored to produce more rapid welds and control the level of interfacial reaction. This included the development of a new variant of FSSW, termed abrasive circle FSSW, where an orbital path was programmed so that the interface was 'cleaned' prior to bonding, thereby reducing the welding time. With this technique, for the first time, dissimilar spot welds were produced between steel and Al that achieved fracture strengths equivalent to that of the parent material, within industrially competitive times of &lt;1 s. For very reactive systems, such as Al to Mg, coatings were also explored to prevent intermetallic formation. Models were developed to predict the microstructure in the weld's heat affected zones. The results have been disseminated in ~ 30 publications and at x conferences and attracted interest from additional automotive companies, including Nissan, Honda, GM and Chrysler. The results of the project are highly relevant to joining multi-material car bodies and aerospace structures.\n\nSpecific welding techniques have been developed for Steel-Al joints.\n\nA knowledge and modelling capability for intermetallic reaction rates in dissimilar metal systems can contribute directly to the optimsaiton of dissimilar welding technologies. Exploitation is being explored through on going activity under LATEST2 and dissemination through workshops and conferences to mainstream automotive companies, including Nissan, Honda and JLR. Visits have been hosted with these organisations to discuss the key results. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
