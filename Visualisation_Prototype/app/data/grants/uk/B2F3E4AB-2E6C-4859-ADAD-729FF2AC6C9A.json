Given that floods cause damage of over &pound;1bn per year under present climatic conditions, climate change bears significant consequences for flood risk management. In order to evaluate these consequences, hydrological and flood inundation models are forced with projections of precipitation from atmospheric models for a range of Greenhouse gas emission scenarios to produce future flood predictions. However the validity and uncertainty of these model-based input precipitation fields are of key concern, as they potentially constitute a major source of ambiguity for hydrological and hydraulic modelling. Additionally, uncertainty is associated with the hydrological and inundation models themselves, such as for example the models ability to represent the dominating physical processes and to uniquely identify effective model factors (parameters and any other model variables) that will shape future forecasts. As the non-linear interaction of all model components will influence the total uncertainty associated with hydrological impact assessments these need to be comprehensively assessed. Therefore, a key and exciting challenge is to describe and quantify the origin and propagation of uncertainty from climate to hydrological to flood inundation models. This project aims to develop a novel holistic modelling approach for doing this. Our region of focus will be the River Severn catchment because of concerns about current and future flood risk. Specifically we will: (1) Quantify the 'top-end' uncertainties associated with climate change hydrological impact assessments by analyzing precipitation fields produced by two contrasting methods and assess how these affect the nature of flood and inundation predictions (2) Evaluate all uncertainties between and within a cascade modeling framework for flood inundation predictions in a fully cupled and dynamic way (3) Use novel techniques of uncertainty analysis including global sensitivity analysis and a new efficient functional similarity sampling approach to enable an effective evaluation of the uncertainties in the modeling cascade. (4) Assess the likely flood hazard change for the River Severn catchment over the next 100 years for various climate, landuse and soil moisture scenarios This project will deliver an insightful scientific methodology which can be used in future research assessments and catapult UK science to the forefront of an exciting, socially, and politically important international research area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E002242/1","grantId":"NE/E002242/1","fundValue":"431828","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Since 2012 an operational EFAS now provides flood forecasting information two days or more before a flood event to the national authorities around Europe as well as the Emergency Response Coordination Centre of the European Commission. The skill of EFAS forecasts and warnings has been continuously improving (https://www.efas.eu/download/efasBulletins/2014/bulletin_dec-jan_14.pdf) and the system has demonstrated its early warning capabilities in several recent events (e.g. the Balkan floods in 2014 and the central European Floods in 2013), assisting with early flood preparedness for the ERCC, European national authorities and thus all European Citizens. Although citizen protection is of paramount importance in flood warning provision, floods are also harbingers of substantial damage costs, particularly in urban areas and although the exact cost-benefit ratio of EFAS flood warnings are currently being researched the system is very likely to have net economic value (Pappenberger et al, The Economic Value of Early Flood Warnings in Europe. Manuscript in Preparation.) The research provided scientific innovation, technical system developments and practical focus on enduser understanding which has contributed directly to these benefits, and costly and potentially contentious decisions are now made in a more consistent, risk-informed way. These knowledge transfer activities, supported by the strong scientific evidence from the research work and demonstrations of the value in systems such as EFAS, have led to a wider move in the UK (and beyond) towards ensemble flood forecasting. The Flood Forecasting Centre and the EA national forecasting centres have (or some cases very soon will have) implemented ensemble flood forecasting systems. Such an ensemble approach is likely to have improved the preparedness for the winter 2013/2014 flooding in the UK (Stephens &amp;amp; Cloke, 2014). In China, forecasts have been improved with the implementation of ensemble systems.

Using these projections is not straightforward, as the spread in the uncertainty is very large and this is inflated through the modelling chain, leading to very uncertain flood projections.\nThe research also provided the first evidence of the potential for improvements in flood forecasting through using ensemble forecasting and decision making techniques. The research included the first setup of a coupled atmospheric-hydrologic-hydraulic model cascade system which used a grand ensemble of weather forecasts to produce probabilistic flood inundation forecasts. By tracking the uncertainty through the model cascade, the dominating influence of the uncertainties from the rainfall could be understood, and the promise of such a tool for forecasting flood inundation demonstrated. Operational flood forecasters can use these new techniques to improve forecast skill and make better decisions. \nMethodologies for robustly understanding climate change impact on water resources including flooding and low flow at the catchment scale are of use to water resource modellers.
