Everyone over 60 will be affected in part by one of these conditions.Our recently completed Medical Research Council trial of glaucoma surgery has shown that in patients whose ocular scarring is well controlled, not one patient got worse over nearly a decade. There are no licenced treaments for skin and other scarring which is also a big problem. The current used anti-scarring treatments are primarily anti-cancer drugs, which may have potentially blinding side effects, and our research has shown that the models currently available to study tissue contraction and identify new promising treatments are not mimicking accurately what happens in humans. Our work in the lab has identified two previously unknown phases in tissue contraction, suggesting that better treatments should include combinations of treatments targeting both phases of the contraction process. Such an approach has been very successful in cancer chemotherapy, where single agents result in a low success rate but combinations of agents have led to some cancers being curable in the majority of cases. This project aims at further developing and validating our 2-phase model of tissue scarring using both cells and intact ocular tissue fragments maintained in culture in the lab. This project will not only generate tremendous insights into the mechanisms of contraction in the eye, but should provide us with a novel more physiologically relevant tissue contraction model to design novel strategies to modulate scarring, that could directly benefit patients in the short term. This should allow us a more rational approach to devise new treatment combinations for preventing scarring, as well as limiting the amount of animal work required before we can use these treatments to help people and prevent blinding and disabling scarring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801049","grantId":"G0801049","fundValue":"487593","fundStart":"2008-11-24","fundEnd":"2011-11-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maryse  Bailly","coPersons":["Peng Tee  Khaw"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
