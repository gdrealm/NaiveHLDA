Defects in gene activation cause these processes to go wrong, resulting in a wide spectrum of human diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer?s. To understand a process, it helps greatly to be able to watch it happening in living tissue, which until recently has not been possible for gene activation. I have developed a new technique, using microscopy, allowing one to watch genes turning on and off in living cells. I will study the natural process of gene activation and how cells and their environment can control this. I will then look at how the process of gene activation goes wrong when the main controlling factors are disrupted, which is a typical cause of many different human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600242","grantId":"G0600242","fundValue":"337676","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2010-01-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Robert  Chubb","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
