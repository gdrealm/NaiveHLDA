Advances in plant phenotyping promise to 'bridge this gap'. \no The USPA would promote the exchange of staff, expertise and facilities between the top US and UK labs pioneering the area of root phenotyping \no US researchers gain access to the state-of-art microCT facility at Nottingham to non-invasively image root architecture in soil in 3/4D (see image below)\no UK researchers gain access to the newly established, Laser Ablation Tomography system at Penn State uniquely able to image root anatomy in 3D Academic route: our findings have obvious educational and agricultural value. \n\nNon-academic route: Our discovery provides the basis for researchers to design new strategies to manipulate plant growth and development Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
