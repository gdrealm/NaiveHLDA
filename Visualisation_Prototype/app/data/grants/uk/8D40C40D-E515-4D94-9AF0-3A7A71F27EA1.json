This was essentially a travel grant but the work undertaken will be of benefit to those wishing to enhance the concentration of isoprenoid pathway precursors. In order to efficiently produce such valuable compounds in microbial hosts it will be essential to enhance the precursor pool. In order to achieve this we have investigated a number of SIRA mediated pathway diversifications with an in vivo biosensor to assemble combinations of up to 10 genes from the E. coli DXP pathway, with different regulatory elements (e.g. RBS strength) using both rational design and random order approaches. The aim was increase the concentration pool of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in plants and microbes. The varying levels of FPP were sensed by the inclusion of a plasmid expressing 3 genes that synthesized the red coloured isoprenoid lycopene from FPP that acted as an in vivo biosensor. The more intense red the colony the higher the levels of FPP produced by the novel synthetic pathway. Using this methodology we have attained lycopene levels of up 25mg/g dry cell weight that is the highest reported specific yield of lycopene produced from the DXP pathway in E. coli to date (Merrick et al manuscript in preparation). \n\nThe next step will be to substitute the lycopene reporter with biosynthetic genes required for conversion of FPP to 2,3-oxidosqualene and the triterpene synthases and tailoring enzymes. This general approach is readily translatable to yeast or any other microbial host.
