{"id":"A1204910-F8E0-42BA-93B8-DB43CC93AC29","title":"Biomass Selective Valorization to Useful Feedstocks Under Aqueous Conditions: Involvement in COST Action CM0903","abstractText":"In 2009 we joined a new European COST Action (CM0903: Utilisation of Biomass for Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals (UBIOCHEM)) in the area of 'renewable chemicals'. This Action runs over the period July 2009 to November 2013. In the past 20 months we have developed new contacts have allowed us to define new research in selective biomass catalysis using water-based reaction systems and close links to groups involved in synthetic biology and biotechnology/plant science. In the period July 2011 to November 2013 we are proposing to make investigations using both materials provided by these groups (and models thereof) to attempt to develop new catalytic chemistry aimed at providing C7+ rich hydrocarbon products for facile separation post catalysis. These joint research programmes will be run through exchange of PhD students (funded through COST) while this grant will support the consumables costs of these visiting researchers and some joint planning meetings to be attended by S. Woodward. For these latter two activities no COST mechanism exists to support them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J005460/1","grantId":"EP/J005460/1","fundValue":"24264","fundStart":"2011-11-16","fundEnd":"2014-03-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  International meeting.\n\nContribution to Biomass utilisation international meeting.
