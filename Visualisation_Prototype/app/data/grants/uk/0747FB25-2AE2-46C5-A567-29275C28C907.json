Therefore, a major challenge is to deliver to the clinic the LB in a validated, quality, 'fit for purpose' form. Across the global market place there is a pressing need to retain the key LB characteristic for at least several days to one week. Although suitable for longer term banking, Cryofreezing for the final product is not an option due to the acknowledged negative effects on the LB. As important, the system needs to be simple, rapid and easy to use at the point of care in order to ease uptake by the clinician. Our recent BRIC enabling grant has shown that an alginate gel cell encapsulation system meets many of these needs. We have a growing body of evidence that demonstrates it is effective at preserving a number of cell types (including stem cells) over extended periods in room temperature conditions. However, further research is needed to fully understand how it works and demonstrate that the technology can be implemented in an industrial setting (i.e. scalable).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K011111/1","grantId":"BB/K011111/1","fundValue":"579831","fundStart":"2013-10-31","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  World wide academic advancement, impact published on BBSRC website; Short-listed for Innovator of the Year 1024; trained biologist PDRA in hydrogel chemistry for tissue engineering; developed innovative technology in stem cell storage and cell based assays; collaborating with cell-based therapy company; communicated with cell therapy catapult Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare,Other Societal,Economic","person":"Che John Connon","coPersons":["Andrzej  Pacek"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" We have discovered that fat derived stem cells can be stored for two weeks at ambient temperature whilst retaining their differentiation capabilities. We have found that cell attachment is temperature sensitive. we have found that cell storage in hydrogel is suited to bioprocessing using bead encapsulation Our findings have significant implications for the future of cell and tissue printing, our technology facilities the use of a cell printing cartridge that can be stored at room temperature before use allowing cell printing to gain much larger target audience i.e. one that does not have to have cell culture facilities. The technology also facilities the development of cell based assess outside of normal operating conditions such as in a war-zone (airborne toxicity tests) Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
