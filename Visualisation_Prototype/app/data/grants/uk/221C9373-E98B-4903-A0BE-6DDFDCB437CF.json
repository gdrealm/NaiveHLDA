Smart Governance of Sustainable Cities (SmartGov)","abstractText":"The SmartGov research project assesses the value of ICTs for engaging citizens in the governance of sustainable cities. The societal objective is to present the acquired insights in the form of a research-based knowledge system for government officials, which can be utilised to enhance sustainable urban goverance and service delivery. This knowledge is in dire need, since the alignment of ICTs and strategies for urban governance is a key challenge for cities: new technologies such as social media and open data promise 'smart governance' - if/when the technologies are integrated in strategies for citizen participation. Examples are abound: the City of Amsterdam uses Citizen Toolkits to engage citizens in environmental monitoring, the Greater London Authority uses open data to stimulate sustainability initiatives and Porto Alegre gathers information from residents to stimulate a dialogue about urban development. These new technologies are 'in vogue' but little is known about their effectiveness - and the drawbacks - in different organizational, institutional and political contexts. To assess the effectiveness, the research incorporates three main empirical research case studies which form a comparative analyses of smart governance in infrastructure, economy and poverty in Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow. The project elicits the mechanisms of smart governance, identifies the conditions that matter and assesses its contributions to (economic, democratic, social and environmental) sustainability. A novel theoretical perspective at the interface of e-governance and urban governance studies is developed to realize this aim and innovative research methods such as virtual ethnography are used. This project is carried out in close collaboration with officials from the Cities of Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow to ensure its value for policy-makers, practitioners and citizens.\n\nThe term 'Smart governance' refers to the use of new technologies, such as social media, the Internet, open data, citizen sensors, and 'serious' gaming, to strengthen the collaboration between citizens and urban governments (Hoon Lee, Phaal &amp; Lee, 2013). In this research 'smart governance' is defined as aligning technological potential with urban governance strategies to form a consistent socio-technical approach to tackling urban problems (cf. Meijer &amp; Thaens, 2010). The promise of smart governance is to create collaborative innovations for sustainable urban development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N011473/1","grantId":"ES/N011473/1","fundValue":"278009","fundStart":"2015-08-14","fundEnd":"2019-08-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher William Webster","coPersons":["Douglas Struan Robertson"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
