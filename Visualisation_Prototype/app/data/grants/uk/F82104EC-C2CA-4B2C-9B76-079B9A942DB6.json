This is 13 th of probably one of the most prestigious international conferences in the field. The conference will be a satellite of the International Conference in the Physics of Semiconductors 2006 to be held in Vienna. It is very well-known that both electronic and optoelectronic devices are gradually shrinking rapidly in size to dimensions in nanometre scale. When devices become so small new physical phenomena takes over conventional expectations. This leads to new technologies, for example electrical current in such devices can be due to the flow of a few electrons, making it possible to make single electron switches, or the emitted light from a nano-device might be due to a few photons which may lead to photonic logic devices. It is very exciting to be able to investigate such devices where physical processes are determined by only a handful of electrons or photons. The proposed international conference aims to look at all the recent developments in and the future implications of nanostructures, nanodevices and the artificial crystal structures known as superlattices","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D05463X/1","grantId":"EP/D05463X/1","fundValue":"12194","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Naci  Balkan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
