Their stories will create a thread through this study around which will accrete many Mary Ann Patten was nineteen and Rebecca Burgess was twenty-two when they had to take command of their husbands' clipper ships to navigate Cape Horn in 1856, one of the most severe winters in the southern hemisphere. Their ships were about two weeks sail from each other, and in them Captain Patten was delirious with brain fever, while Captain Burgess was dying, probably of dysentery. Mary and Rebecca had to divide their nursing duties in the cabin with the exclusively male duties of captain on deck. Both Captains Burgess and Patten had taught their wives navigation. Struck down by illness, they consigned the huge and complex clipper ships to their command. No-one else on board could navigate.\\n\\nUpon safely bringing the ships into port, Mary Ann and Rebecca were hailed in the press as maritime heroines; Mary Ann was dubbed 'Florence Nightingale of the Sea' and Rebecca was compared with the young English lighthouse heroine, Grace Darling. They joined a procession of heroines, celebrated in the novels, poetry, newspapers and Girl's Own magazines of the day. These heroines were often called upon to do a man's job, did it well, but never compromised their feminine modesty. As Mary Patten wrote to the ship's insurers, she had merely, 'endeavoured to perform that which seemed to me, under the circumstances, only the plain duty of a wife to a good husband'. I will place their own accounts of their experiences in the context of a wealth of stories belonging to their contemporaries, a community of maritime women whose letters and diaries exist, largely unpublished, in the rich collections of New England maritime libraries and museums. \\n\\nFlouting the convention of 'The Sailor's Bride', the woman left crying on shore in so many ballads, stories and paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, captain's wives from the 1840s increasingly chose to accompany their husbands to sea rather than endure long and uncertain separation. In order to relieve the tedium and the loneliness of the voyage, many maritime wives both read and wrote a great deal. Diaries reveal how they exchanged novels, periodicals, scrapbooks and poetry while anchored in Whampoa or the Chincha Islands. Separated again by miles of ocean these women still felt connected by the books they shared. Also forming a web of connection between these women was their understanding of the models of behaviour found in the literature they read. Their renegotiation of models exhibited in Victorian novels and poetry performed the work of self-fashioning, as these maritime readers forged an identity for themselves reconfiguring a place for the Victorian 'cult of domesticity' within the male, working environment of the ship. During her first voyage around Cape Horn, for example, Rebecca Burgess was reading Jane Austen's Persuasion, expressing her admiration for the indefatigable sea-going wife of Admiral Croft. She was also reading Richard Dana's sailor's tale Two Years Before the Mast, and studying Bowditch's Practical Navigator. The juxtapositions of romantic, adventurous and practical offer a fascinating insight into the various models open to Rebecca Burgess in her new life at sea. Her reading helped prepare her for the difficult negotiation she would have to make between 'feminine' sickroom and 'masculine' ship's deck when she had to become both nurse and navigator off Cape Horn. Widowed in her native village on Cape Cod, Rebecca turned, like Queen Victoria, to Tennyson for comfort, and also began a life-long habit of carrying a compass with her at all times: literature and navigation helped this maritime widow to locate herself long after her voyages had ended. She is one example of the interface of life writing and literature to be explored in this study of women at sea.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F01550X/1","grantId":"AH/F01550X/1","fundValue":"28301","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie  Gilmartin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
