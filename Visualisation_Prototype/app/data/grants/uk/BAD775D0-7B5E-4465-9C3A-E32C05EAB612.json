Tomatoes are high value products with an annual value in 2009 of around 32 billion US dollars covering both processed and fresh products. They are a major component of healthy diets and provide ready sources of vitamins A, C, E and K, minerals including K and Fe and the lipophilic antioxidant lycopene (the pigment responsible for the characteristic red colour of ripe tomato fruit). There is a wealth of scientific evidence that now exists to corroborate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is beneficial to human health. These benefits have been attributed to the presence of health promoting phytochemicals or &quot;bioactives&quot; in the food matrix. The challenge, particularly, in Western societies, is to deliver to the consumer better tasting, more nutritious tomatoes and other fruit which have a prolonged shelf-life at a cost affordable to the majority of consumers. The most important quality traits in tomato are colour, texture, flavour and nutritional content. Texture can also impact on taste, the release of nutrients and perhaps most importantly shelf-life. In the UK it is estimated that 40% of the food waste is uneaten fruits and vegetables. \nIn addition to its economic and societal role, tomato has become a well established scientific model for understanding the development and ripening of fleshy fruit bearing crops, with strong evidence that many of the gene networks controlling ripening have been conserved across different taxa. In fruit crops, the key controller of quality traits is the process of ripening. The aim of TomNET project is to deliver better quality tomato fruit. Our approach will integrate systems analysis and quantitative genetic studies to identify and modulate regulatory genes that allow precise control of fruit development and the ripening process. By harnessing tomato wild-species variation, we can deliver these scientific discoveries into commercial practice in collaboration with Syngenta; our industrial partner in this LINK project. \nThe project will build on several important resources and findings. Firstly a regulatory network holistically describing the interaction of gene transcripts during fruit development and ripening. Using computational approaches putative regulators of the ripening process have been identified. We have shown that one of these regulators can improve tomato fruit colour. Simultaneously, flavour related compounds responsible for good tasting fruit products are increased. In this project we will use the gene networks to identify additional regulators of ripening that display the potential to alter key fruit quality traits. For the transcriptional activator termed high pigment-4 (HP4), which we have validated as an important modulator of ripening related traits, detail characterisation at multiple levels of regulation will be carried out to ascertain the underlying mechanisms by which the gene product can exert its effects and influence the ripening process. The other key foundation of this project is the identification of genes underlying a complex QTL for texture. Within the target region several interacting components have been identified. In the project the function and interaction between these components will be elucidated by using stable transgenic lines. Combining the enhanced colour and texture traits will also be attempted. Finally natural variation will be exploited to deliver these traits into commercial elite backgrounds thus translating science discovery through to commercial practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J015598/1","grantId":"BB/J015598/1","fundValue":"277248","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This award has played an important role in enhancing our understanding of the regulatory network controlling tomato ripening and the findings have been used to discover new genes controlling the ripening process. A major discovery has been a gene that controls tomato fruit softening and shelf life. \nThe long shelf life and poor taste of many modern tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivars results from the use of the ripening-inhibitor gene to slow the rate of ripening and thereby extend the ripening period. There is currently no mechanism for controlling specifically the softening process without affecting ripening characteristics. Here we report that down regulation of a fruit specific gene in tomato using an RNAi modulates fruit texture in absence of effects on other ripening parameters such as colour or development of flavour compounds. These discoveries are being used by our industrial partner in their breeding programme to improve tomato quality Agriculture, Food and Drink Economic","person":"Graham  Seymour","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The aim of this project is to discover key genes controlling the ripening process using tomato as a model system. We are working with an industrial partner. We have made a major discovery during the course of the project which still has one year left to run. We have identified a gene that controls softening and shelf life in tomato. At present, shelf life in tomato is controlled using non-ripening mutations in commercial hybrids. These extend fruit life but compromise flavour. The gene we have isolated targets only softening, while other aspects of ripening proceed unhindered. The information will be used to improve tomato quality through marker assisted breeding. The work is the subject of a patent application and will be submitted for publication in a referred journal in 2015.\nWe have also completed work on a gene that promotes enhanced levels of phytochemicals in tomato fruits. This work has been published in the scientific literature (Pan et al, 2013) and is also the subject of a patent application (WO2012041856). The knowledge will be used to breed better tomato and pepper fruits The information will be of benefit to the academic community when published as it will enhance knowledge of the mechanisms involved in cell wall remodelling during fruit ripening Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
