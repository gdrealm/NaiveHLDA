A naturally occurring chemical called D-alanine can activate this receptor and may control the way we think, but its levels in the brain are quite low. We have often wondered whether increasing the amounts of D-alanine in the brain would activate the NMDA receptor more, and therefore make the thinking processes work better. Animals and people can drink a lot of D-alanine in water without making them feel ill. We have found that when rats drink D-alanine for a couple of weeks, it causes chemical changes to the NMDA receptor in the brain. Scientists have shown that the sorts of changes we see, make the NMDA receptor more active. We therefore want to prove that D-alanine increases NMDA receptor function, and if this also improves thinking. This information will be useful to people who are interested in stopping the decrease in brain function which happens as the brain gets older or when it is affected by an illness. We will feed rats with D-alanine for two and eight weeks and see if they are better at problem solving than animals not given the compound (controls). This will be done with the attentional set-shifting task which basically tests how many go's it takes the rats to work out where food is buried, by using the information they were taught before the actual test. After the tests we will use standard methods to measure chemical changes to NMDA receptors and the amounts of other brain molecules which sometimes change when the receptor is active. All this information should tell us if D-alanine helps the thinking process, and if it is related to certain chemical alterations in the brain. In separate experiments, rats will be fed with D-alanine as before, and while they are asleep we will measure their brain electrical activity produced by adding the chemical NMDA. We believe that the brains of D-alanine fed rats compared to controls will have more electrical activity after adding NMDA because, the NMDA receptor is more active in these animals. Scientists have known for a while that D-alanine in our bodies actually comes from the good bacteria in our guts. Some drinks and yoghurts, called prebiotics, make these bacteria grow more, and this makes us healthy because the bugs help breakdown the food we eat. When we fed rats with a prebiotic called fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), we saw the same changes in the NMDA receptor in the brain as we previously saw with D-alanine feeding. We now want to see if FOS feeding does actually increase levels of D-alanine in the brain, and if it changes rat behaviour and brain electrical activity. Finally, we will add D-alanine to isolated brain cells (cell culture) and measure chemical changes to the NMDA receptor. If nothing happens, we will know that D-alanine can only change NMDA receptor chemistry when the brain is in the body. This means that other molecules, pathways and brain areas, which are not present in cell culture, are needed for D-alanine to affect the receptor. We will also test if D-alanine added to cells affect other chemicals without causing changes in NMDA receptor chemistry. Overall, the study will tell us if the thinking process and NMDA receptor activity can be increased after drinking D-alanine or a prebiotics. This is important to know because a lot of people take prebiotics with their food, and it is possible that these, or just D-alanine alone, can help brain function as we get older or develop a brain disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I006311/1","grantId":"BB/I006311/1","fundValue":"286198","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The basic scientific findings of our research has led us to test the effect prebiotics on emotional processing in healthy human subjects.

This D-amino acid is only found in bacteria, and so when these breakdown in the gut, D-alanine is released and enters the blood stream. D-alanine is also an activator of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is found at high levels in the CNS and is crucial for healthy brain function. In pilot studies we observed that the direct oral administration of D-alanine to rats increased the levels of brain NMDARs. The project therefore, tested the effects of D-alanine and prebiotics on NMDAR neurobiology, function and related behaviours. We found specifically that:\ni) Feeding rats with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or galacto-oligosaccharides (Bimuno, BGOS), increased the levels of NMDARs in brain areas crucial for memory and problem solving. The numbers of the beneficial microbe, Bifidobacteria, in the rat gut were four-fold greater than those in control animals, and 2.5x greater than in FOS-fed rats.\nii) Although BGOS feeding to rats increased D-alanine levels in the blood, brain concentrations of the D-amino acid did not change. We therefore concluded that prebiotic-mediated changes in central NMDARs were not related to D-alanine.\nii) Rats administered with D-alanine or BGOS demonstrated better problem solving abilities in the attentional set-shifting task, compared to controls. This is in-keeping with the previously observed elevation of rat brain NMDARs following dietary supplementation with D-alanine or BGOS.\niv) In electrophysiological experiments, neurons in the brains of rats fed with BGOS were more responsive to NMDAR agonists compared to controls. This showed that the elevation of brain NMDARs observed after prebiotic feeding were functional and increased the activity of cells. \n2) Since the project found robust actions of BGOS on the brain, we extended our studies to further explore the utility of prebiotics to maintain brain health, and test the role of the immune system. Studies have demonstrated that the growth of good gut bacteria suppresses harmful inflammatory responses. Such responses have been shown to be detrimental to brain chemistry and behaviour. We therefore investigated whether BGOS supplementation could 'protect' a mouse from the biochemical and behavioural effects of an acute infection. We administered a single injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are contained in pathogenic bacteria. We found that:\ni) Mice receiving a single LPS injection displayed a decrease in locomotor activity which was followed 24hrs later by anxious behaviour. However, mice fed on BGOS prior to an LPS injection showed relatively normal LMA, and no anxious behaviour. \nii) The brains of mice injected with LPS and on a normal diet, contained higher levels of the inflammatory molecules, TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6 compared to animals injected with saline. However, mice fed with BGOS contained the same levels of inflammatory markers compared to BGOS supplemented mice receiving a saline injection, and those on a normal diet injected with saline. \niii) Together these data suggest that BGOS supplementation attenuates the molecular and behavioural responses to an acute infection. This is in-keeping with our supposition that the proliferation of gut bacteria modulates the host's immune system, and benefits brain function.\n3) In a supplementary investigation using a small amount of grant funds set aside for contingency studies (in the event of failed objectives), and with an additional contribution from Clasado Ltd, we investigated the effect of FOS and BGOS on emotional processing and the modulation of the stress hormone, cortisol, in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind placebo controlled study, we found that:\ni) Participants ingesting BGOS once every day for 3 weeks, had lower levels of salivary cortisol compared those who had ingested a placebo or FOS for the same amount of time.\nii) Subjects who had been provided with BGOS demonstrated less anxiety in a computer-based psychometric test compared with the other groups.\niii) Together these data show that BGOS supplementation has a mild anxiolytic action in healthy subjects, and this is corroborated by the observed reduction of salivary cortisol. The prebiotic BGOS is commercially available, and so the general public can benefit from its mild anxiolytic properties, and potentially, pro-cognitive effects. Throughout aging there is a natural decline in cognitive abilities, and control of the stress response; indeed, both processes maybe interlinked. The population most likely to benefit from dietary supplementation with BGOS therefore, are the elderly.\nOur finding that D-alanine has a significant effect on cognitive function in rats, also suggests its potential application as a supplement for cognitive deficits in the aged. The amino acid is naturally occurring, and earlier work in schizophrenia patients shows that it is well tolerated in humans. Further studies are needed to test the utility of D-alanine supplementation in the elderly.
