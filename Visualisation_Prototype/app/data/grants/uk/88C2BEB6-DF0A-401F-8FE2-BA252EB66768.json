{"id":"88C2BEB6-DF0A-401F-8FE2-BA252EB66768","title":"The Lazarus Project: Resurrecting data and knowledge from life science articles by crowd-sourcing","abstractText":"The scientific literature is one of the most important knowledge-resources for the life sciences, with over 200k articles downloaded each day from Elsevier's Science Direct system alone. Covering over 20k journals, two new papers per minute are added to 22 million or so existing articles indexed by PubMed. For most scientists, reading, analysing and organising their personal library of articles is a daily task that forms a fundamental part of their scientific process. As the rate of publishing accelerates, the need for computational support to work which articles to read, and how to interpret, reproduce and validate the claims they contain is growing. However traditional publications are aimed at consumption by humans -- they are 'stories that persuade with data' -- and their combination of nuanced natural language and complex figures does not make them easily amenable to processing by machine. In the life-science literature, drug-like molecules are typically represented as illustrations; biochemical properties as tables or graphs; protein/DNA sequences are buried amongst text; references and citations have arcane formats; and other objects of biological interest are referred to by ambiguous names. Capturing such data necessitates the familiar drudgery of re-typing figures from tables, chasing citations through digital libraries, redrawing molecules by hand: all of these are tedious, error prone, wasteful and currently wasted processes that are carried out by scientists on a regular basis. Mass-mining methods (text mining, optical recognition) to automate such tasks are not yet sufficiently reliable to be used without human validation, and are generally disallowed by the licenses under which articles are published. Thus without the 'human computation' possible through crowd-sourcing, existing knowledge is destined to remain entombed in the literature. \n\nThe Lazarus Project aims to harness the crowd of scientists reading life-science articles to resurrect the swathes of legacy data buried in charts, tables, diagrams and free-text, to liberate processable data into a shared resource that benefits the community. Lazarus aims are to harness activities that are currently carried out by individuals for their own purposes (annotating, cross-referencing articles with databases, organising collections of articles).\n\nOur approach is to extend the functionality of an existing literature-enhancement platform that currently is designed for individual use. Utopia Documents is a PDF-reader that enhances the experience of reading life-science literature: it analyses documents on the fly, linking their content to online resources, and helps users explore associated data and knowledge bases. It has a number of 'convenience' features such as extracting data from tables, reconstructing molecules from images or 'markush-like' representations or navigating citations that make interacting with the content of an article more efficient. Its counterpart, Utopia Library, provides complimentary functions for collections, providing automated recommendation, legitimate copyright/license sensitive acquisition and sharing of articles and sophisticated 'semantic' classification and organisation of personal libraries. Lazarus aims to enhance the Utopia tools such that the micro-tasks already performed by individuals can be harnessed at a crowd scale and repurposed for crowd consumption. \n\nAs a result, scientists will benefit from richer, more searchable literature, and more accessible data; publishers - will benefit from enriched content, without the need to develop new in-house infrastructures; data integration initiatives - will benefit from access to a rich literature/data-linking resource.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L005298/1","grantId":"BB/L005298/1","fundValue":"481203","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Pettifer","coPersons":["Robert David Stevens","Teresa  Attwood","Carole  Goble"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" not applicable this year None yet.
