In order to diversify their functions, proteins use additional molecules called cofactors, of which there are many types. Heme is one such cofactor; it is an organic chemical with an iron atom in the centre and has many essential functions in different cellular processes. Many proteins that contain heme undergo a process after they are made in the cell in which bonds are formed between the protein and the heme; these are called cytochromes c and are essential in respiration and in reactions that involve the transfer of electrons. In fact, cytochromes c are believed to be one of the earliest classes of protein to have appeared in evolution. In other cases, heme associates with proteins without forming bonds with them, for example in hemoglobin, which uses the heme to bind oxygen in blood. In the case where the heme cofactor becomes bonded to the cytochrome, other proteins are needed to assist in this reaction, which is not spontaneous. Using the prototypical laboratory bacterium E. coli as a model system, we study this process of heme attachment, which is complex and involves a large number of proteins. Unexpectedly, it has been found that these systems differ in different types of cells. Our proposed research seeks to understand how these proteins function, using a variety of experimental approaches and techniques. Once we have elucidated the cellular mechanisms of attaching heme to cytochromes in bacteria, we might have the possibility of designing drugs to target these proteins. This would be possible because a completely different system exists in humans to attach heme to our cytochromes, allowing us to selectively target disease-causing bacteria, for example. It is also important to understand the process of making cytochromes c as a fundamental and central biological process, in order to complete a description of the essential biochemical reactions that constitute life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004865/1","grantId":"BB/E004865/1","fundValue":"377874","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings are underpinning ongoing academic research in this area but by us and competitor groups, esepcially in the USA.

In particular we studied we studied a variant system which unexpectedly could function without protein components which are essential in a highly related system that is more commonly found. We and other continue to be perplexed by these findiings as we do by the extra sulfur atome that is inserted into the thioether bond of a c-type cytochrome under certain circumstances. Much of what we did remains an enigma and needs to be taken forward by further funding. We need to obtain the crystal structures of the proteins we have studied. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
