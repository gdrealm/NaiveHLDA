Their functions depend on the selective formation of connections, so that they behave as appropriately configured information processing machines. The process of forming connections, though vital, is not well understood, and we are particularly ignorant of what happens in living networks as they form, make connections and begin to function. As nervous systems develop, nerve cell terminals grow. The growth of these terminals is intimately linked to the formation of connections on them. During normal development, nerve terminal growth is therefore tightly regulated, so as to ensure that normal function can emerge. Conversely, mutations in genes that regulate nerve terminal growth or the formation of connections between them have been linked to mental retardation, cognitive disorders and neurodegeneration. In addition to nerve cells, so-called glia cells also contribute to the make up of the nervous system. Glia cells have in recent years become appreciated for their role in regulating the formation and function of connections that nerve cells form between each other. However, our understanding of how glia cells interact with nerve cells so as to regulate nerve terminal growth and connectivity is particularly patchy. One reason for this is that cell-cell interactions are very dynamic and it has been exceedingly challenging to differentially label and image interacting cells in a developing nervous system. We have a simple model network in the fruitfly fly embryo. Importantly, most developmental processes have been conserved during evolution. It is for this reason and because one can do fly genetics with relative ease, that the fruitfly has been instrumental in driving forward our understanding of nervous system development. We have developed new genetic, microscopy and electrophysiological methods that allow us to study and manipulate particular cells in this system. Using genetics, we can differentially label partner nerve and glia cells (with fluorescent dyes). Using our microscope setup we can image how these cells interact as their terminals grow, form connections with one another and mature. We will determine precisely what happens as connections form - we can study it both morphologically and functionally (as a signaling junction) throughout the period of its development. Through a recent genetic screen we have identified a gene called Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) as an important regulator of nerve terminal growth. Mutations that alter the activity of this gene have been found to cause cancers in humans and this aspect has been studied. However, other functions of Alk, namely during nervous system development are less well understood. Our preliminary work strongly suggests that Alk is important for regulating the communication between nerve cells and glia and that it may thus regulate nerve terminal growth. We will apply our genetic and imaging methods to test this hypothesis. Having established the consequences of what happens to nervous system development when Alk function is altered, we will investigate underlying mechanisms to understand how these changes occur. The results from this work will help us understand the mechanisms and molecules that are required to form a functioning nervous system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I022414/1","grantId":"BB/I022414/1","fundValue":"443854","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research has not yet had any impact beyond academia or outreach work.

During nervous system development connections between neurons emerge as a result of dynamic cell-cell interactions: outgrowth, pruning and selective stabilisation of neuronal arbors. In this proposal we focus on two fundamental and important issues: i) how interactions between pre- and postsynaptic terminals and associated glia lead to stabilisation of neuronal branches and the development of synapses in vivo; ii) role of the evolutionary conserved Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) pathway in regulating these interactions. \nWe work with the locomotor network of the Drosophila embryo as a model. We have developed new genetic tools to genetically label and manipulate identified connecting neurons independently from one another. We have developed methods to image the dynamics of these cells in vivo. \nWe determined that in the fly, too, a specific set of glial cells send fine processes into the central nervous system where these appear to interact with the synaptic terminals of nerve cells. We determined that: i) each of these astrocyte-like longitudinal glia occupies a specific territory, suggesting that they can read out existing positional information and that this positioning may be functionally important; moreover, the glial ingrowth occurs precisely at the time when the locomotor network becomes functional. This work has been conducted in collaboration with Don van Meyel, McGill University, Montreal, and is about to be submitted to the journal Neuron.\nSecond, we have established that the conserved receptor tyrosine kinase is required in motorneurons to stabilise their dendrites at the time when the motor network becomes functional. We have characterised how lack and how over-activation of this signalling pathway perturbs dendritic growth and are now synapse formation. We are in the process of determining how this signalling pathway is linked to neuron-glia interactions and have begun writing a manuscript, aiming for submission in early 2015.\nThird, we established the first detailed characterisation of synapse formation between identified partner neurons in a developing motor system. Briefly, we find reproducible cell type-specific interactions: different motoneurons reliably form synapses with different partner sensory and interneurons in a cell type-specific fashion. At the same time there is considerable variability in the number of putative synaptic connections formed between partner neurons. Unlike previously thought (and described for sensory neurons) in this locomotor network the presynaptic cell does not appear to dictate the number of connections formed; instead, the postsynaptic motorneuron appears to be instrumental in regulating connectivity. Specifically, motoneuron dendritic arbors adjust their growth to attain a set range of active presynaptic sites. This work has been written up and received positively, to be resubmitted imminently to the journal Current Biology.\nTo underpin the light confocal microscopy work on synapse formation we initiated a collaboration with the Cardona Group at the HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus, generating serial electron microscopy reconstructions of motoneurons and their pre-motor interneurons. These data support the light microscopic methodology. This work is to be completed with submission by early 2015. Our work to date is the first that describes synapse development between identified central neurons in a locomotor network. An obvious application is to take this into other model systems, particular the mouse, to see how conserved the mechanisms are that we have observed. Following on from this will be potential to deploy such insights to studies on regeneration from nerve cord injury, to explore the extent to which these recapitulate normal development; and if not, to seek methods that would aid regeneration along those lines.\nSecond, our work on Anaplastic lymphoma kinase is novel, as we still know preciously little about this conserved signaling pathway in the nervous system. Here, there is scope for application. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
