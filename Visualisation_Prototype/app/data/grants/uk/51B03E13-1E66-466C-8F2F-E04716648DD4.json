The disease symptoms in people are significantly varied and include asymptomatic infections, severe although recoverable fevers, meningoencephalitis, debilitating or fatal encephalitis and slow developing (for years) progressive encephalitis. The reasons for that are not known although some correlation between the virulent properties of individual strains of TBEV that circulate in different regions and severity of the disease has been observed. Human infections in Far Eastern Asia are the most severe with frequent involvement of the CNS and 20-40% of fatality. TBE in Siberia is usually associated with a less severe disease (7-8% of fatality) but chronic disease is observed more frequently (1-3%). Infections linked to West European strains of the TBEV cause a fatality rate less than 2%. Although the reasons for these differences are not clear, our preliminary research suggests that accidental escape of TBEV into a new tick species might demand the virus to change certain parts of their genome, to speed up virus replication in new tick species and thereby facilitate the virus spread in nature. However these genetic changes, working tothe virus s advantage, might increase the virulent properties of the TBEV and therefore be disadvantageous for humans. The spread of genetically-renewed more virulent TBEV might indeed be the reason for the human epidemics. In this project we suggest to investigate which parts of the TBEV genome are responsible for the adaptation of two different TBEV strains, one called Hypr, to tick I. ricinus and the other, Vs to I. persulcatus. These viruses cannot replicate in ?alien? tick species and they are also different in their pathogenic properties in humans; the Vs was isolated from the patient that recovered from the fever whereas Hypr was associated with fatal case of the TBE. We will use a state of art new molecular technologies such as genetic engineering and DNA microarray analysis to establish whether or not there is a correlation between the parts of the virus genome that determine tick-transmission pattern and those that determine virulent properties of the TBEV. This research contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of emerging of new pathogens in the environment and will facilitate the design the appropriate strategy to intervene with infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801208","grantId":"G0801208","fundValue":"388410","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"","coPersons":["Viacheslav  Bolshakov","Ian Martin Jones"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
