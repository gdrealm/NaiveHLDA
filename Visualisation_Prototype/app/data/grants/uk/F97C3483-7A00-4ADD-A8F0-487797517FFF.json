These propositions posit that foreign and security policies will become more assertive, law enforcement more intrusive and internationalized, and economic policy more business-friendly. They also posit that governments will implement more vigorous measures to expand employment, climate change mitigation will be limited, public spending will tend to increase, and public policy will become less church-friendly, more women-friendly and more liberal on sex, cloning, genetic modification and psychotropic drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to get an idea of whether these propositions are consistent with reality by testing them against evidence about current policy directions. The long-term trends from which these propositions about the future are deduced already exist, so their impact should already be evident. And the methodology for deducing these propositions operates without reference to current policy directions, so there is nothing tautological about using them to test its conclusions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2147","grantId":"RES-000-22-2147","fundValue":"80946","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh W Compston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
