{"id":"827FFAEF-BCDC-4D64-8ABD-AE7E1519FCD3","title":"Application of a High Field and High Resolution MRI to Tribological Studies of Articular Cartilage","abstractText":"Understanding the lubrication mechanism in healthy synovial joints such as hips and knees is important for not only understanding how these natural bearings operate in the human body but also developing intervention therapies. The unique load bearing material of articular cartilage in synovial joints is porous and elastic filled with water. Under loading, the interstitial water flows and supports a large percentage of external loading. The aims of this proposal are to develop and apply an advanced high resolution MRI to the lubrication studies of articular cartilage. The main objectives include the development of the MRI imaging methodology and design and development of a small scale experimental lubrication rig to be used inside the MRI to measure deformation, friction and wear. Once these methodologies are developed, applications will be made on both normal and degenerated tissues. Understanding the fluid flow and lubricating capacity for healthy and degenerated cartilage specimens in a range of loading conditions is important as cartilage substitution interventions and tissue engineering therapies are being developed. The outcome from the proposed research will provide timely guidelines for pre-clinical evaluation of these treatment options, and provide knowledge for the regulatory and standards bodies. This will have tremendous economic benefits to the UK NHS as well as clinical benefits to patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F040792/1","grantId":"EP/F040792/1","fundValue":"567682","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Led to an EPSRC programme grant and industry collaborations\n\nsupported NIHR LMBRU funding of a clinical research unit in musculoskeletal research Healthcare Societal,Economic","person":"Zhongmin  JinJohn  Fisher","coPersons":["Aleksandra  Radjenovic","Sophie  Williams","E  Ingham","Mike  Ries"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" High resolution MRI 9T imaging of the meniscus, \n\nHigh resolution MRI 9T imaging of articular cartilage\n\nHigh resolution MRI 9T imaging of articular cartilage under load, with mapping of cartilage deformation and fluid flow the further research has led to collaborative research with industry on the simulation of the biotribolgy of natural joints in the hip and knee and new studies of the biomechanics and biotribology of regenerative interventions for tissue repair This fundamental research has underpinned further applied research on the biotribology of articular cartilage Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
