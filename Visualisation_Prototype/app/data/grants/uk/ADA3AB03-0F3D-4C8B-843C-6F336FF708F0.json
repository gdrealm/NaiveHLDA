We are asking for support with preparing the symposium material, and also to enable us to provide free places for up to ten students whose work is more advanced to attend both elements, as well as places for ten students to attend the doctoral symposium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D062330/1","grantId":"EP/D062330/1","fundValue":"3795","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Budgen","coPersons":["Barbara Ann Kitchenham"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
