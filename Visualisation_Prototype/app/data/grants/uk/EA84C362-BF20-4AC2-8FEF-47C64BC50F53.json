Progress in unravelling the molecular basis of cell migration and the signalling pathways has been rapid but the complexity of the problem has meant that many of the big questions are still unresolved. In effect, the cell cytoplasm contains a complex mechanochemical computer that controls the locomotion of the cell and directs its responses to the environment. Our approach to understanding how this works is to integrate traditional molecular/genetic methods for modifying the cell signalling pathways and locomotory machinery with methods we have developed for following the dynamic activities of protein assemblies and for observing the resulting cell behaviour. Several proteins of the locomotory machinery are polymerised in the form of filaments and these in turn can form bundles and meshworks. Some of these proteins are the same as those that occur in muscles and they can interact in a similar manner to produce contractions and thus contribute to cell motion. However, another activity of these protein assemblies is very different from muscle and also contributes to cell motion. They are constantly disassembling or depolymerising and then reassembling elsewhere. One of our new microscope imaging methods is able to monitor this rapid activity by ?flash? labelling specific proteins at specific locations and then following what happens to them. We have found that whole cycles of disassembly and reassembly can often take place within a few seconds. It appears that the cell signalling pathways direct where and when these changes in state occur and this is likely to be the chief way in which cell locomotion is controlled.\nWe now intend to use our methods to find out what is happening when the cell responds by moving towards chemical signals in its environment. This response, known as chemotaxis, is the means by which scavenging cells in the body can find foreign invaders such as bacteria and hence destroy them. It may also be a method used by cancer cells to find their way to the blood stream and hence disseminate to other parts of the body and form secondary tumours. Finding out the mechanism of chemotaxis could therefore be important for controlling the spread of cancer and for curing certain diseases of the immune system in which chemotaxis is defective.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401026","grantId":"G0401026","fundValue":"337084","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Dunn","coPersons":["Gareth E  Jones"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
