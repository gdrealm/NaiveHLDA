Fluids, in this case air, are generally regarded as exhibiting two states of flow - a 'laminar' state and a 'turbulent' state. Turbulence is characterised by chaotic variations in the direction of the flow, through the appearance of whirls or 'eddies'. In industrial applications, turbulence typically leads to a loss of performance, as significant energy can be lost to the generation of eddies. A typical example is in pipelines, important for domestic water supply, irrigation, cooling systems, oil and gas supply. Rather than energy being expended in moving fluid directly from A to B, almost all the energy is lost to the creation and sustenance of turbulence! The question of how to model turbulence, therefore, is consistently listed among the most important outstanding problems of applied mathematics and theoretical physics \n(e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics). \n\nThis work builds on recent progress in understanding turbulence, made possible by the recent discovery of solutions to the equations governing flow in pipes and channels. These solutions are in the form of waves. Although they travel with the flow, their structure is otherwise static in time. Turbulence is chaotic in time, however. A radical step-change in this approach will be to model turbulence in terms of solutions that vary in time and that repeat after a period of time. Substantially new computational methods will be required to isolate such solutions in the future. There is strong motivation for isolating repeating cycles, otherwise called periodic orbits - from dynamical systems theory they are known to efficiently capture complex dynamics, filtering out activity that is otherwise a distraction. Often only a handful of periodic orbits are required to reproduce the statistical properties of a seemingly complex system.\n\nBy extracting periodic orbits directly from simulations of turbulence itself, this project aims to capture those periodic orbits that are dynamically most important. So far it has only been possible to find orbits via numerical continuation methods, where there is no clear link between the orbits and the actual dynamics of the system. Capturing periodic cycles in a 'large' system such as turbulence, however, has been a challenging task. In this work, a new symmetry projection method will be developed to enable meaningful visualisations of the underlying dynamics. It has been shown that this particular method dramatically improves our ability to spot recurring cycles, i.e. periodic orbits. Collaboration with a leading European experimental facility will enable further application of these methods, plus theoretically guided searches to be performed more rapidly than is possible in simulation.\n\nThis work will have great impact on our understanding of dynamical processes underlying turbulence, where periodic orbits will provide a basis for describing and predicting fluid flow patterns. This will open new avenues of future research in methods of prediction and control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K03636X/1","grantId":"EP/K03636X/1","fundValue":"65921","fundStart":"2013-08-19","fundEnd":"2015-08-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The symmetry reduction method being developed is a fundamental mathematical tool, and is applicable for applications as diverse as fluid flows and cardiac dynamics. The method enables visualisation of the dynamics, and I have recently been consulted on how to apply these methods to population dynamics in mathematical ecology.\n\nIn the current research these methods have been enhanced and applied to extract families of repeating patterns in turbulent fluid flow.\n\nAs turbulence is familiar to many people through ommercial flight, the notion that turbulent flow is chaotic is easily understood. Our research has shown that this chaotic dynamics can be explained in terms of just a few sets of repeating patterns, and this has been conveyed through public speaking (e.g. Cafe Scientifique).

Patterns that are identical up to a shift are automatically reduced to a single state that lives within a reduce space, the 'slice'. Sliced dynamics reveals dynamically important features, such as recurring periodic orbits, that are otherwise impossible to visualise.\n\nDetermining shifts using multiple templates has proven difficult, as there are innumerable options in how and when to apply the switch between templates. With appropriate manipulation, however, it has been shown\nthat it is possible to implement the symmetry reduction with a single template. Features of the symmetry reduction, e.g. rapid changes in shift, have been explained in terms of properties of the projection onto the slice.\n\nUsing the refined method, it has been possible to isolate many more orbits direct from simulation data than in any previous study. Through visualisation of the state space, it has been found that orbits may be grouped into distinct families.\n\nIt has proven difficult, so far, to get sufficiently good quality experimental data from which to extract orbits. Therefore our research is directed to optimising small adjustments to the system that enable their realisation and detection. The key development is in the very general method. This has been shown to enable vastly improved visualisation of paths taken by a chaotic dynamical system, and thereby can be employed to reveal its fundamental features, e.g. its dominant periodic orbits.\n\nBeyond fluid flow, the method is directly applicable to any system that includes a homogeneous direction. This includes e.g. population models in ecology, models of fronts in chemical processes, models of cardiac dynamics. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
