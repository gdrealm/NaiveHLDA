Practically, this project intends to provide empirical evidence and practical design solutions by obtaining first-hand, accurate and comprehensive research data. Strong academic and industrial collaboration will provide a high level of international research with an excellent impact factor. The collaborators include Brunel University, Tsinghua University (China), Centre for Research on Ageing at University of Southampton, and Sainsburyâ€™s. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009648/1","grantId":"ES/K009648/1","fundValue":"234670","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As the project started in December 2013 and is ongoing until 2016, key findings have yet to be found.

The project has been running since December 2013. So far, five focus groups that aimed to understand shopping related challenges and key human factors that influence the older customers' shopping experience have been conducted. The findings have highlighted that physical strength, reflex, height, hearing, eyesight, dexterity, cognition and bodily mobility are main human factors that have great impact on older customers' shopping experience. Key shopping related challenges include: lack of shopping plan (organisation), narrow parking bays, poor signage, poor access to items on shelves, unsuitable promotions and the challenge of taking heavy shopping bags home. \n\nFor the next research step, in order to further explore older customers' natural shopping behaviours a Cultural Probe Pack has been designed and developed. Culture Probe Pack is an experimental research method used for the purpose of information collection to aid design inspiration. It is an information-gathering tool that contains a camera, a diary, maps, shopping inspection cards and other materials. The Culture Probe Pack will be applied to encourage the participants to record their shopping experience within a two-month period via a diary, shopping inspections and maps that indicates their shopping journeys in the user study. This approach has been selected because it allows the researcher and participants a longer period in exploring and collecting research data related to an older consumer's daily life. Pilot studies that aim to test the user study design have been planned for December 2014. 1) Journal publications in design, ageing and retail service research areas will forward academic knowledge on these issues and highlight opportunities for further multidisciplinary research. Other researchers will also have access to the research data through the UK Data Service, ensuring that further impact can be generated from the data collected for this project. Some journal papers have open access, which can be drawn upon by the wider public and non-profit groups for commend good. 2) A number of accessible briefing papers will be prepared for those involved stakeholders such churches, ageing related charities, supermarket stores and local ageing groups. 3) A project website will provide a forum for disseminating research results in a timely manner, in advance of and publicizing academic outputs. 4) The research results will be creatively presented in diverse formats in order to be disseminated with different audiences such as the older consumers, primary or high school students, supermarket staff and local residents. For example, a user-centred design project has been planed with staff and students at Winchester College. Researchers will present our research results to secondary study students as an example of user-centred design and also to provide insights for their design work. This has been arranged in earlier 2015. 5) The supermarket partner collaborating on this project will have access to research results throughout the process and be able to put that knowledge to use in developing policies and service design solutions to benefit the older shopper. Design students from Brunel University and Tsinghua University will use the research findings to develop new product and service design ideas and concepts for improving supermarket service for the older customers.
