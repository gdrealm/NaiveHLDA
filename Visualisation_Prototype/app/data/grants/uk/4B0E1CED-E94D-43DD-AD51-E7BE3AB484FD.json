{"id":"4B0E1CED-E94D-43DD-AD51-E7BE3AB484FD","title":"Application of a particle detection technique in situ temperature monitoring in synchrotron beamline end stations","abstractText":"Many processes in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, climate, and the environment in general depend on temperature. Research aiming at a better understanding of the world around us, improving the impact of our research, and ultimately benefitting the quality of life, relies on precise data. The contact-free, in-situ measurement of temperature to be developed in this project using a temperature-dependent scintillation characteristic is targeting precisely this - improving the monitoring of temperature of a protein sample holder assembly for macromolecular crystallography on the I23 beamline at the Diamond Light Source. For this purpose, a technique developed for research into the dark matter of the universe is being adapted for use at a synchrotron beamline. It involves modifications to the designs of already demonstrated equipment, fabrication of a specialized version of this equipment, systems integration and implementation at the beamline of the synchrotron. The demonstration of feasibility and quality will allow a better assessment of the wider potential of the technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K003046/1","grantId":"ST/K003046/1","fundValue":"78041","fundStart":"2012-11-12","fundEnd":"2014-05-11","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Hans  Kraus","coPersons":["Samuel  Henry"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
