But what, exactly, are the mechanisms through which external economic pressure is supposed to translate into the political changes that sanctioning states desire? </p>\n\n<p>Policymakers seem to operate with a 'rational choice' model, assuming targeted entities will make a cost-benefit analysis, or a 'liberal' model in which the economic pain inflicted on citizens of the target state will lead them to pressure their government for change. In practice, however, these outcomes are hardly ever achieved, suggesting that these ideas still constitute what scholar Johan Galtung dismissed over 40 years ago as a 'naive theory of sanctions'. This means that sanctions are still being imposed today with little sense of what they are meant to do and how, and thus with no guidance as to their likely effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>'How Do International Economic Sanctions (Not) Work?' will fill this serious gap in policy-making and scholarship by closely analysing how sanctions affects the power resources and strategies of domestic forces in targeted countries, and how they work to reshape the state, economy and society in response to this external pressure. </p>\n\n<p>The study is likely to be of interest and relevance to policy-makers and officials in major sanctioning states, as well as domestic and international non-governmental organisations like Burma Campaign UK, who are often at the forefront of calling for sanctions to be applied to 'rogue' states. It will provide the opportunity to shift the basis of policymaking away from a 'naive theory' of sanctions to a realistic and detailed assessment of the capacity of external intervention to reshape target societies and states.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I010157/1","grantId":"ES/I010157/1","fundValue":"120558","fundStart":"2011-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lee Craig Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" The project has developed a critique of existing analyses of how economic sanctions work and an alternative analytical framework, which is being applied to three cases: South Africa, Iraq and Myanmar. \n\n\n\nIn the case of South Africa, the research has demonstrated how unique were the circumstances that enabled sanctions to 'work'. Early sanctions did not, in fact, 'work', but in the short to medium term merely strengthened the political and economic strategy of the ruling National Party. In the longer-term, the key dynamics at work were the increasingly disillusionment of the English and Afrikaner bourgeoisie with apartheid restrictions on the economy and, most importantly, the rising militancy of the black working class. In this new context only, sanctions eroded the state's ability to restore the conditions necessary for capital accumulation and social stability, helping to foster the transition away from apartheid.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Myanmar, the research has found sanctions to be largely unproductive or even counter-productive. Although they complicated the military regime's transition strategy - the pacification of the borderlands and the imposition of 'discipline flourishing democracy' - after 1988, they did not substantially undermine it. Nor did they assist the weak and marginal democratic opposition to pursue its goals; indeed, they may have encouraged the opposition to take overly ambitious stances out of proportion to their actual political power. Sanctions did not prompt wider social unrest but rather concentrated power and resources in the hands of interests favoured by the regime, particularly 'crony capitalists'. So-called 'smart' sanctions were even less effective. Ultimately Myanmar's present 'democratic' transition has been driven by internal dynamics, not sanctions, which arguably delayed the transition to the extent they had any political effects.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Iraq, research is ongoing. Preliminary findings suggest that the commonly-held view that sanctions had no impact are incorrect. Actually, sanctions accelerated a dramatic transformation in the state-society compact underpinning Saddam Hussein's regime, a profound erosion in the state's capacity to rule, and changes in strategy, including major concessions around weapons of mass destruction. They also contributed to growing tensions in the regime and attempts at regime change. These attempts ultimately failed, however, because of the highly fragmented nature of Iraqi society and the weak, marginal nature of its opposition groups. Sanctions thus produced significant changes and concessions, but stopped short of achieving regime change. In fact, the implicit goal of regime change undermined the possibility of achieving full verification of disarmament, dooming the regime to an apparent 'failure' despite its actual successes. The project has many lessons for policymakers about past cases, and can provide a new way of thinking about how sanctions work and can or should be used in international politics. The research on Myanmar has been of particular interest to policymakers, businesses, officials in international organisations and the wider public given the country's political transition since elections held in 2010.
