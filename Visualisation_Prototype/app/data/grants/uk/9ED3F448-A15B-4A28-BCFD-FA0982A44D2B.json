By involving a broad interdisciplinary membership, the network will widen debate on risk assessment and perception, and regulatory activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E008712/1","grantId":"NE/E008712/1","fundValue":"13726","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The Network's aims were to bring together experts in air pollution and particulate impacts, to discuss the impact on natural mineral particles on health. Since that time, we have worked together to rapidly analyze ash during volcanic eruptions and these data are of use for public health decision making during and following eruptions. This has led to my working with the Cabinet Office on the impact of a future eruption to affect the UK.
