{"id":"ECA8D744-054F-4A79-A379-6A00C7709513","title":"The Cosmology of the Early and Late Universe","abstractText":"Cosmology spans a wide range of physics, from the very small scales and high energies of the early Universe to galaxies and galaxy clusters in the late Universe. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (relic radiation from the big bang) and supernovae explosions allow us to probe the expansion history and constituents of the Universe. These observations suggest that most of matter in the Universe is composed of exotic dark matter. Furthermore the expansion of the Universe recently started accelerating, rather than continuing to slow down as expected. This late time acceleration could be due to an exotic dark energy component, or a modification of Einstein's laws of gravity. The late Universe has a rich structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters. These structures are believed to form from small initial fluctuations in the matter distribution, generated in the early Universe. However the mechanism responsible for producing these fluctuations is not yet understood. Connecting observations of the late time Universe, with the early Universe and fundamental particle physics is a major outstanding issue for cosmology and one of the main goals of our work. Particle physics and general relativity both break down at extreme energies, where a unified theory of quantum gravity is expected to operate. We will test the observational consequences of such theories. In particular string theory allows superstrings to stretch across the Universe, altering the fluctuations in the CMB, producing gravitational waves, emitting high energy particles and lensing galaxies. We will study the evolution of networks of cosmic superstrings and make accurate predictions for their observational signatures. This work could potentially provide the first evidence for string theory through cosmology. We will also study the cosmology of models which arise from string theory, including the very early Universe and the generation of the primordial fluctuations from which structure form. String theory, and other new particle physics models, also provide us with a dark matter candidate in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). WIMPs can be detected directly in the lab (via their rare interactions with atoms) or indirectly via the antiparticles and high energy gamma-rays that are produced when they come together and annihilate. They can also be produced in particle colliders such as the LHC. We will develop the tools required to unambiguously detect dark matter and measure its properties. We will also study the astrophysical and cosmological consequences of specific string theory dark matter candidates. We will take a two pronged approach to understanding the physics underlying the observed late time acceleration of the Universe. We will develop techniques which will allow us to test the laws of gravity, and models of dark energy, in both the early and late Universe. We will also continue to explore fundamental physics models which may provide a mechanism for the acceleration. Our research encompasses a wide range of scales and energies. This diversity is met with a corresponding array of techniques to study various phenomena, ranging from quantum gravity to classical dynamics and analytic calculations to numerical simulations using supercomputers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000388/1","grantId":"ST/J000388/1","fundValue":"442219","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Our work has been published in academic journals and on electronic arXivs. It has been presented at numerous conferences around the world. \nSome of our work has reached audiences beyond academia as it has been reported through the Youtube channel Sixty Symbols and reached a global audience of well over 500,000.

We made a signicant contribution to the Planck pre-launch paper which determined the expected LFI polarisation ability and has become the standard used by the planck consortium. By studying the constraints on non-Gaussainity (NG) which arise from Primordial\nBlack Hole (PBH) formation, we showed how PBH observations would rule out non negligible negative Non-Gaussianity signals. For the first time we constructed a class of observables and matter couplings in spin foam models of Quantum Gravity. We provided the first demonstration that general relativity can be described as an SU(2) gauge theory free from the infamous &quot;conformal mode&quot; problem of the usual metric formulation and this lead to a dramatic simplication of the graviton Feynman rules. We provided a new resolution of the infamous cosmological constant problem (CCP) based on selftuning in Horndeski's most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity. We created the Parameterized Post-Friedmannian (PPF) framework for model-independent testing of gravity and dark energy on cosmological scales. We ruled out a popular class of massive gravity models by demonstrating that they lead to a break down of predictability at unacceptably large distances in the earth's gravitational environment. We completed a highly cited review of modified theories of gravity that has quickly become the standard reference in the field. We presented a new formulation of a model-independent parameterisation of the WIMP momentum distribution which will allow the WIMP mass to be measured accurately using data from future direct detection experiments.\n\nOutside of academic breakthroughs we continued to train PhD students and Postdoctoral Fellows through our research and lecture programmes we ran. Members of the programme contributed significantly to Outreach activities including Sixty Symbols and Numberphile Youtube video series, Masterclasses in particle theory and numerous lectures given to schools. The research remains ongoing, and subsequent grant applications have been made to secure funding so that we may continue with out work. meanwhile other groups around the world have taken on our research ideas and are extending them.
