At present, there is no safe and effective treatment for this disease. Gut bypass surgery does cause major weight loss but can be quite dangerous and has many side effects. Therefore, there is a need for a treatment that can mimic the effects of surgery without the dangerous surgery itself. In response to eating a meal the gut releases appetite inhibiting chemicals, known as gut hormones, which is why after eating you don?t feel hungry any more. These hormones influence parts of the brain to reduce appetite and so limit the amount of food we eat. It is thought that the bypass surgery works by causing an increased release of the satiety gut hormones, chronically reducing ones appetite and the intake of food. In this project, we are testing a modified version of the major satiety gut hormone, known as PYY, that we have successfully developed so that it lasts all day. We wish to show that it is effective at reducing weight, is easy to administer and doesn?t have unexpected side effects. We will also standardise its manufacture and develop a method to measure it accurately in man. At the end of the project we will use this information to get permission to test it in human volunteers, as a novel and potentially exciting treatment for obesity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802390","grantId":"G0802390","fundValue":"735815","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen R Bloom","coPersons":["Tricia Mei-Mei Tan"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
