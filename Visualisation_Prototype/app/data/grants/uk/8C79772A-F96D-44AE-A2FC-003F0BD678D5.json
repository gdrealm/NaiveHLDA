{"id":"8C79772A-F96D-44AE-A2FC-003F0BD678D5","title":"Structural and functional studies in lentivirus RNA encapsidation","abstractText":"There is no vaccine for HIV/AIDS. Drug combinations slow the virus but it has developed resistance to all the current ones and new ones are needed which stop virus replication. When HIV assembles it packages its genes, which are on a long piece of RNA similar to our own DNA. There are lots of other RNAs in the cell and HIV recognises its own because this RNA folds up into a complex but distinct ?knot? like shape. The virus captures this RNA at a particular place inside the cell. Drugs blocking this process would provide a potentially very powerful new weapon against HIV. The plan is to deduce the structures of all the molecules involved and also where the capture happens so we can design antiviral molecules and get them to the correct place to work against the virus. The work will also have spin off benefits for gene therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800142","grantId":"G0800142","fundValue":"1361240","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Michael Lever","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
