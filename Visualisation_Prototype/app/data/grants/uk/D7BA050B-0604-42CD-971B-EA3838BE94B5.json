What isneeded is not just improvements to existing solutions, but radical newdevelopments that can dramatically increase energy savings and reduceadverse environmental impacts. The development of new flow concepts onwhich such solutions will eventually be based requires unprecedentedfully resolved simulations and laboratory experiments because existingturbulence models cannot be applied indiscriminately on radically newflow concepts.One very recent example of a new flow concept originating from the UKis turbulent flows generated by fractal grids (figure 1). As attestedby recent patent applications by Imperial Innovations,proof-of-concept studies at Imperial and reports in various popularscience and engineering periodicals (Food Manufacture, June 2008; TheChemical Engineer, July 2008; Process Engineering, 18 July 2008;Speciality Chemicals, September 2008; Scientific Computing World,August 2008; see http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/tmfc/popular) this classof new flow concepts offers alternative solutions for industrialmixers, silent airbrakes and spoilers, natural ventilation, sun-roofsand combustion. In this proposal, we focus on new industrial staticinline mixers.These new flow concepts also pose unexpected challenges to turbulenceresearch and modelling. Over the past 60 years, efforts in turbulencehave been mostly in ad-hoc modelling of specific turbulent flows andthe progress has been limited. A fundamental understanding ofturbulence dynamics is needed if we want the development of an entireraft of new flow concepts to become a realistic possibility. For this,a well-designed and well-targeted experiment is required where theseturbulence dynamics can be set out of joint so as to give us clues forhow to understand and, if possible, control them. This is the otherfocus of this research proposal and it directly relates to the firstbecause both relate to the same new flow concept: turbulence generatedby fractal grids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H030875/1","grantId":"EP/H030875/1","fundValue":"614884","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Christos Vassilicos","coPersons":["Bharathram  Ganapathisubramani"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Grids have been used to generate turbulence since the mid\n1930s. Fractal grids were introduced by our group in 2007. \n\nWith the support of this grant, it was shown that, \ncompared to regular grids, fractal grids can enhance \nturbulent transport and therefore stirring, which is an \nessential component for mixing, by one order of \nmagnitude without penalty on pressure drop. \n\nThe mechanism for this dramatic improvement was identified as the Scale-Space Unfolding (SSU) mechanism\nand it was demonstrated that the root cause of this mechanism is the fractality of the grid. \n\nOn the more fundamental level, fractal grids allowed the study of the production region which was not easily accessible with regular grids. The production region is the\nregion near the grid where the turbulence is being produced. \nThis region is very small and extremely intense in the case\nof regular grids, hence making experimental inverstigations of it extremelly difficult. In fact this region had never been\ncomprehensively studied before this research grant. Its importance is clear as this is where the turbulence is being created. \n\nThe most important finding in this respect is that many of\nthe properties considered to be defining properties \nof turbulence (the power-law spectrum of the turbulence energy and the constancy of the interscale energy flux) \nare already present in that region even though the existing theories of turbulence establish these properties under extremely different conditions. On the applied side there is now real potential for use of\nfractal grids in industrial mixers and in heat transfer (cooling)\napplications. \n\nOn the fundamental side, the results form the basis and call for new theoretical approaches to turbulence. \n\nWe are currently working in both directions.
