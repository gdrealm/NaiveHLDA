One of these is for the dsRNA molecules to be 'edited' by specific enzymes referred to as Adenosine Deaminases that acts on RNA (ADARs). This type of dsRNA editing involves substitution of one type of residue (adenosine (A)) for another (inosine (I)). Moreover, dsRNA molecules can be 'hyper-edited' where up to 50% of A residues are changed to I. As the residues within a dsRNA molecule are arranged in a specific order to form a particular code, hyper-editing has the effect of disrupting this code. In addition, extensive substitution of A residues to I results in changing the shape of the dsRNA, with localized distortions occurring within edited regions. The change in shape that occurs within hyper-edited dsRNA makes it an easily recognizable molecule in the cell. Hyper-edited dsRNA (I-dsRNA) is specifically recognized and cleaved by an enzyme that is found in various cellular extracts (from humans, frogs). We previously showed that cleavage of I-dsRNA occurred within a particular configuration of residues that comprised both IU and UI pairs. In contrast, a similar dsRNA containing GU and UG pairs (G-dsRNA), which are essentially equivalent to IU and UI pairs, was neither recognized nor cleaved. This suggests that the enzyme responsible for cleaving I-dsRNA specifically recognizes its unique features. We have purified a protein that specifically recognizes I-dsRNA, and also promotes its cleavage. This protein, Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN), was previously described as a component of another major pathway in the cell involving dsRNA (RNAi). However, while TSN was able to enhance cleavage of I-dsRNA, it was not sufficient alone for cleavage. This suggested that other proteins were additionally required. We intend to identify the proteins that may play a role alongside TSN for specific cleavage of I-dsRNA. Following identification, we will investigate how these proteins interact with both TSN and I-dsRNA, and test whether they are involved in cleavage. In addition, we will carry out experiments aimed at understanding the differences in the shape of I-dsRNA, compared with G-dsRNA, that make it susceptible to cleavage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F018347/1","grantId":"BB/F018347/1","fundValue":"279780","fundStart":"2008-11-25","fundEnd":"2011-11-24","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Deirdre Scadden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
