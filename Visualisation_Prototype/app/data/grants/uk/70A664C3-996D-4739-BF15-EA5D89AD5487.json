Deregulation of ErbB receptors or their downstream targets underlie human pathologies ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. To date, we have learned a lot about the signalling cascades that are triggered upon receptor activation; however we know little about the negative regulatory mechanisms that attenuate, tune and specify signalling readout. By targeted deletion of the mig6 gene in mouse, we have shown that lack of Mig6 causes sustained EGF receptor and downstream MAPK activation leading to impaired keratinocyte differentiation and hyperproliferation (Ferby et al., Nat. Med., 2006). Proposed project seeks to provide insight into the underexplored mechanisms by which a growing family of multiadaptor feedback modulators contributes to the specification of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mediated signalling during tissue development and homeostasis. The mechanism by which Mig6 negatively regulate EGF receptor signalling remains unclear and will be the topic of investigation. More specifically we have set up the following tree main objectives: a) We will aim at identifying direct effector molecules that are regulated by Mig6 and characterizing the relevance of these interactions for ErbB-mediated epidermal cellular responses. b) Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggest that Mig6 regulate the spacial distribution of the ErbB receptor family within the cell, which in turn emerges as a central determinant both of the specification and duration of RTK induced intracellular signalling. Therefore we will determine the role of Mig6 in regulating ErbB receptor trafficking and its impact on cellular responses. c) Finally, Mig6 is genetically related to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Ack1 and Tnk1. Intriguingly both Ack1 and Tnk1 have also been implicated in negative regulation of ErbB receptor signalling and are co-expressed in epithelial tissues. These observations raise a possibility that Mig6 cooperates with Ack1 and Tnk1. We will therefore knock down either Ack1 or Tnk1 expression in mig6 knock-out keratinocytes and assess the possible synergistic effect on ErbB mediated cellular responses. Taken together, proposed research will provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which spatio-temporal control of ErbB receptor signalling is achieved and its importance for the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014848/1","grantId":"BB/F014848/1","fundValue":"421276","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ingvar  Ferby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
