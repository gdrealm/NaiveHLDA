{"id":"8FFA0E69-887F-41C6-A024-5FA848C3F15A","title":"The Cinema of John Sayles: Narrative, Language, Subjectivity","abstractText":"This project will provide a critical overview of Sayles's fifteen 'independent' films since 1980, considering industrial, economic, social, cultural and political context and issues of authorship, independence, narrative form and style. It will also address a recurring problem in Marxist criticism. Sayles's films typically simultaneously centre the monadic bourgeois subject (they are melodramas) and decentre it (characters are convinced as complexly interwebbing intersubjectivities). This constitutes a partial, if problematic, response to 'one-sided' Marxism's failure to conceptualise the subject as anything other than the subject of capital,. Which this project will explore through phenomenological and materialistic-linguistic rather than psychoanalytical or linguistic-idealist frameworks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113051/1","grantId":"113051/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Bould","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
