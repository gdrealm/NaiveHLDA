{"id":"8FE24447-93AD-488F-AE66-1E8475AD0CD9","title":"Uncoupling flagellar gene expression from flagellar assembly","abstractText":"Bacterial locomotion plays a key role during the life cycle of over seventy percent of bacterial species. The most common way bacteria achieve movement is by using a cell surface structure known as the bacterial flagellum. The structural organisation of the flagellum is often paralleled to the propeller of a motorboat, consisting of a motor anchored into the cell surface and a long external filament that acts as the propeller. Two key issues in assembly of external structures such as flagella are: how does a cell monitor assembly? And how is the gathered information processed? Assembly of an individual flagellum is a step-wise process that requires individual flagellar building blocks to be transported out of the cell by a dedicated transport system. As with every construction site this process requires site managers. Without site managers the efficiency of construction is reduced leading to a waste of energy, as the production and delivery of the required building materials is not regulated. In the case of flagellar assembly the site managers are a group of proteins known as secretion chaperones. In the pathogen Salmonella enterica the secretion chaperones of flagellar assembly must 1) coordinate delivery of specific building blocks and 2) oversee the timely synthesis of a subset of the flagellar building blocks in response to the construction status of the growing flagellum. During this proposal we will investigate how two flagellar secretion chaperones regulate the production of flagellar building blocks in response to intermediate stages of flagellar assembly. To achieve our goal we will characterise mutations isolated in the secretion chaperones unable to process signals obtained from the growing flagellar. We will also use these mutations to study the overall effect loss of flagellar gene regulation by secretion chaperones has upon flagellar assembly. Our study will advance our understanding of how cells perceive and regulate fundamental aspects of their life cycles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D015855/1","grantId":"BB/D015855/1","fundValue":"308686","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Phillip  Aldridge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
