In both countries urban slums have grown rapidly in the last several decades as a consequence of extreme rural poverty and civil conflict. The intervention is the work of the NGO Un Techo Para Mi Pais (UTPMP), which in English is “A Roof for My Country.” Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that providing improved housing: 1. Improves the health status of beneficiary young children measured by maternal reports of diarrhea in the last four weeks, parasitic infestations in the fecal matter of young children, anthropometric statistics to measure stunting and wasting, anemia, and cognitive development. 2. Improves household economic conditions of beneficiary households, including labor force participation, income, asset accumulation, and consumption. 3. Increases beneficiary school attendance and studying 4. Improves beneficiary maternal well-being measured by depression, perceived stress, satisfaction with various aspects of life and dignity. 5. Reduction in crime and improved sense of security. 6. Improves the same outcomes of non-beneficiary households living in the beneficiary communities \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0317","grantId":"RES-167-25-0317","fundValue":"261146","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Jerome Gertler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Regents of the Uni California Berkeley","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
