Moreover, we do not understand the performance of current systems as no baseline performance data is available, i.e. it is unclear whether current systems perform better than random or not. Thus even if an improvement was proposed, it would be difficult to measure its impact if any.We are proposing to design a plug and play software tool (cargo screening system simulator) that will map the right technology to the right commodity / threat combination and thus* Identify gaps in a current sensor system set-up / what new technology do we need?* Allow for proper evaluation of new sensor technology / is it value for money?* Optimise given resources / get highest throughput / detection for fixed resources.Additionally, as the project is interested in the whole system and allows for the evaluation of new technologies, it is an enabling project for all other sandpit projects. We will be able to evaluate new sensor technologies proposed in specific scenarios to establish practical cost / benefits. To achieve this, we propose to run a follow on network alongside the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G004234/1","grantId":"EP/G004234/1","fundValue":"512242","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  a 3d simulation of calais port was built. this also led to simulation work with the port of dover. there are ongoing discussions on how to take this further.

Port operators are attentive to their standards, a smooth\n\nservice flow and economic viability while border agencies are concerned about national security. The\n\ntime taken for security checks often interferes with the compliance to service standards that port operators\n\nwould like to achieve.\n\n\n\nDecision support tools as for example Cost-Benefit Analysis or Multi Criteria Analysis are useful helpers to\n\nbetter understand the impact of changes to a system. They allow investigating future scenarios and helping to find solutions that are acceptable for all parties involved in port operations.\n\n\n\nIn this project we evaluate two different modelling methods, namely scenario analysis and discrete event\n\nsimulation. These are useful for driving the decision support tools (i.e. they provide the inputs the decision\n\nsupport tools require). Our aims are, on the one hand, to guide through the modelling processes and, on the other hand, to demonstrate what kind of decision support information one can obtain from the different modelling methods presented.\n\n\n\nWe developed models and simulations for the ports of Dover and for the ports of Calais and show how they can be used to answer different what-if type questions, such as the impacts of additinal lanes or searches on the throughput rate and service levels.
