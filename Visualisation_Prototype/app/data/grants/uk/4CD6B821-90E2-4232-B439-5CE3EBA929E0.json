The evolution of personal taxation in post-war Europe","abstractText":"<p>The massive expansion of the state in post-war Europe has rested on a greatly enlarged fiscal base, yet little is known about how that fiscal base has evolved. This is surprising in view of the fact that the questions of how governments get money and from whom they get it are seen to be two of the most important political issues faced in any modern political economy. While most studies of fiscal history try to provide answers to the first question by analysing the ideological, political and administrative inputs to tax policy, our aim is to provide answers to the second question.</p> \n<p><br />We focus on the outcomes of tax policy; what different households across Western Europe have paid in taxes (income tax and social security contributions) at all points on the income scale since 1950. Since such information is not in the public domain, we have to use national tax rules and wage rates in order to infer what households with particular characteristics would have paid in direct taxes each year since 1950. Using our microsimulation model, EuroPTax, we intend to provide for the first time details of the effective rates of income tax and social security contributions paid by different households in all the major European democracies since 1950.</p> \n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1408","grantId":"RES-000-22-1408","fundValue":"46022","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"F  Lynch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
