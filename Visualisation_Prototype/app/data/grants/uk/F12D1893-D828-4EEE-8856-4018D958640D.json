This clearly cannot apply to the purification stages in a batch operating sequence since here the solvent is an essential part of the purification system and will ultimately contain all the unwanted by-products. However, post-purification and pre-formulation it is usual form pharma and agrochems companies to transform an active molecule from its free base or acid state into a molecular salt or co-crystal having desirable physico-chemical characteristics. This process typically involves redissolution of ingredients in an organic solvent (or solvent mixture) and recrystallisation to create the required two component solid form. In this proposal we will address the possibility of new 'solvent free' process technology based on co-grinding of components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F015887/1","grantId":"EP/F015887/1","fundValue":"76460","fundStart":"2008-05-20","fundEnd":"2009-07-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Davey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
