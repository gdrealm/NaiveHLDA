{"id":"A60B8333-EC23-4668-AE89-0DB2B6402FCB","title":"Massively Parallel Sanger Sequencing by Duplex Melting","abstractText":"Small differences in the genome sequence (genetic make-up) underlie different degrees of susceptibility to disease and drug response between individuals. The DNA sequencing technology required to access these differences is currently too slow and costly to apply to human DNA sequencing on a routine basis. New methods are needed which will reduce the cost by several orders of magnitude to ~$1000. This challenge is the basis of the innovation proposed for funding. We will develop a novel ultra- fast, ultra- low cost technology entitled with the aim of bringing sequencing of whole human genomes into routine practice both in the research laboratory and in medical practice. The specific aim of the project will be to furnish proof of concept of this technology within 12 months.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E025013/1","grantId":"BB/E025013/1","fundValue":"99964","fundStart":"2007-06-21","fundEnd":"2008-06-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kalim Ullah Mir","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
