{"id":"5C03FA20-2B15-4B8A-8103-8F3B778CFD93","title":"Nanoanalysis for Advanced Materials and Healthcare","abstractText":"This proposal seeks funding to deliver enhanced capability for characterising and assessing advanced nanomaterials using three complementary, leading edge techniques: Field-emission microprobe (EPMA), combined Raman/multiphoton confocal microscope (Raman/MP) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). This suite of equipment will be used to generate a step-change in nanoanalysis capability for a multi-disciplinary team of researchers who together form a key part of Strathclyde's new Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC). The equipment will support an extensive research portfolio with an emphasis on functional materials and healthcare applications. The requested equipment suite will enable Strathclyde and other UK academics to partner with other world-leading groups having complementary analytical facilities, thereby creating an international collaborative network of non-duplicated facilities for trans-national access. Moreover the equipment will generate new research opportunities in advanced materials science in partnership with the National Physical Laboratory, UK industry and academia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N010914/1","grantId":"EP/N010914/1","fundValue":"13061","fundStart":"2015-11-08","fundEnd":"2019-11-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert William Martin","coPersons":["Duncan  Graham","Deepak  Uttamchandani","Joop  Ter Horst","Paul Roger Edwards","Alastair James Florence","Jan  Sefcik","Karen Jane Faulds","Alastair William Wark","Carol  Trager-Cowan"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
