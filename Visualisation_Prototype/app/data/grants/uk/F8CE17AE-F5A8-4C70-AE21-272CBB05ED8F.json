The corpus is as representative of the deaf community as possible, including a balance of deaf men and women, deaf adults with deaf parents and those with hearing parents, signers who are young and old, and individuals from working and middle class backgrounds and different ethnic groups.</p>\n\n<p>Advances in technology have made it possible for the first time to collect these video recordings of sign language data, store them digitally, give them annotations and make them accessible on-line.

This dictionary will prove invaluable references for research and teaching/learning of BSL and for linguistics more generally.\nInternationally, the BSL Corpus is one of very few large sign language corpus projects (along with projects in Australia, The Netherlands and Germany) and only the second to have video data available online (after The Netherlands). The BSL Corpus team was involved in the Sign Language Corpora Network (2009-2010) and maintains strong links with researchers working on these corpus projects. The BSLCP-hosted 2009 workshop &quot;Sign Language Corpora: Linguistic Issues&quot; had international attendance (&amp;gt;100 academics), and many were researchers starting or planning sign language corpora in their own countries. Since then, the BSL Corpus team have worked and consulted with such researchers, including those from USA, Italy, India and Japan.\nThe BSL video data and web interfaces were gradually curated/developed and uploaded from early 2011. From July 2011, the form for requesting access to the conversation and interview data has been available. Since then (as of October 2014) we have received requests for user licenses from around 30 researchers from all over the world. We expect to receive many more in the future.

In addition, the following studies have been completed.\n\nPhonological variation in the 1 handshape study: This study examined variation in BSL signs produced with the 1 handshape (ie a typical pointing handshape with extended index finger). Analysis of 2110 signs indicates that variation in the 1 handshape is conditioned by linguistic factors including (a) grammatical category of the sign, with functor signs (eg pointing signs) showing significantly more variation than content signs (eg WOMAN, TRY), and (b) phonological environment, with the preceding and following signs conditioning the variation. Conference presentations on this study were given at Linguistics Association of Great Britain (2009), New Ways of Analysing Variation (2009), and International Society for Gestures Studies (2010).\n\nLexical variation and change in numbers, colours, and placename signs: In this study on lexical variation conducted by project-linked student Rose Stamp, we have found that a) younger signers, b) signers who attended a school outside of their region, and c) signers with non-signing parents were all less likely to use traditional signs (which may be specific to the region they lived in), compared to a) older signers, b) signers who attended school in their region and c) signers with signing parents. We also found that sign category was an important factor (signs for countries are changing faster than signs for colours). Conference presentations on this study were given in 2009 (UK Language Variation and Change), 2010 (Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research Conference) and 2011 (International Conference on Language Variation in Europe).\n\nLexical frequency: The study on lexical frequency includes 24,920 sign tokens from the corpus conversation data: approximately 500 signs each from 50 participants from two regions, balanced as much as possible for age, gender, and language background. Results (presented at the) indicate that 60 per cent of the data consists of signs from the core lexicon, with high frequency items including more content words than is typical of a spoken language like English. This data provides the first lexical frequency information for a sign language based on a large conversational dataset, and complements existing work on sign familiarity. Conference presentations on this study were given at the Symposium in Applied Sign Linguistics and the Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory conference (2011).\n\nOutputs: In addition to the peer-reviewed conferences and workshops noted above (in the UK and internationally), we have given presentations invited by local universities and training centres (eg Middlesex University and City Lit Centre for Adult Learning in London), and at Deaf community events hosted by the Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre (DCAL) and the BSLCP (DCAL Deaf Open Day in London, 2010, and 6 UK-wide DCAL Roadshow events in 2011). Overall the studies on sociolinguistic variation and change and lexical frequency have clarified previously held assumptions about how BSL varies across different social groups and in different linguistic contexts, how it is changing, and which signs occur frequently in natural conversation. These findings will lead directly to improved sign language teaching resources that will more accurately describe how the language is used by a range of subgroups within the British Deaf community. This will in turn bring about improvements to the training of BSL teachers, sign language interpreters and educators of deaf children. Better sign language/interpreting resources will result in improved services for deaf people, better ensuring their full participation in society. Work is underway by DCAL (2011-2015) to produce an online dictionary and reference grammar for BSL, both of which will be based on the lexical database created for the BSLCP study on lexical frequency (results of this study have been presented to teachers, interpreters and researchers at DCAL and at Bristol University in 2011). This dictionary and reference grammar will prove invaluable references for research and teaching/learning of BSL and for linguistics more generally.
