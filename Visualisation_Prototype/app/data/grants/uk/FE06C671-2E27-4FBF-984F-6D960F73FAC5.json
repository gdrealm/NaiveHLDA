It has been widely recognized, however, that there can be significant barriers to establishing new cross-disciplinary collaborations. One barrier can be the difficulty in persuading funders that the techniques or skills in question really can be translated between different disciplines. In this context, pump-priming funding that allows workers to trial their collaborative ideas and generate proof-of-principle results can be extremely beneficial. The proposed research grant will bring leading EPSRC-funded researchers at the University of Leeds together both across the EPSRC remit and between EPSRC and other research council with workers from other domains, to develop new collaborations. The output of the research is intended to be the demonstration of the basic concept such that sustainable follow-up funding can then be sought from appropriate bodies, including but not limited to, EPSRC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J013919/1","grantId":"EP/J013919/1","fundValue":"32014","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Kane Jimack","coPersons":["Alexander Giles Davies","Stephen Philip Marsden"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
