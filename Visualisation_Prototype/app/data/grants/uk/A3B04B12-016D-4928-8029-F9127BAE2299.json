Their shrimp-like bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a relatively thin, two-part shell or &quot;carapace&quot; made from the polysaccharide chitin coupled with proteins, often with the incorporation of calcium. The two valves of the carapace are connected by a hinge, and can open and close while retaining their rigidity. Most myodocopids can be distinguished from other ostracods by their well-developed compound eyes; some occupying a third of their total body size. Indeed, they use visual signals in the form of iridescence or bioluminescence for courtship. In one group - &quot;Macrocypridina&quot; (about 8mm long) - the carapace is heavily pigmented except for a round, clear transparent window directly covering the eye, through which the animal can see. These windows have some interesting properties; they are very thin yet rigid, and prevent crack formation and propagation, avoid scratches, allow oxygen to pass through them, and appear resistant to the buildup of surface contamination. Our proposal is to understand the biophysical and structural basis of the properties of these ostracod windows, and consequently to mimic these structures on a larger scale to develop very thin, hard contact lenses suitable for humans. These lenses will act as eye shields in military applications but will also be beneficial for the treatment of eye-related problems in the general population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019879/1","grantId":"BB/J019879/1","fundValue":"112093","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith Michael Meek","coPersons":["Christine  Purslow"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" The ostracod carapace (Macrocypridina castanea) consists of a highly ordered lamellar arrangement with an as yet unidentified surface coating. Chitin fibres within the lamella are assembled into common plywood structure. However, a high number of lamellae (around 120), their thinness and uniformity are what distinguish the carapace from other cuticles. We have also found, using serial block face scanning electron microscopy, interesting channels that connect the cells on the inner to those on the outer carapace surface.\n\nWe have collected x-ray scatter pattern that revealed 7 different reflections arising from the carapace between 2.6&Aring; and 10&Aring; (10.0, 7.1, 5.1, 5.0, 4.7, 3.4 and 2.6). Two of those reflections correspond with so called chitin signature rings which are described to be at 3.38&Aring; and 9.43&Aring;.\n\nThe latter reflection showed some change between the body and the window area of the carapace. We registered a small decrease in molecular spacing in the transparent region, but it is only a preliminary result that requires a further study to be confirmed. Some of the reflections manifest the highly preferential fibre orientation. We now know that the optical and mechanical properties of the carapace are based on its multilayer microstructure. This can be mimicked using other materials to produce very thin optically transparent yet strong materials which potentially have many applications. We are currently seeking funding to develop such a material for military use Understanding the function of the carapace in the lifestyle of marine and fresh water ostracods will be of benefit to the large community of ostracodologists. Our main purpose, however, was to exploit the principles to develop a new material (see below) Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
