Genetic engineering can produce large amounts of pure protein, and the exploration of the multifarious conditions under which a protein might form crystals has also been revolutionised through the use of robotics, such that 1000 different conditions can now be explored rapidly using only a milligram of pure protein. At St Andrews, we have established the Scottish Structural Proteomics Facility in collaboration with structural biologists, chemists and virologists at other institutions. This facility provides robotics to streamline the production of proteins and crystals for subsequent analysis using X-ray diffraction. We have now reached another bottleneck, namely the ability to effectively screen the crystals to determine their diffraction quality. At the moment, for the small crystals produced by our robotics, we have to travel to an intense X-ray source in Grenoble. These trips need to be planned weeks in advance, and involve a considerable amount of travelling. Our research proposal is requesting funds for enahanced X-ray diffraction equipment in collaboration with arguably the world's foremost supplier of X-ray equipment for single crystal analysis. We are proposing to acquire a high intensity X-ray generator that will produce 1.5x the intensity of our current system. This should allow us to screen far more small crystals in St Andrews. Another means of improving observable diffraction is to dehydrate the protein crystals. The majority of protein crystals have large solvent channels that occupy 30 to 70%, and in some cases up to 90%, of the volume of the crystal. This makes the crystals fragile, as there are few interactions between the protein molecules holding the crystal together. There have been many reports of dehydration improving the ordering of molecules in a crystal with a subsequent improvement in diffraction quality. Such reports have often been hit-and-miss and not very reproducible. We are asking for funds in this proposal to purchase a 'free mounting system', or FMS. This device allows fine control of the state of hydration in a crystal whilst simultaneously observing the changes in the diffraction pattern. This simple methodology will allow us to optimise the diffraction quality of our crystals / in some reports, dehydration has had dramatic effects, in some cases going from no diffraction to the observation of diffraction to a resolution that would enable a protein structure to be determined. Another major advantage of the FMS method, is in freezing crystals. It is routine for protein crystals to be flash-frozen to 100K for data collection. The reason is to limit radiation damage. In order to freeze a crystal, however, a suitable cryoprotectant has to be found, that is something that will stop the water in the crystal forming ice upon freezing, as ice produces its own intense diffraction pattern that can disturb the protein's diffraction pattern. Finding such a cryoprotectant can be difficult, however the FMS system allows simple cryoprotection through the use of a drop of oil being placed in the otherwise 'dry' crystal. Therefore, we can very easily cryoprotect a crystal in its optimum diffracting state. Finally, the process of structure determination requires the determination of 'phases' / this is information lost in the diffraction process that needs to be regained through other means. One method is to detect very small changes in the intensities of the diffraction pattern that arise from absorption of the X-rays by certain atoms at certain X-ray wavelengths. Most proteins contain sulfur atoms which absorb X-rays generated using a chromium anode. We are proposing to develop such a chromium phasing system in-house at St Andrews that will allow us to determine certain protein structures without the need to travel to synchrotrons.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012922/1","grantId":"BB/E012922/1","fundValue":"246559","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Garry  Taylor","coPersons":["James Henderson Naismith","Malcolm F White"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
