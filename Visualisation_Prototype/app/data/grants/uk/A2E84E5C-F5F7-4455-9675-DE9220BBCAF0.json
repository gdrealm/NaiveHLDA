{"id":"A2E84E5C-F5F7-4455-9675-DE9220BBCAF0","title":"Creativity East Midlands (CREEM)","abstractText":"We will use a combination of face to face meetings and online collaboration tools to share, explore and converge our various conceptualisations of the creativity domain. We will employ Tuckman's four stage team-development model: &quot;Forming Storming Norming Performing&quot; and the broad methodological framework.\n\n1. Forming Month 1-3\nParticipants begin to get to know each other and contribute their perspectives, priorities, issues etc to the collective knowledge pool. The initial contact needs to be face-to-face as far as possible to establish participant identities and foster rapid development of working relationships. Following and initial one-day meeting, information giving and clarification can be conducted remotely via a wiki and Access grid videoconferencing.\n\n2. Storming Month 4-6\nInformation giving and clarification shades through into a period in which participants increasingly begin to challenge statements, debate issues, priorities and generate new ideas. This is a critical phase as it paves the way for successful integration (norming) and productive work (performing). A one-day symposium will bring this phase to a head. Participants will be helped towards the creation of a &quot;map&quot; drawing on Soft Systems Analysis (Checkland 1981) to develop a shared understanding of the scope and structure of the research territory, identifying outstanding differences and conflicts. This will underpin the generation of the first draft ontology for the domain.\n\nNorming Months 7-9\nDuring the norming phase participants will further converge their ideas, building on the consensus around the current picture. Soft systems &quot;Rich Picture&quot; development techniques and ontology refinement will be continued, conducted remotely and collaboratively initially and coming together in a one-day symposium to refine and agree the research domain description and priorities. Output will be a first draft ontology.\n\nPerforming Months 10-12\nSelected key authors will be mapped on to the ontology to create a conceptual reference model for the creativity domain. The test for the ontology will be whether it enables these texts to be disambiguated. A final two-day, self-financing, symposium will present a mixed programme of internally generated papers presenting the results of the workshop alongside invited, refereed, papers from external authors. Outputs will be (a) specific proposals that seek to apply the ontology to the research topics listed in &quot;Rationale and Research context&quot; above; (b) journal papers across a wide range of disciplines and an edited book.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E508405/1","grantId":"AH/E508405/1","fundValue":"12161","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Creem fed directly into the Nesta funded 'Amplified Leicester' project http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/amplified-leicester-impact-social-capital-and-cohesion and indirectly into the highly successful 'Square Mile' project http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/dmu-square-mile/dmu-square-mile.aspx.

The rapid transformation of the Creem programme of lectures, cafe style discussions and online discussion into the Nesta funded Amplified Leicester project and its relationship with the Square mile project could be examined as a case study in technology supported social networks and use of technology to amplify the effects of actors in a purposeful network to support knowledge transfer and the creative economy.
