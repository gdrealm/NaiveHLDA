A key aspect of this research is to gain knowledge that is grounded in the actual experiences of the returnee women themselves. This is important because not only has the issue of returnee women been largely ignored, but the stigmatisation and poverty of these women means they often have little voice in citizenship debates and pro-poor development policy making. </p>\n\n<p>The project will involve analysis of discourses and policies of trafficking and models of citizenship; semi structured interviews with activists and key stakeholders; and in depth interviews with returnee women.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1490","grantId":"RES-062-23-1490","fundValue":"238346","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Diane  Richardson","coPersons":["Nina  Laurie"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
