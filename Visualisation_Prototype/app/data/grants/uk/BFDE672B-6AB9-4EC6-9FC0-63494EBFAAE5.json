Electrostatic fields can alter how effectively a liquid wets a solid surface. In recent years uniform electric fields have been used to control and manipulate droplets of conducting (ion containing) liquids, typically a salt solution, by using the liquid-solid contact area as one electrode in a capacitive structure - so called electrowetting. This has led to new voltage controlled variable focus liquid lenses, liquid-based electronic paper and droplet-based microfluidic systems. The key to electrowetting is the ability of an applied voltage to reversibly increase the effective hydrophilicity of a solid surface and reduce the contact angle of the droplet without altering the surface chemistry. However, many liquids of interest are not conducting and the need for a sandwich-style capacitive structure and direct physical contact to the liquid limits its range of applicability.\n\nIn this project we create a new method of controlling hydrophilicity and oleophilicity of materials by using the dielectric properties of liquids, but with the effects localized to an interface. Unllike electrowetting which focuses on the ions, our method focuses on the dipoles in a liquid. Using a non-uniform electric field generates unequal forces on the two ends of the dipole. The resulting dielectrophoretic force can result in movement and redistribution of the liquid into the areas of highest field gradient. The basis of our project is the understanding that when the liquid has solid-liquid, liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid interfaces, dielectric energy changes can be coupled to surface free energy changes. With a suitable decaying electric field, the effects of liquid dielectrophoresis can be confined to either the solid-liquid interface or to the liquid-vapor (or liquid-liquid) interface and can be used with a non-conducting liquid.\n\nBy using microfabricated interdigitated electrodes a decaying, and hence non uniform, electric field can be created above a solid surface. For a droplet thicker than the decay length of the electric field, the major change of the surface energy compensating liquid dielectrophoretic energy changes is via a change in the contact area with a solid and so this can be a method of reversibly controlling the contact angle and, hence, the hydro- and oleo- philicity of a surface. For a thin liquid film the major change of the surface energy compensating liquid dielectrophoretic energy changes is via a change in the shape of the liquid-vapor (or liquid-liquid) interface and so, in this case, it becomes a method for shaping a liquid surface. \n\nIn this method of localizing the effects of liquid dielectrophoresis to an interface the contrast to electrowetting is that,\n\n1. the electric fields are non-uniform;\n2. the electric fields are generated by surface microfabricated co-planar rather than sandwich electrode structures;\n3. the forces act upon the dipoles in the liquids, which can therefore be non-conducting (or conducting), rather than upon ions of conducting liquids;\n4. the method does not suffer from saturation of the contact angle and so can be used to produce liquid films. \n\nThe research in this project seeks to establish an approach to wetting that allows conducting and non-conducting liquids to be manipulated using electric fields in a manner complementary to electrowetting. The project will provide the understanding needed to allow future development of novel droplet microfluidic, liquid microactuation, liquid-based optics and displays. The project includes industrial partners who have expertise in the development and commercialisation of microfluidic liquid handling, lab-on-chip devices, display devices and optofluidic systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K014803/1","grantId":"EP/K014803/1","fundValue":"280012","fundStart":"2013-07-15","fundEnd":"2016-11-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project is still underway.
