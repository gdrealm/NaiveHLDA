However, this research suggests that a 'market-driving' approach allows firms to develop long term competitive advantage.</p>\n\n<p>A 'market-driving' approach is based upon proactively addressing the existing market conditions. It is an ability to develop unique business systems, to reshape the value chain, change the norms and behaviour of the market actors and to educate customers. On the contrary, the 'market-driven' approach of simply responding to the market can be more easily copied by other firms. </p>\n\n<p>The management literature has not yet offered a framework that discusses the preconditions for succeeding with the 'market-driving' approach and whether or under what circumstances the 'market-driving' strategy actually leads to a better market performance. </p>\n\n<p>This research suggests that certain internal capabilities and external networks are critical parts of the 'market-driving' approach. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to develop and test a conceptual framework for the 'market-driving' approach and carry out a quantitative survey to test the framework. Structural equations modelling and partial least square methodology will be employed to empirically test the framework and draw conclusions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2690","grantId":"RES-062-23-2690","fundValue":"357152","fundStart":"2011-02-07","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have discovered that firms that are more market driving, that is, more capable of changing consumer, competitor, supplier, and societal behaviors and attitudes, perform better in foreign markets. In particular, these firms exhibit certain capabilities that lead them to be more market driving, such as networking capability, business configuration capability, branding capability, and learning capability. We have disseminated our findings to both academic and pratitioners through conferences as well as by forward findings to participating European firms.

However, the international marketing field has propounded adapting to local markets and this is also the strategy that firms believe they should adopt. The findings of the research project shows that adaptation does not have be prioritized and that through market driving behavior, it is possible to reap benefits from influencing the attitudes and behavior of the foreign market. The research also develops an in-depth understanding of the antecedents to the development of market driving strategy in global firms. Most of the existing literature focuses on describing what market driving strategy consists of. We identified networking, configuration, learning, and branding capabilities as essential to enhancing market driving behaviour. Furthermore, we show that market driving behavior can develop resource inimitability and non-substitutability in foreign markets and ultimately lead to better performance. The findings can be used by firms entering foreign markets. The findings show that rather than simply adapting to the market, the strategy can be to influence the market. In this way, firms can better capitalize on a global strategy.
