This project blends political with social and cultural history and aims to broaden the subject matter of political history and assess it in terms of Britons' identities, new social movements, pressure groups and everyday life. Thus it explores how politics interacted with consumerism, TV and cultural life in a Britain that was increasingly affluent after rationing ended in 1954 and in terms of both social attitudes (permissiveness, the erosion of deference) and content (pop music, the counter-culture) underwent rapid cultural change in the 1960s. As such the project interrogates the category and shifting meaning of 'the political' itself.Context: Informed by the concept of political culture, the project focuses on the status (i.e. its reputation, language) of politics, the relationship between formal political discourses and its popular reception - the character and meaning of politics more than policy or electoral fortunes. To achieve this it utilizes a range of archival sources. Secondly, such approaches have figured little in historical work on this period, so this research will generate novel reinterpretations of British political history. Finally, this period of growing popular spending power, diversifying values and cultural life and expansion of the mass media (especially television) created a more diverse political culture and demands a more sophisticated historical approach to understanding it.To undertake this, the project looks at groups and initiatives that linked popular and elite politics and interrelated politics and key areas of social changes. These are: i) Consumerism (2 chapters): the Consumers' Association (publishers of 'Which?' magazine) founded by Michael Young in 1957 and the Co-Operative movement, illustrate the impact of consumerism. The CA was a product testing body and pressure group that grew rapidly attempting to inform consumer choice. The Co-op had a more traditional consumer politics of necessity and struggled in the new environment. Consumption and choice posed a new agenda for politics previously concerned with production and needs and with pointers to a future 'market politics'. ii) Culture (3 chapters): the social life of the Young Conservatives and the 1962 Festival of Labour allow discussion of how party politics engaged with and attempted to inform cultural and leisure life and attempted to establish a presence in such spheres of civil society. Together with playwright Arnold Wesker's Centre Fortytwo project (to brings arts and culture to 'the people'), Mary Whitehouse's National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (aiming to 'clean-up TV') and the Labour government's creation of a Minister of Arts / questions of culture taste and morality were on the political agenda increasingly. iii) Communication (1 chapter): Whitehouse's campaigns showed TV was at the heart of political debate, but it was also a key technology for communicating politics itself. The project addresses how parties used new forms and how experts in advertising and PR viewed politics. It also explores more traditional forms like street protest, that were reinvented in the 1960s. The study will be introduced by detailing the historiographical issues above and by an interdisciplinary and comparative account of how contemporary writers analysed Britain's political culture. A concluding chapter will interpret whether Britain's was an increasingly apolitical culture or whether historians need a more inclusive definition of 'the political'.Aims: To finish writing a book - working title Political Boundaries. In addition it will produce other publications and conference papers.Applications and Benefits: Besides a contribution to debates in this field, the book will be of use and interest to those teaching and studying the political and social/cultural history of this period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D000092/1","grantId":"AH/D000092/1","fundValue":"14213","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lawrence  Black","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
