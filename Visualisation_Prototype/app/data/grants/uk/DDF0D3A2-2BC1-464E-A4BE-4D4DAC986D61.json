{"id":"DDF0D3A2-2BC1-464E-A4BE-4D4DAC986D61","title":"Relating harmful phytoplankton to shellfish toxicity and human health","abstractText":"Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food chain. Most phytoplankton are benign and indeed positively benefitial to the health of the environment. However, a minority of phytoplantkon are harmful to humans, the environment or the economy as a result of their prouction of toxic substances. These phytoplankton are often called harmful algal blooms or HABs. Toxic phytoplankton may be ingested by filter feeding shellfish that are not themselves harmed but which accumulate and concentrate the toxin in their tissue. If the shellfish are them eaten by humans potentially serious illness may occur. Monitoring programs of phytoplankton and shellfish flesh act as a means of minimising the heath risk to humans of shellfish consumption. Hwever, through factors that are not fully understood harmful phytoplankton and theor toxins are perceived to be on the increase in UK waters. Hence, it is necessary to better understand to factors that influence toxin production its vectoring by shellfish and the public health implications of shellfish toxicity. Research in this field in the UK is relatively underdeveloped and fragmented with little or no colllaboration between environmental and biomedical scientists. In this proposal we intend to hold a research workshop to integrate scientists, regulators, monitoring agencies and industry representatives with expertise in hamful phytoplankton and their effects. The worshop will allow the interdisciplinary sharing of knowledge and ideas and allow the hypothesis to be formulated for future environmental/biomedical colloborative projects. The production of a report will allow us to disseminate more widely the knowledge gained during the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E00878X/1","grantId":"NE/E00878X/1","fundValue":"28006","fundStart":"2007-03-31","fundEnd":"2008-03-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This project funded a collaborative workshop that brought together UK and international experts in the field of harmful algae.\nThe workshop has generated a number of subsequent successful grant applications and research publications Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Keith  Davidson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Scottish Association For Marine Science","findingsText":" This grant was a capacity building workshop that brought together scientists and industry representatives from the UK and abroad to discuss the issue of harmful algal blooms and their impact on human health and aquaculture.\nThe event was very successful generating a number of new research collaborations and areas of research that have subsequently received funding.\nThe workshop generated:\n1) An improved understanding of the factors that at govern harmful algal blooms (HABs), shellfish poisoning and human heath in UK waters.\n2) Better integration of research effort across the sector\n3) Increased knowledge suitable to provide advice to regulatory bodies to allow for better protection of human health. The grant was capacity building in nature.
