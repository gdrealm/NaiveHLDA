It is industrially converted on an immense scale for use in a variety of nitrogen containing materials, particularly in fertilizers that ensure there is sufficient global food production to support the ever growing population. The current industrial method, the Haber Bosch process, operates under intense gas pressure (150 to 350 atmospheres), at raised temperatures (350 to 550 C), and requires hydrogen (currently produced from hydrocarbon sources) to transform nitrogen into the useful precursor compound ammonia. This renders the process incredibly energy (and therefore cost) intensive, consuming ~2 % of the world's energy supply and ~3-5 % of the world's natural gas supply. In stark contrast nature, the synthetic chemist par excellence, performs the same conversion under drastically milder conditions (1 atmosphere pressure and mild temperatures). Mimicking nature's achievement would be a dramatic breakthrough, not only as a stand alone scientific achievement but also in potentially revolutionising the industrial production of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. As such a considerable effort has been expended into elucidating how the metal containing nitrogenase (nitrogen transforming) enzymes achieve this conversion. Recent findings have begun to clarify some aspects of the complex nitrogenase catalyst, particularly the identity of the resting state of this enzyme (the structure when it is not actively converting nitrogen to ammonia). These recent experimental findings combined with computational studies provide insight and inspiration for the synthetic chemist revealing the nitrogenase contains a number of highly unusual features. They also highlight how far from nature's evolved solution humankind's current systems are, perhaps explaining our current dependence on catalysts requiring very severe conditions. The research in this proposal involves the synthesis of new functional model systems that possess the vital (and unusual) features recently identified in the nitrogenase enzymes. The generation of accurate model complexes is a crucial step in elucidating enzyme mechanisms; our simplified model systems will enable the systematic study of crucial parameters that are very difficult to study directly in the very complex enzyme structure. It is imperative to understand these parameters as they are key to the facile transformation of nitrogen. Studies of this nature are particularly important for the nitrogenase enzyme as its operating mechanism is experimentally poorly defined, with only the inactive resting state physically characterised. This body of work therefore will afford a fundamental comprehension of the crucial factors required to achieve the fixation and functionalisation of atmospheric nitrogen under mild conditions. If we understand how nitrogen is converted to ammonia by metallo-enzymes then we have taken a giant leap towards being able to achieve our goal of following in nature's footsteps; and ultimately being able to take nitrogen out of the air and readily transform it, under mild conditions, into products essential to every day life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H006990/1","grantId":"EP/H006990/1","fundValue":"101803","fundStart":"2010-01-02","fundEnd":"2011-05-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The impact of this research is currently limited to the academic sector with two publications containing results from this proposal having been cited 49 times in the past 3 years.

The generation of accurate model complexes is a crucial step in elucidating enzyme mechanisms; and our simplified model systems were chosen to enable the systematic study of crucial parameters that are impossible to study directly. Progress has been made towards all defined objectives (see below). However parts of this project were complicated by the unprecedented weak binding of chelating N-heterocyclic carbenes (termed LIG) to electron rich Fe centres. Despite this we have still uncovered a range of novel chemistry that will inform our future endeavours in this area. This grant was funded under the EPSRC first grant scheme (duration 16 months), thus work in this area is still ongoing (carried out by the PI). \n\n\n\nObjectives (A): (i) To synthesise low coordinate Fe(I) species of the general formula [(LIG A)FeX]n (X is halide and n = 1 or 2)\n\nA range of precursor complexes were successfully synthesised, and the factors determining their stability elucidated. Extensive studies into the reduction of these complexes were conducted using a variety of reductants. Ligand dissociation was prevalent on reduction of the Fe centre frustrating attempts to form the target [(LIG)FeX]n compounds. The facile dissociation of chelating N-heterocyclic carbenes from reduced Fe(0) was unprecedented when we started this research, and is the topic of a submitted publication. \n\n\n\n(ii) To study the binding properties of N2 to the family of [(LIG A)FeX]n compounds.\n\nThe reduction of a range of (LIG)FeX2 species in the presence of varying N2 pressures was investigated. Surprisingly given the precedence for N2 binding to low-coordinate and reduced iron centres no evidence for N2 coordinated was observed, this was partly due to the ready dissociation of the chelating N-heterocyclic carbenes from reduced Fe centre. Reduction with stabilising (electron accepting) ligands was successful, and reduced Fe complexes could be isolated, however these stabilising ligands could not then be displaced by N2.\n\n\n\n(iii) To synthesise a sulfide bridged di-iron species, Fe-(u-S)-Fe and investigate its propensity to bind N2.\n\nTerminal (LIG)Fe-SMe and bridging (LIG)Fe-(SMe)-Fe(LIG) complexes were synthesised, and showed no propensity to bind N2, however studies are continuing into their reactivity towards H2 and reductants. Furthermore these electron rich iron thiolate complexes will have application in radical rebound coupling, as they undergo facile activation of sp2-C-X and sp-C-X (X = halogen). Attempts to develop the chemistry of sulfido bridged Fe species were frustrated by the lack of suitable single crystals for the unambiguous characterisation of these paramagnetic species. \n\n\n\nObjectives (B): (i) to develop a system capable of chemically reducing N2 coordinated to a formally Fe(I) centre (ii) to synthesise low coordinate Fe(I) hydrides \n\nThe formation of Fe-Hydride moieties was investigated in depth and found to be complicated by; a) rapid reductive elimination of H2 on installation of two hydrides onto (LIG)Fe, leading to a reduced Fe(0) complex that underwent rapid ligand dissociation. b) attempts to install a single hydride moiety were frustrated by disproportionation that led to formation of the dihydride species which was unstable with respect H2 loss and ligand dissociation. Monohydride {(LIG)FeH} species could be successfully synthesised and isolated using a stabilising 'place holder' ligand (an arene). The [{LIG}FeH(eta6-arene)] species were not useful for binding of N2, as the arene is not displaced by addition of N2, in contrast to previous reports on related complexes. These findings are the topic of a manuscript currently under preparation. \n\n\n\nThe formation of Fe-Hydride moieties was investigated in depth and found to be complicated by; a) rapid reductive elimination of H2 on installation of two hydrides onto (LIG)Fe, leading to a reduced Fe(0) complex that underwent rapid ligand dissociation. b) attempts to install a single hydride moiety were frustrated by disproportionation that led to formation of the dihydride species which was unstable with respect H2 loss and ligand dissociation.

Results from this work have helped to guide / inform further studies in the topical area of Fe-NHC chemistry. For example, one paper reporting original research stemming from this proposal published in 2011 has received 33 citations in the past 3 years. This clearly demonstrates that the knowledge developed in this proposal has been effectively disseminated and has been useful to the wider chemical community. Chemicals,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
