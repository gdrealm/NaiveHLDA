This will help us to understand how these networks grow and develop over time. This requires us to understand how travellers and land developers use these networks, both in conducting travel, and in developing the land. This research will build a theoretical and empirical model, using information and data collected in the UK, that will allow us to forecast this growth in the UK. This will then allow us to improve the way in which the government makes decisions on transport network and land use development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004403/1","grantId":"ES/D004403/1","fundValue":"77329","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert B Noland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
