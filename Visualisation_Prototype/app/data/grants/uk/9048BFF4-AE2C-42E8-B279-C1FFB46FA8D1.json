{"id":"9048BFF4-AE2C-42E8-B279-C1FFB46FA8D1","title":"The Czechoslovak Experiment, 1918-1992","abstractText":"This book will provide a history of the Czechoslovak state from its creation at the end of the First World War until its dissolution on l January I 993. It will be written simply, for the general reader; but should also interest specialists, since it will use Czech and Slovak archival material (including the entire post-war Czechoslovak secret police archive) which has not been consulted before, and which points to radical reinterpretations of even such well-known topics as the Munich Crisis and Prague Spring. Drawing on a wide range of sources, the book will seek to avoid Czech-centeredness, balancing the often sharply differing perceptions of the peoples who made up Czechoslovakia. As a close study of a state which, although it lasted only 74 years, experienced democracy, fascism and communism, The Czechoslovak Experiment, 1918-1992 should offer a valuable corrective to the great-power perspectives which underpin current interpretations of twentieth-century Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501040/1","grantId":"AH/D501040/1","fundValue":"27257","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Heimann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
