{"id":"C7A69312-BDC8-4BD4-ACBD-3764D30D4214","title":"Solving the Problem of Attrition in Longitudinal surveys","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this collaborative project is to improve understanding of, and find optimum solutions to, the problem of ‘attrition’ in longitudinal surveys”, seeking to update and extend to longitudinal enquiry, the theoretical framework for cross-sectional survey non-response developed in the US by Robert Groves and others. The further practical aim is to develop and test improved strategy for increasing cooperation and reducing drop-out in longitudinal surveys.</p>\n\n<p>The project begins with secondary analysis to identify predictors of attrition in three longitudinal survey programmes: British Household Panel Study; 1958 &amp; 1970 Birth Cohort Studies; Family &amp; Children Survey. In the light of the results, Groves’ theory will be re-formulated for longitudinal surveys and hypotheses specified predicting the changes in field work procedure that will reduce attrition. The implementation of new strategy will then be tested experimentally against standard practice through the vehicle of the National Centre for Social Research ‘Omnibus’ Survey based on independent samples of 1,500 respondents (six per year) one of which will be followed up one year later. The results of the experiment and the conclusions drawn for theory will be disseminated widely to academic and survey constituencies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-175-25-0011","grantId":"RES-175-25-0011","fundValue":"304550","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Morgan Bynner","coPersons":["Gabriele B.
