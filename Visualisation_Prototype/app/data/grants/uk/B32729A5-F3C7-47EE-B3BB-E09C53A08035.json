The purpose of this visit is to foster collaborations between Brunel University and TITech and to experience and learn from the academic research ethos, the organisational culture, the culture of interdisciplinary research work in Japanese universities, the methods of integration of research between university and the industry in Japan and the research directions of the host. In agreement with Prof. Furui, the proposed research work, for this visit, will focus on parts of a current research project on comparative analysis of the various methods of integration of speech recognition and synthesis models for packet-loss concealment in voice over IP (VOIP) and WIFI phone networks. The work conduced at TITech will include Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) architecture for estimation/prediction of lost speech frames and the evaluation of the interpolation algorithms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G039453/1","grantId":"EP/G039453/1","fundValue":"27292","fundStart":"2009-01-18","fundEnd":"2009-04-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Saeed  Vaseghi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
