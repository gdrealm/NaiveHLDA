{"id":"49311CB6-05B9-409F-8BAE-EF65D4887F8A","title":"Investigations of particles, quantum fields and extended objects","abstractText":"We are interested in what is happening to the smallest bits of matter, how\nthey interact with each other, what a force really is, and how all of this\nfits into what we observe around us in the universe. We have a very good\ntheory that describes all this for many of the particles and interactions\n(quantum field theory). By and large, the\nmeasurements line up with the predictions and this is a significant scientific\nachievement. However, there are large holes in our knowledge and this leaves\noppurtunity for work by our research group.\n\nFor instance, in the centre of atoms lies the nucleus. The nucleus is strongly\nbound, which means that we don't know how to calculate anything analytically\n(with a pen and paper) using the standard techniques. \nOur research has found a clever way of mathematically modelling the nucleus\nusing analytic techniques: the Skyrme model. Now, we can describe all nuclei\nfrom atomic number 1 to 108 using this model. We shall be exploring the\nmathematics behind this in more detail: it has a connection to gravitational\ntheories and string theories (mathematical theories that model particles as\ntiny quantum loops). \n\nThere are also other particles other than nuclei which\nare strongly bound, such as B-mesons. \nFor these, sophisticated computer programs must be\nbuilt which break space and time up into a grid of points, and the quantum\nfluctuations of the sub-nuclear interactions are simulated using random\nnumbers on this lattice. Analytic calculations must be done to match the\nnumbers obtained on the computer to experimental data. We shall develop these\ncalculations, and perform new ones so that data can be used to extract the\nlevel to which various quarks (for example, the up quark and the b-quark)\nmix. This helps provide an accurate description of an unexplained phenomenon:\nhow the funny pattern of quark mixing comes about. These calculations also\nhelp the extraction of the difference between matter and anti-matter from\nexperimental data. \n\nString theory is an extraordinarily mathematically rich structure, that\npurports to describe gravity. One variant of it may also even underlie all of\nthe interactions between particles that are observed in nature. The tiny loops\nbehave like particles unless one probes them at energies that are far too high\nfor us to reach in current experiments. Some of our research examines the rich\nstructure behind the mathematics of these theories: it turns out that\nscattering two particles and scattering three particles have strict relations\nbetween the interaction probabilities. Sometimes, truths such as these are\neasier understood by mapping one string theory to another one, which has a\ndifferent coupling strength and a different number of space-time\ndimensions. These &quot;dualities&quot; help us winkle out truths and\ndeep connections in string theory. We shall be investigating their role in the\nrelations between interaction probabilities. \n\nThe LHC will start up again after the shut-down around 2015 with double the\nenergy that it had in 2012. This means that if supersymmetry keeps the higgs\nlight (this is the main motivation for the kind of supersymmetry that the LHC\ncan discover), the LHC should discover supersymmetric particles in the first\nyear of running. Even if this idea of supersymmetry is not present in nature,\nsome other particles or interactions should be responsible for cancelling the\nquantum fluctuations (a seething random mass of particles popping in and out\nof existence) which tend to make the Higgs mass some 10^15 times heavier than\nhas just been observed at the LHC. These particles should also be discovered\nsoon. We shall be interpreting the data, and discriminating various models by\ncomparing their predictions to any signals that the LHC sees. We should be\nable to work out which theories are ruled out, and which are favoured.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000385/1","grantId":"ST/L000385/1","fundValue":"1084880","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin Christopher Allanach","coPersons":["Malcolm John  Perry","Nick  Dorey","Matthew Bowen Wingate","Fernando  Quevedo","Paul Kingsley Townsend","Ronald  Horgan","Nicholas Stephen  Manton","Ben Matthew Gripaios","David  Skinner","David  Tong","A C  Davis","Maciej  Dunajski"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
