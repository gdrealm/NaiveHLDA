{"id":"A6C08FEE-A24F-4263-8377-A3F9553A5FD3","title":"FAITH: Building Trust Between Citizens, Local Authorities and Contractors","abstractText":"Faith is often described as being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. In this project we aim to develop innovative trusted digital services that will enable citizens, local authorities and contractors to have the faith in each other and the systems they use in order to work in partnership to maintain the UK's transport infrastructure more efficiently. At present maintaining the UK's transport infrastructure is an opaque process with potential distrust between the stakeholders. For example, members of the public can report defects on the roads but there is rarely any way for them to monitor the progress of repairs and road users are often left wondering what repairs are being carried out and why. Local authorities often feel the need to visit reported defects before logging them as faults and then to revisit the defects after they have been repaired to check on the work. This lack of transparency of the process and the desire to continually inspect work has major cost implications - we believe the project can deliver substantial savings to Local Authorities and contractors. The project includes a multidisciplinary team of social scientists, ICT specialists and end-users to explore the use of digital technologies to support trust between citizens, local authorities and contractors. In particular we will combine recent advances in pervasive computing with new trust models based on those found in social networking scenarios to deliver an innovative set of trusted digital services to facilitate more effective delivery of contracted services to Local Authorities and the general public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I002537/1","grantId":"TS/I002537/1","fundValue":"306824","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Technologies developed as part of this project have been trialled as part of a highways maintenance operation focused on cleaning gullies (drains). Our industrial collaborators report that significant efficiencies can be achieved and estimate these as up to a 35% save per annum, so the current estimate of 70 million GBP UK annual spend on gully cleaning represents a saving of 24.5 Million GBP that could be realised if the system was adopted throughout the UK.\n\nBeneficiaries: Councils\n\nContribution Method: The system being trialled is based on the output of the Faith project. In particular, the project has helped develop the trusted data feeds that underpin this new type of Gully cleaning operation.

Through the design and evaluation of such systems we have developed a extensive understanding of trust in the context of highways maintenance, and have further developed new models of trust that are now being realised in commercial products for the highways maintenance industry. Industrial partners are now leveraging outputs from the project to provide innovative products within the highways maintenance domain that support new working practice that helps build trust between key stakeholders and deliver new operational efficiencies.
