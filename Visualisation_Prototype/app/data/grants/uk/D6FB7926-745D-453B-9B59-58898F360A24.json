The distinctive features of the qualities of the programme include the cross-fertilization between community archaeology and community history; the long run of expertise offered by academics involved from Roman times to the present; the combination of a regional focus with wider connections beyond the region; and the depth of experience working with community groups offered by senior and early career researchers in the team.\nThe programme will benefit from strong institutional support from the UoN including the Centre for Advanced Studies, the University Museum and the Community Partnerships team. It will also draw on the UoN's non-HEI partners including Nottingham City Museums and Galleries, Nottinghamshire Archives, Durban House (Broxtowe Borough Council), National Trust, Norfolk Museum Service, Derbyshire VCH Trust, Southwell Town Council, and York Archaeological Trust/Trent &amp; Peak Archaeology.\nThe proposed programme will be delivered by a team of academics involved in a portfolio of flagship projects involving community-based research in local history and archaeology. These include: \n1. Caistor Roman Town project, running since 2008 (Bowden): volunteer groups undertake large sections of the project's archaeological field work and finds processing.\n2. Southwell archaeology project: established in 2011 (King, Bowden and others), co-designed with Southwell Community Archaeology Group; distinctive for its use of the town and environs as a laboratory for examining settlement in the context of the written record.\n3. Southwell Workhouse (Badcock, Carter, Newman) collaboration between UoN and National Trust established 2011: current project includes work with volunteers in Southwell Workhouse Research Group collating data on Poor Law history from 19c newspapers.\n4. Victoria County History Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire (Riden): local groups (three in Derbyshire, one in Notts) work with guidance and support of tutor on source material for their chosen parish and co-draft text suitable for publication on the VCH website.\n5. Coalmining heritage (Amos): new project with Bilsthorpe heritage society and other ex-miners' groups seeks to document the 'end of an industry' and its impact on mining communities.\n6. Raleigh and Player's projects (Gaunt, Harvey): ongoing projects involving former workforces of Nottingham manufacturers that have shut down or drastically cut production.\nBuilding on these projects, the content of the activities taking place between February and November 2012 will entail:\ni) Project team liaison with HLF representative and NCCPE\nii) Launch events targeting UoN academics, raising profile of existing projects and demonstrating benefits of community research partnerships\niii) Incentivizing additional activities through the Challenge Fund as a resource for UoN academics to pitch ideas for projects involving existing community groups that could extend existing research and co-design HLF grants: up to &pound;500 per project\niv) Roadshow events on 'Writing Our History' and 'Digging Our Past' including workshop, training and taster sessions to enable volunteers to present work and acquire new skills, attract new recruits, and broker new links between academics and volunteers\nv) Showcase and Project development day where Challenge Fund pilot projects presented and HLF bids mentored\nvi) Follow-up workshops for HLF-funded and unfunded projects looking to future plans.\nThe benefits of the programme will be the enhancement of existing community-based research, the fostering of new community groups and the co-design of research bids for HLF funding. In the longer term, the programme will build new capacity for academic engagement with volunteer researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J01348X/1","grantId":"AH/J01348X/1","fundValue":"19784","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It was in the nature of this Phase 1 project that we were not conducting research ourselves so much as fostering the research activities undertaken by volunteer history and archaeology groups and supporting their efforts to secure Heritage Lottery Funding awards. In that sense, it is not so much our research findings that have been used as our insights into the process involved in creating working relationships between academics and community groups involved in historical and archaeological projects and designing appropriate 'offers' in the form of events and training for such groups. What we learned about this informed the Phase 2 follow-on project involving funded All Our Stories project groups and the co-production projects that also followed on from Phase 1. \nFrom the start of the Phase 1 project we fed back our experiences to the Heritage Lottery Fund, to the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) and to the AHRC itself (by attending the Summit in July 2012 in Manchester). In addition, we contributed to the AHRC Research for Community Heritage Case-Study produced in 2013 (see report on Phase 2 of Writing Our History, Digging Our Past by Dr Richard Gaunt) and hope that in this way we will have contributed to ongoing reflections on the Connected Communities programme and funding policy.

The project of which I was PI represented the first phase of the project; Dr Richard Gaunt was PI on the second phase. In Phase 1, I worked with a team of academics in the School of Humanities who developed existing research collaborations with local heritage partners and community groups. We encouraged these groups to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the partnership between AHRC and Heritage Lottery Fund 'All Our Stories' scheme and acted as advisers on their HLF applications. By earmarking ?5000 of the original project grant for a 'Challenge Fund' to which groups could apply to enhance their activities and develop their plans, we enabled groups to enlarge their volunteer base and acquire new skills, particularly in relation to the use of digital technology to record and disseminate the groups' findings. In addition, we ran open days and workshops to enable new groups to come forward with proposals for 'All Our Stories' projects. By the end of Phase 1 of the project, we had createed a framework to work with successful projects holding HLF All Our Stories awards. Having forged contacts with fifteen East Midlands-based groups holding All Our Stories awards, we then went on to apply for Phase 2 of the funding. We gained a number of insights in the course of Phase 1 of the project which were taken up and developed in Phase 2 of the project (PI Dr Richard Gaunt) and in other follow-on projects 'Trade and Traffic on the River Trent and Associated Waterways, 1850-1970' (PI Gaunt) and 'The Social World of Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces (PI Prof J Beckett).\nThe first was the demand and interest on the part of voluntary heritage and history groups for practical training and assistance in digital technology: this accordingly became a very high priority in planning Phase 2 training activities.\nThe second was the importance of enabling voluntary groups to meet with each other so that different groups can pass on their knowledge, contacts and experience.\nThirdly, we found that projects greatly appreciated the 'service' we were able to provide, for instance the opportunity to present their work in the form of professionally-produced posters, created with the assistance of the Digital Humanities Centre.\nFourthly and finally, we learned that although volunteer heritage and history groups may differ in their approach and goals from academic researchers, moving towards co-design and co-production of research is possible if they build on established contacts and relationships.
