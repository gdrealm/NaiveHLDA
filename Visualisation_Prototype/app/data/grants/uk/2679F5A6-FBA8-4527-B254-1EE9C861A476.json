Theology of religions is currently defined in terms of how: Christian theology relates to and assesses other religions; whether non-Christians are 'saved'; and whether other religions can be a means of salvation despite the claim that salvation is through Jesus Christ alone; and by attention to a number of other questions. \\n\\nIn the first chapter I want to argue that world 'religions' have been problematically seen in a unitary fashion as if they were clear analogues to 'Christianity'. This cultural production of religion started in the seventeenth century and has skewed the radical difference and otherness of non-Christian beliefs and practices. I argue for a more theological definition of 'religion' that relies neither on seeing the 'other' as if they were a mirror image of 'Christianity' (distorted or otherwise); or on assessing the other in Christian terms. This allows for a new form of contextualised and specific engagement with the cultural and political phenomenon of a religion in a particular time and place which forgoes any overall general theology of religions. \\n\\nIn the second chapter I isolate key social and political, rather than theological, factors that have shaped the theological debate in Europe and the United States since the nineteenth century. I examine the influences of colonialism, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, secularism and capitalism to show how these factors have actually dictated various theological positions. I argue that this situation in which non-theological considerations dictate theological positions requires remedy, without in any way insulating theology from history and other disciplines.\\n\\nIn the third chapter I examine the vexed question as to whether non-Christians are saved or not. I want to show how this debate has been reliant on a particular model of mapping out positions in the theology of religions utilised since the mid nineteenth century which has unduly shaped the question into an either/or choice. I criticise this model and argue that this issue is not a question that can or should be answered for theological reasons and that this question should be removed from the disputed questions in this field. \\n\\nIn the fourth chapter, I turn to the question of whether in principle a non-Christian religions can be the means of salvation. This particular question has received much attention in the reaction to Jacques Dupuis book, so I outline the arguments on both sides of the Dupuis debate. I want to suggest that a resolution to this central debate can be reached through utilising the technical distinction between a sacrament and a quasi-sacrament (in effect the former being an objective effacious saving act, regardless of the respondent's disposition or the giver's disposition; and the latter being dependent on both the giver and the respondent for its effacious nature). I shall argue that other religion can be quasi-sacramental in principle, although the question of whether they are in practice is entirely another matter. They cannot be sacramental in principle or practice. \\n\\nIn the final chapter I turn to the recent debate about the social and political 'clash of civilizations' (Samuel Huntington) and the importance of democracy to negotiate religious differences (Jeffrey Stout). I shall be arguing that both thinker's over-value democracy and its historical role in religious civilisations and show how careful and reasoned argument between and within traditions can be pursued without the social necessity of democracy. I am not concerned to advance an anti-democratic position as such, but to question whether democracy is a 'sacred cow'. This chapter is also an attempt to show how theological reasoning is central to determining social and political considerations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F00379X/1","grantId":"AH/F00379X/1","fundValue":"29205","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  D'Costa","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
