We are using the zebrafish embryo as a model system for the analysis of genetic disorders of the inner ear. The zebrafish inner ear is similar in both structure and function to that in humans. Inner ear defects can be observed directly in the living organism, even though the ear is an internal organ, because the zebrafish embryo is transparent.\nWe will concentrate on the formation of the endolymphatic duct, a structure thought to be critical for the regulation of fluid balance in the inner ear. We have identified several strains of zebrafish in which the embryo develops with defects in endolymphatic duct formation. Preliminary observations indicate that there are distinct similarities to human diseases; fluid pressure builds up in the ear, causing it to swell.\nThese studies will lead (a) to the identification of genes with important functions in early inner ear development, and (b) to an understanding of how each gene - and ultimately its counterpart in the human - contributes to normal inner ear formation and functioning, and how, when defective, leads to deafness and balance problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300196","grantId":"G0300196","fundValue":"568810","fundStart":"2004-07-19","fundEnd":"2010-01-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanya T Whitfield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
