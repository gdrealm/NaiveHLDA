This is particularly truefor two of the most challenging application areas facing thescientific community: (i) the analysis and control ofcommunication networks and (ii) the analysis of biologicalnetworks. To successfully solve the problems in these areas,strong interaction is required between different scientificcommunities. Interdisciplinarity is the key to understand complexnetworks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03356X/1","grantId":"EP/D03356X/1","fundValue":"19427","fundStart":"2006-07-03","fundEnd":"2006-08-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John Hogan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
