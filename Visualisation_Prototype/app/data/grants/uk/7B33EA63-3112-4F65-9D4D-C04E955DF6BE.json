{"id":"7B33EA63-3112-4F65-9D4D-C04E955DF6BE","title":"SensoPellet: A new tool to investigate signalling and motility in the lower digestive tract","abstractText":"Chronic constipation and faecal incontinence are prevalent in the elderly and often lead to social isolation. Little is known regarding why these conditions occur with age; however they have been classified as functional bowel disorders. Signalling molecules such as serotonin regulate the motility of the bowel, and therefore investigating alterations in these signalling molecules may help our understanding of these disorders. In this proposed project we aim to develop a new medical device, known as the SensoPellet, which is a sensor based device moulded into the shape of a faecal pellet. This device will be used to understand the process of normal defecation. The device will consist of carbon composite electrodes encased in a cavity moulded into the shape of a faecal pellet. This device will be characterised for its suitability for conducting stable biological recordings in colonic tissue. Biological recordings will allow the means to simultaneously monitor serotonin levels and image the motion of the pellet to understand the process of terminal bowel motility. The ability of the device to help us elucidate the process of normal defecation is important to understand what changes occur during the onset of age related disorders or how colonic motility is altered by various therapeutic agents utilised at present.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J000175/1","grantId":"EP/J000175/1","fundValue":"98989","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bhavik Anil Patel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":" Within this project the major aim was to develop a sensor based device that could be used to monitor signalling molecules in the colon during motility. During this study we were able to fully manufacture the components of the device using novel carbon based materials to act as the sensor. We housed the sensor into a polymer based cavity that was shaped as an artificial faecal pellet thus would be suitable for biological assays. Various successful prototypes were developed and characterised. The device showed fit for purpose sensitivity, stability and reproducibility for biological measurements. Simultaneous recordings of faecal pellet motility and monitoring of signalling molecules were carried out to study if the device could function in the isolated colon. The device was able to show important functional knowledge about the relationship between motility and signalling and thus will provide key insight into how the bowel functions and how it may be targeted for drug treatment in the future. This research will highlight key important insight into how colonic motility and signalling are linked and thus would be important to the healthcare service and the pharmaceutical industry. We also will use this device to enhance pharmacological teaching of colonic motility and thus could provide a niche in new teaching approaches. This research will lead to various peer reviewed publications that showcase the novel engineering of the materials used to make the device and also the final device itself. The final product is also subject to patent. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
