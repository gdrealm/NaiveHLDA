Normal bowel function and defecaetion depend upon a combination of voluntary and involuntary actions of the muscles regulating bowel function. These processes, in turn, depend upon the structural integrity and the normal molecular and physiological properties of the complex system of nerves, muscles and secretory cells that together make up this part of the digestive tract. Many cells and tissues are known to undergo structural and molecular changes during ageing that result in changes to their functional properties. Little is known however, of the changes that occur in the cells of the terminal bowel during ageing. The aim of the proposed project is therefore to use a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together expertise from four academics, to fully characterise the physiological, molecular and structural age-associated changes in the cells of the terminal colon, rectum and anal sphincters. The work will be performed in mice, for a number of reasons; mice have a life-span amenable to studies on ageing; many of the variables associated with studies on humans can be avoided; mouse gastrointestinal physiology is well-understood and readily analysed and in future, research based on the data obtained from this project will be able to employ the powerful tool of mouse genetics to further analyse the changes that occur in ageing terminal bowel. The results of this work will allow more effective therapies for the treatment of age-associated incontinence and faecal impaction to be developed","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G015988/1","grantId":"BB/G015988/1","fundValue":"357096","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Jill Saffrey","coPersons":["Richard Nicholas Ranson"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":" Consitpation, faecal impaction and incontinence are common disorders among the elderly population. This project analysed age-related changes in the cells in the mouse terminal bowel, in order to gain an understanding of how cellular changes might contribute to bowel dysfunction.\n\nWe have analysed changes in the nerve cells and fibres that regulate the contraction of the muscle that moves gut contents along the bowel, and also defaecation. We have also studied changes in two other cell types, that play a role in the regulation of the function of the gut, these are known as Interstitial cells and enteroendocrine cells.\n\nWe found that the number of different types of nerve cells is maintained in the ageing mouse colon, but some nerve cells displayed markers of cellular senescence and some degenerative changes were observed in nerve cells and in nerve fibres. \n\nThe density of some types of nerve fibres was reduced in the internal anal sphincter muscle of ageing animals, but other types were unaffected. There was also a reduction in the density of Interstitial cells in both the ano-rectum and colon of the ageing gut. \n\nChanges in the patterns of defaecation and physiological properties of the terminal bowel of these ageing mice was also measured. Thus the cellular changes detected may have contributed to the observed functional changes, and suggest further areas for future study and provide a basis for development of possible therapeutic strategies. Possible use in public awareness of conditions associated with ageing These results could form the basis for future work on development of therapies to alleviate terminal bowel dysfunction in the elderly.
