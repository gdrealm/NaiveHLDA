{"id":"486260CE-2A04-4847-B98F-D3CC849FC418","title":"Low viscosity wheat for improved properties for fermentation and animal feed","abstractText":"Iin BBSRC Project BB/F014295/1 we identified genes whcih are responsible for determing the soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) content and extract viscosity of wheat grain. Using a GM approach to suppress the action of these genes, we produced wheat plants where NSP content and extract viscosity was lowered by 70-80%. This low-viscosity property would be highly desirable in wheat varieties for whisky and animal feed uses, however a GM approach is not possible due to regulatory costs and consummer resistance. Here we intend to start developing a low-viscosity wheat using the non-GM approach of TILLING to find versions of these genes (alleles) which are inactive. By the project end, we will have identified such alleles for all the target genes and established whether they confer the low-viscosity property and check that there are no adverse effects. Our breeding partner will then begin the process of inroducing these alleles into commercial wheat varieties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K010824/1","grantId":"BB/K010824/1","fundValue":"144811","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-08-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Yes they are being used by Limagrain to try to develop a low viscosity wheat variety.
