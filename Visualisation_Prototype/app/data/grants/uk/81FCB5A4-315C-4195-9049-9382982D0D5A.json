Despite huge advances in understanding how the components of the bacterial cell work, little is known about how they are organised within the living cell, nor how such organisations impact upon the functionality of the cell. Using a method that enables us to visualise single molecules within living cells, we will look in a quantitative way at the dynamics of the cellular components that let the cell survive a stress that damages its membrane. In effect we will be studying the cell in action, and will be able to describe the cell in its pre-stressed state as well as in its adapted state. Gaining an appreciation and understanding of how the cells components are organised for function is important in establishing principles of signaling and the networks of interactions that allow cells to grow and adapt to new environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G00594X/1","grantId":"BB/G00594X/1","fundValue":"523659","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The code developed for the measurement of the stoichiometry of protein complexes in living cells has been adopted by several other labs in the US and UK.

We have found that a stable repressive PspF-PspA complex is located in the nucleoid of an E. coli cell, transiently\ncommunicating with the inner membrane via PspA. We have also established that the PspF as a hexamer stably binds only one of the two psp promoters at a time, suggesting that psp promoters will fire asynchronously. The code for protein complex stoichiometry analysis based on single molecule photobleaching has been used by other labs in the US and UK.
