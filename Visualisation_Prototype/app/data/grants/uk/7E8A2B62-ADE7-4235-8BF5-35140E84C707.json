Part of the problem lies in the market structures and in the poor institutions, policies, and infrastructure serving the agriculture sector.</p>\n\n<p>This research will investigate if and how agricultural market structures and farm constraints affect the development of dynamic food and cash crop sectors and whether these sectors can contribute to economic transformation and poverty reduction in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>The project consists in a number of case studies where each of them has three building blocks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>supply chain</li>\n\n <li>farm constraints and grass-root institutions</li>\n\n <li>poverty impacts. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will provide a mapping of the existing supply chains characterizing the existing market structures and domestic competition policies. At the farm level, the project studies the constraints faced by small holders to increase productivity and break a vicious cycle where low productivity exacerbates vulnerability to poverty. In a series of micro case studies, the project explores how grass-root institutions may help overcome those constraints. Special attention is given to female headed and poor households as often they confront greater barriers to participation in value chains and in nonmarket institutions.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J00894X/1","grantId":"ES/J00894X/1","fundValue":"361311","fundStart":"2012-04-25","fundEnd":"2015-04-24","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicolas Manuel Depetris Chauvin","coPersons":["Guido Gustavo Porto","Yaw  Ansu"],"organisation":"African Ctr for Economic Transformation","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
