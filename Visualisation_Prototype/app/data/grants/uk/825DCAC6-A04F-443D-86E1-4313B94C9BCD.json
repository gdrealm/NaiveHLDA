{"id":"825DCAC6-A04F-443D-86E1-4313B94C9BCD","title":"Laser Loan Pool Facility.","abstractText":"Lasers continue to be essential tools to researchers in a wide range of scientific disciplines and are becoming increasingly important in enabling physical scientists to develop technologies for the benefit of biological and medical science. However, state-of-the-art lasers are often complex and expensive, which often precludes their use in many projects, or limits their availability to test out innovative new ideas. As such, the concept of a laser loan pool was established in 1985 to provide a variety of state-of-the-art commercial laser systems to UK researchers to use at their home institutions, underpinned by technical and scientific support from the Central Laser Facility (CLF). This allows a single investment in laser technology to be accessed by any UK researcher.Researchers apply through a formal peer review process and receive a laser on loan for up to 6 months. All aspects of the laser operation including transport, installation and maintenance are supported by CLF staff. The staff also give advice on all areas of the scientific programme from the application process to experimental detail and laser operation. This application is to secure and enhance the operation of the Laser Loan Pool by the CLF for the next 5 years, working with EPSRC on behalf of the UK research community. It identifies the key areas for continued support such as ultrafast investigations and new opportunities in bioscience. This will ensure a continuation of internationally leading science output, coupled to the essential training that has helped so many researchers and permitted numerous academics to develop their fields and submit successful grant applications.The allocation of lasers will continue to be made by the established peer review process through an independent Facility Access Panel. As recommended by a recent review of the Loan Pool, a new Steering Committee will be established with the specific purpose of guiding the facility on scientific hot topics , timely and appropriate equipment procurement, and its overall strategic direction.This application is supported by 38 UK researchers who give brief examples of the high quality and broad range of science that will be maintained through this programme.The topics cover many EPSRC programme areas including Research for People, Prosperity and the Planet (Health, Defence and Crime Prevention), The Nano World, Human-Centred Systems and Engineering and Science for Sustainability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G03088X/1","grantId":"EP/G03088X/1","fundValue":"2733480","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The EPSRC Laser Loan Pool was established over 25 years ago to provide state-of-the-art lasers to UK academics at their home institutions, for feasibility studies, grant support and training. This grant enabled the STFC's Central Laser Facility to continue to provide this vital support to the UK research community. The funds have enabled the facility to provide in excess of 70 laser loans to UK academics, supported in excess of 20 PhDs and provided training for numerous other staff and researchers. The facility has continued to supply users with state-of-the-art technology along with the necessary knowledge and support required for successful laser operation. In addition it has provided vital support to experiments at both Diamond Light Source and CERN.\n\nThe diverse nature of the research findings is reflected in the wide breadth of publications attached.\n\nAlong with the academic outputs the support the facility has provided has enabled a number of researchers to successfully seek further grant support including Dr J Greenwood (Queen's University Belfast, EP/J007048/1 and RPG-2012-735) and Profs McKenna and Faulkner (University of Oxford, OCIC2). A number of other researchers have also successfully sought local internal funding backed by the outputs from the Loan Pool supported research including Prof J Lawrence (University of Lincoln, 'Laser ignition in gas turbines - Phase 2' and 'Detonation plume analysis') and Drs Volk and Brust (University of Liverpool, 'Novel Photochemical Approach to Cancer Therapy using Gold Nanoparticles').\n\nUnfortunately the Laser Loan Pool's support to the UK research community will cease in 2015 as EPSRC has decided that the facility does not meet the criteria of a national mid-range facility and has had a lower level of usage in recent years.

Unfortunately these activities will cease in 2015 as EPSRC has decided that the Laser Loan Pool does not meet the criteria of a national mid-range facility and has had a lower level of usage in recent years.\n\nDuring this grant the facility continued to supply its users with state-of-the-art technology along with the necessary knowledge and support required for successful laser operation. The facility was also enhanced with numerous new systems including: a supercontinuum laser and ultrafast system suited to research at the life science interface; an ultrafast system ideal for both the engineering/materials and physics communities; and a high energy pulsed laser which appeals to the engineering and materials communities for applications such as laser peening.\n\nResearch supported by the Laser Loan Pool does not fall under one single project as it supports a wide variety of UK academics and their research projects ranging from bioscience to engineering and materials. Thus this summary naturally includes findings from a selection of the numerous researchers supported. Highlights of the research include:\n\nDr Greenwood's (Queen's University Belfast) recent studies on ultrafast (attosecond) dynamics in phenylalanine. This is an extension of previous attosecond science progressing the work from atoms and simple molecules and advancing to more complex and biologically relevant species providing a new benchmark for attosecond science (Science DOI: 10.1126/science.1254061).\n\nDr Mahajan (University of Southampton) demonstrated the potential for CARS imaging to provide rapid label-free cell and tissue-based assays for measuring the effect and response to drug treatment. This technique is similar to Raman where the molecular 'fingerprint' is recorded but is orders of magnitude stronger. This development has both in vivo and in vitro applications (Journal of Biophotonics DOI: 10.1002/jbio.201300110).\n\nProfs Simons and Davis (University of Oxford) continued their research into sugar structures by investigating the anomeric effect. This effect describes the tendency of sugar molecules to take 'unusual' structures by 'preferring' to orientate their bulky electronegative substituents in the more hindered axial position. Whilst the underlying physical origins for this effect are not clear, this had been attributed, by some researchers, to the influence of water and other substances. This study showed that isolated molecules in the gas phase can still adopt the unusual structures, ruling out extraneous effects as the cause. This work suggests that it may be import to examine the reasons for the effect and its potential biological relevance (Nature DOI: 10.1038/nature09693).\n\nDrs Volk and Brusts (University of Liverpool) investigated the potential for initiating cancer cell death by laser radiation of cancer cells containing gold nanoparticles in the cell membrane which lead to cell rupture and death. The low laser intensity used in their research rules out photothermal damage as the cause (Nano Letters DOI: 10.1021/nl103142t).\n\nThe above examples detail only a small fraction of the work supported by the facility and you are referred to the complete list of publications submitted with this report. As examples:\n\nThe research of Profs Simons and Davis into sugar structures could have implications for medicine but will need much additional research (Nature DOI: 10.1038/nature09693).\n\nThe work of Drs Volk and Brust on cancer cell damage (DOI 10.1021/nl103142t) and the CARS imaging within live cells by Dr Mahajan (DOI 10.1002/jbio.201300110) have obvious potential non-academic uses in healthcare.\n\nDr Wu's (University of York) research on ultrafast magnetization of transition metal alloy films has potential future applications in data storage in optical media (eg DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2012.2202313 and DOI 10.1063/1.2713701).\n\nDr Claeyssens' (University of Sheffield) research into the writing of three-dimensional neural tissue using laser induced multi-photon polymerization of polylactide-based materials has applications for neuronal implants (DOI 10.1088/1758-5082/3/4/045005 and DOI 10.1088/1758-5082/4/2/025005).
