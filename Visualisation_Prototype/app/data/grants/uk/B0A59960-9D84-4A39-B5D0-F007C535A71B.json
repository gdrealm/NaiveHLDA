We have identified a master regulator (called a 'transcription factor') that switches the genetic machinery of these useful bacteria to allow them to survive in the presence of toxic molecules called Reactive Oxygen Species (a condition called &quot;oxidative stress&quot;). The aim of this work is to find out exactly how the activity of this master regulator is controlled at the molecular level. We also know that this same master regulator controls resistance to oxidative stress in the pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the bacteria that cause the fatal diseases tuberculosis and diphtheria, respectively. This is important because white blood cells ingest pathogenic bacteria and expose them to Reactive Oxygen Species in order to kill them, and so the mechanisms by which disease-causing bacteria like M. tuberculosis and C. diphtheriae resist this oxidative killing are potentially important to human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L019825/1","grantId":"BB/L019825/1","fundValue":"470380","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Buttner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" Not applicable at this time Not applicable at this time Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
