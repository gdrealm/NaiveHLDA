Archaeologists can use this signal in the bones of past human populations to find out about their dietary habits. The technique is now widely used, and is reliable at the broad-brush level. However, work over the last few years has shown that other influences, both external such as climate and internal such as growth or stress, can subtly influence these chemical signals, known as stable isotopic values. In particular, one potential influencing factor on one type of stable isotopic value, the nitrogen isotopic value, is that of pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy and lactation have been shown to influence hair nitrogen isotope signatures of modern female humans and animals. The mechanisms by which this happens are not fully understood, but it is possible that the effect results from changes in nitrogen metabolism during pregnancy/lactation. To date it is unknown whether the nitrogen isotope changes observed in mammalian hair due to pregnancy and lactation can be seen in bone collagen. Hair records short-term isotopic changes in the body, whereas bone reflects the body's average isotopic composition over several, possibly many, years. However, it is important to identify whether pregnancy and lactation is recorded in bone collagen. Small but significant differences between adult human male and female bone collagen nitrogen isotopic values have been reported in archaeological populations from multiple periods and worldwide locations, with females always lower than males if a difference is observed. At present, such differences are generally interpreted as dietary differences, either differential access to food resources for men and women, or evidence of migration between areas with different diets. However, it may be that what is observed is physiological rather than dietary - endogenous rather than exogenous. We require controlled isotopic studies on individuals with known life-histories to test whether or not pregnancy and lactation affect an individual's bone collagen nitrogen isotopic values. We will test our hypothesis on modern red deer, using a population in which we have already shown that hair nitrogen isotopic values are affected by pregnancy/lactation. We can then consider whether wide-scale observed differences between male and female bone collagen nitrogen isotopic values in archaeological human populations could relate to pregnancy/lactation rather than dietary differences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E010644/1","grantId":"NE/E010644/1","fundValue":"39979","fundStart":"2007-07-08","fundEnd":"2008-01-07","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Tamsin Christina OConnell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
