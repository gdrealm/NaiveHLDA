{"id":"5E0D929A-0CA2-489D-9263-DDB8F0F0BAC3","title":"Risk communication in preventive medicine: Optimising the impact of DNA risk information","abstractText":"Summary\nThere is growing interest in how genetic information might be used to motivate people to change their behaviour to reduce their risks of disease. But the few studies available show few motivating effects. Moreover, genetic information on risk may have perverse behavioural consequences if negative test results reduce engagement in health-directed behaviours. Given the personal nature of genetic information it should have potential to be more motivating than other types of risk information, particularly if it is presented in a way that makes sense to people given their existing ideas about genes and risk.\n\nThe aim of the proposed research is to explain how people respond to genetic risk information as a first step towards developing effective ways of communicating such information.\n\nThree linked studies will be conducted. Two assess the risk of developing diseases in at risk populations (Crohn?s disease and cardiovascular disease). The third study assesses the risk of responding well to different types of prescription for a medicine (nicotine replacement therapy, being prescribed for smokers attempting to stop). In each study people have a risk assessment based either on assessing their genes or assessing another type of risk indicator. In each study people will be told what they can do to reduce their risks of disease (Studies 1 and 2) or increase the chances that their medicine will work (Study 3).\n\nRelevance\nRapid developments in medicine and particularly genetics make it increasingly possible to predict preventable diseases. For this to lead to health improvements the information needs to be communicated to motivate people to relevant actions. The proposed research aims to understand, from the recipients? perspectives, how they make sense of genetic risk information and how this affects their subsequent behaviour. \n\nTranslation for the general public\nA core feature of the proposed research is to learn how people make sense of genetic information on risk. The results of the research are intended to help doctors and other health professionals to communicate this information effectively both to those undergoing genetic testing and to the public more generally. The general public will be represented, along with other key stakeholders, at one of two workshops that will be organised as part of the research, one at the planning stage, and one towards the end. In addition our dissemination strategy (see Section 6 of the protocol) involves direct communication with user groups including general public representatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500274","grantId":"G0500274","fundValue":"1034040","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Theresa Mary  Marteau","coPersons":["David  Armstrong","Ann Louise Kinmonth","Stephen  Sutton","John  Weinman","Andrew Toby Prevost"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
