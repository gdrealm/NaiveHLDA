These are abundant in tissues such as epidermis and heart muscle that are constantly subjected to physical stress.\n\nTwo recent exciting findings from our laboratory form the basis of this project. \n1) Strong adhesion by desmosomes can be weakened by a signalling process inside cells involving an enzyme called protein kinase C (PKC). This becomes important when cells need to break free of their adhesions in order to move, for example when epidermal cells need to cover a wound. 2) The sticky molecules responsible for adhesion in desmosomes appear to have an additional function in regulation the thickness and rate of cell division in epidermis.\n\nWe will investigate 1) by modifying the proteins of desmosomes in cell so that they cannot receive PKC signals and determine what effect this has on adhesion. In relation to 2) we will determine what genes are affected by desmosomal proteins in epidermis in order to learn what signals are involved in this type of regulation.\n\nThe results will further our understanding of how cell adhesion is regulated in normal tissues, in disease and in embryonic development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9630879","grantId":"G9630879","fundValue":"1806730","fundStart":"1998-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Ronald Garrod","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
