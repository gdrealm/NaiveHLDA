{"id":"7D114FBB-AC95-4179-8765-1FC06173571C","title":"Next Generation Industrial Lasers for Super-high Speed Precision Manufacturing (NEGLAP)","abstractText":"This project will install two state-of-the-art high power lasers: a 400 W nanosecond pulsed diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser and a 1 kW fibre lasers, both developed by UK companies. Suitable external optics and high speed CNC systems will be integrated with the lasers to form materials processing cells.The lasers will be used to carry out a number of joint projects between the applicant's research group and four existing EPSRC IMRCs: Cambridge Manufacturing Institute, Scottish Manufacturing Institute, Cranfield Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre and the University of Nottingham. These projects include super-speed laser cutting, high precision laser drilling, direct laser milling, surface texturing and micro-welding. Also six companies (including Rolls-Royce, BNFL and Pilkington) are involved in the project.This project will bring five leading research groups in the UK together to tackle the chanllanges of next generation manufacturing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C013352/1","grantId":"EP/C013352/1","fundValue":"581997","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2008-07-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Li  Lin","coPersons":["Z  Liu"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
