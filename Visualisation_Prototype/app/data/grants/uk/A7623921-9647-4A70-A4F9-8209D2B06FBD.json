However, there is an emerging literature that suggests that the concentration of ethnic minority people in particular areas may mitigate some of these effects. The main objective of the proposed study is to investigate the associations between residential ethnic density, socioeconomic deprivation, interpersonal ethnic discrimination and health, and the causal pathways that might link these factors. In order to do this, the study will use secondary data analysis of the 2003 and 2005 Home Office Citizenship Surveys.</p>\n\n<p>The study will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Describe associations between the residential ethnic density of an area and physical and mental health</li>\n\n <li>Examine whether these relationships vary across ethnic groups</li>\n\n <li>Model pathways linking ethnic density and health, including measures of deprivation, experiences and perceptions of racism, social networks and participation</li>\n\n <li>Explore how far the relationships between ethnic density and experiences, perceptions and health are a consequence of own group density or ethnic minority density generally.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-163-25-0043","grantId":"RES-163-25-0043","fundValue":"119766","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mai  Stafford","coPersons":["Laia  Becares","James  Nazroo"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
