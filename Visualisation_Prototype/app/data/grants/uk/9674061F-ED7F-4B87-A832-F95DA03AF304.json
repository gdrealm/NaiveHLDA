{"id":"9674061F-ED7F-4B87-A832-F95DA03AF304","title":"WORKSHOP: Multiscaled Mathematics in Defence Research and its Spinoffs","abstractText":"The proposed workshop, which would be held at the Lighthill Institute of Mathematical Sciences, in London's Russell Square, is to focus on defined areas of mathematical modelling in biomedical / human-risk-interface, terrain / geophysical and impact / multi-particle problems and applications that are arising in the Defence context and its spin-offs. New analysis is required along with computation in order to better accommodate multiple scaled phenomena. This forms the central aim of the workshop, attracting computational and analytical researchers on mathematics and mathematical science in the broad sense to underpin applications e.g. of potential interest to users and sponsoring agencies; to seek non-traditional methodologies; to expand the international effort in the areas; to encourage multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-disciplinary work; to invite the UK's main players [from mathematics and various disciplines, and from industry as well as academia] along with significant international involvement and participation; and to involve about 50 researchers in this unique and timely workshop. Details of the specific research topics as suggested in the case for support allow for spin-off topics and issues arising during the workshop itself as well as exciting new questions, as ideas are discussed and generated for future research. The emphasis on Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Science and Modelling ties in with the cross-disciplinary aspects involved and the range of applications to be explored. Mathematics is crucial throughout the Defence and spin-off motivations and in turn there is exciting mathematical spin-off to fields which to date have hardly been connected.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E045413/1","grantId":"EP/E045413/1","fundValue":"13180","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This workshop stimulated a wide variety of collaborative research, nationally and internationally.
