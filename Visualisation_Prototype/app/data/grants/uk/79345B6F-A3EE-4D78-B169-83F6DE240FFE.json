{"id":"79345B6F-A3EE-4D78-B169-83F6DE240FFE","title":"A genetic analysis of the response to the presence of glycine","abstractText":"Collagens are a family of proteins with many different functions in humans. To a large extent, they are responsible for holding our bodies together. Mutations in human collagen genes can have very debilitating effects and in many cases, the presence of a mutant collagen can act like a poison damaging the function of other normal collagens in the affected person. The severity of disease is often more the result of this damaging healthy collagens effect, than the presence of the mutant collagen itself. The proposed research is to investigate some aspects of mutant collagen behaviour using an experimentally and ethically tractable model system, the free living nematode C. elegans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401202","grantId":"G0401202","fundValue":"201093","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain Lindsay Johnstone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
