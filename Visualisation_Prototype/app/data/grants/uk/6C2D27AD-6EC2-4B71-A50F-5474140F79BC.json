A starting point in this research is to identify the current needs and aspirations of those who work, live and play in three upland areas and explore their concerns for the future. The driving forces behind these concerns will be modelled to build up detailed scenarios of possible future social, economic and environmental conditions. Innovative ideas will be developed on how to respond to changing conditions. The suggestions will be fed into computer models to explore what effect they might have on future society, economy and environment. This will help in identifying the most appropriate ways for people to adapt in each upland area. Indicators will be identified that people can use to monitor how successfully they are adapting to change. Communication and understanding between different stakeholders and researchers will be fostered through joint site visits and workshops.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-227-25-0001","grantId":"RES-227-25-0001","fundValue":"750337","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Klaus  Hubacek","coPersons":["Christina  Prell","Pippa  Chapman","Mark S.
