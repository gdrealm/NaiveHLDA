Phospholipids are essential because they form the membranes that not only encapsulate all cells, they also form the membranes inside cells that partition cellular constituents into organelles. There are many different types of phospholipid, and these can serve both structural and signaling functions. We have observed abnormalities in a mutant mouse strain that lacks annexin 6, one of a large and abundant family of proteins that binds to phospholipids, that is strongly suggestive of defective phospholipid metabolism. The proposed research will use cells from these mice to investigate the expression and movement of certain phospholipids within these cells, and to understand how annexin 6 is involved in these activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018099/1","grantId":"BB/D018099/1","fundValue":"363954","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Edward Moss","coPersons":["Timothy Paul Levine"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
