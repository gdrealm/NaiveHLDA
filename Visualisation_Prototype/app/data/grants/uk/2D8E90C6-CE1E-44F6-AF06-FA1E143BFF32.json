{"id":"2D8E90C6-CE1E-44F6-AF06-FA1E143BFF32","title":"Annexin 8 and differentiation of the retinal pigment epithelium","abstractText":"There are two broad aims to this research. One is to learn more about the function of a protein named annexin A8, and the other is to find out how this protein influences vision. Annexin A8 is only expressed in a few cell types, and is most abundant in the cells that line the airways of the lungs. These are termed epithelial cells, and annexin A8 is also expressed in epithelial cells in other parts of the body including the breast and eye. A consistent observation is that annexin A8 is present at high levels in epithelial cells that are mature and functioning normally. The maturation process for epithelial cells requires their development from dividing immature cells into a sheet of tightly connected non-dividing cells. As this maturation process occurs, annexin A8 levels steadily increase. Interestingly, annexin A8 levels are much lower in cancerous epithelial cells, most notably in breast cancer, and the disappearance of annexin A8 from these cells seems to be associated with a reversal of the maturation process. These observations led us to the hypothesis that annexin A8 is somehow required for epithelial cell maturation and for maintenance of the normal characteristics of the mature epithelial sheet. Support for our hypothesis came unexpectedly from a study in which we were investigating the growth and maturation of epithelial cells from the eye. In the retina, which is the part of the eye that captures light and enables us to see, there is a layer of vitally important epithelial cells that is essential for retinal health. Without these cells the neighbouring light-sensitive photoreceptors rapidly die (which is what happens in age-related macular disease). We examined the expression of all known genes when the cells underwent a drug-induced reverse-maturation process, and we found that annexin A8 levels were massively reduced when this occurred. We also found that by forcing the cells to express annexin A8, we could prevent the reverse-maturation. Here, we plan to use these epithelial cells from the eye to investigate the function of annexin A8, to find out how it maintains the mature epithelial state, and why it needs to be switched off or suppressed for maturation to reverse. Some of this work we can do using cultured cells, but we now also have the necessary strains of mice to investigate this process in vivo. We have developed a way of deleting a gene in the retinal epithelial cells, and will use this approach to delete annexin A8 in the living eye. We can then investigate the consequences of this on vision, and also examine whether or not the annexin A8-depleted epithelial cells undergo maturation reversal in the living eye. If they do, and thus behave in a manner similar to their behaviour in culture, then they may convert from epithelial cells to neurones. This would constitute a remarkable developmental feat, and in the future may pave the way for new treatments for forms of blindness caused by the loss of photoreceptors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019707/1","grantId":"BB/I019707/1","fundValue":"436223","fundStart":"2012-01-28","fundEnd":"2015-01-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research is on-going and so far the findings have been used only in our group for the progress of the study.

The RPE is a layer of cells at the back of the eye that forms a barrier between the blood supply and the light-sensitive cells of the retina. Our work is still in progress, but once complete the study will make an important contribution to understanding of epithelial cell biology with particular relevance to the differentiation and properties of the RPE.
