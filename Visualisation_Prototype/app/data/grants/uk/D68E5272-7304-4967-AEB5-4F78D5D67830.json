{"id":"D68E5272-7304-4967-AEB5-4F78D5D67830","title":"Sensor Coating System - SeCSy","abstractText":"The efficiency of gas turbines is inextricably linked to the maximum gas temperatures that occur in the hot gas section. Uncertainties in current temperature measurement systems do not allow operators to run their engines at maximum efficiencies without compromising on reduced material life and safety. The proposed 'thermal barrier sensor coating system' will provide more accurate temperature data and can reduce safety margins by 50 degC or more. A 50degC increase in firing temperature corresponds to 1% efficiency gain - a huge amount given the size of the market. The objective of this programme is to demonstrate that a sensor coating system can be applied on an operating concept turbine: a Rolls Royce Viper 201. This programme will a) develop the coating-instrumentation system and b) carry out a measurement programme on a running engine.By installing the Viper facility at Cranfield University it will provide the UK with a strategic advantage both in terms of materials research, instrumentation development and 'on engine' metrology. It would be the only Viper research facility independent of a manufacturer, giving the scope to develop manufacturer independent programmes of research, in conjunction with materials and coatings specialists at Cranfield and elsewhere, to test new concepts that will increase the efficiency and extend range of operations of both land based and aero gas turbine engines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000255/1","grantId":"TS/G000255/1","fundValue":"167012","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bernard  Charnley","coPersons":["John  Nicholls"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
