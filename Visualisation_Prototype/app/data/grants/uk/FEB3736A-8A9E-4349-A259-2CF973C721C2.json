The size of the artery that is blocked and how quickly it is opened again after the onset of the heart attack is an important factor in determining the amount of injury. However, it is now clear that another form of injury also occurs, paradoxically at the time when the blood supply is restored. This is called ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The precise cause of this type of injury is not known although there is evidence that activation of a system in the blood called the complement system by a pathway called the lectin pathway plays a role. We have developed a unique model to investigate the role of this pathway in ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The proposed studies will provide definitive information on the importance of this pathway in causing ischaemia-reperfusion injury and whether inhibiting this system would be valuable way of protecting the heart after heart attacks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700859","grantId":"G0700859","fundValue":"399981","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wilhelm  Schwaeble","coPersons":["Nilesh Jayantilal Samani","Michael Stephen Marber"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
