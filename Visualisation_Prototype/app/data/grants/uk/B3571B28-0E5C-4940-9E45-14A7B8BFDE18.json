To avoid these problems, we will use two novel approaches in which the critical items act as their own controls:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>A picture-naming study in which pictures have labels with no neighbours in English but many neighbours in French or vice versa. These pictures will be named in turn by monolingual speakers in their own language. An interaction between picture set and response language would indicate an effect of phonological neighbours. Since the same pictures are presented to both groups, non-linguistic factors are perfectly controlled.<br /></li> \n <li>A direct manipulation of a word's neighbourhood through training of &quot;novel neighbours&quot; (nonwords derived from the targets by changing one speech sound). Participants will be trained on these &quot;new neighbours&quot; of half the target words (counterbalanced across participants) and then tested on all words, thus allowing us to compare the same items in the trained and untrained condition.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>These experiments should provide solid empirical evidence about whether lexical retrieval in language production involves co-activation of related items.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001807/1","grantId":"ES/E001807/1","fundValue":"74540","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hans  Stadthagen","coPersons":["Jeffrey  Bowers","Markus  Damian"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
