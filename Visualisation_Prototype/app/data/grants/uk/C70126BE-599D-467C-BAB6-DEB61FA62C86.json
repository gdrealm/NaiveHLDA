The pharmaceutical industry has been relatively unsuccessful in bringing new treatments to the marketplace for COPD, with many products failing when they are first given to patients because they do not have the effects that were predicted from studies in animals. A way of circumventing this problem is to test new potential medicines in cells and tissues obtained from COPD sufferers and develop laboratory models of COPD using these cells to predict more accurately the approaches that are likely to succeed in patients. Many patients with COPD have progressive changes in their airways and airspaces which are currently unresponsive to any of the current COPD medicines. By understanding how these processes develop, we will identify new pathways that the medicines of tomorrow can target. We will also gain information on molecules that we can measure in patients that will accurately predict whether a patients airways or airspaces are getting destroyed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001367","grantId":"G1001367","fundValue":"1095620","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan John  Knox","coPersons":["Gisli  Jenkins","Simon Richard Johnson","John Andrew Kirby","Howard William Clark","Andrew John Fisher","Derek  Mann","Ratko  Djukanovic","Ian  Adcock","Paul  Kirkham","Paul  Skipp","Fan  Chung","Donna Elizabeth Davies","Christopher  Brightling","Teresa Dorothy  Tetley","David  O'Connor"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
