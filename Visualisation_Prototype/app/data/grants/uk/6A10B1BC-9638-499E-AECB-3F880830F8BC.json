{"id":"6A10B1BC-9638-499E-AECB-3F880830F8BC","title":"Smart Leak Detection Pipes - 27657","abstractText":"This project will develop an easy to install leak detection system for existing and new water pipes. Based on self-contained\nsensor nodes located on the outside of the pipe the system will detect changes in pressure and vibration to indicate the\nformation of leaks and their location as they occur. The innovative features of the system include the fact that internal\nconditions are monitored from the outside of the pipe using sensors not used before due to their need for a power source,\nwhich now will be supplied by a novel radioisotopic battery lasting the lifetime of the pipes themselves. These features\ntogether develop a low cost, easy to install system which will last the lifetime of the pipes. This will allow these sensors to\nbe installed along the lengths of pipes such that all water distribution pipes can be monitored in real time, eliminating\nlocation errors &amp; the current delay in identifying leaks due to the need for the leak flow to grow to a size where it can be\nidentified on a district flow meter.\nOFWAT estimated water losses of 3281 Ml/day in the UK in 2010 through leaking pipes. It is estimated that 32 billion cubic\nmetres are lost every year worldwide (World Bank 2006). This water is lost from the 'blue water cycle'. Not all leaks are\nvisible and the non visible leaks are initially identified through monitoring flows into discrete areas or via slow and time\nconsuming surveys along the lengths of pipes. This means that leaks are not identified until they have grown to sufficient\nsize and this 'awareness time' can amount to several weeks or even months and lead to a large amount of water being lost\nbefore then. Whilst this time can vary, it is generally seen as considerably longer than the time taken to pinpoint and repair\nleaks. Eliminating the delay will substantially reduce the water lost - in this country alone by over 1000 Ml/d (~450 Ml/day\nfor Severn Trent Water, STW, alone, who own ~1/8th of the network). Thus, on a worldwide basis the approach has the\npotential to save considerably more than the required 1000 Ml/d. Leakage can have dramatic effects on society. In many\ndeveloping countries it is frequently the principal cause of intermittant supplies or the inability to connect more people to the pipes water network. The water has been treated and pumped with substantial embedded energy; therefore reducing\nleakage also reduces energy wastage.\nLeakage control is a major activity for water utilities in both the UK, where it is a regulatory requirement, and throughout the\nworld. New methods of identifying leaks which reduce the time taken to identify and locate leaks are needed worldwide.\nThere is a particular need for systems to manage leakage on plastic pipes due to their poor response to current leakage\ndetection techniques. This collaborative project is led by Jo Parker of Watershed Associates, who has many years\nexperience in leakage control and who managed the Technology Strategy Board's VISTA project to successful completion\nexemplified by the take up of the research outcomes in Scotland. It includes 2 UK water companies representing the end\nuser and together supplying 25% of the UK population; STW and United Utilities (UU). The University of Birmingham (UoB)\nwill lead the research development supported by an SME specialising in developing electronic systems for the\nmanagement of leakage, GCR Tech. It also includes a utility contractor, Morrison Utility Services, (MUS) which will develop\na fast, low cost installation technology. Thus, the consortium can develop the product and market it through the\nprofessional networks specialising in leakage management in the UK and worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K504191/1","grantId":"EP/K504191/1","fundValue":"240685","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As this is a TSB funded project, the findings to date are confidential within the project team.
