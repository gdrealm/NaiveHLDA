This project supports combining PhotoBiotics' proprietary OptiLink technology and its own drugs with experts from Imperial College and University College London National Medical Laser Centre to develop a novel antibody-directed phototherapy (ADP) drug to treat cancer. These drugs have few side effects and tumours cannot develop drug resistance to them. We have identified a clinically-validated target and have preliminary data to show that we can tackle this for Oesophageal Cancer. Photobiotics will oversee the manufacture and testing of the drug, Imperial College will help to generate functional data and UCL will treat tumours using their established models. If successful, thus funding will lead to major interest from the pharmaceutical industry to take this into clinical trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13036","grantId":"MC_PC_13036","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Laurence  Lovat","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
