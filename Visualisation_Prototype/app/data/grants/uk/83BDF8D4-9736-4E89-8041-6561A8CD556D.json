It is important from a theoretical perspective, because it helps to identify the information flow process and its many aspects, such as information clustering and persistence due to private information and heterogeneous beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>But it is also very important from an applied perspective, since it helps choosing the appropriate (multivariate) model for estimating and predicting financial volatility. <br />This research develops formal statistical tools for testing conditional independence and noncausality that are suitable for checking volatility and jump dependence in asset prices.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0311","grantId":"RES-062-23-0311","fundValue":"316594","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Distaso","coPersons":["Valentina  Corradi","Marcelo  Fernandes"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
