To achieve this the UK energy sector has to migrate towards supplying innovative, high quality, highly reliable, low or zero emission energy generation sources. Hydrogen and fuel cells have emerged as potential initiatives that could serve as alternative energy sources. They are currently being engineered for a range of applications including automotive, stationary power, aerospace and consumer electronics. Each application presents its own set of requirements for the fuel cell system including performance, operating range and cost. With the introduction of a new technology into markets, where existing products are highly reliable, requires that this aspect of the system performance must match customer expectations which are demanded for a new product. The area of focus of this research aims to improve the durability and reliability of this new energy source by better system integration and design optimisation, coupled with effective health management to maximise the life of the power source. The outcome is a real time dynamic and adaptive intelligent lifecycle infrastructure with leading edge research in system design for reliability, prognostics and diagnostics, and semantically modeling relationships been the product and the environment for fuel cells, achieved through a multidisciplinary approach, including the areas of mathematics, information science and engineering. The dividends both in design efficiencies and lifecycle management can be achieved placing hydrogen and fuel cell power sources at the forefront of future UK energy provision.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K02101X/1","grantId":"EP/K02101X/1","fundValue":"909687","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Currently the research is ongoing and as yet the findings have not been used by the public sector.

The first phase of failure modelling has adopted a petri net framework to deal with the strong dynamical aspects and dependencies within the fuel cell design. The health monitoring research has focussed on a prognostic approach using equations and development of a diagnostic method using the Bayesian network. All areas are ongoing. There has been already some conference publications on the research to date, with more due in the near future. Continued discussions with the collaborator will aid tailoring the research. The findings will steer the up and coming work packages still remaining on the grant programme. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
