Contingent on successful evaluation, during its second year the collaborative research activity will be further developed and extended.Throughout the two year period, training and support mechanisms will be developed and implemented including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>mentor surgeries</li>\n\n <li>a virtual learning environment and website</li>\n\n <li>research colloquia and seminars.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The management and governance of the Network will be collaborative and comprise all Welsh higher education institutions.Evidence will gathered for an internal evaluation by recording and monitoring the outcomes of the Networkâ€™s activities, and by interviews with all participants to explore institutional participation and any emerging cross-institutional synergies. An external evaluation will also be commissioned from a critical friend from outside Wales.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-068-41-0001","grantId":"RES-068-41-0001","fundValue":"339835","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Margaret Davies","coPersons":["Jane  Salisbury"],"organisation":"Trinity College Carmarthen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
