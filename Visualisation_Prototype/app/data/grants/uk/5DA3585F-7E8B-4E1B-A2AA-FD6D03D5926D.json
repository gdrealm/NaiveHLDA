{"id":"5DA3585F-7E8B-4E1B-A2AA-FD6D03D5926D","title":"Eurasian Boreal Network for land - atmosphere - climate interactions (BORNET-Eurasia)","abstractText":"The Eurasian Boreal region is warming 3 times faster than the global mean making it a priority region for identifying and understanding land-atmosphere-climate interactions and feedbacks. Much of the warming at these high latitudes is driven by short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as black carbon and ozone. There is a severe paucity of observations of SLCPs over the Eurasian Boreal region presenting a major challenge to improving our understanding. This proposal aims build capability for improving understanding of SLCP budgets and climate feedbacks in the Eurasian high latitudes. This will be achieved through the establishment of a network of European and Russian scientists, and exploitation of existing observations and global model simulations to motivate future large-scale field observation experiments in the Eurasian boreal region. \n\nWe will leverage existing NERC investment in our ongoing research into European pollution export and evaluation of atmospheric composition in global models to provide scientific impetus and direction for new research priorities. We will build new, and strengthen existing collaborations between a network of researchers across Europe and Russia. By synthesising existing observations and multi-model simulations, we will motivate the requirements for future observations and prioritise processes that require improved understanding. Within our network we will hold a number of workshops to discuss a) existing data synthesis, b) model-observation comparisons, c) future data needs in the Eurasian boreal region, and d) plans for future aircraft field campaigns. In addition, we will make a scoping visit to the Central Aerological Observatory near Moscow, Russia, in order to evaluate the feasibility of different strategies for a joint aircraft campaign, considering issues such as logistics for joint operations and communication, geo-political constraints on aircraft operations, and experimental strategies for joint flying. The overall end-result of this project will be a coherent community of international scientists with a robust knowledge base of deficiencies in our understanding of short-lived climate pollutants, priorities for observations, and a strategy for developing future large-scale observation networks and large-scale field projects in the Eurasian boreal regions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L013347/1","grantId":"NE/L013347/1","fundValue":"37891","fundStart":"2014-05-02","fundEnd":"2015-11-01","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Steve Robert Arnold","coPersons":["Dominick  Spracklen"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
