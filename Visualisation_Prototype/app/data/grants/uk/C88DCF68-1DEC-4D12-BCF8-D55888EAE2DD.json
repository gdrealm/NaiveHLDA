The Se status of the UK population is only marginal and may increase risk not only of viral infections but also of a number of major diseases including prostate and colon cancer. However, the mechanisms by which Se intake affects gut health are poorly understood and the impact of interactions between Se intake and genetic factors not defined. In this project we will adopt a systems approach to describe the effects of Se on the intestinal epithelium and the impact of a specific genetic variant. The project will also provide a proof of principle of for such analysis of nutrient-gene interactions. The programme of work will combine mathematical modelling with in vitro molecular techniques, experiments in cell lines and work with transgenic mice to assess the functional effects of a key variant in the gene that codes for the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase in response to Se intake. Measurements will be made of selenoproteins and related biochemical pathways and the experimental data will be used to refine a mathematical model of selenoprotein metabolism and its downstream effects. The systems model generated in this programme will allow prediction of the how Se supply modulates biochemical pathways and cell function. Validation of the model in a physiological context will lay the basis for future testing of the model in human studies. The major outcomes from this programme will identification of novel functional biomarkers of Se status for use in later human studies and an increased ability to model nutrient metabolism at different physiological levels in relation to genetic factors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H011471/1","grantId":"BB/H011471/1","fundValue":"813617","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Hesketh","coPersons":["Daryl Pierson Shanley","Tom  Kirkwood","John Cummings Mathers"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
