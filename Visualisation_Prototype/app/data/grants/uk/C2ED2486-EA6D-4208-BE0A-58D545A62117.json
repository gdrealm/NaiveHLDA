In this project, a test rig of a small-scale power generation (up to 5kW) and heat recovery system will be established with a heat source temperature between 100 ^C and 500 ^C, which is representative of actual industrial waste heat. The natural refrigerant CO2 will be engaged as a working fluid in the system, considering its excellent thermophysical properties and negligible environmental impact. Corresponding to the large temperature range of the heat source, the CO2 supercritical Rankine cycle will be applied for temperatures below 350 ^C, otherwise, combined CO2 Brayton and supercritical Rankine cycles will be employed. Simultaneously, a detailed mathematical model for the proposed system will be developed and validated with measurements. The model will then evaluate, compare and analyse different system and component designs, heat recovery potentials and control optimisations which will eventually lead to optimal design and construction of the proposed system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505869/1","grantId":"EP/L505869/1","fundValue":"98362","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yunting  Ge","coPersons":["Savvas  Tassou"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
