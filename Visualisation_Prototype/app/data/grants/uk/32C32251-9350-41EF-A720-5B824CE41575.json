Instead, the technique involved in this proposal uses a high density of minature columns with dimensions on the nano-scale to initiate the chemical growth of a large crystal from a crystal of another material that has a different crystal structure. The columns reduce the problems associated with the different crystal structures and has the potential to produce high quality gallium nitride at relatively low cost.The research will determine the optimum column size and the best conditions for the crystal growth by theoretical modelling and experimentation. Three different complementary growth techniques at the universities of Nottingham and Bath will be used, and the advanced characterisation techniques and expertise at Bristol University will provide essential feedback and understanding of the nanostructures to the growth personnel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E000673/1","grantId":"EP/E000673/1","fundValue":"210490","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Paul Campion","coPersons":["Anthony  Kent","Charles Thomas Foxon"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), we have shown that it is possible to grow almost exclusively defect free Gallium Nitride Nanocolumns and then subsequently coalesce these columns into a continuous film during a single growth run. The films showed a reduced defect density with respect to films grown in the conventional manner. We also produced a geometrical model to help explain the growth modes that we observed. Furthermore, we idenified a previously unidentified defect in a small proportion As a basis for lower defect density substrates for the growth of Gallium Nitride devices.
