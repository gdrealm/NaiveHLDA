The developed model will be used to elucidate the extent and distribution of the factors causative of lung injury in diseased, heterogeneous, mechanically-ventilated lungs. By treating the problem as one of feedback control, we will investigate methods of parameter adjustment in the mechanical ventilator to optimise cardiac output and arterial gas tensions while minimising the factors associated with VALI. Due to the inevitable complexity of the simulation model which we intend to develop, advanced methods from multivariable robust and optimal control theory will be required in order to identify which combinations of parameters should be adjusted, and how, in order to achieve the desired reduction in VALI. The work will go beyond that previously attempted in quantifying the factors that risk lung injury during mechanical ventilation through the greater fidelity of the proposed simulation platform. In addition, we will apply robustness analysis techniques to the modelling to improve the reliability and applicability of our findings. This will allow us to perform population modelling, rather than the commonly used approach of modelling and studying a single, idealized subject, rendering our findings applicable to populations and to a variety of real patients, in contrast to previous work where the idealized subject is in fact representative of neither the population nor any one individual.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F057059/1","grantId":"EP/F057059/1","fundValue":"163159","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Grant Hardman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
