This project will focus on a unique membrane protein class which is highly conserved in eukaryotes: the G protein coupled receptor type-G proteins/Golgi pH regulator (GTG/GPHR) family. Contrasting theories exist for the roles of these proteins and the physiological function of this family remains enigmatic. One model suggests the Arabidopsis GTG/GPHRs are plasma membrane receptors for the plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA; Pandey et al, 2009, Cell 136, 136-148). In contrast, a second group used patch clamp technology, which can be used to measure current carried across membranes by proteins called ion channels, and found that the mammalian GTG/GPHR possesses voltage-dependent anion-channel activity and is critical in regulating Golgi acidification (Maeda et al 2008 Nat Cell Biol, 10, 1135-1145). They made these finding using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line which had a mutated GTG/GPHR, and showed defects in Golgi function. The Golgi is part of the endomembrane system and is a critical organelle in eukaryotes required for packaging and sorting of molecules to be delivered to other parts of the cell and for secretion. This vital process in eukaryotic cell biology is thought to be dependent on a pH gradient along the endomembrane pathway. \n\nThe proposal builds on our recent breakthroughs using the model plant, Arabidopsis, and model animal, C.elegans, demonstrating that plant and animal GTGs are critical for growth and fertility. We have shown in Arabidopsis that GTG proteins are required for Golgi function, cell wall synthesis and light-regulated growth (Jaff&eacute; et al, 2012, Plant Cell 24, 3649-68). This was carried out using mutants that we have isolated independently and in which we observe normal responses to ABA treatments. This and the fact that we find them localised to the Golgi questions their role as plasma membane ABA receptors. In addition, we have produced the first whole animal model (C.elegans) where both GTGs are mutated and this mutant also shows defects in fertility and growth. Transformation of C. elegans GTG1 into plant gtg1gtg2 mutants shows that its expression restores normal root and hypocotyl (seedling stem) growth. As the animal protein restores these defects in plants we propose a common function for plant and animal GTGs. \n\nThis project will define the function of this novel membrane protein class, further investigating conservation of function and specifically testing the hypothesis that they function as anion channels regulating Golgi pH in plants.\n\nTo demonstrate whether there is conservation of function across kingdoms, we will determine if the Arabidopsis GTG1 gene can restore the defects in two animal mutant systems which lack GTG function. The first will be the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary GTG/GPHR-mutant cell line which shows defects in protein secretion due to poor Golgi acidification; the second will be the C. elegans gtg1gtg2 mutant. To determine directly whether plant GTGs have channel activity we will use patch clamp technology to demonstrate anion transport activity following purification and insertion of AtGTG1 into giant unilamellar vesicles. This system will be used to determine biophysical and pharmacological properties of these putative channels and structure/function analysis. We will develop systems for assessing Golgi/ER pH in Arabidopsis using a range of pH probes and test whether plant GTGs can function as pH regulators allowing acidification of these endomembrane compartments. Finally, a regulatory protein called Galpha has been shown to interact with AtGTG1 in yeast. To address the importance of this interaction in the function of GTGs we will determine whether a Galpha-GTG interaction can be observed in planta and the extent to which the phenotype of the gtg1 gtg2 double mutant is dependent on Galpha.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L010313/1","grantId":"BB/L010313/1","fundValue":"416696","fundStart":"2014-06-02","fundEnd":"2017-06-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are only 5 months into this grant and so our findings have not yet been used.

The project has only been running for 5 months but in this time we have developed a range of molecular tools to specifically answer this question. To investigate the role of GTGs as pH regulators of the secretory pathway we have successfully generated a range of constructs which can be expressed in plants and used to detect pH in various cellular compartments (ER, cis-Golgi, Trans Golgi Network and prevacuolar compartments. We have now transformed Arabidopsis wild-type and mutants defective in the GTG genes so that we can monitor what effect knocking out these genes has on pH in the secretory pathway.\n\nIn addition, in order to understand the role of G proteins in GTG function we have made constructs suitable for Bimolecular Fluorescence complementation (BiFC). This method will be used to detect an interaction of GTGs with G proteins in the plant. We have used the Gateway method of cloning and so far we have produced more than half of the constructs we require for this assay.\n\nWe are also testing the importance of Galpha for the gtg1gtg2 mutant phenotype by crossing gtg1gtg2 with the Galpha mutant gpa1-1. The cross has been carried out and we are currently selecting for a gpa1gtg1gtg2 triple mutant. These will be specifically analysed for light-dependent hypocotyl growth inhibition, inhibition of root growth and silique length. \n\nGTG proteins are conserved across the full protein sequence. However, there are two major domains in which conservation is especially strong. One of these (named the GTP-binding domain) contains a single conserved tyrosine residue, conserved across all GTGs. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have mutated this residue conservatively and non-conservatively to test whether this mutated form can restore the seedling and fertility defects observed in the Arabidopsis gtg1gtg2 mutants.\n\nWe have shown previously that CeGTG1 can complement the root and hypocotyl defects seen in Arabidopsis gtg1gtg2 mutants. In this grant we have shown that CeGTG2 cannot restore the root and hypocotyl defects indicating a fundamental difference in CeGTG1 and CeGTG2. The work will have major implications for our understanding of Golgi (and endoplasmic reticulum, ER) function in plants and in other eukaryotic systems. GTG proteins are hypothesized to represent a new class of anion channel and information about these proteins will therefore impact all researchers interested in how ions are transported across membranes. More specifically the identity of the anion channels required for efficient endomembrane acidification is largely unknown and certainly in plants there are few clues to how this is achieved. We hypothesize that the GTG proteins can fulfil this role and that our data will have major implications for the understanding of Golgi and ER function in plants. The major academic beneficiaries will be all researchers in the fields of membrane biology, transport, and endomembrane function. Since GTG proteins also have major effects on plant growth and fertility, researchers interested in the underlying mechanisms will also benefit from this work. In that sense the research is broadly relevant to BBSRC research priorities on bioenergy and crop science. Importantly, we have identified homologues of the GTGs in the major crop species: wheat, barley and rice. Therefore longer-term beneficiaries will include research institutes and industry in the plant breeding/agricultural biotechnology sector, both in the UK and internationally.\nOur work will also address the role of the GTGs in cell wall synthesis and structure, again fundamental aspects relevant to these research priorities. Our collaboration with Professor Paul Dupree is important for the high level analysis required to ascertain how the cell wall is affected in these mutants. Explaining in more detail the processes underlying Golgi function and cell wall synthesis and structure is important to those working in plant cell biology. The increased understanding of animal cell biology from this fundamental work may also have long term implications for medical research. Certainly, further analysis of the animal model that we have produced, which has defects in development and fertility, will be of benefit to those addressing these topics not only in nematodes but more widely.
