An energy revolution must take place if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. Even without the impact this may have (eg through carbon pricing), fuel costs have a very uncertain future. GRIT has two aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>create a fine-grained picture of the current spatial structure of the UK economy</li>\n\n <li>consider how changing fuel prices could alter that structure over the long term.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>GRIT examines the web of connections between businesses in the UK to identify sectors and locations facing the greatest changes.</p>\n\n<p>GRIT will work with a unique dataset: the Business Structure Database contains information for nearly every UK business, including location and sector classification. This will be linked to sectoral trade flow data. These two sources offer an opportunity to map the current spatial distribution of economic activity in the UK and to think about how that distribution may change in the future.</p>\n\n<p>GRIT combines this data-driven approach with a plan to engage with organisations directly affected.

It combines two datasets in a novel way, using the latest available data on domestic trade flows between industrial sectors (from 2010) and combining these with the Business Structure Database (BSD) to estimate their spatial location and magnitude, and how they are affected by distance cost change.\nGRIT's method has successfully identified what may be the most vulnerable industrial sectors and locations in the UK to increases in fuel costs. There are three key sectoral types likely to be most affected: utilities such as water, waste treatment, electricity and gas; certain manufacturing sectors such as machinery and fabricated metal products; construction and its related sectors like quarrying and cement. These all share the trait of being low `value density' sectors: relatively, it takes a lot of fuel to move their goods over distance. Geographically, while some inland zones are affected, it is those most geographically isolated zones, as well as certain other coastal bands, that are most negatively affected by distance cost increases. Some specific places involved in petroleum and its processing also appear to be particularly vulnerable. \n&quot;New and improved research methods or skills&quot;\nThe process of developing GRIT's methodology has led to a number of technical innovations. The central method of GRIT is itself a methodolical innovation. The approach of combining non-spatial trade flow input-output data with spatial information from the BSD has been shown to produce effective results.\nOne of GRIT's key aims has been to examine the impact of fuel cost changes on the industrial structure of the UK. Rather than concentrating on specific fuel cost changes, a novel method has been developed that shows per-sector and per-zone change is relatively stable at a range of plausible changes in distance cost values, calibrated around known goods flows from Department for Transport data. This method of parameter-sweeping around real-world distance data is a novel way of dealing with otherwise extremely difficult calibration issues to produce useful results and signpost the most promising research paths. \n\n&quot;Important new research resources identified / important new research questions opened up&quot;\nGRIT has successfully identified a new source of information on the spatial economic structure of the UK's economy by combining its two key data sources with a novel method of estimating trade flows between regions. The essential approach is sound, and there is a great deal of potential to exploit this approach further - for example by building a longitudinal version, looking at years beyond 2010 or working with input-output modellers to cross-validate. GRIT's results clearly identify three broad sectors likely to be most affected by increases in fuel costs: utilities, heavy manufacturing and construction-related industries. Utilities such as water, waste, sewage processing and electricity generation that are central to the UK's infrastructure may be interested in taking GRIT's methods forward, in order to dig deeper into possible future spatial outcomes and plan accordingly. Other private sector industries identified may also be interested. Given that this would require Secure Data Service access, joint academic/industry projects could be the way to pursue this.\nMore strategic-level government bodies may also be interested in taking GRIT's method forward, particularly for climate change and transport planning.\nThere are further potential academic collaborations that could follow on from the project. Work done on input-output modelling has some crossover with GRIT. Though the methods are different, there may be scope for introducing a spatial component to an input-output model, as well as investigating how supply/demand changes modelled through input-output would impact on GRIT's findings. Refinement of the GRIT method itself would be particularly suitable for a PhD project – another potential route for working with industry through, for example, a CASE award.
