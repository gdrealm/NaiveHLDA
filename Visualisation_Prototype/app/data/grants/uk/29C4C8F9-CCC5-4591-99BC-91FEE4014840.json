The ultimate aim is generating strains for pest control. We evaluated the performance of one system, and identified components that worked as predicted and others that did not work as predicted. Continued optimisation is required to achieve a working system. This project was in collaboration with a biotech company. A working system can be used by them in insect pest control products. It would also be of great use to others working in basic biological research requiring novel methods to regulate gene expression.
