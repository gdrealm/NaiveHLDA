Police on horseback are used primarily in public-order police work, particularly in the policing of large crowds, as well as for a number of other functions such as urban patrols. Mounted police represent a symbol of physical force as well as a connection to past eras of policing. They are thought to calm crowds and avert disorder in ways ‘standard’ police activity cannot. They are also among the most poorly-understood tools in modern public police work.</p>\n\n<p>In current conditions of austerity mounted police are, like many other police units or activities, under threat of retrenchment or elimination. Yet policy decisions are being undertaken without recourse to evidence, since virtually no focused research has ever been conducted with mounted police. There is no empirical basis on which to make claims regarding their utility.</p>\n\n<p>This project will investigate the ways in which mounted police work is experienced in the UK through a unique observational methodology, alongside focus groups with police officers and citizens. This research will build an evidence base for future strategies and priorities regarding mounted policing. The project is supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and mounted police units across the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001918/1","grantId":"ES/L001918/1","fundValue":"55066","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This project has constituted the first in-depth academic investigation in the use of horses in policing. While we are still in the process of finalising the outputs of this project, our findings have already been used to inform work conducted by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), and in particular its 'Mounted Working Group'; and to help inform funding decisions taken by police organisations in the UK and Australia. \n\nSpecifically, findings from the project have been used in:\n- The development of national guidance on mounted police within the ACPO operational support management area\n- The development of a collaborative arrangement between Gloucestershire and A&amp;amp;S for sharing of mounted resources\n\nWe will be hosting a national mounted police symposium in Oxford on the 19th November 2014 to present the findings of the project and launch its final report. This event will be attended by: academics; police representatives from the UK and overseas; the College of Policing; and Police and Crime Commissioners and others involved in the governance of policing. \n\nThe project has already received considerable press attention, with both Giacomantonio and Bradford being interviewed on local television in the South West. There have also been several reports on the project in the printed media.

Our findings coalesce around a number of main points.\n\n1. While it is often assumed they are primarily a public order resource, mounted police spend substantially more time on neighbourhood-level patrol or supporting local policing than any other area of activity. \n\n2. In neighbourhood settings, mounted police patrols are associated with higher levels of visibility, trust and confidence in police.\n\n3. In both neighbourhood and peaceful crowd settings, mounted police generate far greater levels of public engagement, by volume over similar time periods, than foot officers.\n\n4. In demonstration or public disorder settings, mounted police do not provide substantial public-engagement value, and their value in these situations appears mostly tactical.\n\n5. In specific instances where coercive crowd control is required, mounted police provide a unique capacity to control crowds that does not have an obvious equivalent amongst other available police tools. \n\n6. Based on our estimates, mounted police cost approximately &pound;6,550 per annum more than officers in other operational support roles (e.g. dog units, armed police units).\n\n7. There are substantial points of commonality between the ways in which mounted police are used in the UK and the ways in which they are used in other countries. Our findings are already being used by our police partners in a number of ways, for example to help in resource allocation at various levels within the police service. Findings from the final report will feed into the work of ACPOs 'mounted working group'. Moreover, we have received requests for the final research findings from police in other countries including Australia, Denmark and Germany, for use in supporting organisational reform.
