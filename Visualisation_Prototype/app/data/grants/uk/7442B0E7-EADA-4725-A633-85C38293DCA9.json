Unsafe abortion is the most easily prevented cause of maternal death. Post-abortion care (PAC) is a strategy to address the problem of the outcomes of unsafe abortion.This research aims to establish how investment in safe abortion services impacts on the socio-economic conditions of women and their households, and the implications for policy-making and service provision in Zambia.</p>\n\n<p>The microeconomic impact of out-of-pocket health expenditure for&nbsp; reproductive health and abortion care, have received little attention.The data available for sub-Saharan Africa are particularly scanty and poor quality.</p>\n\n<p>The approach is multi-disciplinary, with primary data collection of both qualitative and quantitative data, including a quantitative survey and in-depth qualitative interviews with women who have sought PAC, and policymaker interviews.</p>\n\n<p>Zambia's relatively liberal legal context, and the existence of PAC provision facilitates research on issues related to abortion which can have broader lessons for developments elsewhere in the region.The majority of women seeking abortion-related care in Zambia do so for PAC following an unsafe abortion, and have not accessed safe abortion services.This demands better understanding and analysis.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0626","grantId":"RES-167-25-0626","fundValue":"256726","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings are being written for publication in peer-reviewed journal articles.\nFindings have been presented at a range of international conferences and invited presentations with academic, policy and professional audiences.\nImpact of findings now being further developed in linked Impact Maximisation Grant Education,Healthcare Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Ernestina Elizabeth Coast","coPersons":["Bellington  Vwalika","Tiziana  Leone","Christine  Kaseba","Divya  Parmar","Cristina  Masseria","Susan Fairley  Murray"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":" 1. Trajectories and pathways to seeking an abortion are complex.\n2. Younger women are more likely to seek an unsafe abortion.\n3. The health system costs of providing care after unsafe abortions are substantially higher (est. 2.5 times) than providing safe abortion.\n4. Levels of knowledge about the legal status of abortion in Zambia are very low.\n5. Zambia is not yet realising the substantial investment (legal and health services) in safe abortion\n6. Poorer women more likely to seek an unsafe abortion\n7.
