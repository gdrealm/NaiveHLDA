{"id":"B9F47CE8-9D22-44B5-9DAC-03377418CEAE","title":"Modern Futures","abstractText":"This interdisciplinary research network brings together academics, representatives from the creative industries, policy-makers, and activist groups to explore the legacies and possible futures of modern architecture: buildings like Birmingham Central Library, London's South Bank Centre, St Peter's Seminary and Preston Bus Station, whose future is currently being actively debated. \n\nIn September 2013 Preston Bus Station was granted listed Grade II status following a sustained period of campaigning that involved conservation societies, architectural enthusiasts, local activists, artists, filmmakers and everyday bus users supporting this example of Brutalist architecture. Such widespread public support and interest in post-war modernism (although long the focus of architectural conservation societies) is a recent phenomenon. It took fifteen years of lobbying and campaigning to get Preston Bus Station listed, yet it was only in the last two years that the fate of this municipally owned building became something that garnered national and international attention. This is a reflection of the new and diverse interpretations of modern architecture that are now emerging, and of the novel activist and creative alliances that are being formed to celebrate and campaign for particular buildings and styles. \n\nComing at a moment when post-war architectural modernism is the focus of growing interest, but is still controversial and contested, an examination of the possible futures of this building style is critical and timely. Drawing on the perspectives of academics, professionals and community groups, the network will ask, for example, how is modern architecture valued (economically, socially and politically)? Who is speaking out for this architectural style? What groups and alliances have formed around particular buildings threatened with demolition? What gets knocked down, what gets saved? Who decides - market forces or public opinion? How might modern buildings be adapted and reused if their original purpose is no longer relevant? What does listed status mean for modern buildings? A safe future, or being destined to be mothballed as examples of 'historic interest'? The answers will provide new directions for conservation and regeneration policy, academic debate, and creative practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L015323/1","grantId":"AH/L015323/1","fundValue":"17052","fundStart":"2014-10-29","fundEnd":"2015-12-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hannah  Neate","coPersons":["Ruth  Craggs"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
