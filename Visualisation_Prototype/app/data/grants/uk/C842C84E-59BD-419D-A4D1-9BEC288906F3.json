{"id":"C842C84E-59BD-419D-A4D1-9BEC288906F3","title":"The Dynamics of Religious Change: An International Comparative Analysis","abstractText":"<p>This project will provide an empirical analysis of the dynamics of religious change in seven advanced industrial nations (Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, the US and the UK) using longitudinal and time-series data. Two problems underlie the research: some countries are more religious than others, and the socio-demographic mechanisms producing religious change have seldom been clarified empirically. Religious change in a national population reflects some combination of period, cohort (or generation) and age effects, with immigration and differential fertility being possible additional contributors. </p> \n<p>The aim is to determine the relative impact of these factors in the seven countries studied. The proximate causes of religious change provide vital clues about the underlying sociological influences at work (and whether they vary between nations), issues that will be investigated empirically. If, for example, cohort effects are important, one can examine why inter-generational transmission is sometimes successful and sometimes not: is it mostly to do with the family or the extra-familial environment? If age effects are important, is it a pure age effect or due to age-related life course events? If particular time periods are important, do they affect all generations or just the young?</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1410-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-1410-A","fundValue":"32936","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Voas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
