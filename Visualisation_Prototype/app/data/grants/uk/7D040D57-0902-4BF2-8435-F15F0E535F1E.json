The four sets of activities for which support is sought are targeted at different career points.&nbsp; They are: (1) the establishment of a formal panel that comprises stakeholders within the management and business community to oversee the development of capacity building within the sector (2007/08); (2) the mainstreaming of a number of a number of methodological developments from the wider social sciences into management research (2007/08); (3) continuing support for an annual doctoral symposium (2008/09 and 2009/10); and (4) biennial workshops on writing qualitative and quantitative articles for top rated journals, targeted at mid-career and senior academics (2007/08 and 2009/10). \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F018711/1","grantId":"ES/F018711/1","fundValue":"84870","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marie Louise McHughIan Michael  Clarke","coPersons":["Gail  Clarkson"],"organisation":"British Academy of Management","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
