Early lifestyle changes including stable weight loss and low calorie diet can be effective, but in late stage disease many patients do not respond to current therapies. There is evidence that metabolic cells and immune cells co-localize in adipose (fat) tissue as a result of an evolutionary need to store energy in times of food deprivation and yet provide energy to mount an immune response during infection. This delicate balance appears to be disrupted in the context of over-nutrition, or obesity, and can lead to a chronic activation of immune pathways and serious complications such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It is thought that some immune cells in adipose tissue can produce protective anti-inflammatory factors, whilst other cells can produce pro-inflammatory factors that lead to problems such as more insulin resistance and diabetes. In this project I plan to investigate the role of a newly identified type of immune cell, named natural helper cells, which are found in adipose tissue, and are thought to produce protective anti-inflammatory factors. The aim of this application is to learn how these cells can be manipulated to control immune responses in adipose tissue and prevent the development of complications during obesity such as diabetes. Techniques have been developed to isolate and characterize these cells. These techniques enable the study of these cells during the progression of obesity and diabetes using humane mouse models.\nIn summary, I have built a strong foundation in the areas of immunology and cardiovascular disease, developing techniques to study immune cell function during obesity. I believe that the study of these new cells will generate important information about how immune responses can be controlled in adipose tissue during obesity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K019716/1","grantId":"MR/K019716/1","fundValue":"181580","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley  Miller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
