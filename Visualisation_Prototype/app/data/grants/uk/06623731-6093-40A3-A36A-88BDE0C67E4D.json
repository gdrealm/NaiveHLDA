Within the brain, this tube expands into a series of larger chambers, each lined with a specialised, blood vessel enriched tissue called the choroid plexus. This plexus acts as a barrier between the blood system and brain, protecting nerve cells from infection. It also makes the cerebrospinal fluid, which fills the neural tube. Problems in the development of this system of chambers, named ventricles, and their choroid plexus are associated with a variety of developmental disorders in humans from hydrocephalus to schizophrenia. Despite its significance, many fundamental questions about the development of the choroid plexus remain unanswered. How is its formation coordinated with both neural development and the blood supply growing in from the body? Why do ventricles and choroid plexus form in the brain but not the spinal cord? We believe that the answers to first of these questions lie at the junction between the choroid plexus and the brain. Here, the secreted molecules that play a role in organising how nerve cells grow may also signal to the developing blood vessels and tissues of the plexus. We believe that clues as to why only some brain regions make choroid plexus lie in events that occur at and just after the neural tube forms. Patterns and pathways of cell mixing at the edges of the tube as they knit together appear point to fundamental differences between brain and spinal cord. Our proposal will address these questions in simple animal model systems where cell movements, gene function and blood vessel growth can be visualised and manipulated using cutting edge experimental approaches. The results of our experiments will contribute to the fundamental knowledge of brain development that underlies advances in neurology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I021507/1","grantId":"BB/I021507/1","fundValue":"370450","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant is still ongoing.

The roof plate gives rise to the choroid plexus which produces the cerebrospinal fluid the fills the cavities of the brain and supports it within the meninges. We showed that this tissue's development is stimulated by Delta-Notch signalling - a key molecular interaction that is used in a variety of tissues in the body during development. The significance of the choroid plexus in coordinating brain development has only recently been fully recognised. It regulates stem cell niches in the brain and regulates plasticity. Our data is an important platform for future research on this tissue. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
