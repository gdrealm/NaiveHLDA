The pathways aimed to meet the UK's target of an\n80% cut on 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The team developed and applied tools to\nanalyse the technical feasibility, social acceptability and environmental and economic impacts of these\npathways. The research built a sound platform from which to address the challenge of realising a low\ncarbon transition.\n\nThe aim of the new project is to explore what needs to be done to achieve a transition that successfully\naddresses the energy policy 'trilemma', i.e. the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable\nenergy services. We focus on electricity, but in a context that includes the electrical provision of heat and\ntransport, and key EU developments and policies. The project will inform thinking and decision-making\nabout technological and behavioural developments, and the roles of key energy system 'actors',\ngovernance arrangements and regulations in a low carbon transition. The team will:\n\n1. Analyse actors' choices and decisions in past, current and prospective developments in electricity\nsupply and demand;\n\n2. Analyse the social, behavioural and technical drivers and implications of electricity users' responses\nto incentives on the demand side and how to integrate these responses into electricity systems;\n\n3. Undertake techno-economic modelling and energy and environmental assessments of the\ndevelopments in electricity supply (including transmission and distribution networks) needed to\nmeet this responsive demand.\n\nThis research will inform decision-making by central and local government policy-makers, energy firms -\nboth incumbents and new entrants, and civil society groups with an interest in energy policy. Following\nanalysis by the Committee on Climate Change and in view of its commitments under national and\nEuropean targets, the UK government is envisioning a rapid expansion of low-carbon electricity generation\nas a key means of moving towards a low carbon economy. However, this will require significant and interconnected\nchanges in the patterns of energy service demands, market and regulatory frameworks and\nenergy company business models, as well as technological innovation and deployment. This research aims\nto inform decision-making by:\n\n1. investigating how the choices and interactions of actors and structural factors could contribute to the\nrealisation of low carbon pathways, and what are likely to be key decision or branching points;\n2. assessing the role of future demand responses, understanding the factors that drive energy demand\nand energy-using behaviour, and integrating this analysis within a whole-systems framework of\nelectricity system development;\n3. developing a set of interacting and complementary tools to analyse electricity network infrastructure\ninvestment and operational decisions, in order to model decisions to invest in the range of fossil\nand low carbon generation, taking into account market design and subsidy mechanisms;\n4. appraising the energy and environmental performance of the technological mix, on a whole systems\nbasis, analysing future economic costs, benefits, risks and returns, and uncertainties, and using\neconomic models to explore wider social welfare, growth and employment impacts.\n\nThese strands of research will be brought together to form a 'whole systems analysis' of the technical,\nenvironmental, economic, and social implications of alternative transition pathways to a UK low carbon\nelectricity future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K005316/1","grantId":"EP/K005316/1","fundValue":"2566730","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Key findings from the project are being used via dissemination across a wider audience. A series of small workshops have been held, where speakers have been invited from niche community energy projects in the UK to share their work and find out more about the Consortium's work. There have also been numerous publications made throughout the project which are now publicly available. The Consortium has developed approaches to wider extensive communication and engagement, including public audiences, though the dedicated project website (http://www.realisingtransitionpathways.org.uk/) and a social media presence through Twitter @RealisingTP. \nThe Consortium has been closely engaged with members of its Advisory Board, that is chaired by James Smith (Chairman of the Carbon Trust, and ex-CEO of Shell UK), and includes representatives from UK Government departments and agencies (the Committee on Climate Change, DECC, EPSRC, and Ofgem), industry (E.On UK, National Grid, Rolls Royce, RWE npower, and Western Power Distribution), and other stakeholders. \nMany of the Co-Investigators have also been involved in wider dissemination via public events such as Cafe Scientifique and meetings with climate friendly communities, as well as the 'University Research Day Schools Project' in Scotland. \nThe Consortium is currently finalising an interdisciplinary exploration of the Thousand Flowers pathway, via a report entitled 'Distributing power: A transition to a civic energy future', which is due to be launched in spring 2015.

The pathways (Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers) explore the roles of market, governance and civil society actors respectively in realising a transition to a UK low carbon electricity system. These are currently undergoing revision to take account of energy sector developments since 2010. The focus of the overall work is on electricity but in a context that includes the electrical provision of heat and transport, and key EU developments and policies. To date the project has developed and applied a variety of tools (models) and approaches to analyse the technical feasibility, environmental impacts, economic consequences, and societal acceptability of the core pathways. The project is further exploring the constraints and opportunities in realising a low carbon UK energy sector, including those stemming from European developments. This involves a series of new studies on historical transition experiences, 'branching points' on pathways, strategic issues (including horizon scanning of medium-term technological developments on the supply-side, the network infrastructure and the demand-side over the period to 2050), as well as network, market simulation and behavioural modelling, with 'whole systems' appraisal' of key energy technologies and the full pathways within a 'sustainability framework'. \nTo help with this, the research is being carried out under four interlocking groupings or 'Wedges': Wedge A: Pathways, Actors and Governance; Wedge B: Integrating Demand Response; Wedge C: Systems and Network Modelling and Evaluation; and Wedge D: Strategic Appraisal and Decision Making. Work across the Consortium has thus led to the development and production of numerous cross-wedge and co-authored publications, including a Special Section on journal Energy Policy on 'Transition Pathways to a Low Carbon Economy', vol. 52, pp.1-840. The Consortium has also been invited to prepare a book by the publishers Springer UK. The findings from the project could be taken forward via various means, including: academic publications, the project website (http://www.realisingtransitionpathways.org.uk/) and Twitter @RealisingTP. The Consortium is currently finalising an interdisciplinary exploration of the Thousand Flowers pathway, via a report entitled 'Distributing power: A transition to a civic energy future', which is due to be launched in spring 2015 and will be widely available. At the end of the project in 2016 it is proposed that a final dissemination conference will be held to provide an overview of the findings from the project and proposed future work - including invited speakers. Invitation to the event will be open to all, including: Ofgem, DECC, CCC, the energy sector, government, industry and the general public.
