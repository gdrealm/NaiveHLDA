This covers the structure of future systems which will both be highly parallel and need to cope with the variability of circuits resulting from their continuing miniaturisation. Other areas of concern are the need for tools to design these complex systems and the way in which programs are written and controlled on the future hardware.This is a rapidly developing area and the resources of the Platform Grant will enable the group to develop their research to maintain a position at the forefront of the subject.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G013500/1","grantId":"EP/G013500/1","fundValue":"1154980","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project provided general support for APT group activities.
