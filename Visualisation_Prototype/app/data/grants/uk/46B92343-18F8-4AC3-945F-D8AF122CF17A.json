In particular, building on its work in the area of integration and extremism, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) aims to increase its knowledge and understanding about right-wing extremism. In co-operation with the DCLG as project partner, the aims of this six-month knowledge-exchange are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>support impact-generation from past research while contributing directly to the work of a national-level policy community</li>\n\n <li>to promote the application of accumulated academic knowledge on right-wing extremism and related issues</li>\n\n <li>to strengthen wider networks between academics and policy-makers</li>\n\n <li>to facilitate the co-production of creative and concrete policy ideas. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project is anchored in a six-month placement at DCLG, where the applicant will draw on his past research, and also the work of other social scientists, to directly inform policy development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020907/1","grantId":"ES/J020907/1","fundValue":"31661","fundStart":"2012-08-31","fundEnd":"2013-03-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  My findings have been used across central UK government as this secondment fed into the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Home Office, Downing Street and other government agencies.
