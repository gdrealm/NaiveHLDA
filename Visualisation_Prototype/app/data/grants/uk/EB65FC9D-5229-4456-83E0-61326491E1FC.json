However, our capacity to generate sufficient food, animal feed and energy is increasingly\ncompromised by human population expansion, competition for land use, rapid biodiversity loss and predicted global climate\nchange. The process of sexual reproduction in higher plants is of particular importance for the aim of increasing crop yields,\novercoming hybridization barriers and selecting and fixing quality traits. Before we can develop tools to manipulate plant\nreproduction in our favour we must achieve a deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying gamete\ndevelopment and double fertilization mechanisms in angiosperms.\nThe project will deliver the first comprehensive view of the molecular evolution of plant sexual reproduction and will provide\ninsights into the origins of double fertilization in flowering plants. In addition, gene expression data and the networks\ngenerated will be valuable in understanding the evolution of biological pathways and gene function prediction beyond the\nfocus on reproduction in this project. In parallel, the work on crop species will identify genes useful to the agricultural\nindustry to enable precision control of plant reproduction, to overcome hybridization barriers and to promote better breeding\nschemes by improving hybrid seed production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N005279/1","grantId":"BB/N005279/1","fundValue":"389910","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jose F Gutierrez-Marcos","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
