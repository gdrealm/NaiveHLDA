In severe cases the disease leads to loss of the teeth and there is growing evidence that people with this disease may be more susceptible to other conditions including heart disease. Over &pound;270 million is currently spent annually by the General Dental Services of the NHS on periodontal disease treatment and its consequences. Hence there are significant clinical and financial pressures to develop improved methods of diagnosis control and of this disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the most important bacterial causes of periodontal disease. One of the critical characteristics of this bacterium is its ability to live in the mouth of an affected individual for a long period of time despite the actions of the body!\ns immune defences. In this work we aim to understand the how three components of the surface of P. gingivalis are constructed. In particular we will examine a the steps in their synthesis which appear to be common to all three and which may prove useful therapeutic targets. In the longer term a better understanding of the biology of this bacterium and the mechanisms it uses to survive in patients can be expected to lead to the development of novel methods for the treatment of this disease and related chronic infectious diseases of human","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501478","grantId":"G0501478","fundValue":"585109","fundStart":"2006-07-16","fundEnd":"2009-07-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Anthony Curtis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
