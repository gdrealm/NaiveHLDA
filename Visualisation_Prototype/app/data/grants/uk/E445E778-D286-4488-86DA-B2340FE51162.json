The network does not &quot;understand&quot; what is being transferred, i.e., it is not content-aware. This agnostic mode of operation affects several of its key functionalities, for example, efficient content distribution and content-aware traffic engineering. As a result, the network is not able to cope well with the exponentially increasing amounts of multimedia content access which constitute the major mode of use in recent years. Fixed and mobile network providers keep continuously upgrading their infrastructures but the situation has become unsustainable due to their eroding profit margins. There is an urgent need to rethink traffic management under the umbrella of active content management, rather than passive content transfer, allowing ISPs to control traffic better and achieve a sustainable model for the long-term evolution of their networks. New approaches that maximise traffic localisation are essential for long-term global network sustainability.\n\nIn this context, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged as an alternative to the current host-to-host communication paradigm and proposes direct communication between user applications and the content itself, putting the actual information or content in the forefront and disregarding location. In ICN, the network transfers individual, identifiable content chunks, instead of data containers, i.e. packets, with opaque data. Contents are identified by name and relevant packets contain a part of a content chunk; the latter can be retrieved from the hosting server or from an in-network router cache, given that in-network caching is a key aspect of the ICN paradigm. Popular content tends to stay longer in network caches and &quot;anycast routing&quot; based on content names retrieves the closest copy to the user. This increases dramatically traffic localisation, avoids flash crowd effects and gives to network providers control over the information transferred, allowing them to engineer their networks based on the actual demand for named content.\n\nDespite the considerable amount of effort that has been invested to date by the research community in location-independent routing based on content names, a widely acceptable and scalable solution is yet to be found. Any naming scheme would have to be able to accommodate 10**12 or more objects and content resolution and routing based solely on content names raises serious scalability concerns. In addition, the current IP-based Internet represents a massive infrastructure that cannot be easily replaced by a new, clean slate design. Having this in mind, and given our considerable research experience in the ICN area, we believe it is possible to achieve the ICN benefits of traffic localisation and sustainable network evolution without radical ICN approaches but by introducing, in an evolutionary manner, a &quot;content layer&quot; in the Internet architecture which will operate above the current network layer and below the transport layer, i.e. layer 3.5.\n\nThis layer will intercept communication, will produce unique location-independent names for requested content and will store the latter within the network according to sophisticated caching policies. Content will be accessed in an anycast fashion using ICN style of operation but overlaid over IP, exploiting the existence of scalable IP-based routing, maintaining full backwards compatibility and protecting current investment. In addition, congestion control will be dealt with in a hop-by-hop rather than an end-to-end basis within the content layer, maintaining at the same time compatibility with current end-to-end operation while maximizing the use of available network resources, increasing user quality of experience and paving the way for future Internet applications with stringent real-time requirements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K019589/1","grantId":"EP/K019589/1","fundValue":"486939","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our &quot;Icarus&quot; simulator has already been used by other members of the community and relevant labs in order to evaluate in-network caching algorithms.

This new paradigm requires changes both to the network core, but also to the end-points (i.e., user terminals). Research in this area has so far focused on clean slate designs that necessitate a complete replacement of the current Internet infrastructure. Throughout the last 5 year period and after intense research by clean slate projects, it has become apparent that deployment of this new networking paradigm will be difficult due to the massive investment required by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\nThe primary focus of the COMIT project and its design target is the evolutionary shift of the current IP-based architecture to an ICN one. We have argued that this shift should build on the current infrastructure and shouldrequire minimum investment from ISPs and content providers. In other words, the benefits gained from this investment should outweigh the investment itself. Given the project runs for less than a year, so far, we have made the following key main contributions: \n\ni) We have designed the main functionality of the architecture, which allows for incremental deployment and shift to a content-oriented operation (i.e., not all ISPs want/can shift together to an ICN mode of operation). Our findings are not yet published, but we have received positive feedback from experienced industrial colleagues in the area.\n\nii) The daunting problem of congestion control in the Internet, an issue that is constantly being investigated as the demand-supply ratio can be solved in much more efficient ways using an ICN mode of operation. The conceptual ideas and the initial results of this new way to manage network congestion in the Internet has recently been published in the highly selective ACM Hot Topics in Networks Workshop (HotNets 2014) conference [1].\n\niii) Information-Centric Networks demand that information being transferred throughout the network is exposed in the packet header through a &quot;content name&quot;. So far, the information exposed in content names has mainly included routing information, ignoring other interesting and useful factors. In [2] we have argued that the content name can include much more information that can help the network to make more informed decisions on how to handle the content.\n\niv) One of the main benefits of the ICN operational model is its ability to make the Internet a native content distribution network, in contrast to simply an end-to-end communication system (as today). A basic building block of this functionality comes from the in-network caching feature of ICNs, or in other words the ability of the network to bring content closer to the users, from where it can be retrieved in a faster and more resource efficient manner. To evaluate the benefits of in-network caching, we have developed a simulator, which we have made available in the public domain for the community (the &quot;Icarus&quot; simulator). This work has been presented in the ICST Simutools conference [3] and the simulator has already been used by other research groups in the area.\n\nWe are confident that building on these initial findings we will facilitate the adoption of the ICN paradigm by ISPs, which is our key target.\n\n\n[1] Ioannis Psaras, Lorenzo Saino, George Pavlou, &quot;Revisiting Resource Pooling: The Case for In-Network Resource Sharing&quot;, in Proc. of ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks 2014 (HotNets 2014), Los Angeles, California, Oct 2014.\n\n[2] Kostantinos V.

This extension of our proposed scheme has already received interest from the community and we expect that our solutions will be also used in this domain.
