{"id":"2F1679DB-795C-4709-8459-4B8F15FBABE4","title":"Quantifying Age-related Changes in the Mechanical Properties of Tissues","abstractText":"As people get older the mechanical properties of the body change and many components of the cardiovascular system become stiffer. Stiffening of the arteries has been implicated in increased mortality from heart failure, stroke and aneurysms. Arterial stiffening can also occur through the action of other age-related conditions, e.g. raised blood pressure, diabetes and kidney failure. Collectively, these failures of the cardiovascular system are the most common cause of death in the western world. Other tissues within the body can also deteriorate with time and although not life threatening, can seriously affect the quality of life, e.g. debilitating lower back pain is associated with the mechanical deterioration of the intervertebral disc. Cosmetic changes with age are also important for personal well being and the global market in anti-ageing treatments is forecast to exceed $250 billion by 2015; development of such personal care products is an important part of the British economy. Thus understanding how the ageing process leads to the stiffening of tissue is important in improving life expectancy and importantly, improving the well being of the population as a greater proportion of the population is living longer.\nOne obstacle to our understanding of how ageing changes the mechanical properties of tissue is the relatively primitive methods currently used to measure them. These were originally developed to measure the properties of engineering materials such as metals and polymers; these are much stiffer than biological materials and are simpler in composition. However, recent developments in mechanical testing methods allow us to now use a technique called nanoindentation that can be used to measure the mechanical properties, not only of tissue but also of the microscopic components that cause the changes in properties with age. By further developing this new technique we will be able to explore how changes in these components that occur during ageing, which can be monitored using microscope observation, degrade the stiffness and other mechanical properties. Because the volumes of material sampled are so small, the technique will allow us to measure the properties of human tissue using a minimally invasive approach. This can then be used to monitor the progress of ageing and chronic disease and any treatment used to alleviate symptoms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001398","grantId":"G1001398","fundValue":"900268","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Derby","coPersons":["(John) Kennedy  Cruickshank","Christopher Ernest Griffiths","Michael  Sherratt","Riaz  Akhtar","Rachel Elizabeth Watson"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
