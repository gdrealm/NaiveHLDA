{"id":"12C784BE-681D-4CDE-84F9-4CCEBA494D2A","title":"Public Spirit","abstractText":"Public Spirit is a proposed new on-line public forum featuring research, analysis and debate on religion and public policy. Public Spirit will provide a space for academics, policymakers, politicians and practitioners from voluntary, community and faith-based organisations to engage with current research and debates on religion and public policy, in a forum that crosses political affiliations and religious traditions, supported by regular off-line events. The proposal for this online public forum emerges from the project 'Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance' (MPCG) that is jointly funded by the AHRC and ESRC through the Religion and Society Programme. The online forum will provide a mechanism for further disseminating the project's findings to a range of policy, practitioner and civil society audiences, through a series of short articles on specific aspects of the research. It will connect these findings to broader contemporary debates about religion and public policy, by hosting contributions from a wide range of public actors who are actively engaged in these debates. \nIssues relating to religion and public policy have generated considerable interest in recent times - with both New Labour and the present Coalition government according particular significance to religion and faith groups in policies on cohesion, integration, equalities, welfare, active citizenship and security and counter-terrorism. The anticipated audiences for Public Spirit include policy-makers, practitioners, civil society organisations (e.g. think-tanks, pressure groups, community organisations and religious institutions) and academics. Guided by feedback from our consultation with 44 such actors, the forum will: provide accessible articles on the findings from the MPCG research; connect this research with views and perspectives from a range of actors; provide accessible analysis and reflections on related research; feature spotlights on evidence and analysis on local areas to inform national debates; host debates that bring together academics, policy-makers, think-tanks, pressure groups and religious institutions to engage with and inform one another. \nPublic Spirit will be hosted by the Centre for Ethnicity and Citizenship at the University of Bristol, where the project team will be based. The forum will work with an Editorial Board with a membership from the fields of academia, publishing and politics. The Editorial Board will meet to determine and commission the content for Public Spirit and discuss strategies for impact. \nIn order to maximise the relevance and influence of Public Spirit among wider audiences, we have formed an agreement to partner with the recently formed All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Faith and Society and its Secretariat, FaithAction. This partnership will allow Public Spirit to connect with the actors and audiences engaged with the APPG and FaithAction, whilst providing an additional forum for debate and considered reflection on the issues raised in the work of the APPG. \nThere is at present no blog or forum that focuses on religion and public policy in the UK (at national and local levels), featuring academic research that is presented accessibly and which is engaged with policy, practitioner and civil society discussants and contributors. Public Spirit will provide a unique forum for Knowledge Exchange. Using digital media, it will make the findings of the MPCG project easily accessible to individuals and groups outside of academia who cannot normally easily access conventional scholarly sources. It will significantly increase user engagement with the MPCG project, as well as other related research, and enable Knowledge Exchange among a diverse range of actors concerned with issues relating to religion and public policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K004042/1","grantId":"AH/K004042/1","fundValue":"92369","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Therese  O'Toole","coPersons":["Tariq  Modood"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
