Patients with type 2 diabetes are unable to control their blood sugar (glucose) level properly. As a result, the blood glucose level of these patients is too high most of the time. This so-called chronic hyperglycaemia can lead to many medical complications including disorders of the heart, kidney, eye and brain. Type 2 diabetes thus poses an enormous burden on healthcare systems and budgets and it is therefore very important to understand how this metabolic disease arises. The blood glucose level of healthy people is kept constant through an interaction between multiple organs. When the blood glucose level increases, for example after a meal, the pancreas (more specifically, the pancreatic beta cells of the islets of Langerhans) secretes insulin. This hormone ?tells? skeletal muscle and the liver to take up and store glucose, respectively, and thereby restores the original blood glucose level. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by pancreatic beta cells relies heavily on mitochondria, the cells? powerhouses. Beta cells burn glucose as a fuel and their mitochondria use the released energy to make ATP, a signal that triggers insulin secretion. Surprisingly, beta cell mitochondria contain a protein, UCP2, which uncouples glucose burning from ATP synthesis. Because UCP2 activity essentially wastes energy and lowers GSIS as a result, UCP2 has been put forward as a possible mediator in the development of type 2 diabetes. If UCP2 were indeed responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes, then it would be an attractive therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease. However, it seems almost impossible that UCP2 would have survived millions of years of evolution just to make us ill: from an evolutionary perspective, UCP2 activity in beta cells must have an outcome that benefits us under certain conditions. My research aims to identify this benefit and thus clarify the evolved, physiological function of the beta cell UCP2. In particular, I will use beta cell models and isolated pancreatic islets to test my hypothesis that UCP2 fine-tunes the insulin secretion response of beta cells to continuous fluctuations in nutrient supply. My research will improve the fundamental understanding of beta cell behaviour. Such understanding will establish if UCP2 is a safe therapeutic target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100165","grantId":"G1100165","fundValue":"434679","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Affourtit","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
