{"id":"74E754C8-B2C3-4C97-B7C9-F583F9BCA1EB","title":"Interfacial domain structure of polycrystalline semiconducting polymer films","abstractText":"The objective of the proposed research is to use cutting-edge synchrotron-based techniques to answer fundamental questions regarding the operation of real-world organic electronic devices. Electronic devices based on organic (carbon-based) semiconductors are just beginning to enter the market place enabling a new generation of low-cost, flexible electronic displays and devices. Unlike traditional inorganic semiconductor materials such as Silicon, organic semiconductors have a highly complicated and often disordered film structure. Therefore to improve our understanding of the operation of these devices we need to fully characterise the structure of these films. Synchrotron-based microscopes are powerful tools that are ideally suited to this task that allow for the bulk and surface structure of materials to be probed with sub-micrometre resolution. Additionally, the use of lower energy soft X-rays with energies that match the molecular resonances in carbon-based materials allows for additional structural and chemical information to be extracted. The results of this research will help to enable next generation organic semiconductor materials and devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G068356/1","grantId":"EP/G068356/1","fundValue":"131322","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henning  Sirringhaus","coPersons":["Christopher Robert McNeill"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
