Flowering plants have the greatest species number and diversity of any plant group on earth and petals played a critical role in generating this diversity by attracting different pollinators. Many plants can also pollinate themselves and this can be advantageous for weeds like hairy bittercress that invade new habitats. This transition to self-pollination can be associated with petal loss, however, the genetic mechanisms that determine petal number, and how these have varied during evolution, are poorly understood and are hence the focus of our research. Our research aims to understand the genetic changes that underlie changes in petal number between two mustard species, the model organism thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta). These species are closely related and easy to work with in the lab, so genetic and transgenic experiments can be used to identify mechanisms that make these two species look different from each other. Thale cress has a typical mustard flower with four petals while hairy bittercress differs by having fewer petals. We know that one region of the hairy bittercress genome controls a large amount of the variation observed in petal number in this species. We also know that an important gene controlling petal development called LEAFY maps to this genomic region. In order to identify genes that repress petal number in hairy bittercress we induced variation in the genome by mutagenesis and identified mutants that convert hairy bittercress to thale cress petal number. Identifying the genes mutated in these plants will tell us which genes act to reduce petal number in hairy bittercress but not in thale cress. One way that LEAFY regulates petal development is by turning on expression of the APETALA1 gene. Other regulators in thale cress but not in hairy bittercress also turn on this gene. We want to know whether this difference in gene regulation plays a part in making these two species look different from each other. Here, we will determine whether LEAFY or a different gene controls the variation observed in hairy bittercress populations. We will also identify genes that act only in hairy bittercress to reduce petal number. Many of the genetic changes during evolution that produce different-looking species result from changes in the way genes are regulated and we will test whether this is true for the APETALA1 gene in these two mustard species. Thus, species-specific differences in petal number between hairy bittercress and thale cress, and natural variation in this trait between hairy bittercress populations around the world, provide an exciting experimental platform to trace evolution from specific changes in gene regulation through to altered morphologies in nature. Another group of mustards called Brassicas are remarkable for containing more important agricultural and horticultural crops than any other plant genus. Understanding the genetic basis of mustard diversity is therefore a vital part of generating crops for the 21st century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01313X/1","grantId":"BB/H01313X/1","fundValue":"429776","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Hay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
