Analyses will be undertaken using two currently under-utilised micro-datasets in South Africa. Attitudinal perspectives on inequality will be explored using the nationally representative South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS). The unequal spatial distribution of poverty and deprivation will be explored using the South African Indices of Multiple Deprivation (SAIMD) which are derived from the 2001 Census and the 2007 Community Survey (CS 2007).</p>\n\n<p>The analysis of these microdata will be used to gain a better appreciation of the spatial patterns of poverty, deprivation and inequality, the nature and distribution of attitudes to economic inequality and redistribution, and importantly the relationship between them. The project will also build quantitative data analysis skills among social researchers in South Africa. The findings will be used to promote discussion about policies and programmatic interventions to address deprivation, poverty and inequality.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-238-25-0026","grantId":"RES-238-25-0026","fundValue":"79843","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David James McLennan","coPersons":["Michael William Noble","Buxton Sipho Masilela","Benjamin  Roberts"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" *** Objective 1: To make an important contribution to the social policy evidence base concerning socio-economic inequality in South Africa. ***\n\nOur analyses revealed, for the first time, how people's exposure to socio-economic inequality varies geographically according to where they live and where they carry out their routine daily activities. Variations in exposure to inequality were found both between municipalities and, more importantly, within municipalities. We also found that, in terms of public attitudes, there is a broad consensus across South Africa that income inequality is too high and a broad agreement that the government has a responsibility for pro-poor income redistribution. However, in terms of particular policy options, certain disparities in levels of support were found between different population sub-groups which may have important implications for policy acceptance. When we linked the spatial and attitudinal components of the project, we found statistically significant evidence that exposure to inequality does affect people's attitudes to inequality and support for government redistribution, with these effects typically acting differentially by population subgroup.\n\n\n*** Objective 2: To strengthen research networks between social scientists in South Africa and the UK, through close collaborative working. ***\n\nThis project was only possible through very close collaborative working between the UK- and SA-based researchers. Our collaboration has fostered new research ideas and, indeed, generated new research funding as detailed in the 'further funding' section. Negotiations are currently underway between members of this research collaboration and funding bodies in South Africa concerning additional potential new programmes of work. We have also strived to develop our collaboration into a broader research network to involve other relevant academic experts from the UK, SA and elsewhere internationally with a view to submitting further funding applications to both northern and southern hemisphere organisations in future months and years. \n\n\n*** Objective 3: To help build capacity in quantitative methods in South Africa. ***\n\nAll members of the research team, both UK- and SA-based, have gained substantially strengthened quantitative methods skills during this project. The development of quantitative measures of exposure to socio-economic inequality was a new undertaking for the entire team, and indeed one that had not previously been achieved within South Africa. Likewise, the development of multilevel cumulative link ordered logit regression models represented a major advance in quantitative skills, for which we drew heavily upon expert statistical advice and training from the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics. As a by-product of this, we also became skilled in undertaking analyses in the R statistical software package.\n\n\n*** Objective 4: To familiarise UK social scientists with a range of data resources not widely recognised as available for research in South Africa. ***\n\nThe potential value of the South African Index of Multiple Deprivation (based on national Census data) and the South African Social Attitudes Survey have been highlighted through: peer reviewed academic journal articles; the final project report; three policy update/briefing notes; four dissemination videos; presentations at UK and international seminars, workshops and conferences. We have also raised awareness through personal contacts and our growing research networks, collaborations and funding applications. We believe that further academic research is merited to confirm and/or refine certain of the methodological assumptions in our measurement of spatial inequality. Primarily, we believe that qualitative research (which was outside the scope of our ESRC Pathfinder grant) could help to better understand the different ways in which people are exposed to inequality as they go about their daily lives, including through family/friendship networks and through local, national and international media streams. We also believe that the development of new and/or refinement of existing attitudinal questions in SASAS could provide a more nuanced picture of public attitudes to inequality.\n\nIn a policy context, we believe the findings from our research can help to inform and support efforts to realise the South African government's long-term vision for the country as set out in the 'National Development Plan 2012' and the associated initial implementation plan set out in the 'Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019'. To this effect, our research is already being taken forward and promoted across government departments by the Department for Science and Technology. We also anticipate the findings being taken forward in the political sphere via our briefings for Members of Parliament.
