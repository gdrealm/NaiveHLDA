{"id":"19EAA6FC-EB1A-4702-99F0-9F37DE8A7FBD","title":"Precarious Trajectories: Understanding the Human Cost of the Migrant Crisis in the Central Mediterranean.","abstractText":"Context\n\nIn the first six months of 2015 a series of tragic vessel sinkings in the Mediterranean resulting in hundreds of migrant deaths forced the European Union to reconsider its refusal to support the Italian Navy's search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which had been suspended due to a funding dispute in October 2014. In April 2015 the European Council convened an emergency summit at which it was agreed to resume official search and rescue operations. The budget for the Operation Triton border surveillance and search and rescue operation was tripled and Germany, Ireland and the UK agreed to commit naval vessels to support the operation. By June 2015 some 137,000 migrants had made the sea crossing to Southern Europe with Greece (68,000) and Italy (67,500) taking the vast majority of new arrivals according to the UNHCR.\n\nWhile the focus of European policy makers and the western media has centred on the Mediterranean because its dangerous international waters are now the last resort for those desperately fleeing conflict, forced conscription and destitution from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and beyond-the precarious trajectories and the hidden harms experienced by the irregular migrants and refugees are often overlooked and ignored. \n\nAims and Objectives of the Proposal\n\nIn order to develop a rigorous, evidence based account of the human cost of the current Mediterranean emergency we therefore propose a research agenda that seeks to understand and demonstrate\n\n(i) how the Mediterranean crossing is only a segment of more extensive and complex migration trajectories, linking distant countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia on the one side, and splintering across European space on the other\n(ii) how different state and non-state actors can add or reduce friction to the mobility of migrants, thus shaping the directionality of migrants' trajectories as well as the risks to life and liberty faced by migrants and their families, and \n(iii) how conventional governmental and media representations can be qualified or challenged by giving voice to migrants as knowledge bearing subjects.\n\nIn adopting a research perspective that allows us to identify and trace the precarious trajectories of a constantly changing population in search of protection we will also seek to document and explore \n\n- the hidden harms that are experienced by and carried with 'illegalised' migrant populations\n- the complicity of state and non-state actors in both failing to protect those in need because of their nationality status/statelessness and in actively contributing to the physical and psychological risks they face in escaping destitution and danger\n- the role of official organisations and NGOs in promoting a humanitarian response to the migrant crisis and in generally mitigating harm \n- the official and media representation of migrant subjects as bearers of 'collective harm' and radical 'otherness' with respect to western populations, economies and cultural and religious values \n- facilitating alternative representations through auto-ethnography and other migrant subject based counter-narratives \n\nPotential Applications and Benefits\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach will lead to outputs of different formats including\n\n-a documentary film\n-videos of migrants testimonies and of field visits\n-maps of migrants' trajectories and of the spatial practices of the actors they encounter\n-written analyses, articles and reports to be published in academic, policy and news contexts\n\nThese outputs will not only allow us to engage a broad public, our insights will be crucial for policy makers in terms of enabling them to better understand how policies translate at the ground level, and what - at times unexpected - consequences they may have, in particular in terms of making migrants trajectories more or less dangerous or addressing the challenges of integration under the current EU asylum and refugee protocols.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N013697/1","grantId":"ES/N013697/1","fundValue":"137565","fundStart":"2015-09-17","fundEnd":"2016-09-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Frank Parker","coPersons":["Eyal  Weizman","Susan  Clayton"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
