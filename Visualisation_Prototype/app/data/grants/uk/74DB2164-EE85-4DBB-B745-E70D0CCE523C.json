{"id":"74DB2164-EE85-4DBB-B745-E70D0CCE523C","title":"Reconfigurable Autonomy","abstractText":"As computational and engineering applications become more sophisticated, the need for autonomous systems that can act intelligently without direct human intervention increases. Yet the autonomous control at the heart of many such systems is often ad-hoc and opaque. Since the cost of failure in critical systems is high, a more reliable, understandable and consistent approach is needed. Thus, in this project we aim to provide a rational agent architecture that controls autonomous decision-making, is re-usable and generic, and can be configured for many different autonomous platforms. In partnership with the industrial collaborators we aim to show how such &quot;reconfigurable autonomy&quot; can be achieved in relevant applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J011843/1","grantId":"EP/J011843/1","fundValue":"489242","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandor Mihaly Veres","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
