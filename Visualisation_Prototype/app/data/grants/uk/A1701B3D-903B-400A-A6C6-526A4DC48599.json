The reconfigurable NoC fabric will direct the effective communication and exchange of data among the multiple processing tiles and enable fault-tolerance and very high communication bandwidths with low-latency and low energy consumption. The processing tiles will morph their functionality and operation point based on the application demands.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E06065X/1","grantId":"EP/E06065X/1","fundValue":"319957","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas Andrew Edwards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
