It seeks to achieve meaningful policy debate, practical action for research informed improvement to strategy and services, and a synergy that could help to underpin future research. <br /><br />Jointly managed by the University of Sheffield Department of Town and Regional Planning and HQN Ltd, and supported by the Housing Studies Association, the one-year project will create a bespoke network within HQNâ€™s current membership of about 700 housing organisations. There will be three main outputs: a monthly newsletter featuring news and digests of relevant academic and other research, aimed at practitioners, an impact-focused initiative working individually with four organisations to support them in incorporating academic research into their policy and practice or strategic work, and a final event to promote collaboration.<br /><br />The project is led by principal investigator Dr Ed Ferrari with support from Professor John Flint. Researcher Dr Janis Bright will be placed with HQN Ltd to develop the project.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005669/1","grantId":"ES/K005669/1","fundValue":"41271","fundStart":"2013-03-11","fundEnd":"2014-03-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Terence Ferrari","coPersons":["John  Flint"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
