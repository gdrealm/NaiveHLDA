Substantivalists answer yes'; relationalists answer &quot;no&quot;. This question continues to dominate philosophical discussion of the interpretation of general relativity and some leading physicists now connect the debate with conceptual difficulties that lie at the heart of the search for a quantum theory of gravity. \n\nMajority opinion amongst knowledgeable physicists and philosophers was that Einstein's general theory of relativity vindicated substantivalism. But in recent decades this view has lost ground. There has been renewed interest in relationalist approaches to spacetime structure and some are now inclined to reject both substantivalism and relationalism in favour of a view that seeks neither to reduce spacetime to matter, nor to paint it as an entity in its own right. \n\nThe recent rejection of substantivalism is partly motivated by a renewed belief that general relativity breaks with previous spacetime theories by implementing a substantive principle of general covariance. Einstein saw general covariance - the invariance of a theory's equations under smooth but otherwise arbitrary coordinate transformations - as a way to implement a general principle of relativity according to which all frames of reference are physically equivalent. But it was quickly recognized that almost any theory, including extant pre-relativistic theories, can be given a generally covariant formulation. For this reason the consensus quickly became that general covariance has no physical content. But recent reflection on the 3+1 formulation of general relativity central to one of the main approaches to quantizing the theory, and on the related &quot;Problem of Time&quot;, has led some to view the status of group of general coordinate transformations as importantly different in general relativity and In generally covariant formulations of pre-relativistic theories. It is claimed that this has implications for the theories' differential claims about the nature of what's observable, and for what they imply about the existence of spacetime points and regions. \n\nIn The Reality of Spacetime, I review the central, historically significant arguments in the substantivalist-relationalist debate and then bring the lessons learned from this exercise to bear on these recent issues. I defend a view called &quot;sophisticated substantivalism': one should view spacetime as a real entity, but one is not thereby obliged to admit that there are genuinely distinct possibilities that are structurally identical but that differ merely over which spacetime points instantiate which chronogeometrical properties. I argue that this version of substantivalism remains defensible and is, indeed, the most attractive interpretative option, despite these recent claims. In particular, while a principled distinction can be made out between different senses in which theories can be generally covariant, these senses do not support differential interpretative stances to general relativity and pre-relativistic theories. \n\nIt has been a mistake to assimilate the issue of substantivalism versus relationalism to the question of what's special about general relativity. I identify two more significant interpretative issues. The first concerns the action-reaction principle. It is the presence of 'background' fields which violate this principle that underwrites the structure of non-generally-relativistic quantum theories, and it is the absence of such fields in general relativity that entails quantum general relativity must be radically different from more familiar quantum theories. The second concerns whether spacetime is fundamental or whether we should conceive of reality in terms of a dynamically evolving sequence of 3-dimensional entities. I argue that it is this question, not the issue of substantivalism, that is brought to prominence by the Problem of Time","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E506216/1","grantId":"AH/E506216/1","fundValue":"19742","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Oliver  Pooley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
