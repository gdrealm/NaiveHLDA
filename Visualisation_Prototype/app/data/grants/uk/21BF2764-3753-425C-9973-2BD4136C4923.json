This membrane acts as an effective barrier separating the contents of the cell from the external environment. The lipid membrane itself is impermeable to all but a limited number of molecules, however cells need to have a means of efficiently taking up key nutrients and removing waste products. The import and export of a wide range of molecules across the membrane is mediated via a system of specialized proteins called membrane transporters, which are embedded into the lipid layer. These transporter proteins bind a specific substrate or cargo on one side of the membrane, undergo a reconfiguration and then release the substrate on the other side of the membrane. Such a mechanism has the potential to be exploited as a means of getting drugs into cells and this has made transporters the subject of significant interest by pharmaceutical companies. However, our understanding of transporter function for higher-order organisms, the eukaryotes, is currently limited. UapA is an unusually well studied eukaryotic membrane transporter responsible for import of xanthine and uric acid in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. This fungus is particularly amenable to genetic manipulation and this has allowed extensive analysis of mutants of UapA in its native environment. Such studies have provided insights into UapA function, its location within the cell and which parts of the protein are responsible for trafficking to the correct location. However we still lack a detailed picture of how UapA works. Central to increasing understanding of the operation of UapA is a technique called X-ray crystallography which allows us to obtain very detailed information on the arrangement of the atoms within a protein structure. Obtaining such detailed structures of membrane proteins such as transporters remains very challenging as it is necessary to remove the proteins from their membrane environment into a detergent containing solution so they can be isolated and crystallised. We have made substantial progress towards obtaining a detailed structure of UapA, having isolated and crystallised two different forms of the protein and obtained some high resolution structural data. We have also shown that isolated UapA binds xanthine and forms a complex of two protein molecules, a dimer, in solution. The aim of the research outlined in this proposal is to obtain a high resolution structure of UapA by X-ray crystallography. The structure of UapA obtained will be used to guide further investigations into the roles of key regions of the protein in structure and function. We will combine the structural and mutagenic information obtained as part of this study with currently available data on UapA function in order to build up a uniquely detailed picture of how a eukaryotic membrane transporter works.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K017292/1","grantId":"BB/K017292/1","fundValue":"354374","fundStart":"2013-06-10","fundEnd":"2016-06-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Dr Byrne, (PI) presented key research findings at the Ada Lovelace Public Engagement event in October 2013.

However we still lack a detailed picture of how UapA works. The aim of this study is to obtain a high resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of this important protein. We had previously obtained well diffracting crystals of this protein and these have formed the basis of the research undertaken as part of this grant. We have optimised the isolation methods which means we get much more protein allowing us to screen a far greater number of crystallisation conditions from teh same culture volume. The biggest hurdle we face is in obtaining phase information which will allow us to solve the structure. We have obtained 4.4 Angstrom diffraction crystals of UapA labelled with potassium iodide which should allows us to obtain phase information. We are currently optimising these crystals. We have also done some further work on the oligomerisation status of the protein and these findings are being written up now by our collaborators. We anticipate that the manuscript will be submitted in the next couple of months. In addition we have started a programme of mutagenesis to start to explore which amino acid residues are important for stability of the protein. The structure of UapA will provide unprecedented detail into the mechanism of action of eukaryotic transporter proteins. This will be of interest to a range of basic scientists including cell biologists, fungal biologists and structural biologists. In addition, transporters represent a mechanism for drug uptake. This a structure of UapA may be the means of rational design of novel anti-fungal agents. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
