Greater knowledge about these issues would lead to better understanding of how the lifecourse and the ageing process influence well being in later life, how household resources are shared, and how financial resources flow between generations.&nbsp; Understanding this will help to inform social policy for older people relating to debt, financial services, financial education, the payment of benefits and the causes of poverty in later life. Much government policy in these spheres excludes older people or does not take their experience into account. \n<br />\n<br />This research aims:\n<br />(i) to analyse the financial resources of older couples, with particular emphasis on inequalities within and between couples;\n<br />(ii) to investigate cultural, social and lifecourse influences on how older couples manage their money, and the implications for autonomy and well-being in later life;\n<br />(iii) to illuminate the policy implications of findings in the fields of pensions, benefits, savings, debt and financial services.\n<br />These aims will be met through statistical analysis of financial inequality in later life using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA); through qualitative research in the form of focus groups and in-depth interviews; and by analysis of relevant government policies.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F00138X/1","grantId":"ES/F00138X/1","fundValue":"274727","fundStart":"2008-02-04","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Debora Janet Price","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
