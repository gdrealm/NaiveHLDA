During rapid tumour growth, some areas of cancers do not receive an adequate supply of oxygen and other nutrients. This turns on cellular pathways which enhance cell survival and increase the resistance of the cells to standard treatments for cancer such as radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, a sensitive method for monitoring oxygen levels within tumours on an ongoing basis is required. One possible approach is to use small particles containing fluorescent dyes (nanosensors), which change colour when the oxygen concentration changes. Such particles could be used to monitor oxygen concentrations within tumours and, ultimately, to trigger treatments under defined conditions. Fluorescent nanosensors have already been developed and this project will investigate the possibility of applying them to monitoring oxygen concentrations in whole tumours. In addition, more sensitive light emitting nanosensors will be developed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601797","grantId":"G0601797","fundValue":"92508","fundStart":"2007-11-15","fundEnd":"2008-08-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Clarke","coPersons":["Susan  Watson","Jonathan  Aylott","Anna Maria  Grabowska"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
