Through discussion, debate and presentations of research results, OPHI and collaborators will engage in the process of discussing the (improved) indicators that will measure poverty in all its dimensions in the new Sustainable Development Goals. This work, in turn, will have a direct economic and social impact on global poverty. This proposal thus responds to a unique moment in time when actors are determining the indicators to measure the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe uptake of the ESRC-DFID sponsored research at the national level led to OPHI being awarded the International Impact award by ESRC last year. This proposal moves the ESRC-DFIC grant's targeted impact audience from national level policy makers to the international level, where the United Nations Statistics Division has convened an inter agency expert working group to define the indicators that will measure poverty (among other topics) over the next 15 years as part of the Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs). More specifically, the target audiences include the UN Statistics Division and the Governments that make it up; the Inter-Agency Expert Working Group on SDG Indicators, the World Bank, the lead agency focused on global poverty measurement (which is itself considering new global poverty indicators with OPHI as an Advisor on its commission); the Foreign Affairs Offices and UN Missions of selected countries and key stakeholders in global poverty measurement such as the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. \n\nThe crucial time for this debate, discussion and decision-making is between September and March 2016. We plan to communicate this body of research to these audiences in order to educate the debate and decision-making on measuring poverty within the SDGs. The specific activities planned include: \n\n- Join with governments in the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network in a Side Event at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the new global MPI and its relevance as an indicator in the SDGs. \n- Disseminate the new OPHI authored OUP book to the target audiences and promote seminar discussions with statisticians at the UN and World Bank. \n- One-on-one discussions with key figures at the World Bank, the UN, National UN representatives and key non-state stakeholders (such as the SDSN) to discuss the research findings and their relevance.\n- At least two meetings of a working group of MPPN countries to discuss the research findings and how to broaden the discussion to Foreign Ministries, national UN Missions and statisticians and others involved in the SDG Indicator process.\n- With its MPPN partner countries hold a side event at the UN Statistics Commission Annual Meeting in March 2016. This side event could be essential in the UN debate and decision making process on indicators.\n- Throughout this grant period, OPHI will prepare and disseminate results packaged for these research users through appropriate channels.\n\nThese specific activities would benefit the technical staff, statisticians and evidence-based policy makers who would emerge with better knowledge of and understanding of the multidimensional poverty measurement methodologies and their practicality for policy. This would give them the tools needed as they set the indicators for the new SDGs.\n\nIf the results of OPHI's research were to be adopted by the UN, it would transform the way the world not only views but also deals with poverty in an integrated and multi-sectoral manner, informing national public policies over the next few decades. The impact would be on the extreme poor at a global level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N014812/1","grantId":"ES/N014812/1","fundValue":"70560","fundStart":"2015-09-18","fundEnd":"2016-03-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabina  Alkire","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
