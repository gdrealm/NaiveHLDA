It also aims to investigate how these inputs vary with important characteristics of the family, such as the presence of a partner, household income, and the mother’s share of the latter. </p> \n<p>The empirical evidence will be provided by the British Household Panel Survey. This survey collects birth weight for all children born during the period 1991-2004 and provides measures of time-varying maternal inputs and other household attributes. Crucially, the survey offers information on women who have had at least two births making it possible to control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics of the mother which might be correlated with the observed inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2044","grantId":"RES-000-22-2044","fundValue":"64576","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emilia  Del Bono","coPersons":["Marco  Francesconi","John Francis Ermisch"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
