{"id":"A111B787-CC08-46F7-8107-693500A9DF6D","title":"Optimal Protocols for Storage of Embryonic and Fetal Neural Stem Cells","abstractText":"Involving neural tissue transplantation in the brain, as well as stem cells, human embryos and animal experiments, this research is high profile in the general as well as scientific news media. In addition to publication in peer reviewed journals, the results of the present project will be widely disseminated to the biomedical research community, to NHS and clinical professions, and to interested charities and the lay public, through lectures and seminars in the normal way as well as in media interviews when appropriate. The PIs already have extensive experience in public communication of research results. We strive to achieve\nthe best balance between the competing demands of proper disclosure of publicly funded science, public\neducation, promoting enthusiasm for science and support for the MRC and biomedical research, but without raising false or premature hopes for cures that remain distant. The credibility of the team will be markedly enhanced by the present collaboration between three PIs actively involed in neural transplantation and stem cell biology with two PIs who have established expertise in clinical obstetrics and gynaecology, cryobiology and embryological storage protocols.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300237","grantId":"G0300237","fundValue":"280814","fundStart":"2004-11-12","fundEnd":"2008-08-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen B.
