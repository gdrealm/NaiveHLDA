{"id":"DAA40C79-D3CF-475A-8114-0FEC048A388D","title":"Using Scenario-mapping Theory to predict plural reference","abstractText":"<p>When two characters are mentioned in a piece of text, subsequent reference to these characters is often made with a plural pronoun such as they. This can be taken to indicate that the two characters have been represented in the reader's understanding as a 'complex reference object' (a set rather than two individuals). Various factors have been shown to influence the likelihood of this happening. For example, a plural pronominal reference is more likely if the characters are described as being in the same physical location. </p>\n\n<p>Our current aim is to identify a theoretical framework on the basis of which we can predict those factors which influence such pronominal reference. According to scenario-mapping theory we use our existing knowledge of situations depicted in the text to guide our understanding of both current and subsequent text. This theory leads to several predictions about the construction of a complex reference object following the mention of two individual characters. For example, if characters are related to the same role within the same scenario they are highly likely to make a coherent complex reference object. In this research five studies will be carried out which test these predictions of scenario-mapping theory directly. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3172","grantId":"RES-000-22-3172","fundValue":"71717","fundStart":"2009-01-26","fundEnd":"2010-01-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda Mae Moxey","coPersons":["Anthony J Sanford"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
