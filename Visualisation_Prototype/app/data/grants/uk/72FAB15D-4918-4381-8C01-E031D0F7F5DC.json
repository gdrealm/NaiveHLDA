{"id":"72FAB15D-4918-4381-8C01-E031D0F7F5DC","title":"Digital Dance Archives (DDA): cross-collection interactivity and enhanced user engagement with dance resources","abstractText":"The Digital Dance Archives project (DDA) will disseminate multimedia archive material on dance and choreography via a public internet web portal to enhance user engagement and encourage interactivity. Three parties will work on two distinct digital developments using existing archival resources at Surrey (the National Resource Centre for Dance) and Coventry (the Siobhan Davies digital archive). These are the Department of Dance, Film and Theatre Studies /NRCD and the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) at Surrey and ICELab, School of Art and Design at Coventry. Two inter-related digital pilots will work across the DDA project: producing a searchable platform based on visual content, and an interactive tool supporting online learning and collaboration.\\n\\nThe DDA project aims to unify previously disparate archives under a sustainable digital platform (with the future potential to add further archives). The main functions of the web portal will be to:\\n\\n1. Stream the DDA's visual content to a diverse range of users via the web. This content will take the form of images and video of dance performances, and objects (e.g. costumes) related to those performances. \\n\\n2. Enable both directed search, and the browsing / discovery of DDA content via a novel and intuitive search interface.\\n\\n3. Facilitate online interaction and collaboration, by building and sharing virtual scrapbooks of archival content. \\n\\nInteraction will be enhanced through two technological innovations unique to this proposal:\\n\\nWe will enable 'visual search' of the archive using content based image retrieval (CBIR) technologies. Content will be indexed not only using traditional text search of meta-data tags, but also using visual appearance. For example, a user may search for similar instances of a photographed costume or object within archived performances - or search for 'similar' dances, or dances containing a particular twirl or gesture. In doing so we bridge between different multimedia formats, and broaden the indexing beyond meta-data terms associated with dance content (no additional meta-data is manually generated to enable this novel search).\\n\\nA novel interactive tool will enable 'virtual scrapbooking' of content. The tool provides users with the facility to annotate, create and curate responses to the digital collections, thus providing a potential network/community for exchange of ideas. Using Web 2.0 technologies, this 'learning tool' will demonstrate how dance archival content can be used generatively to enable users to develop personalised interpretations of dance content.\\n\\nIn summary, the DDA project represents an accessible and sustainable solution to digital archiving of the performing arts. It will provide a single point of contact for interacting with archived dance, leveraging unique technologies that enable new routes to content discovery, learning and collaborative research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037926/1","grantId":"AH/H037926/1","fundValue":"323262","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel Susan Fensham","coPersons":["John Philip Collomosse","Sarah  Whatley"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
