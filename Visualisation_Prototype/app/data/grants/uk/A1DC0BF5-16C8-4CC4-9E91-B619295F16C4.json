There now exist both the need and a sufficient body of work to extrapolate the findings to establish and test alternative urban futures: to create a variety of scenarios, building on prior and new work, and predicated on different fundamental assumptions and priorities; to assess those scenarios in terms of design, engineering implementation and measurement of performance; to refine them, in terms of mitigation and adaptation measures, incorporating novel solutions; and ultimately to provide alternative solutions with an associated evidence base and strategies for their implementation. This bid seeks to integrate the outputs of three current SUE consortia (Birmingham Eastside, VivaCity 2020 and WaND) and complementary research on the use of trees to mitigate the effects of atmospheric pollution. The team will work across disciplines to envision and establish alternative futures (using extensive literature on this subject and prior WaND consortium work) and construct scenarios that might flow from each alternative future. The various work packages will then focus on testing specific dimensions of each alternative future vis a vis their design, implementation and performance in the context of case history sites. Each project will engage an expert panel of influential stakeholders who will meet six-monthly to test and help shape new ideas, the chairs of each of the expert panels forming the higher level project steering committee. Panel consultation will be followed by interviews of stakeholders on motivations and the decision-making process, and specific empirical research and modelling. The following high level questions will be addressed via this process: - How does the ab initio conceptualization of sustainability influence design outcomes (e.g. form, density)? How would outcomes change if urban renewal were predicated on either environmental or social or economic overriding drivers? - How does development impact on its environs, and vice versa (e.g. is a 'sustainable' site good for the city / region / country and, if so, in what ways?) and is there an optimum development size to yield optimally sustainable outcomes? - Push versus pull to achieve sustainable outcomes. Much of what is done is thought good (for individuals, society, the environment), what might be wanted (push). Thus decisions are made and people must decide whether or not to take ownership. Might more sustainable outcomes follow if those who must take ownership dictate what is created (pull)? Birmingham Eastside will be used both to develop sustainability ideas and to test them on sites at various stages of planning and development (the research team has unparalleled access via its partnerships with key stakeholders involved in Eastside). Lancaster (with Morecambe, population 96k) and Worcester (94k) will be used to test the outcomes at the scale of smaller urban areas (e.g. market towns) but no attempt will be made to build comprehensive databases as at Eastside. Several other UK and international urban areas (including Sao Paulo, Singapore and an urban area in India) will be used to test a sub-set of the project's findings to assess the transferability of the scenarios to a variety of contexts and thus their general applicability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F007426/1","grantId":"EP/F007426/1","fundValue":"3148360","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  James Hale took part in the construction of the Birmingham Dry Garden, part of the Birmingham Floral Trail, which won the Gold Award in the Britain in Bloom Urban Community category in September 2009.\n\nBeneficiaries: Birmingham residents and visitors\n\nContribution Method: James Hale helped to design and construct the Birmingham Dry Garden, drawing upon his disciplinary and wider knowledge and experience in biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nJames Hale led the team in its response to the Retail Birmingham Design Strategy 2010, resulting in some of the team's ideas being included in the subsequent draft of the strategy.\n\nBeneficiaries: Birmingham City Council\n\nContribution Method: James Hale led the team in its response to the Retail Birmingham Design Strategy 2010, resulting in some of the team's ideas being included in the subsequent draft of the strategy.\n\nThe Urban Futures team worked closely with project partner Peter Braithwaite of CH2M HILL, who incorporated futures thinking into a new initiative for developing cities.\n\nBeneficiaries: CH2M HILL\n\nContribution Method: The Urban Futures team worked closely with project partner Peter Braithwaite of CH2M HILL, who incorporated futures thinking into a new initiative for developing cities.\n\nThe Urban Futures scenarios and 'future proofing' thinking is being used by The Environment Agency to future proof its current sustainability recommendations (contact Rob Kinnersley).\n\nBeneficiaries: Environment Agency\n\nContribution Method: The Urban Futures scenarios and 'future proofing' thinking is being used by The Environment Agency to future proof its current sustainability recommendations (contact Rob Kinnersley).\n\nA consultation with Glenn Howells Architects on the revision of the Birmingham Eastside Masterplan in the summer of 2010 and the incorporation of HS2.\n\nA consultation with Glenn Howells Architects on the revision of the Birmingham Eastside Masterplan and the impact of HS2.\n\nBeneficiaries: Glenn Howells Architects, Birmingham City Council\n\nContribution Method: A consultation was held with Glenn Howells Architects to incorporate futures thinking into the revision.\n\nThe Urban Futures Team (Chris Rogers, Joanne Leach, Rob MacKenzie, Jon Sadler, James Hale, Silvio Caputo, Chris Boyko and Mark Gaterell) were invited to pressure test the forthcoming ICE State of the Nation: Transport 2013 report.

If a proposed solution delivers a positive legacy, regardless of the future against which it is tested, then it can be adopted with confidence. The Method is supported by a web-based Interactive Tool available at http://www.urban-futures.org.\n\n\n\nPrimary research area outcomes:\n\n\n\nHigh built density has a negative impact on urban bats, but this can be offset for at least one species by well-connected tree networks. Artificial lighting can undermine this connectivity, reducing movement across large gaps. Resilient bat habitats, their connectivity and the built density of the surrounding area must be monitored and managed in perpetuity.\n\n\n\nStreet canyons (narrow streets surrounded by high buildings) trap air pollution from traffic at street level. Judiciously-placed vegetation, especially ‘green walls’ in street canyons, can substantially improve urban air quality… but street trees can make street-level air quality worse by reducing mixing of air. Intelligent siting and planting of vegetation must be central to urban air quality strategies.\n\n\n\nThe rate and type of urban development has major implications for water infrastructure with compact urban development providing the best balance of cost, water quality and network resilience. The use of a diverse range of water management options can improve and increase overall system resilience in the face of an uncertain future. Extreme conditions require adaptable and flexible infrastructure with multistage design and operational strategies.\n\n\n\nConsidering future technologies and consumer behaviour alongside policy ensures future resilience of water and energy solutions, and makes clear the impact on waste streams. The complex relationship between what is built above and below ground, and how it is impacted by natural and human interaction has required new quantitative models to be developed. Pipe number and location affect the long-term cost of locating utilities within Multi Utility Tunnels.\n\n\n\nChoosing energy components and systems that are low maintenance helps ensure future resilience. Knowledge of the correct use of solutions must be provided to current and future residents and workers. Regulation is needed to prevent future overshadowing of buildings designed to maximise solar access.\n\n\n\nDensity is more than just the number of dwellings and people in an area. The impact of different densities on urban design and development projects must be explicitly considered by the key decisionmakers early in the process. Informed decisions require both ‘hard’ data (eg, numerical density standards) and ‘soft’ data (eg, context, local knowledge and best practice). Urban designers and developers need contextually-relevant, standardised figures for low, medium and high dwelling density.\n\n\n\nBuilding owners, occupiers and investors determine the sustainability agenda for development. Integrating sustainability into business models may provide competitive advantage. Local economic context determines whether innovative sustainable technologies are incorporated.\n\n\n\nBuild in flexibility to accommodate future socio-demographic changes. Engaging the local community early and often will help ensure facilities and amenities are used. Alternative models of governance may increase resilience to future changes. The Urban Futures Method is designed to assist anyone involved in making strategic or detail-level decisions about investing in plans or projects related to urban development and regeneration, including community led projects, regeneration proposals, and strategic development plans and projects. Such decision-makers include communities, professionals, funders and local authorities.\n\n\n\nThe Urban Futures Method can be used throughout the lifetime of an urban development and regeneration project to assess the resilience of the sustainability solutions being put in place: from pre-feasibility, through design and build, to use, maintenance and renewal. The Method can also be used to assess the resilience of policies and regeneration programmes as well as to test the resilience of sustainability solutions that are already in place and functioning. The resilience of a sustainability solution should be considered as early as possible in a project so all perspectives can be investigated and so alternatives are not locked out. However, this should not prevent users from applying the Method at all relevant stages of a redevelopment.\n\n\n\nA strength of the Urban Futures Method is that it can be used to assess the resilience of sustainability solutions at all scales: from the planting of an individual street tree, to building systems such as appliances or water systems, to a mixed use policy implemented at a regional or national scale.\n\n\n\nThe Urban Futures Method is primarily for use when the stakeholders involved in implementing a sustainability solution (or solutions) consult together to make decisions as part of the redevelopment process. The greatest value comes when there is an opportunity for all partners involved to exchange knowledge and ideas and to create better solutions based upon their combined knowledge. Depending on the project, these stakeholders might include the client, community, development agencies, funding bodies, the project team, supply chain members and various specialists. This consultation is likely to include meetings, telephone calls and emails, but the Method can also be used in a workshop setting. A workshop can take several forms depending upon the complexity of the project and may include stepping through the Method, or focus upon key aspects (for example, identifying the necessary conditions for a given solution or set of solutions). \n\n\n\nAn interactive tool has been developed to help the user analyse the robustness of sustainability solutions. This is available at www.urban-futures.org. The Tool has been developed using four UK-based scenarios and is thus applicable to sustainability solutions being implemented in the UK. However, the user can add alternative scenarios or additional aspects to the existing scenarios and in this way can tailor the tool to any context. The Urban Futures Method, Interactive Tool and the outcomes from the project's eight research areas can easily be incorporated into Master's programmes. Designing Resilient Cities: a Guide to Good Practice, which describes in detail the Method and Tool, provides the basis for non-academic use (see below) but also provides the foundations for focussed Masters level learning, most beneficially as an intensive, focussed course.
