{"id":"E6172D5E-EE04-4EF3-B9B5-957A28EF194D","title":"Injectable Biomimetic Tissue Repair Systems","abstractText":"This project stems from an interdisciplinary EPSRC-funded research grant (New Clinical Materials for Biomimetic Repair of Invertebral Disc - GR/S41173/01) involving a UK-based collaborative research team comprising three complementary academic research groups and two clinical centres. The consortium brought together established expertise in synthetic polymer-based biomaterials science (Prof Brian Tighe, Aston), the biochemical and biological properties of the intervertebral disc (Dr Sally Roberts, Keele/Oswestry) and the physico-chemical characterisation of cartilaginous tissues (Dr Jill Urban, Oxford), closely linked with relevant surgical expertise in Oswestry (Dr SM Eisentstein) and Oxford (Mr. JCT Fairbank) to guide the project towards provision of an effective clinical therapy. The focussed objective of this work was the development of an injectable biomimetic hydrogel nucleus prosthesis to restore disc height in the intervertebral disc thereby avoiding the necessity for invasive surgery. We have developed such a system and brought it to the stage of pre-clinical evaluation. The three centres worked closely and successfully together and the outcome of the work may be judged from the attached final report. Further work is now necessary to facilitate the transition from the interdisciplinary science and successful outcome of the initial project to the development of a commercial product which will fill a clear clinical need, acceptable to spinal surgeons and patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G006202/1","grantId":"EP/G006202/1","fundValue":"191035","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Tighe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
