{"id":"8FD7F2B7-1074-48C7-97B5-B9DD3CAA17D2","title":"Sandpit: Rapidly Deployable Printed Antenna","abstractText":"Techniques will be developed that allow metal structures to be printed on cloth in such a way that they can be used to improve the performance of body-worn antennas. The first step will be to develop and characterise the fabrication method and use it to make a deployable antenna consisting of metal structures printed in cloth. The idea is that a soldier can use this light, foldable fabric sheet to provide increased communication range.In taking this first step we will also be validating the electromagnetic design process which can then be used to tackle the more complex problem of using printed metal structures to enhance the performance of body worn antennas. The approach will be to attempt to guide the fields around the body and in this way prevent the high levels of absorption that are generally seen. Metalisation will be printed onto the fabric of clothing in such a way as to acheive this goal. The resulting solution will be resiliant to damage and the uncertain location of other objects close to the body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H019723/1","grantId":"EP/H019723/1","fundValue":"156916","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2010-11-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Mark  Fitz","coPersons":["Darren John Southee"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
