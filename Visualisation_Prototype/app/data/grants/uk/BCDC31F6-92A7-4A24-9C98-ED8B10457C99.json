Although carbohydrates were the first of these to be extracted from living organisms and characterised, our understanding of protein and nucleic acid biological function is far advanced, which is, in part, due to the excellent progress made in the 1950s on probing the structure of crystallised biological matter with x-rays. By investigating the geometries adopted by amino acids and nucleic acids, Watson, Crick, Pauling, Phillips and others theorised that biological function is a manifestation of microscopic shape, which drove a revolution in Biochemistry: the realisation that proteins comprise a string of amino acids folded into specific functional shapes and work as micro-machines. It also led to discovery of the DNA-double helix, which carries our genetic information and is the progenitor of Molecular Biology and Genetics. Unfortunately, a similar revolution has not occurred in our understanding and harnessing of carbohydrates, for example, although the heparin carbohydrate has been routinely used in surgical procedures for almost a century, the mechanism of action has only recently begun to be understood. The problem is that carbohydrates do not crystallise readily and other techniques to investigate their microscopic shape have not been developed. Consequently, the relationship between carbohydrate composition and function is tenuous. Carbohydrates, therefore, represent a major unexplored frontier in Biochemistry and due to their fundamental industrial importance (e.g., food, paper, wood, pharmaceuticals, biomaterials) any breakthrough in understanding this relationship would certainly lead to another revolution in biotechnology. This research is driving toward providing this important link between carbohydrate composition and function by developing new techniques for investigating their microscopic shape. Rather than using x-rays, we are using precise and extensive computer simulations, advanced methods for refining pure carbohydrates and a molecular microscope based on magnetic resonance (similar to MRI-scanners found in hospitals) to achieve this goal. To date our research has focused on unravelling some of the mysteries surrounding the large polymeric carbohydrate molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which fill the space between cells, bonding them together, conferring strength to organs, joints and skin, while allowing our bodies to grow and change. Microscopically, carbohydrate molecules are composed of chemical rings, joined together to form polymeric chains. We found that to accurately describe the shape of these molecules we need to understand both what is happening around the connection joints between these rings and also how the rings flex dynamically. Computer simulations of carbohydrates, which take into account thousands of interactions with solvent water, have so far managed to investigate the joints, but up until now limitations in computer hardware has not permitted an investigation into ring flexing because it happens on timescales that are hundreds of times longer. We overcame this problem using graphics processors (hardware used for computer gaming) to dramatically speed-up simulations and provide insight into the GAG heparan sulphate, an anticoagulant similar to heparin that lines blood vessels. It has revealed that ring flexing is central to carbohydrate function and that absence of ring flexing leads to regions that are stiffened, which consequently interact with other molecules in the body. We now plan to research and test this hypothesis further and determine whether this ring flexing behaviour is central to the function of other GAGs, such as those found in cartilage and skin, whether it is important in other human and plant carbohydrates and whether it can be used for understanding how to design novel pharmaceuticals and biomaterials based on carbohydrates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J00040X/1","grantId":"BB/J00040X/1","fundValue":"417585","fundStart":"2012-05-14","fundEnd":"2015-05-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No other than cited by other international scientists Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Andrew  Almond","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" BBSRC-funded researchers at the University of Manchester's Institute of Biotechnology have used the power of off-the-shelf computer gaming technology to capture previously unobservable atomic movements. The research is helping to chart one of nature's most complex entities known as &amp;quot;glycomes&amp;quot; – the entire complement of carbohydrates within a cell.\n\nThis novel solution provides a new understanding of these vital biomolecules which play a role in everything from neuronal development, inflammation and cell structure, to disease pathology and blood clotting.\n\nUnderstanding the shapes of major biological molecules has revolutionised areas like drug development and medical diagnostics, but the shape of complex carbohydrates has been largely ignored.\n\nThe research, reported in a series of six peer-reviewed scientific publications (see notes) with the most recent appearing in Carbohydrate Research, provides a new view of these biochemical barcodes and present new opportunities in the science of carbohydrates, such as designing drugs or biomaterials that mimic carbohydrate shape and interpreting burgeoning functional glycomics data. The researchers produced the first predictions of microsecond molecular motions in glycomic building blocks and oligosaccharides. Previously unobservable atomic movements were predicted and found to be sensitive to the carbohydrate sequence. Building on these new insights, the researchers developed a new physics-based model and GPU software that allows far more realistic simulations of long carbohydrate sequences (polymers) – on microsecond and micrometer scales. Using heparan sulphate chains the researchers showed that including both flexible degrees of freedom in their model, polymer linkage and ring motions, is crucial to reproduce experimental shape data and ring dynamics were implicated in sequence-dependent biological activity.\n\nThe research has culminated in a computational GPU-based method and protocol that can now be used by other researchers to explore the 3D-landscape of largely unchartered organismal glycomes in unprecedented detail.
