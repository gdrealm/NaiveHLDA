From a policy viewpoint,&nbsp; the role of training in curbing the effects of an individualâ€™s forced shift from the public sector is investigated, and the relative private costs to the individual and benefits of mobility are estimated. Although the value of job training has been well documented in the existing literature, here a new question is addressed, which is the value of job training for workers facing redundancy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00476X/1","grantId":"ES/K00476X/1","fundValue":"82052","fundStart":"2012-10-31","fundEnd":"2013-07-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Genevieve  Knight","coPersons":["Karen  Mackinnon","Sergio  Salis"],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
