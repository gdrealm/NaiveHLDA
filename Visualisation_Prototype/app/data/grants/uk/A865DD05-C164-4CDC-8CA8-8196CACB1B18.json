It has the potential of providing a portable, low cost, and non invasive imagery which could be suitable for medical applications such as rapid medical assessment of conductions such as cerebral strokes in emergency situations. Algorithms for image reconstruction have successfully been developed in recent years by our group and others. These algorithms are very intensive computationally, and only low resolution images can be reconstructed within practical time limits. In this project we propose to port our existing code (written in FORTRAN) to a multi accelerator board platform (Clearspeed) to allow fast computation of image reconstruction and allow higher resolutions making MIT more suitable for medical applications. The new implemented system will be the basis for future research and commercial development in MIT.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F011059/1","grantId":"EP/F011059/1","fundValue":"96546","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mohammed Ali  Roula","coPersons":["Huw  Griffiths","Robert John  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Glamorgan","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
