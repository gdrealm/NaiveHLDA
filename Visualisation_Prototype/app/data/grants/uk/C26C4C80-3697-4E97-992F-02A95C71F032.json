During a normal conversation, however, speakers often avert their gazes from listeners' faces. They may do this to avoid distraction, to signal that their conversational turns are ongoing, to maintain an appropriate level of intimacy, or perhaps to fixate on something they have noticed in the environment. Following a speaker's eye-gaze in all but the last case will be of little use to a listener, and yet the existing research suggests that all such shifts of gaze will trigger reflexive shifts of attention.</p>\n\n<p>In our research we ask whether listeners can distinguish different types of gaze behaviour, and if so, how? Pairs of people will be asked to engage in a task that will elicit normal, conversational gazes on the part of speakers (eg glances away while they are thinking), but which will also elicit deliberate, object-directed gazes at designated targets, and reflexive gazes toward the source of an unexpected loud noise. Using eye-tracking equipment, we will examine whether listeners are more likely to follow the deliberate and reflexive object-directed gazes of speakers than their conversational gazes. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3211","grantId":"RES-062-23-3211","fundValue":"271399","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Richard Langton","coPersons":["Peter  Hancock"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
