These looked at ‘Experiences of Forced Labour in the UK Food Industry’ and the ‘Scope of Forced Labour in the UK’ (see: http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/forced-labour).</p>\n\n<p>The mission statement for the FLMG is: “to help define, measure, monitor and tackle workplace abuse, exploitation and forced labour in the UK”. At present the FLMG is only a ‘pilot’ project with its exact role, remit and membership open for discussion. The 12-month grant (September 2012 - September 2013) is being coordinated by an academic steering group of: Dr Sam Scott, Dr Alex Balch, Professor Gary Craig, Dr Alistair Geddes and Dr Kendra Strauss. There are five outputs associated with the pilot project:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>a web-site ‘www.forcedlabour.org’</li>\n\n <li>five policy workshops</li>\n\n <li>a book on ‘Workplace Abuse, Exploitation and Forced Labour’</li>\n\n <li>academic journal articles</li>\n\n <li>a collaborative policy paper. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>These outputs are designed to act as an impetus for a longer-term FLMG that would:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>draw academics together with policy makers and practitioners</li>\n\n <li>be sustainable</li>\n\n <li>be independent</li>\n\n <li>influence policy</li>\n\n <li>raise knowledge and awareness of forced labour.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020567/1","grantId":"ES/J020567/1","fundValue":"88639","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2013-09-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sam  Scott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
