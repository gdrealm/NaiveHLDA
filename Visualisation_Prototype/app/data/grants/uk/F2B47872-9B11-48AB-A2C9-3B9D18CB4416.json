The specific research questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What is the degree and nature of overlap between the various deeply socially excluded groups that may also experience homelessness?&nbsp; </li>\n\n <li>What is the view of those affected by MEH about the relative importance of the different difficulties they face? </li>\n\n <li>To what extent are there similar or different 'routes in' to specific manifestations of MEH?&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>What is the role of material deprivation in generating MEH? </li>\n\n <li>What role is played by social and psychological factors in generating MEH?&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>Does the nature of MEH vary geographically? </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research comprises a multi-stage, quantitative survey in six research locations across the UK. The first stage will involve drawing a representative sample of 'low threshold' services working with people experiencing deep social exclusion in each of these research locations. The second stage will comprise a 'census' self-completion survey of users of these services over a two-week 'time window'. The third stage will be to conduct follow-up extended interviews with 400 respondents who have experienced MEH.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Contact: Prof Suzanne Fitzpatrick</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:s.fitzpatrick@hw.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">s.fitzpatrick@hw.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n <li>Website: <a href=\"http://www.homeless.org.uk/esrc-research\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.homeless.org.uk/esrc-research</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ESRC contact: Liz Grassby</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:liz.grassby@esrc.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">liz.grassby@esrc.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n <li>Telephone: 01793 444697</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-188-25-0023","grantId":"RES-188-25-0023","fundValue":"207276","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  N/A - grant transferred - see RES-188-25-0023-A for details of findings and impact  ","person":"Suzanne  Fitzpatrick","coPersons":["Nicholas  Pleace","Deborah Jayne Quilgars","Sarah  Johnsen"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" N/A - grant transferred - see RES-188-25-0023-A for details of findings and impact N/A - grant transferred - see RES-188-25-0023-A for details of findings and impact Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
