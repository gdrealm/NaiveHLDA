It explores the politics of masques, investigating the way masques legitimated kingly rule by invoking particular ideological values, but also the opportunity taken by some subjects to use masques to talk back to the monarch. \nIt will put the masques in a framework defined by the most recent historiography, particularly viewing Stuart Whitehall as a powerful institution. Rather than as a royal dynasty on the verge of inevitable collapse.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112989/1","grantId":"112989/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The main public acknowledgment of this work has been the shortlisting of my book for the George Freedley Memorial Award of the American Theatre Library Association, for the best theatre book of 2010 (an international competition; my book was one of six considered for the title). Other work from the project, published as independent articles, won the Ben Jonson 'Discoveries' award in 2007 and the 'English Literary Renaissance' prize in 2008. Other work from the book was used as part of my invited lecture in the Victoria and Albert Museum's public programme for summer 2013.

It demonstrates the political function of court festivity in the early 17th century and the contribution made by court masquing to defining and promoting the public identity of the king. It establishes that the old idea of court culture as expounding the priorities of a flawed monarchy is simplified and misleading. Court festivity was not simply a royal culture talking to itself but a channel of communication between king and subject in which royal identity was staged, legitimated, challenged, and debated. The book demonstrates the contribution made by court masques to a series of key political debates: the construction of a new British identity under the Stuart monarchs; the representation of the female body and public female performance; the question of dynastic inheritance and the acclamation of a royal heir; the dependence of monarchs on their favourites as channels of honour; the involvement or withdrawal of the nation from the religious warfare ravaging continental Europe for much of the period in question. Cumulatively, this presents a radical new interpretation of English court festivity, and one which brings literary and historical perspectives into close relation. The book has been extensively and enthusiastically reviewed and is influencing future work on the topic amongst historians of literature and politics, but is also part of the revival of interest in the form amongst museum professionals. The last two years have seen exhibitions relating to court festivity at the Queen's Gallery, the Banqueting House Whitehall, the Tate Gallery, and Bolsover Castle in Nottinghamshire. Some of these events (at the Banqueting House and Bolsover) have included revivals or reconstructions of performances. Any events along these lines would benefit from the perspectives developed in this project, as would exhibitions mounted at archives which have holdings related to the design and performance of masques (notably the architectural collection at Chatsworth, which I drew on in my research).
