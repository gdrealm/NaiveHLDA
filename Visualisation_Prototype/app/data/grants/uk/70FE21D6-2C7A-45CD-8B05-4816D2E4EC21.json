The main objective of this research proposal is to apply nonlinear signal processing and system identification methods to identify nonlinear mesh models associated with the core mechanisms between activation and flow from data collected across a wide range of stimulus conditions. This is a highly complex and multi-disciplinary project involving neuroscientists, psychologists, and control and systems engineers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D001218/1","grantId":"EP/D001218/1","fundValue":"264277","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings obtained from this EPSRC grant are crucial to our current research in understanding the local field potential recordings in terms of neural excitation and inhibition through experimental design and mathematical modelling.

(1) the relationship between cerebral blood flow and volume can be modelled as a compliant balloon with model parameters related to the compliant properties of blood vessels. (2) The neural signals recorded by a microelectrode in the somatosensory cortex can be decomposed into subsystems (brain stem, thalamus and barrel cortex) via mathematical modelling. (3) The neurovascular coupling relationship can be largely modelled by a linear time-invariant system within the range of stimulation used. The structure of the model indicated that blood vessels dilate and constrict during the evoked response. All the findings from the EPSRC grant provided foundations for our current research work on balanced neural excitation and inhibition funded by the BBSRC. In the long term we aim to relate invasive neural and hemodynamic recordings to non-invasive recordings such as EEG and fMRI, thus providing algorithms to enable researchers and medical workers to interpret human EEG and fMRI signals to the underlying changes in neural activity.
