The new manufacturing process is based on adding an induction heater to the tundish of a\ncontinuous cast process for bearing steel manufacturing; this will significantly enhance inclusion control and increase\nbearing life. The work will be combined with modelling of multiscalar effects associated to bearing fatigue, allowing to\noptimise the microstructure for fatigue, and to select optimal processing parameters for alloy processing. The end result will\nbe computer programmes to aid manufacturers to control bearing steel processing, rules for optimal steel processing,\nmethods to quantify inclusion content in ultra-clean steels, and understanding of how variations in microstructure and\ncomposition lead to different bearing life.&quot;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507817/1","grantId":"EP/M507817/1","fundValue":"326509","fundStart":"2015-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"P E J  Rivera","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
