The six workshops are focussed on both application and methodological subject areas, and cover Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Neuroscience, Computational PDEs, Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Simulations. The workshops will be small meetings. with no parallel sessions and significant time for informal interactions. The visitor program will bring nine longer term visitors to Warwick who will engage in research related to the six subject areas covered in the workshops, and provide links between them. The capstone conference will cover a wide range of subjects in Scientific Computing, and will feature 16 plenary talks, by leading international reseachers, as well as contributed sessions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F032323/1","grantId":"EP/F032323/1","fundValue":"206853","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Stuart","coPersons":["Charlie  Elliott","Jianfeng  Feng","Gareth  Roberts","Robert McDougall Kerr","Michael Phillip Allen","Rudolf Andreas Roemer"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
