Evolution has resulted in adaptation to the different environments in which these microbes are found. This adaptation means that they can often make unusual chemicals using enzymes not found on land. Some of these enzymes could replace harmful chemical processes used by industry to make products This is a proposal to discover new and useful enzymes from marine microbes for the development of environmentally-friendly industrial processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F014406/1","grantId":"NE/F014406/1","fundValue":"81211","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Joint","coPersons":["Sohail Tahir Ali"],"organisation":"Plymouth Marine Laboratory","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
