The garden will provide a dramatic artistic and architectural interpretation of the effect of Dark Matter via gravitational lensing. By approaching one subject (astronomy) through the medium of another (a garden), a different and wider audience is engaged than by following the usual channels. Chelsea Flower Show attracts a huge audience of garden lovers and general public, many of whom would not normally engage with astronomy and astrophysics. The Dark Matter Garden is timed to coincide with the centenary of the publication of Einstein's theory of General Relativity and the European Year of Light in 2015 and is timely, exciting and definitely 'Fresh'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000648/1","grantId":"ST/M000648/1","fundValue":"38500","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Howard  Miller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Howard Miller Design Ltd","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
