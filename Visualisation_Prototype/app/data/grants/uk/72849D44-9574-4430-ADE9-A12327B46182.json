There are two main classes of transposable element, transposons and retrotransposons. Retrotransposons move by first copying of themselves into an RNA molecule, the RNA transposition intermediate, and then turning this RNA back into DNA, a process called reverse transcription. This makes a new copy of the retrotransposon that can insert at a new chromosomal position. Retrotransposons duplicate themselves as they do this and so increase in copy number. As a result the chromosomes of most organisms contain many copies of each retrotransposon. The human genome, for example, contains about 800,000 copies of a particular type of retrotransposon, a non-LTR retro transposon called an L1 element. Only 80-100 of these are still able to transpose but these have the potential to damage genes and chromosomes in the short term. In the long term they have had a profound effect on the evolution of the human genome. The aim of the work proposed in this application is to investigate in detail the behaviour of the RNA transposition intermediate of a non-LTR retrotransposon called the I factor that is found in the chromosomes of the fruit fly Drosophila. This is more amenable to investigation than similar elements in other species because of the of the technical advantages of Drosophila as an experimental organism, and because transposition of I factors can be increased easily. The results of this work will be of relevance to non-LTR retrotransposons in general, however. Most non-LTR retrotransposons code for two proteins known as ORF1p and ORF2p. ORF1p may package the RNA transposition intermediate in some way while ORF2p carries out the chemical reactions necessary for transposition. Transposition of the I factor takes place in the germ-line of females and requires that both the RNA transposition intermediate and ORF2p enter the nucleus. We have previously shown that I factor RNA is transported to the oocyte nucleus by a transport machine that also moves a cellular RNA, gurken, that has to reach the nucleus as part of oocyte development. The transport of RNAs to particular sub-cellular compartments is a mechanism used by many cells to allow them to carry out their functions. Although a good deal is known about this process much remains to be learnt. The work described in this proposal is directed towards addressing two general biological questions, how is RNA localised within cells and how does the RNA transposition intermediate of a non-LTR retrotransposon, and its associated proteins, reach the nucleus of a cell in which it is transposing and how do they enter the nucleus? The first will be investigated by comparing the behaviour the I factor and gurken RNAs as they move to the same sub-cellular location in order to achieve different biological ends. The second will be achieved by following the movement of I factor RNA and I factor encoded proteins within the oocyte. This will be done using a combination of high resolution fluorescence microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F001045/1","grantId":"BB/F001045/1","fundValue":"412678","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Finnegan","coPersons":["Ilan  Davis"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" 1.
