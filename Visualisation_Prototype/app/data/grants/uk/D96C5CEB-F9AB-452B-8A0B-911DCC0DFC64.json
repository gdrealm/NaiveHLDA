Invitations were issued on the basis of the volume and profile of funding received from EPSRC.The Department is internationally leading with very strong research across Pure and Applied Mathematics. A Platform Grant will provide a baseline of funding to retain key staff between projects, to develop new collaborations, and to undertake feasibility studies and preliminary research work into new research directions. It will enhance the health and capability of the research base in the Department and allow us to improve our position in relation to EPSRC's strategic research agenda. In particular, it will enhance the Department's ability to contribute to new and emerging research challenges and to identify the mathematical areas in which we can have effective impact as contributors to transformative and cross-disciplinary research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I019138/1","grantId":"EP/I019138/1","fundValue":"520809","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Sparrow","coPersons":["Sebastian  Van Strien","Saul Domenico Jacka","Charlie  Elliott"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
