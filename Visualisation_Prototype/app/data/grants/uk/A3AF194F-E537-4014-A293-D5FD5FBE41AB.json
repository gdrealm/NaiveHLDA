We will exploit three UK tax reforms between 1999 and 2006: the rate of corporation tax faced by small companies was reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, then to zero, before being raised again to 19 per cent. We will exploit confidential, newly available, data from the HMRC Datalab on the corporation tax assessments of the universe of UK companies.<br /><br />A substantial number of new companies were created around the period of the low rate of tax. We aim to identify the role of taxation in inducing these company births, as well as the also substantial number of company dissolutions. We will compare the new companies with existing companies. In particular, the incentive for unincorporated firms to incorporate differs across different levels of profit: we aim to identify the extent to which new companies simply took advantage of the low starting rate. We will also investigate whether the lower starting rate induced a higher rate of corporate investment.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I027580/1","grantId":"ES/I027580/1","fundValue":"83580","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This main scientific impact to date has been through the paper: Devereux, M.P., L.

Under certain circumstances this elasticity can be a &quot;sufficient statistic&quot; for evaluating the costs to society generated by the tax. We use a technique proposed by Saez (2010) to estimate this elasticity, by analysing the extent to which companies &quot;bunch&quot; at kinks in the marginal tax rate schedule. Further, for companies where owner/managers are able to take income as salary or profit, we decompose the elasticity into an effect on the total income of the company and an effect on the share declared as profit. We derive the first estimates of the welfare cost of corporate taxation in the UK. \n\nWe estimate that the elasticity of corporate taxable profit to be between 0.14 and 0.18 for companies with profits around the ?300k kink in the marginal tax rate schedule, implying a marginal deadweight cost of 8% of revenue. We find a much higher elasticity of between 0.54 and 0.57 for companies around the ?10k kink. Decomposing this into two parts, we estimate an elasticity of total income with respect to the net of tax rate of between 0.2 and 0.3, and an elasticity of the share of income taken as profit with respect to the difference between the personal and corporate tax rates of between 0.04 and 0.07. Together these imply a marginal deadweight cost of the tax around ?10k of around 29% of revenue. We find no evidence of inter-temporal shifting of profit.\n\nThe second study concerns the incorporation decision of small businesses. Because we do not have access to data on unincorporated businesses, we use the merged data set to identify the total income each small company earns. We then identify (a) the minimum total tax that the owner could pay, conditional on the business being incorporated; (b) the actual tax that the owner paid; and (c) the tax that the owner would have paid had his business been unincorporated. This approach allows us to make inferences about the extent to which incorporation decisions reflect differences in the tax treatment between the different forms of business.
