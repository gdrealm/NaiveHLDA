Flocks of sheep and goats are still ubiquitous from Palestine to Portugal; the 600 km sheep highways are clearly visible in Castile. However, pastoral societies are considered to cause backward economies and degraded vegetation (Klein, Melville). Only in recent decades, after centuries of a historiography placing the emphasis on the study of settled agriculture, are mountainous and marginal land attracting the interest of several disciplines. There are two reasons for this shift in paradigm: disruption of transhumance and other livestock raising practices has provoked the demographic collapse of whole regions around the Mediterranean; and abandonment of pastureland and other natural resources has triggered the interest of environmentalists in understanding traditional more sustainable uses of less fertile lands.\\n\\nHistory has become the crucible in which the hypotheses of different disciplines are tested. Castilian transhumance has a strong historiographical tradition since the American historian J.Klein published his study of the Spanish Mesta in 1920. His work focused on Castile, where from 1273 to 1836 there was a strong organisation of sheep breeders. He adopted an institutional approach examining the structure of the organisation, officials, relationship to the monarchy, taxes, privileges, and ordinances. Since then, social historians have continued to look predominantly to Castile to investigate the social background of the sheep breeders and their power struggles in specific towns (Biskho, Reyna Pastor, Mar&iacute;n Barriguete, Garc&iacute;a Mart&iacute;n, Phillips and Phillips, Asenjo Gonz&aacute;lez). The approach is usually limited in chronology and geography.\\n\\nMy project addresses the study of transhumance and the environment in a whole region, Aragon, over four centuries. Approach, chronology and geography will bring new material and understanding to the subject. The researill contribute to debates connected with stock raising in two disciplines: that of the economists about the efficiency and logic of common property rights and that of the environmentalists over the causes of deforestation of the Spanish countryside. The case study of Aragon will be crucial to understanding what can be done with the more complex documentation of the Mesta.\\n\\nMONOGRAPH OUTLINE:\\n'Lords of the Landscape: Transhumance in Aragon from the Thirteenth to the Sixteenth centuries'\\n\\nIntroduction.\\n\\nCH 1: The setting up of a pastoral society in Aragon following the pace of the Christian conquest in the Late Middle Ages (13th / 15th centuries) with a focus on the Confraternity of the 'Casa de Ganaderos of Zaragoza'.\\n\\nCH 2: The conflicts between the 'Casa de Ganaderos' and other communities in the northern Pyrenees and in Zaragoza around water, pastures, enclosures, rights of way and boundaries. Political factors will be explored to see how they informed the strategies of the community towards natural resources and the contradictions between current knowledge of the environment and real practices.\\n\\nCH 3: The strategies and criteria of the confraternity in the allocation and use of the natural resources in their own municipal district: Zaragoza in the sixteenth century when the documentation is at its best.\\n\\nCH 4: A reconstruction of the impact of stock-breeding on the landscape of the municipal district of Zaragoza: the creation of a grass enclosure (dehesa) and land for bearing ewes (acampos), the network of roads, the appropriation of watering places, bridges, shelters and huts; in short, the shaping of the shepherds' world within the provincial boundaries.\\nConclusions.\\nMaps.\\n\\nThe CD ROM will include two databases comprising all primary source references to landscape and geographical features (place names) and statistics on transactions and animal/hectare ratios along with sheepherders prosopography and maps reconstructing historical environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F001428/1","grantId":"AH/F001428/1","fundValue":"27227","fundStart":"2008-02-04","fundEnd":"2008-06-03","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Esther  Pascua","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
