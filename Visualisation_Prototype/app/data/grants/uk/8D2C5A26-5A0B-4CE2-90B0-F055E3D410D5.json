{"id":"8D2C5A26-5A0B-4CE2-90B0-F055E3D410D5","title":"Workshop on Global Optimization","abstractText":"The length of the workshop is envisaged to be three days. A number of speakers, both internal and external, have been approached and all have agreed to contribute. There is an even spread between external and internal speakers. It is planned that external (main) speakers be given more time (half a day each) for their presentations. Internal speakers will largely complement the topics covered by the main speakers and will be available for discussions after the workshop. The target audience is mixed, ranging from theoretical researchers to practical users. The content is tailored to suit the needs of a wide range of interests.The topics will include:1) Introduction to global optimisation / domain and motivation;2) The price of global optimisation / how much we are willing to pay to obtain the strict global optimum, or approximate optimum, or when it is not important;3) Methods / deterministic, stochastic, DC functions; 4) Software tools and computing;5) Problems suggested by the audience;6) Discussions and Q&amp;A sessions / This should take place in both, inside the class and on the breaks. Coffee breaks will be included to encourage networking and informal discussions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E054285/1","grantId":"EP/E054285/1","fundValue":"16205","fundStart":"2007-11-07","fundEnd":"2008-11-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Berc  Rustem","coPersons":["E  Pistikopoulos"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
