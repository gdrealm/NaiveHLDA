The trick is to incorporate into the biomolecule a label, another molecule that emits fluorescence when excited by a light source like a laser. Although we can not see the biomolecule itself, we can identify its position by detecting the fluorescence signature coming from the label attached to it. Thus, we can differentiate molecules by labelling them with different fluorescence colours and use this property to investigate how molecules interact and for how long. Also, we can label different parts of the same molecule with different colours to get information about their relative movement. This has made single-molecule fluorescence a particularly powerful technique in elucidating mechanisms of molecular machineries: what they do, how they work individually, how they work together, and finally, how they work inside live cells. We want to apply this technique to study the DNA repair machinery. DNA repair is a very important task and cells devote a lot of energy to this, as mutated DNA or wrong DNA structures can cause severe damage in living organisms if they are copied and propagate. We have studied some of the proteins that participate in this repair mechanism, in particular structure-specific endonucleases such as XPF and FEN1 that recognize anomalous DNA structures and cut DNA strands protruding outside the double helix. These proteins are derived from archaeal organisms, a group of microbes that are very useful models because their DNA processing pathways are rather similar but simpler than those in higher organisms (yeast, worms and humans). We know the structure of these proteins and we have characterized them by conventional techniques, where you look at millions of copies at the same time. However, to further advance in our understanding of these mechanisms we need to extract the information that is only accessible by looking one molecule at a time, in which order they interact, for how long they remain attached to the damage DNA and how they recognize the anomalous DNA structures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E014674/1","grantId":"BB/E014674/1","fundValue":"335109","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by other academics working in the in vivo function of Fen1 and XPF endonucleases and how this is affected by the interaction with PCNA.

WE have developed single molecule assays to investigate the binding and cleaving steps of these proteins. Our data provide a model regarding how FEn1 distorts the DNA substrate to perform its catalytic function.Moreover, we demonstrate that in the presence of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), fen1 function is further enhanced by facilitating the binding of fen1 to the substrate. We have also demonstrated that PCNA has no effect on the catalytic step The single molecule assays developed to investigate FEn1 function can be used to investigated other relevant endonucleases assisted or not by sliding clamps.
