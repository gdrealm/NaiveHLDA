{"id":"BBA4EA39-D86D-4B49-B695-34FD77A85BA7","title":"Colliding Particles - 'Endgame'","abstractText":"1. Increased engagement by students studying science through the provision of high quality and focused classroom resources which support the delivery of the ‘How Science Works’ strand of GCSE and A-level courses, through an exciting and topical context of scientific research.\n\n2. A better understanding of both the scientific process and the realities of working as a scientific researcher amongst students and the general public.\n\n3. An increase in understanding of, and engagement with, current research in particle physics and the scientific process in general amongst both students and the general public, specifically focussing on the proving or disproving of the existence of the Higgs Boson Particle at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n4. An increase in the awareness by students of the benefits of choosing physics as a career choice and a subsequent increase in students studying physics post-16 and in H.E.\n\n5. To produce enduring and definitive documentary films of the groundbreaking research at the LHC, promoting the UK as a leading nation involved in research in particle physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J50158X/1","grantId":"ST/J50158X/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Paterson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Pfilm","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
