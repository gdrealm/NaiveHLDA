Traditionally, philosophers have conceived of them as determinate psychological states that cause, and therefore determine, one's actions. But this conception appears to oversimplify the relationship between a person's intentions and their behaviour (which includes omissions). I propose to explore conceptions of intentions that recognise their fluidity and indeterminacy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000681/1","grantId":"AH/E000681/1","fundValue":"25643","fundStart":"2007-02-05","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Alvarez","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
