However, despite this treasure trove, we have yet to understand how the information encoded in our genome is used by the embryo in order to regulate its normal development. Developmental processes are remarkably similar in all backboned animals and consequently we can compare the human sequence with that of other animals to find those sequences in common and then test them to see if they carry out important functions. A rapid system to do this in is the zebrafish as it is non-invasive (zebrafish lay eggs which are fertilised in the water) and rapid, allowing us to test a large number of candidate sequences. Sequences that we find to be both conserved at the sequence level and functional may be considered critical sequences for normal embryo development, and we can consequently look for associations between mutations in these sequences and developmental disease. We have identified a number of regulatory sequences which are very likely to be important in this way and will use our zebrafish system to gain functional information on them. They are present in all the animals we have looked at so far (including humans, rodents, chicken and fish) and are always found close to genes that are thought to play important roles in development. We will analyse these sequences and look for their association with disease. Furthermore, we will use computational approaches to start to understand the hidden language of this type of sequence. To help other researchers in our field, and to allow the public to access this information, we make all data we generate available through our comprehensive web sites at http://fugu.biology.qmul.ac.uk/ and http://condor.fugu.biology.qmul.ac.uk/","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401138","grantId":"G0401138","fundValue":"778771","fundStart":"2005-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Greg  Elgar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
