Perturbation of these networks can leads to too little or too much growth of the cells or even to cell death. Control and fine-tuning of the diverse networks in response to environmental changes is accomplished by adjusting the abundance of the individual proteins according to the actual needs of the cell.\n\nOne obvious way to do this is to change the levels of their corresponding mRNAs. The Ccr4Not complex, global player in the regulation of the mRNA levels acts at both ends of the spectrum of mRNA life. On the one hand, it can target the RNA polymerase II to genes to produce new copies of mRNAs. On the other, it can prepare selected mRNAs for degradation. In order to ensure that appropriate adjustments are made, the Ccr4Not-complex senses the state of the cell by communicating with reporter proteins. According to the reports received, the complex switches its functionality and regulates mRNA levels either positively or negatively. \n\nToday, we understand very little about how the Ccr4Not complex accomplishes this fascinating role as master control complex. Some evidence suggests that it has different modules, which it can activate, deactivate, add or delete. Yeast has at least two Ccr4Not complexes: a smaller core complex and a larger complex whose various attachments provide additional functionalities. \nI propose to explore where the modules and the attachments are placed and how they switch the functionality of the complex. We will use electron microscopy to visualize the different variants of the complex followed by computational analysis to reconstruct their three-dimensional shapes. The resulting structures will tell us how the different modules are arranged in respect to each other and may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying their regulation of mRNA levels. \n\nThe different variants of the Ccr4Not complex can either promote degradation of mRNA or promote generation of mRNA. These different processes occur at different places in the cell. We will use advanced light microscopy to map the distribution of the different variants of the Ccr4Not complex in cells and determine how this changes under different growth conditions.\n\nAs a master controller, the Ccr4Not complex is vital for the health of cells and organisms. This is especially evident in stress situations, where cells with impaired Ccr4Not complexes fail to grow properly. At the organismal level, defects in the Ccr4Not complex can lead to heart disease or influence the outcome of certain types of cancer. Indeed the links between function of the Ccr4Not-complex and human health are only now beginning to emerge. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of structure/function relationships in the Ccr4Not complex will yield important insights, both for a basic understanding of how cells interact with their environment, but also for human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006351/1","grantId":"BB/J006351/1","fundValue":"501386","fundStart":"2013-01-16","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings and research have been used to train students at a high level Education Economic","person":"Bettina  Boettcher","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" the production of the different building blocks of the Ccr4Not complex was established; the interaction of the building blocks will be further quantified; initial pilot studies were done for developing methods for the efficient and consistent study of these interactions. \n-The project is still ongoing- The research is still under way, the methodological findings have been share at conferences and EMBO courses Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
