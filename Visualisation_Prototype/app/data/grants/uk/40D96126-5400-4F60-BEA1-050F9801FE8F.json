{"id":"40D96126-5400-4F60-BEA1-050F9801FE8F","title":"Characterising Informal Risk Sharing in Family Networks","abstractText":"<p>Risk is extremely prevalent in rural areas of developing countries, but markets for credit and insurance are undeveloped and government-provided social insurance is very rare. Households in these contexts resort to informal tools, such as gifts and inter-personal transfers, to share idiosyncratic risk. Such informal risk sharing occurs within social networks, with family networks, particularly, forming a “natural” risk sharing institution.</p>\n\n<p>This research aims to deepen our understanding of risk sharing in family networks, focusing explicitly on the role of network structure (representation of who is related to who). This is likely important because many informal tools employed for risk sharing rely on bilateral relationships. Therefore, who one is linked with and who their links are further linked with will shape both how risk is shared and the amount shared.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this research will use unique data from Mexico with information on family ties and socio-economic variables to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>provide empirical evidence on the importance of network structure for risk sharing</li>\n\n <li>investigate empirically predictions from theory that networks of higher value provide better insurance</li>\n\n <li>investigate whether altruism, or mutual caring, in family networks allows for more risk sharing when risk sharing arrangements need to be self-sustainable. </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00123X/1","grantId":"ES/K00123X/1","fundValue":"176100","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bansi  Malde","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
