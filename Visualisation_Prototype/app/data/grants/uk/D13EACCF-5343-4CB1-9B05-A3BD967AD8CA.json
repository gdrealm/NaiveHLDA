{"id":"D13EACCF-5343-4CB1-9B05-A3BD967AD8CA","title":"Expanding Understandings of Inclusion: implications of preventing social exclusion for practices in schools","abstractText":"<p>This sixteen month study runs from June 2007 and is jointly led by Professors Anne Edwards and Ingrid Lunt at the University of Oxford, Department of Education. It is located within the Every Child Matters reform of services for children and families. It focuses on secondary schools and teachers as they become part of new local authority systems of practitioners who are working together to disrupt children’s trajectories of exclusion. It comprises five in-depth case studies of schools and a questionnaire with 50 schools to check the wider relevance of case analyses. It identifies the challenges facing schools; examines the features of schools that enable responsive inter-professional collaborations; and the changes in teachers’ practices which arise in them. </p> \n<p>The study is framed by Cultural Historical Activity Theory. The framework allows systemic analyses of schools as organisations alongside analyses of practices. It makes it possible to examine, for example, how schools teachers are interpreting the idea of preventing social exclusion; how the rules in place in the school enable responsive work with other professionals; and how resources designed to help collaboration, such as joint assessment systems, are used.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E025218/1","grantId":"ES/E025218/1","fundValue":"77676","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Edwards","coPersons":["Ingrid  Lunt"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
