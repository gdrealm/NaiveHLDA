The proposed examination of the ethical and moral issues surrounding the reporting of war crimes signals what has become one of the outstanding problems facing journalism in the contemporary era. </p>\n\n<p>As the nature of war has changed, so has the nature of the journalism mandated to cover it, and the selection of war crimes trials, tribunals and truth commissions are key places in which to analyze these changes. </p>\n\n<p>The research involves: a literature review pertinent to the subject area under research; collection of documentary material on the establishment of the International Criminal Court, war crimes tribunals and truth commissions together with details of journalists as witnesses appearing at these trials; and interviews conducted with journalists, editors, lawyers, and humanitarian aid workers in order to explore the core questions of the research relating to: journalistic objectivity and impartiality; the verification of journalists’ stories; the safety repercussions for journalists participating in international trials and tribunals; and the implications for the erosion of confidentiality of journalists’ sources.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1648","grantId":"RES-000-22-1648","fundValue":"52895","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Howard  Tumber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
