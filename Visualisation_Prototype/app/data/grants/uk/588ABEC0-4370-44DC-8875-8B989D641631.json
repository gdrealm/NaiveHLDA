In particular, it concerns regression and cointegration models with thresholds or breaks and large dimensional volatility models. Threshold models are parsimonious and yet flexible, and thus favoured in many empirical studies. However, distribution theory for the threshold or break point estimate is known to be nonstandard and very complicated due to the nature of break, which limits the practical use of such models. The project proposes an estimation method that is based on the smoothing of the non-smooth objective function, which is in the spirit of the smoothed maximum score estimator. The objective of the project includes establishing the asymptotic normality of the new estimator and the validity of the standard bootstrap procedure, which is the case in the smoothed maximum score estimator. The threshold cointegration model will also be considered. The project also develops a large dimensional volatility model based on a factor structure, which introduces a volatility factor, other than the mean factor, that accounts for commonality in volatility movement. Estimation and inference method will be developed based on large n and T setup.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0059","grantId":"RES-061-23-0059","fundValue":"72649","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Myunghwan  Seo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
