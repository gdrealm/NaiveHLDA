This process is called gene expression and it is vital to all life. Gene expression comprises two main steps, called transcription and translation. In transcription, the information in the DNA sequences of the genes is converted into equivalent sequences in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. In translation, the mRNA molecules are 'read' by a large molecular structure called the ribosome, which uses the information to dictate the synthesis of proteins. On the other hand, the mRNA templates for protein synthesis do not survive for ever in the cell, but rather are continually degraded and resynthesised. The degradation of an mRNA molecule is timed to follow a spell of activity in protein synthesis. We will study how this timing is controlled by examining the interactions between the cellular components that are responsible for making proteins from the mRNAs and the components that degrade the mRNA molecules. In this way, we will learn about the balance of synthetic and degradative forces in the cell.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E015778/1","grantId":"BB/E015778/1","fundValue":"350802","fundStart":"2007-07-16","fundEnd":"2010-07-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Edward McCarthy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
