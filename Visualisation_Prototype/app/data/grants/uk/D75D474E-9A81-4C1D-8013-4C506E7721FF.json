This will employ footage shotby video professionals of a performance by a 40 piece community choir of a commissioned choral work to be developed in association with composer Leo Chadburne from a libretto that will be constructed from texts referring to heterodox belief systems identified the world wide web. Through shifting the loci of production: from individual construction to collaboration to group expression it is hoped that the relationships and difference between the component positions will be made available for investigation. It will model means of production that echo those from outside mainstream auteur art-practice and which are drawn more from the anonymous or collective modes of earlier cultural productions to investigate how this shapes readings of a contemporary cultural artefact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G014507/1","grantId":"AH/G014507/1","fundValue":"16171","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Grayson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
