We aim to achieve deeper understanding of the physics of light-matter interactions, embracing colloidal and biological systems, and to enable advances in device concepts to be made, particularly by integration of functional and structured materials, and integration with living systems.This activity is strongly linked, in two way interactions, to a series of intermediate and end users ensuring relevence and that our work benefits the wider community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006683/1","grantId":"EP/F006683/1","fundValue":"771632","fundStart":"2008-03-14","fundEnd":"2012-06-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Michael Smowton","coPersons":["Peter  Blood","Wolfgang  Langbein","D  Westwood"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
