We generate many thousands of these rapid movements everyday. In this project I will focus on how the mechanisms responsible for where and when the eyes are directed are related. It has been shown that saccade accuracy can be improved when the reaction time of the saccade is artificially increased (by about 40 milliseconds) by presenting a distractor (e.g., a sudden onset of a visual stimulus such as a cross) far away in the visual field. It is the aim of this grant to further characterise this effect by examining its basic nature, where and when the distractor appears and its implications for successful visual search (i.e., finding a desired object among distracting objects). This has implications for the understanding how the visual environment should be designed to interface optimally with humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D053145/1","grantId":"EP/D053145/1","fundValue":"127964","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eugene  McSorley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
