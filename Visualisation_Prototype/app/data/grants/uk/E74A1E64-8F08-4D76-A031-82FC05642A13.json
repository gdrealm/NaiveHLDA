Those who have grown up interacting with digital technology from a very early age are still young, whilst older technology adopters have identities that pre-date the Digital Age, populated with paper trails of memories. Many citizens have only a limited awareness of the permanency and consequence of posting in public and extended social circles. Digital posts from student or teenage years reflecting opinions or behaviour that seemed socially appropriate at that time may not reflect well in future professional life. Digitally mediated interactions produced in life may develop an undesirable perspective if they linger after physical death. The lifelong digital trails generated through our digitally mediated interactions, including online, echo our 'offline' lives, but unlike a physical life, the Digital Lifespan can persist indefinitely, and the rich personal context it provides can be harnessed in ways an individual might not expect or desire.\n\nIn this EPSRC-funded research, we will produce unique insights into the digital lifespan of UK citizens both now and in a future where our young Digital Natives approach adulthood, become parents, retire, and pass away. To help generate\nthese insights, we will first chart the unmapped territory of the &quot;Digital Lifespan&quot; as it is now in the UK, exploring the ways in which virtual and physical aspects of our lives converge, diverge and clash. This chart will be grounded in a series of in-depth studies with UK citizens at four transition points in their lives: approaching adulthood, becoming parents, retiring, and bereavement.\n\nThe chart that we create will guide us as we look into a future where citizens increasingly live out their lives through digitally mediated interactions. We will explore the implications of this future with individuals, policymakers, legislators and industry representatives. The knowledge and insight developed into issues surrounding ownership and management of citizens' Digital Lifespans will be used to raise digital literacy. New technologies will be designed and developed, bringing personal digital content together in one place to create a far richer picture than that afforded by currently available tools. Our new technologies will automatically draw out the personal context of such content, making inferential links and distilling the impressions that citizens present of themselves through digital media. These distilled impressions will be reflected back to individuals, raising digital literacy by promoting awareness of how individuals' digital identities are (or will in future be) represented online over their entire lifespan. Further these novel technologies will equip citizens with ways to manage the impression that they give.\n\nBeyond individual citizens, our work will inform educators, policymakers and legislators providing a deeper understanding of what it means to live as a UK citizen in a Digital Age.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L00383X/1","grantId":"EP/L00383X/1","fundValue":"704221","fundStart":"2013-08-28","fundEnd":"2016-08-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wendy  Moncur","coPersons":["Abigail Christine Durrant","John Philip Collomosse","Mike  Chantler"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Charting the Digital Lifespan (CDL) is a two-year project investigating the digital lifespan of UK citizens both now and in a future where Digital Natives (who are currently young adults) will experience three key transition points in the human lifespan: leaving secondary school, becoming a parent, and retiring from work.\n\nCombining social, technical, design, and cultural expertise, the CDL project considers what it means for individuals to 'live out' digital lives across the complete human lifespan.\n\nOur research involves talking to people and finding out about their experiences, as well as the design and evaluation of novel technologies for depicting and managing digital representations across the lifespan. We're generating a rich picture of what the digital lifespan means for our UK population by charting how people live their lives online now and expect to in the near future.
