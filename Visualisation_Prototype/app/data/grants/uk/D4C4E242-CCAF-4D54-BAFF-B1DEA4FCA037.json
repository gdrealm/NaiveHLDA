The nose is an important sensory organ, and a portion of the inspired air is directed towards the upper portion of the interior nasal cavity where the olfactory receptors are located. In order to perform these different physiological functions, the internal nasal cavity possesses protrusions (turbinates) which interact with the jet of inspired air, producing complex flow patterns to improve heat and water exchange and retain samples of air for olfaction. Understanding the mechanisms governing the interaction between nasal geometry and airflow is not only of fundamental physiological importance, but of great potential benefit in health care, therapeutic drug delivery and environmental hazard assessment. Detailed in-vivo measurement of air-flow and particle deposition in humans is extremely difficult, and the large disparities in anatomical features between species means that extrapolation of the flow and transport characteristics from animal studies is of questionable validity. Computational modeling is thus needed to build predictive capabilities. This will help doctors to understand and assess nasal function in health and disease, they will provide a more rational basis for surgeons to plan and judge the success of interventions, they will allow scientists to investigate the mechanics of gas transport and particle deposition which is needed to improve drug delivery and environmental assessment, and they can be used for many other beneficial purposes. Recently computational techniques combined with in-vivo imaging have been developed which provide a means to model nasal air flow, and a number of studies have recently shed some light on the complex nature of flow in the nasal cavity. However no attempt has yet been made to develop and to apply systematic procedures to characterize the functional significance of the wide variation in normal nasal airway anatomy found in the population. Even for a given individual, there is a lack of detailed information on how changes in airway geometry affect the air flow and transport characteristics. Our first aim is to determine the geometric form of the nasal airway, initially from more than twenty individuals. We will develop and apply mathematical techniques to characterize the ways in which nasal geometry varies, and assess the significance of these variations for physiological performance. The initial data set will gradually grow through contributions from colleagues in other countries, and will provide a valuable resource to provide more accurate modeling and prediction of physiological function and for many applications. Our second aim is to investigate how the variation in nasal geometry in an individual affects flow and transport. There are several factors which produce intra-individual geometric changes, for example in most normal adults, each side of the nasal airways alternately congests and decongests to a varying extent in a process termed the nasal cycle, altering the flow (and often sensation), and rapid sniffing causes partial collapse of the external nose. We will apply novel imaging techniques to investigate these changes. By studying the flow through simulation and by experiments in replica models, we will then be able to understand the significance of such alterations in the conditions that determine the flow. Our third aim is to study the very complex physical processes which cause the air flow in the nose to become unstable at higher inspiratory rates, to determine how to model such processes, and to study their impact for transport in the nasal airways. Overall we aim to provide both the data and the techniques needed for the first systematic exploration of nasal air flow and transport across a broad range of individuals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E023444/1","grantId":"BB/E023444/1","fundValue":"673877","fundStart":"2007-06-06","fundEnd":"2011-05-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The main outcome of the research is that we now have a much better understanding of how the shape of the nasal airways, together with the manner in which we inhale enables the nose to accomplish its disparate physiological functions. We have also provided a rationale for the abandonment of a hitherto common surgical technique intended to improve sinunasal health. The research has provided a detailed mechanistic understanding of nasal airflow, exploring the relation between flow and airway anatomy. Combining innovative experimental techniques (e.g. imaging in replica models and in-vivo) with computations, key parameters have been established and new phenomena discovered. The findings are important for physiology, medicine and applications such as drug delivery and toxicology. \n\nThe main findings of the grant were as follows.\nFirst, the temporo-spatial profile of inspiration differs in key respects from that implied by prior steady flow studies, compounding the influence of local anatomical variability on the loading of mucosal tissues. \n\nSecondly, we showed how nasal respiration affects gas exchange with the maxillary sinuses. It established how anatomic variations in sinus-airway ostia upset the milieu of the sinuses and gas exchange. \n\nThe techniques developed in the research and its outputs research has been used for basic studies and for applied clinical research as follows: (i) to validate computational modelling of large airway flows, with more ambitious projects to map whole airway dynamics underway; (ii) to develop procedures which are now allowing us to quantify the effects of topical decongestants\n(iii) to suggest new imaging techniques to quantify sinunasal exchange (based on radioactive tracer gases)\n(iv) to develop computational means to assess the impact of different airway pathologies. This work is now being pursued by NHS-supported clinical researchers attached to the project.\nSince the project grant finished, two surgeons have been trained in the geometric reconstruction techniques used in the project and a third has just started her MD; collaborations with a number of different surgical groups to use the methodologies are now beginning. More advance simulation techniques are also being developed in an international collaboration.
