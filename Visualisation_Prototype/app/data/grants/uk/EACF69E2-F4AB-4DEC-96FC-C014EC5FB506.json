We have shown that our methods offer improvement over OFDM in certain practical situations. The polynomial matrix techniques were found to be unsuitable for the design of resource allocation algorithms for MU-MIMO systems due to the lack of decentralized control strategies. Game theory was found to be an excellent tool for the design of distributed algorithms for power control in MU-MIMO systems. The application of iterative waterfilling algorithms for power control in broadband MU-MIMO systems was analytically characterized using techniques from game theory. A distribution-free robust iterative waterfilling algorithm was proposed and characterized, with sufficient conditions for existence an uniqueness of the solution. Further, these techniques were extended to systems with bounded uncertainty in channel state information. This world-leading work has been written up as a PhD thesis at Loughborough University. In the context of SU-MIMO channels, it was shown that the Polynomial Matrix QR decomposition algorithm (developed under this project) provides a useful alternative to the conventional OFDM approach for exploiting the spatial diversity offered by fast fading channels. Hoowever,the polynomial matrix method avoids the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) problem associated with the OFDM approach. Researchers in ICT could use the algorithms in other application domains. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
