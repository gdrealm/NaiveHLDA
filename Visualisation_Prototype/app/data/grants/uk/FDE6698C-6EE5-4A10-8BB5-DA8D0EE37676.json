Who do they become? </p>\n\n<p>One way to examine this is by using sociolinguistic methods to study the language variety migrants acquire once they have settled in a country. To do this, the project investigates the acquisition and sociolinguistic variation of local and non-local non-standard linguistic features among pupils of Polish descent in schools in London and Edinburgh. The large group of newcomers from Poland represents a unique chance to conduct a comparative study in two locales with different local dialects. It will show how immersion in differing contexts of language variation influences migrants' speech. Sociolinguistic methods are used to document how migrant pupils speak, and compare them to a local control group of age-matched teenagers. This reveals where the linguistic features Polish pupils use come from. By studying pupils' language attitudes and the language norms they're aware of, researchers can find out about the motivations behind different patterns of language use. Attitudes may influence what linguistic features pupils use, and how they indicate through language who they are becoming.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G027145/1","grantId":"ES/G027145/1","fundValue":"81553","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Miriam  Meyerhoff","coPersons":["Erik  Schleef"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
