CFS is characterised by prolonged, debilitating fatigue that can be triggered by minimal activity (NICE, 2010). The fatigue is accompanied symptoms which can include painful muscles and joints, disordered sleep, gastric disturbances and cognitive impairment and is sometimes associated with depression. CFS can affect people of any age but is most common between the ages of 25 and 45. Evidence suggests between 150,000 and 250,000 people are affected in the UK. The effect of CFS on quality of life is substantial, with some individuals becoming housebound, employment becoming difficult or impossible, disrupted education in younger sufferers and thus represents a substantial effect on the quality of life for people with the condition, their families and carers.\n\nThe mechanisms by which an initial event leads to the chronic debilitating muscle fatigue and pain are unknown. The time required for diagnosis (typically 4 - 6 months) further complicates the identification of the factor(s) responsible for initiation of the illness. Irrespective of the factor(s) which initiates the illness, reversal of the severely debilitating fatigue which ensues remains the most promising form of treatment.\n\nA number of studies have suggested that there is a defect in the energy producing components of muscle cells, known as mitochondria but, although this is core to understanding muscle fatigue in patients with CFS, the presence of abnormal mitochondria in muscle of patients with CFS remains the subject of considerable debate as other studies have failed to demonstrate a defect. The reasons for such different findings are likely due to the previously limited methods of analysis for mitochondrial function with a lack of availability of appropriate and sensitive techniques to determine mitochondrial function directly in human muscle fibres. However, a new technique to study mitochondria in muscle fibres in situ from humans has now been developed and is established in our laboratory. \n\nWe hypothesise that the application of these newly developed techniques will demonstrate that skeletal muscle mitochondria in patients with CFS are dysfunctional and that this results in muscle fatigue. The dysfunctional mitochondria then activate a process which leads to a chronic, low grade inflammation, commonly reported in patients with CFS, which in turn results in further mitochondrial abnormalities and the establishment of a vicious circle of events. Nutritional interventions that modify mitochondrial function or modify the systemic inflammation will break this vicious circle and improve muscle function and improvement in muscle function and or the direct effects of polyphenols will result in improved wellbeing of individuals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J002895/1","grantId":"MR/J002895/1","fundValue":"252030","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  McArdle","coPersons":["Louise  Dye","Clare Louise Lawton","Francis  McArdle","Michael Barrington James  Beadsworth"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
