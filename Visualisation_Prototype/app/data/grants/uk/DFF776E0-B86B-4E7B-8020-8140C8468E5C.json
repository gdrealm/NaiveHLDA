These molecules have unique properties (such as base-pairing) that make them ideally suited to their role. \n\nIt is now clear that some synthetic nucleic acids (or XNAs) can also store genetic information, enabling a number of potential applications, based on the chemical properties of the individual XNAs. Our goal is to establish a novel XNA, based on oxymethylphosphonates (PMTs), as a genetic material with a view to developing a PMT genetic system that can be introduced and maintained in vivo, in bacterial cells. \n\nThere are many challenges to introduce a stable genetic element into a cell that is not based on DNA; a number of conditions must be fulfilled for that to be achieved: \n1. The genetic element and its precursors cannot be toxic to the cells and should be maintained isolated from the cell machinery. \n2. Precursors must be readily assimilated by the cells but not interfere with the their metabolism. \n3. The genetic element has to be replicated in vivo, so as to be maintained as cells divide. \n4. The genetic information in the XNA system must be of use to the cell, otherwise it will be lost.\n\nThe chemical modifications in PMT are expected to make natural enzymes that normally interact with DNA or RNA, unable to interact or degrade PMT molecules, minimising PMT toxicity and creating a natural separation between natural and synthetic genes. That separation will be maximised by adapting a stable genetic element from yeast, which we believe will replicate in bacteria independently from the bacterial genetic material.\nUsing rational design, high-throughput assays and directed evolution, we will first establish PMT as a genetic material and then obtain a specialist enzyme, based on natural enzymes that replicate DNA, capable of replicating PMTs. \n\nPMT maintenance in vivo, in addition to the replicase and a stable genetic element, also requires efficient precursor uptake and a link between PMT and cell survival. Phosphonates, like PMT precursors, can be readily taken up by bacterial cells using dedicated transporters but we will also explore other approaches to ensure maximum uptake. In addition, we will identify PMT molecules capable of carrying out chemical reactions essential for cell viability. Synthesis of these PMT molecules in vivo will enable cell survival, ensuring stability for the PMT information and genetic elements.\n\nEstablishing an XNA element in vivo should give us great insight into the origin of life and into how to define life itself. It will establish a platform for the development of therapeutic agents based on PMTs and a safer transgenic organism - a contained organism dependent on the continuous supply of synthetic precursors and encoding information inaccessible to natural organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N01023X/1","grantId":"BB/N01023X/1","fundValue":"714648","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vitor  Pinheiro","coPersons":["Philipp  Holliger"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
