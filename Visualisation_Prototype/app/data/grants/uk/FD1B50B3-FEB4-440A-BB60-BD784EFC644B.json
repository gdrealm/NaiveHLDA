{"id":"FD1B50B3-FEB4-440A-BB60-BD784EFC644B","title":"Identifying sustainable pathways out of in-work poverty","abstractText":"<p>This project provides a unique and valuable opportunity for a team of social scientists from the University of York and three important employers from the York labour market (City of York Council, Joseph Rowntree Foundation/Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust and York St John University) to collaborate on an applied research project, using mixed-methods research to underpin a knowledge exchange.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research project and knowledge exchange will focus on one specific geographical labour market, York. However the challenges currently being faced by these three employers are not York specific. The knowledge exchange will centre on the design and analysis of a structured quantitative poverty survey and a follow-up qualitative survey of employees from the project partnersâ€™ workforce, as well as an economic analysis of the recent Living Wage implementation at each of the three partner organisations. The applied research project will allow a knowledge exchange between the research team and the project partners on the likely effectiveness of current measures being employed to reduce in-work poverty within their organisations. In addition, via the active engagement with the applied research project the project partners will be part of a collaborative discussion centred on sharing and developing effective and sustainable approaches to in-work poverty.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002086/1","grantId":"ES/L002086/1","fundValue":"90084","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna Kate Swaffield","coPersons":["Carolyn Jane Snell","Jonathan Richard Bradshaw","Rebecca  Tunstall"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
