We will address the Atlantic, UK shelf and slope waters, and selected locations in the Southern Ocean, using data from time series stations and volunteer observing ships (VOS), measuring three parameters of the marine carbonate system. The programme will be integrated with the efforts of colleagues in other European countries, (enablng better and longer-term coverage, and of of a wider area). It will be co-ordinated with the Surface ocean carbon atlas project (SOCAT) which aims to produce the most comprehensive and up to date data base to access all the quality data relevant to ocean carbon uptake, and from which pH trends can be derived. Estimation of decadal trends change will be set against the background of intra- and inter-annual variation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H017054/1","grantId":"NE/H017054/1","fundValue":"137595","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Changes in the pH of seawater have both direct and indirect impacts on marine chemistry, marine biology and on the ability of the oceans to take up anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Our measurements are submitted to SOCAT an international database and findings used by us, national and international scientists to assess the ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Results feed into the IPCC reports and hence to governments and policy makers.

Measurements of the concentrations of carbon dioxide gas both in the atmosphere and in the water were made and samples collected for the analysis of inorganic carbon and alkalinity. With these measurements we can calculate the pH of seawater. We also made measurements of carbon dioxide in the air and water at two fixed locations off Plymouth and in a field experiment around the UK\n1. To increase the number of measurements of this gas in remote areas of the oceans and in coastal shelf seas. These data will be used by PML, UK and International scientists to determine how much carbon dioxide the oceans are taking up from the atmosphere and how quickly the pH of the oceans and shelf seas are reducing in response to this uptake. The Western English Channel is a net sink for atmospheric CO2 over an annual cycle This work will contribute to work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, by informing on the role of coastal seas and the open oceans as sinks for atmospheric and anthropogenic CO2 and how quickly the pH of seawater is responding to this uptake.
