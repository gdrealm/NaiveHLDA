{"id":"5F8E9F51-DF31-48CF-8771-EB53B7118618","title":"Sino-British Institute for Materials Research","abstractText":"As China is set to be the major source of global economic growth for the next decades, it is clearly essential that the UK is linked into and can benefit both from the excellent research that is being fostered in China (China's engineering research is already in the world top three for impact, for example, and second in Physics, with nearly 20% of world papers), and from the potential for the exploitation and implementation of that research.\nQueen Mary has an outstanding track record of working in collaboration with Chinese partners. Our ability to collaborate successfully with China HEI's is best evidenced in our long-term award-winning partnership with China in teaching\nproviding IET-accredited joint (dual) degree programmes in telecommunications with BUPT, but also through institutional partnerships and research centres, and through numerous individual research collaborations. Our track record of working with industrial partners in China builds on the Innovation China UK (ICUK) programme which was the first UK-China collaboration to promote joint innovation and knowledge transfer. Launched in 2007, the &pound;4.9 million HEFCE and BISfunded initiative, was led by Queen Mary and with the end of the original funding ICUK has been embedded into Queen Mary's business development unit.\n\nThis project aims to build on Queen Mary's experience in China to develop our joint Sino-British Institute for Materials Research with Sichuan University and use it as a base for developing collaborations with top Chinese Institutions which are funded primarily through the Chinese Government.\n\nThe project aims to build on our existing strengths in Organic photonics and spintronics to develop true international research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L020114/1","grantId":"EP/L020114/1","fundValue":"70718","fundStart":"2014-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Paul Gillin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
