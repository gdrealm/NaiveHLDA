{"id":"504DA0C6-421F-43C8-853A-811D67AEAF1E","title":"The Cultured Rainforest: Long-term human ecological histories in the highlands of Borneo","abstractText":"Though rainforests are frequently described as the world's last 'virgin landscape', recent work in tropical Southeast Asia (the region with the longest evidence for modern humans living in rainforest) has shown that hunter-gatherers were modifying rainforest by clearing and burning vegetation over 40,000 years ago. By contrast, some modern rainforest hunter-gatherers traditionally assumed to be remnants of a 'natural' way of life of deep antiquity may in fact be a relatively recent response to landscapes created by farmers. Many rainforest dwellers today are engaged in both foraging and farming and have historically moved in both directions along a continuum between the two. So how has rainforest shaped the lives of forest-dwellers, and how have forest-dwellers shaped the rainforest? To answer these questions this project will chart the great time-depth of human action that has shaped the rainforests of Southeast Asia, and reveal its changing character. As out project title indicates, we shall explicitly avoid a simple division between 'nature' and 'culture' and concentrate instead on the mutual shaping of people and the physical world. The project necessitates a collaboration of disciplines, with anthropologists and historians providing a detailed picture of human-rainforest relations today and in the recent past, and archeologists and environmental scientists teasing out sequences of long-term landscape change over the last 40,000 years. The area chosen for study, the Kelabit highlands of Sarawak in Borneo, is ideal because, unusually, it is still inhabited by both Kelabit rice farmers and by Penan hunter-gatherers. The antiquity of rice growing and the role of other crops in the past in highland Borneo are entirely unknown, but the potential antiquity of forest habitation is indicated by a wide range of archeological monuments. The project is particularly timely because in the face of logging and other forces of globalization the forest, the lives of its present-day inhabitants, and the archeological evidence for their history, are unlikely to survive in present form beyond a few more years.\\n\\nThe project will have three main strands. Anthropologists will collect information on present-day forest life and the past as people remember or imagine it. They will study how objects (material culture) are used today, and will study objects and photographs in museum collections to reconstruct the role of material culture in the past. Archeologists will conduct surveys, excavate selected monuments, and employ a range of innovative techniques in archeological science, to establish the lifeways of past forest dwellers from prehistoric to recent times. Palaeoecologists will study fossil pollen to document the long-term history of the forest and people's impacts on it. All of the team has experience of working in rainforest environments in the region.\\n\\nWe shall publish the project as specialist papers and a major book for the academic readership, and disseminate it through websites including an existing Kelabit e-network. We shall make presentations to the local communities, and bring together their oral histories as a community-based book. We shall organise an international conference to place our results in a comparative global context. We shall prepare an exhibition ('The Cultured Rainforest') of modern and archeological Penan and Kelabit materials for display in the UK (George Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford) and in Sarawak. Our results will directly inform current political debates and policy-making regarding the future of the Kelabit Highlands, the forest, and its forest-dwellers, whose traditional lifeways are under tremendous threat from logging.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E510574/1","grantId":"AH/E510574/1","fundValue":"461344","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Graeme  Barker","coPersons":["Christopher Hugh Gosden","Huw James Barton","Christopher Owen Hunt","Monica  Janowski"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
