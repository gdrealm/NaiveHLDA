{"id":"D0BA39B3-996D-4A2F-B4FF-8D56FFA03671","title":"The Conjecture of Dixmier","abstractText":"In Mathematics there are two old open problems: the Jacobian\nConjecture (open since 1938) for the polynomial algebras\n in n variables and the\nConjecture of Dixmier (open since 1968) for the algebras A(n) of\npolynomial differential operators, the so-called Weyl algebras,\n that claims that\nthe Weyl algebras behave like the finite fields. More precisely,\n every algebra endomorphism of the Weyl algebra is an\nautomorphism. In 1982, Bass, Connell and Wright proved that the\nConjecture of Dixmier implies the Jacobian Conjecture. In\n2005-07, Tsuchimoto, Belov-Kanel and Kontsevich proved that these\ntwo conjectures are equivalent. The Weyl algebra A(n) is a\n subalgebra of the algebra I(n) of polynomial integro-differential\noperators. At the end of 2010, I proved that an an analogue of the\nConjecture of Dixmier holds for the algebra I(1) (V. Bavula, ``An\nanalogue of the Conjecture of Dixmier is true for the algebra of\npolynomial integro-differential operators,'' Arxiv:math.RA:\n1011.3009), and conjectured that the same result is true for all\nalgebras I(n). The aim of this project is to prove this conjecture\nand as a result to have a progress on the Conjecture of Dixmier.\nAnother goal of the project is to find the K-groups for the\nalgebras I(n) and to answer the question of whether or not the\nBott periodicity holds. The most interesting (and difficult) is\nthe case of the K(1)-groups for the algebras I(n) since it leads\nto finding explicit generators for the automorphism groups of the\nalgebras I(n). The groups of automorphisms of the algebras I(n)\nare infinite dimensional algebraic groups. Little is known about\ntheir structure in general. In the polynomial case there are\nseveral papers by Shafarevich (1966, 1981) and more recently by\nKambayashi (1996, 2003, 2004). We are going to obtain\ngeneralizations of these results for the Weyl algebras A(n) and\nI(n).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J009342/1","grantId":"EP/J009342/1","fundValue":"55281","fundStart":"2012-04-09","fundEnd":"2014-10-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"V  Bavula","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
