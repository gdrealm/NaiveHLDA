{"id":"B3EACFFA-3081-433D-AD05-A700898BF18A","title":"Contemporary practice in digital music, post-digital music and electronica","abstractText":"This project will document the contemporary practice of nine leading audio artists working in digital music, post-digital music and experimental electronica. These genres are areas of musical and cultural activity showing new trends and approaches to musical composition, supported, informed and driven by technology. This research will consider the application of technology, the cultural and economic operating circumstances of the genres and the aesthetic stance of composers working in the field. \\n\\nThe project will include composer residencies by artists who work within the commercial experimental music domain, not 'electroacoustic' composers or composers employed in Universities. Each composer will be invited to create a new work and participate in the research project. The project will research their creative outputs, discuss, analyse and document their working practice, and hold a series of interviews and discussions. The research will investigate the following issues: how musical, technological and aesthetic influences are combined, controlled and developed within the genres; how the music operates within a commercial domain; how the music is distributed and disseminated; new relationships between artists and their audience (enabled by technology); new forms of musical consumption; new forms of musical function; how the democratisation of technology has facilitated, or otherwise, this body of work; the role of performance and improvisation in the creation and presentation of the musics, and the significance of technology (software and hardware) to enable new forms of musical expression.\\n\\nThe research will produce a series of papers documenting contemporary aesthetics, practice and process in electronica genres, two doctoral theses and a book. Each individual paper will focus upon the aesthetic stance, working practices, methods and output of a single composer. To accompany the project's written outputs, interviews with each composer will be broadcast on the internet. \\n\\nThis proposal recognises that knowledge in this area of musical culture lies predominantly outside academia and seeks to engage with practitioners and professionals directly. This will establish a bi-directional flow of knowledge into and out of the academic domain, following models of contemporary research and its relations to society proposed by Nowotny (Nowotny, 2006).\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E002056/1","grantId":"AH/E002056/1","fundValue":"195903","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Myatt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
