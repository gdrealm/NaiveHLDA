These tumours are\ncharacterised by extensive infiltration of normal brain by tumour cells. These migrating cells render it impossible to\ncompletely remove the tumour surgically and as a consequence the survival for victims of this kind of tumour is particularly\npoor, with the vast majority of patients not surviving beyond two years after diagnosis. It is thought that an effective therapy\nthat targets the tumour cells that invade the brain would be of great use in treating this disease. Dr Lawler has identified a\nstrategy that blocks glioblastoma cell migration by acting on a specific cellular protein called GSK-3. Because GSK-3 is \nimplicated in common illnesses including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, a large number of drugs have been \ndeveloped that will block its action. \nDr Lawler has shown that these drugs also potently block adult brain tumour cell migration. Astra-Zeneca have developed\ndrugs that target GSK-3 for potential use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. One of these drugs, AZD1080\nhas been tested in humans, and here we will carry out studies that will determine whether it is suitable for the \ntreatment of glioblastoma - a new application for this drug, which may represent the fastest way of getting \nthis approach to the clinic.\nAZD1080 will be tested in a variety of laboratory models of glioblastoma alongside existing treatments. \nEvidence of activity in these models will be used to support future clinical trials.It is hoped that this study will \nultimately contribute to the development of an effective clinical approach for the treatment of glioblastoma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015214/1","grantId":"MR/K015214/1","fundValue":"406779","fundStart":"2013-11-11","fundEnd":"2016-11-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Short","coPersons":["Sam  Butterworth"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
