{"id":"F7F2FF46-44F6-4165-B5AA-7FD8796D7F6C","title":"Development of a meningococcal disease vaccine based on heat shock protein complexes","abstractText":"There is an urgent need for an effect vaccine to prevent serogroup B meningococcal disease. This causes about 1200-1500 cases of disease with about 100 deaths per year in the UK, with many more deaths worldwide. To date scientists have not been able to develop a vaccine that can protect against all the strains that cause disease. This vaccine, based on heat shock protein complexes presents a wide range of parts of the bacterium to the human immune system in a very effective way, offering the potential for cross strain protection. This proposal is to develop a manufacturing process for the vaccine so it can be made in the quantity and manner to be suitable for injection into large numbers of children.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902176","grantId":"G0902176","fundValue":"665382","fundStart":"2010-05-07","fundEnd":"2011-11-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Richard Gorringe","coPersons":["Susan  Clarke","Nigel  Allison","Camilo  Colaco","Chris  Bailey","Graham  Clarke"],"organisation":"Public Health England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
