{"id":"7A6BE5DB-1D95-4476-83E6-F193186B05BA","title":"Beyond the Community: Migrant Club Cultures and Queer Diasporic Identifications","abstractText":"This research project investigates cultural identifications and forms of sociality among 'queer' migrants participating in the diasporic club cultures of London and Berlin. Culturally marginal both on the basis of their sexual orientation/ gender expression and their ethnic minority belonging, queer migrants rely on club culture as an opportunity for socialising among themselves, developing positive identifications in protected spaces, and challenging the confines of dominant cultural labels. The aim is to analyse whether queer migrant cultures should be seen as new forms of cultural community, or challenge us to develop new concepts in order to describe them as cultural formations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119482/1","grantId":"119482/1","fundValue":"9882","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kira  Kosnick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Nottingham Trent University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
