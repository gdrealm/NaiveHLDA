{"id":"E1DEF901-613C-4726-8BEC-5B57DDEBB970","title":"Antibodies to the MET receptor for cancer therapy","abstractText":"The most important cause of death in patients with cancer is the migration of cancer cells away from the primary tumour and the emergence of secondary tumours at distance sites in the body, a process called metastasis. At present there are very few effective treatments for metastatic cancer. In this project we aim to develop a therapeutic antibody to MET, a protein critical for initiating the migration of cancer cells. We have made progress in understanding the architecture and the three-dimensional structure of MET and, through the technology available in the laboratories of our Industrial Partner UCB-Celltech, we have a strong prospect of developing an antibody that can block the activity of MET in tumour cells and with potential for the treatment of metastatic cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800858","grantId":"G0800858","fundValue":"268975","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-01-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ermanno  Gherardi","coPersons":["Graham  Craggs","Colin Richard  Stubberfield"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
