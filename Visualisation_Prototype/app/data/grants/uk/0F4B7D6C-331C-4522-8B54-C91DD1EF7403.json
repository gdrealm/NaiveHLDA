These are scientific reviews and analyses that aim to identify and integrate all reliable research studies pertinent to the question at hand. The Cochrane Collaboration is an international organisation undertaking systematic reviews and meta-analyses to compare interventions in all areas of health care. Its database currently includes over 4,500 systematic reviews, many of which contain meta-analyses to combine key results across multiple clinical trials of the same intervention.\n\nThe validity of a meta-analysis depends on the validity of the individual studies contained in it. Since January 2008, Cochrane authors have been encouraged to use a specific 'Risk of Bias' tool for assessing potential biases in the individual trials prior to conducting the meta-analysis. However, it is unclear how these assessments should be incorporated into the meta-analyses. Two recently proposed methods are: (A) to adjust the results using off-the-shelf adjustments based on what is known about previous trials with similar flaws (a data-based method); and (B) to adjust the results using expert opinion, elicited specifically for each trial in the meta-analysis (an opinion-based method).\n\nIn our research, we will make use of a newly constructed data set consisting of 300-400 recent meta-analyses with completed Risk of Bias assessments, from The Cochrane Collaboration. First we will use the research database to examine the agreement between opinion-based and data-based approaches to evaluating biases. On the basis of these investigations, we will develop an integrated approach to adjusting for bias in meta-analysis, which makes use of both data and opinion. We will ask experts to draw on the Risk of Bias table for each particular trial as well as data we have about biases from trials with the same types of flaws as the trial at hand. Three different approaches for integrating methods A and B will be considered.\n \nTo assess the practicalities of the proposed new integrated method, we will select two case study meta-analyses from the research database, one including fewer than 10 trials and one including 30-50 trials, and compare methods A, B and the newly developed integrated methods for bias adjustment in these meta-analyses.\n\nOn the basis of our experiences of using Risk of Bias tables, we will consider how Cochrane review authors could most usefully discuss and interpret the information presented.\n\nFinally, we will develop guidelines for bias adjustment in meta-analysis, targeted at researchers carrying out Cochrane reviews or reviews commissioned by NICE or the HTA programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/K014587/1","grantId":"MC_EX_MR/K014587/1","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Turner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Centre Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
