Many risk and protective factors for substance misuse in young people are located in the family. The Strengthening Families 10-14 UK programme aims to strengthen areas of family life that protect against substance misuse (parenting, communication, and young people?s resilience skills). The study will identify whether the programme delays or reduces substance use, and collect information that will help in wider implementation of the programme if successful.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802128","grantId":"G0802128","fundValue":"2144990","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon MARK Murphy","coPersons":["Jonathan Bryn  Scourfield","Ceri James Phillips","Zoe Elizabeth Roberts","Jeremy Russell Segrott","Kerenza  Hood","Joanne Claire Holliday","Laurence Anthony Moore","David  Foxcroft"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
