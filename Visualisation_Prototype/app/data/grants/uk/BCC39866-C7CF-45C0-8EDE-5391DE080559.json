{"id":"BCC39866-C7CF-45C0-8EDE-5391DE080559","title":"The Mexican Revolution: Photography and Iconicity","abstractText":"An eminently newsworthy historic event, the Mexican revolution (1910-1917) generated hundreds and thousands of photographic images. Indeed, with its key protagonists Fancisco Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Venustiano Carranza and Francisco I. Madero employing photographers to document their campaigns, the revolution is arguably the first 'media war' of the twentieth century. Yet, in the post-revolutionary period, as the new ruling elite established itself in power, particularly from the 1940s on, only a handful of images received the kind of exposure that has led to iconic status. Indeed, on the eve of the revolution's centenary, even the most casual visitor to Mexico cannot fail to notice their presence in the everyday: from tourist paraphernalia, through to more solemn commemorations of this nation-defining event.\n\nIt is one thing to acknowledge that as endlessly reproduced and persistent artifacts, certain images have insinuated themselves into everyday Mexican life to the degree that they have become instantly recognisable; it is another to investigate the terms and conditions of photographic iconicity in the context of post-revolutionary Mexico. Working at the interface of photography studies, cultural history and memory studies, this project aims to address the terms and conditions of photo iconicity. In so doing, it will make a timely and important contribution not only to Mexican cultural studies, but also to t11e broader fields of photography and memory studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504051/1","grantId":"AH/E504051/1","fundValue":"26232","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrea  Noble","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
