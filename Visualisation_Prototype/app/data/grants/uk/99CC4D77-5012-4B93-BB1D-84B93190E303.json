Relating these to offender sightings and arrests will demonstrate the risks of different strategies and inform theoretical evaluation and policy recommendations about targeted patrol deployment, graded patrol responses, situational prevention, police management and resource allocation. </p>\n\n<p>The relationships between the areas that different offenders select for targeting and offenders' neighbourhoods and homes will be examined in order to establish temporal-spatial targeting patterns. </p>\n\n<p>Existing studies of non-residential burglary either compare burgled and non-burgled properties using victimisation indicators or are based on interviews with imprisoned offenders. This study will involve adding offender data and small area census data to existing data collected from officer questionnaires, victim interviews and site surveys. Hence, data on police response, crime investigation and outcome, victim and target characteristics, offender characteristics, and area circumstances will be tied to a sample of individual burglary incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H007288/1","grantId":"ES/H007288/1","fundValue":"53017","fundStart":"2009-10-26","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Timothy Coupe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
