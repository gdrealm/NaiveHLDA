However, there are several materials systems in which the electron and hole separate just across the heterojunction and form a bound charge-transfer states. In this project a number of optical techniques have been developed to measure the strength and effect of these bound states. In one study, for a model polymer-polymer heterojunction we have been able to show that this binding energy is rather large, of order 0.25 eV; this is the first report of the size of this binding energy and sets an important measure for future device designs. In another study, we have shown that up to 50% of the photo excitations produced in an organic semiconductor - zinc oxide structure form bound electron-hole pairs, which can be substantially ionised through optical absorption of a second, IR energy photon that breaks up the localised hole wave function. These fundamental studies, carried out within a EUROCORES programme that brought materials synthesis and characterisation expertise, provide an important basis of understanding for the field of excitonic solar cells. This work has underpinned subsequent research on exciting solar cells Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
