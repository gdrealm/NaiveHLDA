By taking advantage of spiral feedback between modeling and experiment, we expect to identify key steric and electrostatic interactions, the control of which will facilitate rational design of improved host-guest combinations. The knowledge thus created will shed light upon a variety of different questions of current interest, from how proteins bind substrates within their hollows, to how new catalytic transformations might be carried out within purposefully-designed hosts.\n Theoretical models based on both quantum and molecular mechanics will be employed. Quantum mechanical models will be chosen by validation against available experimental structural data, and then employed in part to provide further benchmark data for the selection of classical mechanical force fields. Quantum mechanical models will also be used to compute spectral data (e.g., NMR and UV/Vis) in order to compare to experimental host-guest combinations where crystal structures are not available. Classical mechanical force field modeling will be used to simulate the dynamical behavior of host-guest combinations and for the prediction of potentials of mean force associated with aqueous binding events. With sufficient validating data in hand, in silico design efforts will next be undertaken with the goal of focusing synthetic efforts on host-guest combinations showing enhanced selectivity and binding efficiencies.\n International collaboration is critical to achieving the goals of this proposal, as expertise in synthesis and spectroscopic characterization is concentrated in the Cambridge group while expertise in static and dynamic modeling is concentrated in the Minnesota group. Exchange of graduate student and postdoctoral personnel between laboratories will ensure that junior personnel receive training in complementary experimental and theoretical techniques, and will also afford them opportunities to experience international aspects of the scientific enterprise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J001163/1","grantId":"EP/J001163/1","fundValue":"473871","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  My group's research has explored the preparation of complex, functional structures using chemical self-assembly. A signature feature of our approach is the simultaneous use of different kinds of chemical-bond-forming reactions that operate under thermodynamic control to bring about a substantial increase in structural complexity during a single overall process. I have coined the term 'subcomponent self-assembly' to describe this technique; other research groups worldwide have fruitfully adopted this method and terminology, citing my group's work at the source.\n\nBuilding upon the self-assembly rules that we deciphered, we were able to design a capsule that is capable of binding white phosphorus (P4) within its central hollow (Science 2009, 324, 1697). White phosphorus, which has been known for centuries to catch fire upon contact with atmospheric oxygen, was thus rendered indefinitely air-stable through encapsulation. Our dramatic pacification of this ancient demon attracted substantial media interest, and is discussed in an undergraduate chemistry textbook (Chemistry: The Molecular Science, 4th ed, C. L. Stanitski, P.C. Jurs, M. Sanger, Brooks/Cole, Stamford CT USA, 2011; p. 1024). \n\nWhen collections of subcomponent building blocks come together to form multiple products, reaction patterns can become quite complex. Such mixtures are best considered as molecular networks or systems, in which the introduction of a new subcomponent may have consequences involving many molecules. Understanding signal transduction within such abiological systems may help to illuminate the behaviour of more complex biochemical networks. The originality and impact of our contributions in this area have been recognised by an invitation to write a Q&amp;amp;amp;A piece (Nature 2009, 460, 15) on systems chemistry, an emerging field which I am helping to define.\n\nA new line of research for my group has involved the preparation of metal-containing conjugated polymers through the use of our techniques (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 3158). These polymers have been built into electroluminescent devices with the group of Richard Friend in Physics (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 135, 19170), and sensors able to determine the handedness of molecules in solution in collaboration with Milko van der Boom's group at the Weizmann Institute (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, in press: dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja4077205). This work is demonstrating the utility of our techniques to solve real-world problems, with the creation of economic value as our next goal.\n\nA key future direction to my group's effort will be the design and exploration of chemical systems that are capable of evolution towards the achievement of a targeted function, such as electrical conductivity for a polymer or the fit of a capsule to a guest molecule.
