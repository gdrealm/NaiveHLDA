According to the 2011 Census, individuals from BME groups comprised 14 per cent of the total population in England and Wales, with the Indian, Pakistani and Black Caribbeans being the largest groups. These estimates also reflect the younger age structure of the minority ethnic population, with about one-quarter of the UKâ€™s total population aged 25-44 coming from BME groups , partly as a result of net international migration particularly from Eastern Europe but also from Old Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada.<br /><br />This project analyses data from Understanding Society and the Labour Force Survey, in order to understand the pension prospects of individuals who are currently of working age, and individuals above the State Pension Age.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to examine differences between the BME population and the White majority; between different minority ethnic groups; between different cohorts of BME groups; and between men and women, in order to inform the future design of policies in the area of pension protection for BME groups.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003518/1","grantId":"ES/K003518/1","fundValue":"155059","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Athina  Vlachantoni","coPersons":["Jane Cecelia Falkingham"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
