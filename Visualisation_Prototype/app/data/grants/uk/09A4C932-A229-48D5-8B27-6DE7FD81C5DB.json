The formation and breakdown of these communities is tightly controlled by the bacteria itself. Bacteria growing in biofilms can cause a multitude of problems in healthcare and industry. The slime encapsulated bacteria are very difficult to remove and when growing in a biofilm they are usually highly resistant to standard antimicrobials. It is therefore very difficult to cure bacterial biofilm infections. A novel approach to fight biofilms is to use signalling molecules that tell the bacteria to disperse from their biofilm. The subsequent free swimming bacteria can more easily be targeted by classic antibiotics or other antimicrobials. Specifically, this project aims to identify compounds produced by a marine isolate of Bacillus licheniformis. This bacterium produces biofilm dispersal compounds (BDC's) that induce dispersal of itself and other species from their biofilm. Identifying the BDC's will allow us to further develop their commercial potential. Furthermore we will determine the applicability of the compound against a wide range of different bacteria.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G011206/1","grantId":"NE/G011206/1","fundValue":"9592","fundStart":"2008-11-05","fundEnd":"2009-11-04","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Grant  Burgess","coPersons":["Michael John Hall","Reindert  Nijland"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
