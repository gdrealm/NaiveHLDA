The academic partner's role in this project is aligned to enabling the design freedoms and IP frameworks\nof AM to create successful business transformation. The purpose of research within this project is to improve the\napplicability and acceptance of a new service, where the aim is to create a commercially viable output that is significantly\nmore efficient than competitors. In order to achieve this, structured research based on a Design Research Methodology\n(DRM) framework (Blessing and Chakrabarti, 2009) would first seek to define research goals, establish the criteria of\nsuccess and identify influences and how they interact.\nThis first research phase is linked to project work package 1. This is fundamentally about understanding end user (the\nmedical specialists who would use the new service) requirements in terms of implant design intention and software\ninterface requirements. The research team would work with the Maxillofacial Unit at Morriston Hospital and other end\nusers to employ the principles of a User-Centred Design (UCD) approach. UCD is multidisciplinary approach that requires\nexperts from various disciplines to examine, analyse, interpret and synthesise user needs and behaviours and translate\nthese to end products, often in an iterative process. It is value-adding both in terms of improved design output (leading to\ngreater commercial success) and in considering the overall experience of product/service interaction for the user. Crucial to this approach is the involvement of product/service users, in this case medical professionals, in the very early stages of\ninsight generation, through to the development and evaluation of concepts. This is contrary to more commonly used\napproaches that first establish concepts and prototypes before engaging with the end users. The approach significantly\nreduces the risk of developing services that do not meet the market needs.\nA combination of observational techniques and structured reviews would be used during work package 1 to capture user\nrequirement at the points of potential application. Stakeholder interaction mapping would be used to define and quantify\nhow new services developed as part of this project would impact implant production. The data generated would be used to\ndefine an optimum workflow, measures of project impact and a product specification, against which new approaches can\nbe developed. This information would be used to develop a testable software-based platform based on low-fidelity, 'throw\naway' prototyping for evaluation by end users. Low-fidelity prototypes are not constrained by current technical knowledge\nand by nature contain no coding that could be used in the final solution; they are, however, an important mechanism that\nwill be used to assess the user requirements that may make the product successful in the market, without committing the\nsignificant resources required to build a final system. User feedback will be used to filter more viable options into highfidelity,\nevolutionary prototypes, with increased function. These prototypes would be evaluated in theoretical clinical case\nstudies that can be evaluated against the specification developed in work package 2.\nUser-insight generated research developed during work packages 1-3 would then be used to inform the software\nengineering team for final, functional product development.\nBenchmark data and the concluded impact measures defined during work package 1 will be used to evaluate the\ndemonstrator platform created in work package 7. This would determine the effectiveness of the project and research\noutcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505249/1","grantId":"EP/L505249/1","fundValue":"213266","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project started in Feb 2014.
