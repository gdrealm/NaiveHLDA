These concerns relate to the erosion of the professional value base, the growth of deprofessionalisation, the undermining of the worker/client relationship, the excessive dominance of IT systems, the reduction of a rich interventive repertoire to a reliance of a very narrow range of methods, and the shrinking of worker autonomy and discretion.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series would explore these issues and concerns through a comparison of the experience of professional social work in Britain and Japan, and specifically would seek to address the following questions:<br /><br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>In what ways and to what extent have the dominant managerial policies of the past two decades transformed professional social work practice in Britain and Japan?</li>\n\n <li>How has the profession responded to these changes, and what possibilities exist for the emergence of new and different forms of social work practice rooted in concepts of social justice?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H031782/1","grantId":"ES/H031782/1","fundValue":"11648","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  Ferguson","coPersons":["Mark  Baldwin","Rona  Woodward","Michael  Lavalette"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
