{"id":"5C2F4BF6-6C74-43B6-8CA7-E9A9BEE168BC","title":"Determining the stability and conidial yield of the entomogenous fungus Metarhizium anisopliae","abstractText":"Three strains of the insect-pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae have been identified through an earlier NERC funded project that are highly pathogenic to ticks, which are important pests of livestock and vectors of zoonotic diseases. Subsequent studies showed that these strains are also efficacious against insect pests. Two independent consultants have established that markets exist for Metarhizium-based products but these must be produced economically and without a decline in quality in order to compete with conventional chemical pesticides. Two key factors that greatly influence the product cost are the stability of the strains and conidial yield. Fungi can readily degenerate (lose virulence and exhibit phenotypic instability) when continuously maintained on nutrient rich media. The focus of this project is to determine the stability and conidial yield of the Metarhizium strains and establish which are worth commercialising.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E522308/1","grantId":"NE/E522308/1","fundValue":"80902","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Tariq Mahmud Butt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
