These calcium channels are present in all brain cells, and are essential for communication between them. In several animal models of chronic pain, the levels of alpha2delta subunits are found to increase in the damaged nerve cells.\nIn this study we now hope to understand, at the molecular level, how these alpha2delta subunits work, and how the binding of gabapentin to these proteins interferes with their function. To do this we will mainly use cells in tissue culture, but also where necessary, rodent models of disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700368","grantId":"G0700368","fundValue":"1029790","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Catherine Dolphin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
