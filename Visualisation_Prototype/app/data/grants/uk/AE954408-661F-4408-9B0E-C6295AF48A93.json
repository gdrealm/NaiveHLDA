For a distrubted generation scenario with power output in the range of kW to MW the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a leading contender, with development undertaken by many international companies. One of the areas of concern with new technologies is the lifetime of the device and as SOFCs operate at elevated temperatures any degradation of components may be accelerated. Due to the complexity of these devices there has been limited scope to analyse the operation of the SOFC in-situ, and from this determine mechanistic information on degradation processes. It is the aim of this proposal to tackle this challenge.Degradation and reactivity of solid oxide fuel cells may be characterised by processes occuring on a variety of length scales, from chemical reactivity and diffusion processes on the atomic scale through surface chemsitry, stress in functional layers and thermal management over mm and cm. Each of the processes contributes to the overall cell degradation, but may evolve differently depending on the functional component concerned - hence anode and cathode processes will be significantly different. As these are complex devices characterising these processes and the origin of them is challenging and currently results from post-mortem analysis. Whilst this is one route to understanding the failure of devices, an in-situ characterisation under operating conditions will provide detailed direct understanding. Our approach is to develop a combination of complimentary techniques that will allow detailed study of device operation using diffraction, spectroscopy, ion scattering, modelling and emissivity measurements. We will tackle known degradation issues in fuel cells including carbonate and Cr poisoning of cathodes, carbon formation on anodes and electrode delamination and will interact strongly with the UK Supergen Fuel Cells programme. As a result of this programme we will be able to inform industrial partners of mitigation strategies to minimise device degradation and use this information in development of new materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J001007/1","grantId":"EP/J001007/1","fundValue":"159059","fundStart":"2012-05-31","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings of the operation of solid oxide fuel cell materials under thermal gradients are being communicated to out industrial collaborator, Ceres Power, and we have recently applied for a Supergen H2FC Early Career Researcher award with Ceres to apply thermal imaging alongside X-ray computed tomography to help understand how electrodes function in devices.

This includes the ability to examine the temperature distribution in electrode materials and relate this to strain within the structure. We have also developed an in-situ SOFC cell capable of viewing, with an infrared thermal camera, the temperature distribution within an operational system. We will use these results to inform model development in the next phase of work. Our thermal imaging technique will provide unparalleled insight into the internal workings of SOFCs and allow advanced models describing electro-thermal operation to be developed and validated, so leading to the development of commercial SOFC technology.
