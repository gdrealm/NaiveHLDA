{"id":"3544FB29-ACEC-473D-9498-F64BE65D9214","title":"Workshops: UK Mathematics in Medicine Study Groups (2009-2012)","abstractText":"Mathematics has an important role to play in the understanding of biomedical problems. This role has resulted in the recent explosive growth in fields such as Mathematical and Systems Biology. This proposal is focused on continuing an existing programme of week-long MMSGs and shorter follow-up meetings designed to foster and stimulate new collaborations between the mathematical and biomedical sciences. The MMSGs allow mathematicians, statisticians, biomedical scientists and clinicians to come together under `one-roof' for a period of five days, and to participate in the application of mathematical modelling techniques to problems presented by the biomedical scientists. The workshops are focused, collaborative meetings where the mathematicians work side-by-side with the biomedical scientists to tackle their problem. The new ideas that are generated can help to direct future experimental work and developing new informative mathematical models and techniques. Shorter one day follow-up meetings (three per workshop) allow collaborations developed at the workshops to develop further. MMSGs have a nine year track record of facilitating exciting interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians which have led to journal publications and future research being funded through MSc and PhD studentships, fellowships and larger grant applications. The programme provides an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary research and an excellent training environment for students and early stage career researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00078X/1","grantId":"EP/H00078X/1","fundValue":"34328","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel John MottramSteven D Webb","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
