{"id":"B15D9026-B817-4AA3-8737-AB5BEC7CB5D1","title":"Molecular and Functional Characterisation of Sea Urchin ADP-ribosyl Cyclases","abstractText":"All cells of the body are physically separated from their surrounding environment by a membrane. In order for cells to respond to factors in the blood (such as hormones) which normally can not pass through the membrane, special 'messenger' molecules are used that are generated inside the cell upon contact of the stimulus with the cell. Two of these messengers called cADPR and NAADP are produced by a single family of enzymes / the ADP-ribosyl cyclases. Once made, cADPR and NAADP cause large increases in the concentration of calcium within the cell which in turn are important for many processes including for example the nerve function. Understanding how these enzymes work then is important to understand how cells work. In this study we will determine the DNA sequences of the genes for ADP-ribosyl cyclases in the sea urchin a well-studied experimental system. Having this information will allow us to produce large quantities of each protein to study their properties and determine their location within eggs. We will then study how these enzymes change when eggs are activated by sperm and determine what impact blocking these enzymes has on how the embryo develops. This study should provide new information on these critically important proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018110/1","grantId":"BB/D018110/1","fundValue":"371662","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2009-04-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandip  Patel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
