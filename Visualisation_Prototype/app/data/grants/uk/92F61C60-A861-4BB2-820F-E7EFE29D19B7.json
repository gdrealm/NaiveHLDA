{"id":"92F61C60-A861-4BB2-820F-E7EFE29D19B7","title":"Adaptation of the Good School Toolkit for reducing violence in secondary schools","abstractText":"Violence against children and adolescents is highly prevalent and associated with numerous negative health and social consequences. An intervention we have been testing in Uganda, called the Good School Toolkit, is effective in reducing physical violence from school staff to Ugandan primary school students. The Toolkit, by Ugandan NGO Raising Voices, is a complex intervention that takes a whole-school approach to support students, staff, administration and community members. The intervention consists of a series of steps designed to: change school culture to encourage mutual respect; facilitate student participation and leadership; foster critical reflection on power relations and violence; and provide staff with alternatives to corporal punishment and improved teaching techniques.\n\nWe want to adapt the Toolkit to see if it can reduce violence against secondary school students. To do this, we will examine patterns of violence in secondary schools to see how they differ from patterns observed in primary schools. In conjunction with key partners, we will decide how best to adapt the Toolkit, and new materials will be added. For example, we may need to add more content on sexual violence, which may be more common in secondary school students versus primary school students. We will test our new adapted intervention to see if it is acceptable to secondary school students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026264/1","grantId":"MR/M026264/1","fundValue":"147420","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Devries","coPersons":["Nambusi  Kyegombe"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
