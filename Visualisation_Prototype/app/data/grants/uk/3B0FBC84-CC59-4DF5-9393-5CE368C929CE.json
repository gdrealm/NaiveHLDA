{"id":"3B0FBC84-CC59-4DF5-9393-5CE368C929CE","title":"Renewable Building Blocks from Wheat and Maize Straws (ReBuBloS)","abstractText":"This project seeks to further develop a novel straw biorefinery process that will target the development of a range of\nproducts for applications such as platform chemicals for plastic manufacturing and high quality cellulosic fibres for value\nadded applications. This technology will bring triple line manufacturing benefits to the Chinese economy through reductions\nin energy and the production of new conversion technologies. Straw is an underutilised co-product in China and the UK\nwith a great potential as a feedstock. However, using this feedstock is problematic and new technological approaches are\nneeded. The straw bio-refinery concept was first developed in Bangor in 1995 and the principle scientist is now based in\nBeijing. This project will introduce new technologies such as novel enzymes and will use a novel fractionation process that\nis based in Bangor. The project will enable Beijing and Bangor to work together and enhance and demonstrate the benefits\nat a scale previously not achievable. Funding will enable the application of the technology to the manufacturing capacity of\nChina which will result significant economic and environmental benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507805/1","grantId":"EP/M507805/1","fundValue":"211142","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Morus  Elias","coPersons":["Qiuyun  Liu","Radek Messias Braganca"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
