Acute lung injury ALI is a major cause of lung failure in critically ill patients. Most patients affected are of working age and survivors experience a significant reduction in health-related quality of life, with 46% unable to return to work within 12 months. Currently, apart from invasive protective ventilation, no therapy has been conclusively proven to reduce mortality or improve functional outcome in survivors. This represents a major unmet health need. \nBy undertaking this research we will establish if simple and cheap replacement of vitamin D influences the development and severity of acute lung injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100196","grantId":"G1100196","fundValue":"490752","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Richard Thickett","coPersons":["Gavin D Perkins","Fang  Gao Smith"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
