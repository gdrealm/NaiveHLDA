Clinical trials have demonstrated that drugs, which inhibit blood vessel formation, can improve the outcome of patients with several different types of cancer. \n\nWe have developed a new drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer that works by blocking blood vessel formation inside the tumour. The drug blocks three of the critical growth factors (like hormones) that drive blood vessel formation in ovarian cancer. The drug emerged from a novel chemistry research programme that allows us to make custom-designed oligosaccharides (complex sugar molecules) that block growth factors from generating new blood vessels in a cancer. \n\nIn the laboratory the oligosaccharides block blood vessel formation in several different types of experiments. In this research project we will continue our research on these new molecules by testing several different oligosaccharides in experiments that will test the safety and effectiveness of the drugs. At the end of this grant we will have identified the lead molecule and will be ready to move the drug towards clinical trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902173","grantId":"G0902173","fundValue":"820890","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"  This project has been extremely productive and the findings are very innovative. We have been able to elucidate the chemistry to generate multi-gram amounts of site specifically sulphated heparan sulphate oligosaccharides. This has allowed us to demonstrate the first evidence for structural specificity with respect to chemokine inhibition; the first evidence for such a relationship for decades. This opens a new area of medical research and multiple opportunities for further research.
