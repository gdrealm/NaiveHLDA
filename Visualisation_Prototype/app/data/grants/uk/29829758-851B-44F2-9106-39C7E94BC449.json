As long-term conditions have become increasingly multi-medicated, many medications need to be taken at specific times in specific combinations to be effective. Research shows that 50% of patients do not follow this advice and, specifically, that one in three patients over 65 will have some sort of adverse medical event as a result - whether relapse, recurrence of symptoms or even, in the worst cases, death. Bad handling of medication therefore puts the patient at risk and puts a strain upon medical resources such as a doctor's time, hospital beds etc. De Montford University found that the current 'dosette' box had limitations and identified a need for a new and effective tablet storage container (TSC), to store pills safely and logically.\\n\\nDe Montfort University recognised that with the 'dosette' box medications had to be set up weekly, tablets had to be removed from their original packaging and so became confused amongst others, and medication became difficult for doctors to change. Ms Julie Lowe, a recent graduate in Design Management, and her research team overcame these problems with their new container that, among other things, offered clear instructions and retained tablets' original packaging.\\n\\nThis knowledge catalyst project has brought together De Montfort University's brand knowledge and design expertise with South Wigston Health Centre to further the development and marketing of a new Tablet Storage Container. The new prototype has been developed to help patients manage their medication more effectively and so experience less relapses or recurrence of their illness, and thus to reduce the strain on medical resources. The project has also led to the design of a travel model and talks with the World Health Organisation to launch the design globally.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G500037/1","grantId":"AH/G500037/1","fundValue":"7611","fundStart":"2008-07-16","fundEnd":"2008-11-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tina  Barnes PowellEun Kyong Baek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
