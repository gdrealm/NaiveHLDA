{"id":"9FE1D384-413F-4964-ACDA-FA804241C3C1","title":"Development of a porcine model for investigation of Campylobacter jejuni diarrhoeal disease","abstractText":"Campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhoea in humans, acquired from food, particularly poultry, other meat products, untreated water and unpasteurized milk. How this organism causes the symptoms of diarrhoea in man is currently not well understood. The purpose of this project is to develop a disease model in piglets who also get acute diarrhoeal disease when they acquire this organism. Two different models of piglet diarrhoea will be used - the gnotobiotic or germ free piglet and a colostrum deprived model. These pigs get watery or inflammatory diarrhoea respectively, similar to the clinical conditions described in human disease. We will use these disease models to determine if we can devise a strategy for screening pools of tagged mutants. This will enable us to better understand how these organisms cause diarrhoeal disease in both man and pigs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F020988/1","grantId":"BB/F020988/1","fundValue":"545061","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Howard Everest","coPersons":["David George Smith"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
