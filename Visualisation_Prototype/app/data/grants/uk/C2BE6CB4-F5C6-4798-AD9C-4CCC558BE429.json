Houses in flat areas are particularly at risk: meeting the shortage of houses in the south-east requires building on these areas. To estimate the flood hazard risk in order to try to protect these buildings, accurate rainfall predictions are needed. However, the connection between rainfall and flooding is complicated, so that rainfall predictions must also say how likely rainfall is at any time - calculating the probability of rainfall. Extreme rainfalls caused devastating floods in Boscastle in 2004 and Lynmouth in 1952, but the causes and pattern of rainfall was different. Therefore, scientists also need to know what pattern of rainfall caused the flooding. This research aims to get good quality predictions of the probability of rainfall by combining advanced methods from statistics, the output from a new supercomputer model of the weather, and a new computer archive of exteme rainfalls going back to 1860, provided by a specialist company Hydro-GIS Ltd. It also aims to produce an automatic system for discovering the most likely pattern in the predicted rainfalls. The new prediction system and data will be freely available over the internet for use by the government and universities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E002013/1","grantId":"NE/E002013/1","fundValue":"192175","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick Eugene McSharry","coPersons":["James William Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
