Innate immunity provides a first line of defence during the critical period just after a host has been exposed to a microbe and functions, firstly, to slow the progress of the infection while the adaptive response ?gets going?, and secondly, to help the expansion of the adaptive immunity. Innate immune cells recognise infection and cancer using receptors that distinguish alterations on the typical structures present on healthy cells, and can detect molecules from microbes, and foreign or aberrant molecules generated as a consequence of a particular disease. From this ?immunological? point of view, cancer cells can be viewed as altered self-cells that have escaped normal growth-regulating mechanisms. As a consequence of their transformation, tumour cells express altered cellular proteins (tumour antigens), some of which could be recognised by receptors of either the adaptive or the innate immune system. This is the case of MIC and ULBP molecules, two families of proteins expressed on the cell surface of a few cell types, such as gut epithelium, that are induced in stressed cells, for example as a consequence of a viral infection or a tumoral transformation. These proteins are an example of link between the adaptive and the innate immune response, as they engage with an activating receptor, called NKG2D, present in cells from both arms of the immune system. The recognition of MIC or ULBP on the surface of a cell is understood as a marker for ?unhealthy? or ?stressed? cell by NKG2D and leads to its killing. However, some MIC and ULBP molecules can be shed by tumours into the serum of patients where they seem to prevent activation of immune system cells. Further, some viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the expression of MIC and ULBP proteins at the surface of the infected cell, avoiding the killing of the cell and thus allowing the dissemination of the virus.\nThe mechanisms underlying surface expression and shedding of NKG2D-binding proteins are not completely understood. Study of these processes could thus help to understand evasion of the immune system by certain viruses and tumours and to design new strategies to fight against the disease from its origin.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601165","grantId":"G0601165","fundValue":"362381","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mar  Vales-Gomes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
