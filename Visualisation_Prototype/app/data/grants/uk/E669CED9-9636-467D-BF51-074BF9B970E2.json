They approximate real world populations in a much more sophisticated way than the classical ordinary differential equation models of population dynamics. Our main goal in the present project is to understand the long time behaviour of solutions of a very general size-structured model where competition between individuals is based upon a hierarchy in the population related to individuals size.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F025599/1","grantId":"EP/F025599/1","fundValue":"11886","fundStart":"2008-01-02","fundEnd":"2008-09-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jozsef Zoltan Farkas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
