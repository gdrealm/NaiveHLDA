To this end, it looks at discourse practices in the Black Country region. </p>\n\n<p>The project looks at the relationship between traditional dialect forms which are typical of the Black Country, and the ways in which performers in the region use these forms. It examines the possibility that language can be used to construct a certain identity, doing so by reference to the notion of indexicality; this being the idea that language features can mean different things to different people in the community. </p>\n\n<p>The project will record two live performances and transcribe these. Interviews with members of the audience at these performances will then be conducted.&nbsp; Analysing this data in the light of what is already known about the social values of linguistic features to the wider community will provide an inroad into looking at the values which these features have for performance artists, and the way in which they use these features in their shows.</p>\n\n<p>The project will also mark the start of the creation of a web resource titled 'Midlands English: Speech and Society'.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H009159/1","grantId":"ES/H009159/1","fundValue":"79896","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Urszula Irena Clark","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
