Caste-type systems also exist in Japan and parts of Africa. However partly because of its size the most widespread and also the most extreme manifestation of the phenomenon occurs in India where 160 million 'Scheduled Castes' (formerly 'untouchables') are along with 67 million tribals, or Adivasis, among the poorest and most marginalised in the country. Caste discrimination and the practice of untouchability are outlawed under the Indian Constitution, discriminatory, violent and oppressive behaviour and practices are illegal, and the Constitution provides for affirmative action policies for Scheduled Castes, or Dalits, but despite such legal measures and the creation of various statutory human rights bodies, widespread prejudice and discrimination against Dalits and violations of their civil, political, social and economic rights remain a major problem. \\n\\nHistorically, caste discrimination was largely overlooked by international human rights law. It did not fit easily into the existing international human rights framework, while in countries such as India it was hoped that domestic measures would eradicate the problem, or at least minimise its worst effects. The international community lacked an understanding of caste discrimination, and domestic activists and NGOS often faced hostility in raising the issue. \\n\\nSeveral factors have served to bring to global attention the continuing realities of caste discrimination for millions in South Asia and elsewhere, generating pressure for more vigorous legal intervention nationally and internationally. Since the late 1990s the UN human rights regime, prompted by activists and NGOS, has begun explicitly to address caste discrimination. In India the economic liberalisation process initiated by the 1991 reforms, coupled with the globalisation process worldwide, has resulted in increased economic and cultural interaction with Northern states but an increased urban-rural divide. The 2001 UN World Conference on Racial Discrimination gave NGOs and activists an organising focus for the issue. Awareness of caste discrimination within the South Asian diaspora is also increasing. In this internationalised context, the nature and adequacy of current legal mechanisms and strategies (international and domestic) for tackling caste discrimination require urgent examination and reappraisal.\\n\\nThis research will improve our understanding of caste-based discrimination as a human rights violation and the capacity of existing human rights frameworks to address it; provide enhanced insights into contemporary debates on the nature of caste discrimination and legal approaches to it; enhance our understanding of the legal, political, economic and cultural pressures on the phenomenon and the use of legal means to tackle it. To do this, this research will examine the conceptualisation of caste discrimination; evaluate current national and international legal strategies; explore the potential for improved application of existing legal mechanisms and the potential for and possible obstacles to the development of new legal approaches to the problem. \\nThis research will (i) advance academic understanding of caste discrimination as a human rights violation and the capacity of existing legal cultures and frameworks to challenge it (ii) be of value to lawyers, NGOs and activists by illuminating existing and potential legal strategies and approaches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E001440/1","grantId":"AH/E001440/1","fundValue":"26609","fundStart":"2007-01-05","fundEnd":"2007-05-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Annapurna Deborah Waughray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
