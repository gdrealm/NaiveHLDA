Its rich spectrum may be analyzed to yield fundamental data on the region which emits the methanol lines, such as the gas density and temperature and the relative abundance of the two forms (ortho and para) of molecular hydrogen. This analysis requires the rates of excitation of methanol by the most abundant interstellar species, helium and molecular hydrogen, to be determined. The present research project is concerned with obtaining these basic data, by the use of quantum mechanics. Large-scale numerical calculations will be undertaken, and the data will be used to interpret radio-astronomical observations of methanol in the interstellar medium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E00086X/1","grantId":"PP/E00086X/1","fundValue":"256772","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Flower","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
