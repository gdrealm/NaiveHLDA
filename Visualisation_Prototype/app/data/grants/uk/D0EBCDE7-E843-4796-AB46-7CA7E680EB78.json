Each gene in a genome is used to direct the synthesis of a specific protein. It is the proteins that are the functional agents in a cell, for example acting as catalysts to speed individual chemical reactions within the cell. Information in the gene, coded as different sequences of the bases A, T, C and G, is used to make a protein in a two-stage process. First, the gene information is copied into a similar chain of bases in the form of a messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA, a long chain-like molecule, is then used as an information store to direct the assembly of a protein, consisting of a chain of amino acids, in a process called translation. The precise sequence of amino acids (directed by the mRNA base sequence) determines the eventual function of the protein. The amino acid sequence is defined by the mRNA sequence, which in turn is defined by the gene sequence, thus linking gene to protein. The process of translation forms the focus of this research proposal. During translation, small particles called ribosomes (themselves made of RNA and protein) travel along the mRNA, sequentially adding amino acids to make the final protein. This production line process is stopped (terminated) in response to a specific sequence of bases in the mRNA, causing the release of the completed protein. Termination is crucial for ensuring the protein made is of the correct length. It is now known that following termination, ribosomes are directed back to the beginning of the mRNA, effectively recycling them on the mRNA chain. This makes the translation process more efficient, but generates very complex ribosome traffic flow on the mRNA production line. For this reason, mathematical modelling of ribosome flow will be used in this research alongside the biochemical experimentation to help unravel the mechanisms by which translation is controlled. This proposal seeks to study translation termination for two important reasons. First, in many human genetic diseases, the affected gene (e.g cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) is mutated because it contains an additional stop codon early in the gene sequence. This has the effect of prematurely terminating translation, resulting in a shortened, non-functional protein. There is increasing interest in developing drugs that would make translation termination less accurate. This would allow the ribosome to bypass the early stop codon and reach the natural stop codon to make correct length protein. Research into the molecular mechanisms of termination, as this proposal describes, can provide crucial insight used directly in the development of drugs to treat some forms of human genetic disease. Termination is also important because associated with this process is the recycling of the ribosomes on the mRNA. After termination at the end of the message, ribosomes are actively returned to the beginning of the mRNA to make a new protein from the same template, forming a type of circular ribosomal race track; each circuit of the track results in a new protein being made. The recycling process is very poorly understood, and yet it is key to protein synthetic efficiency. By understanding how recycling works, it may be possible to boost the efficiency of protein synthesis in cells, which is crucial for the manufacture of drugs like hepatitis B vaccine and insulin, to name but two. In summary then, the process of translation termination is crucially important in the expression of genes in every cell, and thus has fundamental 'pure' research interest. It is however also a key to understand how proteins can be made efficiently in biotechnological processes important in drug manufacture, and is also an attractive target for drugs that can treat a range of extremely debilitating human genetic diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020454/1","grantId":"BB/I020454/1","fundValue":"283382","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work on this grant is under progress.\nWe expect the work from this grant can be used to understand the effects of mRNA stability and destabilization, ribosomal recycling on mRNA translation and protein synthesis.\n\nSince protein synthesis is a very basic process very broadly relevant in cell biology, biomedicine and biotechnology, this can be fruitfully put to use in all these aras Other Cultural","person":"J  Krishnan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We have been developing approaches to understand the basic process of translation: a basic cellular process responsible for the synthesis of most proteins. In particular the goal is to understand the processes by which the basic template for protein production becomes unstable, and how other factors can interact with translation.\n\nOur work so far has led to a better understand of the subtle interplay between these various processes. As a byproduct of this work, we have also performed a comprehensive comparison of modelling approaches for translation and developed a new computational/modelling tool using so-called Probabilistic Boolean Networks, to aid in the dissection of translation The findings obtained here will aid in the understanding of this basic process which is responsible for the synthesis of most proteins. It provides new knowledge into how the mRNA may be destabilized and how different factors may interact with translation. Finally, we have developed a new tool which can be used to effectively dissect and understand this basic process, and this approach could find widespread use.\n\n\nThis knowledge and the newly developed tools can be used in the context of the huge number of translation processes which are responsible for the synthesis of most proteins. It is thus of relevance in basic biology and a number of application domains including biotechnology, biomedicine and agriculture. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
