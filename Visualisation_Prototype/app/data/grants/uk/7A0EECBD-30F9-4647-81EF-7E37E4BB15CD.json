The\nkey proposition is to use an ultra thin-film membrane (graphene) as the vibrating mechanical\ncomponent in a resonant gate transistor (RGT). Such a sensor will provide direct transduction of\nacoustical vibrations in air, via vibrations of the membrane, to an electrical signal within the\nunderlying transistor. Main advantages of such an approach include adaptive gain control,\nselective frequency tuneability, improved signal to noise performance over conventional\ntransducers and multi-channel scalability.\n\nThe proposed system, made using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication\nprocesses, also lends itself particularly well to direct incorporation within a wider integrated circuit\ndesign that will provide both signal processing and real-time tuning and gain control capabilities. \nEventually, a fully integrated parallel system is proposed that will see an array of transducers, each\nacoustically/mechanically/electrically tuned to a narrow portion of the auditory bandwidth and\ncapable of real-time gain and frequency response control. \n\nSuch a system will provide cochlea-inspired gain control and, where desired, \nfrequency selectivity at the point of transduction, leading to improved signal to noise \nperformance and opening up a range of novel signal processing possibilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M026914/1","grantId":"EP/M026914/1","fundValue":"477577","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Cheung","coPersons":["Enrico  Mastropaolo","Michael James Newton"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
