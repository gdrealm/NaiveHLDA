{"id":"D9473EC3-4794-4801-8B68-6DC1CFBC87DA","title":"Exploring the anaerobic adaptations of the mitochondrion-related organelles of Blastocystis","abstractText":"Blastocystis is a parasitic organism commonly found in samples taken from people and other animals suffering from stomach illnesses. It is a microscopic organism, which can only survive in an environment completely devoid of oxygen. This alone, highlights Blastocystis as unusual, because none of the organisms it is closely genetically related to are negatively affected by an oxygenated environment. \nThe peculiarity of Blastocystis has been shown in several research reports where unusual structures within Blastocystis have been observed, which have been reported as &quot;mitochondrion-related organelles&quot; (MROs). MROs are similar in shape, but have been predicted to be in different protein composition than typical mitochondria. There are several types of irregular mitochondria among parasitic organisms, the most commonly known are hydrogenosomes (producing molecular hydrogen) and mitosomes (with unknown functions). The MROs in Blastocystis fits neither category completely, but instead displays features of both, as well as normal mitochondria.\nThe proposed research will endeavour to unravel the mystery surrounding this bizarre organism and its equally strange internal structures. Using modern biochemical and proteomic techniques, we will seek to identify proteins within Blastocystis that function into its peculiar mitochondria. The framework of this investigation is based on previous experiments, which, although successful in predicting many proteins and metabolic pathways, produced mainly hypothetical and inconclusive results. By scaling up the experiments, growing Blastocystis under different atmospheric conditions and the use of alternative complementation systems, we will determine the functions of such hypothetical proteins. \nMoreover, environmental conditions that will be investigated include observations of protein concentrations alternations and functions in relation to changes in the oxygen content of the organism's environment. As a parasite, this organism is routinely exposed to oxygen when transferred between hosts, so we will investigate how Blastocystis survives during this transition. Similarly we will investigate the effects of iron concentration in the environment in order to investigate how Blastocystis retrieves the iron it requires for forming different complexes important to the function of many of its proteins.\nTo add to the mystery that is Blastocystis, it has also been shown that out of the four methods that most organisms use to produce the energy molecule ATP, Blastocystis contains all four within its genome. In most cases an organism will only have one. To discover why and how Blastocystis has so many different methods of generating energy we will characterise all these pathways using a combination of cell biological and biochemical techniques. \nUnderstanding the unique bridging nature of the Blastocystis MROs between canonical mitochondria, hydrogenosomes and mitosomes will allow Blastocystis to be established as a model organism for the further investigation of mitochondria found in other organisms. In addition, the fundamental research and knowledge that this project will produce, will benefit both research in biotechnology, where this knowledge can be used for the production of biomaterials (for example anaerobic production of Vitamins) or in biomedicine for drug-development of anti-parasitic compounds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M009971/1","grantId":"BB/M009971/1","fundValue":"383723","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anastasios  Tsaousis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
