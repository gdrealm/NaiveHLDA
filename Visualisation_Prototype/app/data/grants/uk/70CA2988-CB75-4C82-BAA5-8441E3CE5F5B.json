A type of cell known as a B cell responds to infection by changing into an antibody-producing cell. Antibodies are proteins that work by attacking the foreign invader and destroying it, clearing infection by removing the foreign agent. Because antibodies are our body's natural defence against disease, many new antibody type drugs are being developed to help treat a number of human diseases such as cancer. These antibodies are usually produced by cells kept in a culturing solution under defined conditions. The problem is that these antibodies must be in a special shape; otherwise they do not work. The cells used to produce such antibodies have a very complex set of machinery to make the antibodies and put their components together into the right shape. This works very well when the cell is not expected to make much of the antibody in question. However, the cells we use to make antibodies are much less efficient at producing these drugs when we try and produce more of the product. As a result, we are not able to produce enough of these drugs and the cost and demand for them is therefore high e.g. the breast cancer drug Herceptin. The root of the problem is that when cells are asked to produce much more protein to meet our needs the machinery can no longer cope / the cells sometimes die or else don't produce antibodies of the right shape, of no clinical use whatsoever. It is largely agreed that this problem will become even serious as further antibody-based drugs are developed. The research proposed here will investigate how the cell machinery for making proteins works and examine whether, and in what ways, it can be manipulated to produce more antibody. We want to determine the different parts of this machinery that are limiting in terms of making the antibody, and then investigate how these parts work together to ultimately produce the antibody of interest. At present it is unknown if this is possible, and the process is poorly understood in the mammalian cells presently used to produce antibodies. We will employ a combination of new state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to take apart the antibody assembly line in mammalian cells in a step-wise manner, and then using the information gathered will determine the relationship between each step of the assembly process. Ultimately this should enable the manipulation of cells to change the balance of each step in the assembly line to produce more of the target antibody drug at reduced cost and higher quality. As stated above, this is extremely important as it is expected that with an increasing number of protein 'drugs' being developed we will lack the capability of producing large enough amounts to meet the required demand for these new drugs for the majority, as opposed to for those who can afford what must currently remain prohibitively expensive, but very effective, medicines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005969/1","grantId":"BB/E005969/1","fundValue":"987762","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings from these studies are being used by the biopharmaceutical industry and those industries that manufacture biopharmaceutical protein based drugs to enhance the predictability of expression of mammalian cell lines and hence develop more efficient cell lines for use commercially.

Development of mathematical models using experimental data that describe the gene expression pathway for luciferase and an industrially relevant IgG (monoclonal antibody such as those used for the treatment of disease in the clinic) from mammalian expression systems confirming limitations are cell line specific, however translational limitations for the IgG heavy chain results in non-productive light chain/light chain dimmers being secreted in some high producers. These models have identified targets for cell engineering or can be used for screening.\n\nii. Demonstrating a direct link between the translational machinery and specific chaperones that influence protein synthesis/cell growth and identification of targets for cell engineering/screening strategies. Further, that manipulation of untranslated regions (UTRs) influences recombinant protein synthesis towards the end of culture and may allow for enhanced yields.\n\niii. An orchestrated panel of chaperones controls folding of recombinant proteins and yeast chaperone over-expression in mammalian cells can aid recombinant protein expression and disaggregation. Screening for the appropriate balance of chaperones in host cells is preferable to manipulation. These findings could be utilised and implementation of our strategies developed through the knowledge generated during this programme of work to further improve biotherapeutic recombinant protein (protein based drugs for use in the clinic for the treatment of disease) expression from mammalian cell lines either through cell engineering strategies or the use of novel screening approaches to select either host or recombinant cell lines with enhanced bioprocessing properties (enhanced yields or biomass).
