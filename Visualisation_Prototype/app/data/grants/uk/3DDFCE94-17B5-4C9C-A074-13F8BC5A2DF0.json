{"id":"3DDFCE94-17B5-4C9C-A074-13F8BC5A2DF0","title":"THE LONDON COPD EXACERBATION COHORT (The EXCEL Cohort)","abstractText":"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may often experience episodes of acute worsening of symptoms called exacerbations or ?attacks?. These exacerbations are an important cause of physical and mental ill-health, poor quality of life and death. Exacerbations also impose a considerable cost on the NHS, the patient and their families through time off work, hospital admissions and additional treatments. Finding the cause of these episodes is difficult because they can be due to different types of bacteria and viruses, and their timing is unpredictable so that the patient must be seen as soon as possible after the start of the infection. There is still an urgent need for more studies of COPD exacerbations but researchers need access to patients in whom exacerbations are likely to occur.\n\nThe London COPD Exacerbation Cohort (EXCEL Cohort) is a small established cohort of COPD patients recruited and specifically trained and monitored to report their attacks (exacerbations) to the research team to enable the exacerbation to be studied (and also the patient to receive treatment as quickly as possible). Our skills in running this cohort and research that we have published has gained us an international reputation and we have received both charity and industry research grants over the last 10 years. We are now seeking funding to increase the size of our cohort from 150 to 300 patients, and to study our patients in even greater detail with investigations including x-ray scanning measures of thickness of the lung airways and emphysema, state-of-the-art detection of bacteria and viruses using modern molecular methods, airway and systemic inflammation and ultrasound imaging of the heart. This will provide important information that will allow new treatments and ideas to be tested more efficiently. Our cohort has previously been involved in many studies, both on our own and in collaboration with other researchers world-wide. This proposed enlargement of our cohort has received support from multi-national pharmaceutical companies and the NHS as it provides a cost-effective resource to carry out smaller studies on specific groups of COPD patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800570","grantId":"G0800570","fundValue":"566068","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jadwiga Anna Wedzicha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
