{"id":"E1D907E1-4CD2-4C50-932C-20F032A01246","title":"Validation &amp; Verification for Critical Heat Flux and CFD","abstractText":"The behaviour of nuclear reactors must be thoroughly analysed under a range of normal operation and (especially) fault conditions. Computer programmes that simulate the flow of fluids, (such as 'Computational Fluid Dynamics codes, or CFD codes') can in principle help with this. However, the complexities of the phenomena to be analysed are such that these codes need to be thoroughly validated against good measurements made in suitable experimental rigs. Under this proposal a team of UK researchers will collaborate with colleagues at BARC in India, where there are excellent such experimental facilities available. Experiments will be designed and analysed jointly, and used to validate such codes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I012427/1","grantId":"EP/I012427/1","fundValue":"207496","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Walker","coPersons":["Raad  Issa","Michael John Bluck","Geoffrey F Hewitt"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
