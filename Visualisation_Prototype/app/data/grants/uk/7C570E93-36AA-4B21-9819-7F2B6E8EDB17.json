This proposal is aimed at the development of a simple technique for the fabrication of crossbar electrode arrays for non-volatile memory devices based on a modulated block copolymer/nanoparticle (BCP/NP) assembly approach, where the ability to control the interfacial interactions between the NPs and the BCP domains under an electric field is crucial for obtaining the desired structure. Through a tight collaboration between experimental chemists, theoreticians, and an electrical engineer we intend to unravel the fundamental behavior ofBCP/NP assembly under the influence of a directing electric field, and then to utilize the structures formed for the creation of an ultrahigh-density, multi-component memory device.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H006583/1","grantId":"EP/H006583/1","fundValue":"230474","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrei V Zvelindovsky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
