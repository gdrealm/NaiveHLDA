The IU-ATC project represents the largest collaboration of its kind between UK and India and as such provides a unique and internationally competitive research eco-system to be further leveraged for maximum impact. As commented by the EPSRC Review Panel that met on 15th August (i) &quot;The panel were positive about the success of Phase 1 of IU-ATC, commenting that they were impressed with the achievements of the consortium so far in the face of the significant challenge of making a consortium work across numerous institutions and country boundaries.&quot;, (ii) &quot;The panel were clear that there is no question of the huge capacity that the IU-ATC has built over phase 1.&quot; A summary of our strengths is provided in the Joint 2-page (planning for IU-ATC Phase 2) document submitted to EPSRC-DST on August 5th 2011 (attached). In summary there has been 246 international Conference Papers, 106 Journal Papers ( with 31 papers still under review), Papers under dissemination 31 , 6 Books , and 10 Technical Reports. Of particular significance are the 15 Patents Submitted, the 8 technical Prototypes built and the 12 Technical Testbeds / Demonstrators that support the work of the team in both countries. \n\nAs we plan for Phase 2, we have reflected on our outputs to-date and also the recently published strategic research priorities from EPSRC published in July 2011 on Global Uncertainties , Healthcare, Digital Economy, E-Infrastructure, Intelligent Information Infrastructure, Working Together and DST 11th Plan, DST SAC respectively. In light of the respective national priorities for ICT Research and Innovation that have been identified by EPSRC-DST, there are a number of directly relevant &quot;grand challenges&quot; which we highlighted in our 2-page plan for the respective EPSRC-DST Review Committees on 5th August 2011 (attached). \n\n\nLeveraging the capacity that has been developed in IU-ATC Phase 1, we will take into consideration some of the respective national priorities areas as listed in 1..7 above and the key recommendations of the EPSRC-DST review Panels. As evidenced from the EPSRC Review Panel a specific recommendation was made that whilst we should strive to have commonality of approach between work areas in both countries we should not 'force-fit' all research activities to both countries. Given this recommendation, we have developed a plan of innovative research that attempts to address global issues, common challenges and respective national priorities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J016632/1","grantId":"EP/J016632/1","fundValue":"521844","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Evans","coPersons":["Mehrdad  Dianati","Klaus  Moessner","Muhammad Ali Imran"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":" This is the second phase of the UK India project;\n\nThe test Bed has now been enhanced and an IoT element added.

A unified demo of emergency and disaster relief is planned for later in the year. The test beds are proposed to be used by industry in both countries--in the UK via TSB trials of systems.\n\nTVWS work is planned to convince Indian Regulators to gom ahead with this business opportunity in India and thus involve BT and Indian companies.
