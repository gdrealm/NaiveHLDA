{"id":"494D1CF8-0D41-41F9-97F7-2EEAE6C950FB","title":"Death and Community in Rural Settlements: Changing Burial Culture in Small Towns and Villages, c. 1850-2007","abstractText":"<p>Modern cemetery history has been dominated by urban themes such as rapid population growth, public health and secularisation. This study will, for the first time, examine change in rural locations, and in doing so explore the local impact of national burial legislation in the second half of the nineteenth century; the religious politics of burial in smaller settlements; and the endurance of ‘traditional’ funerary practice. The research will focus on rural settlements in Leicestershire and Rutland, and in Yorkshire, and will have three substantive stages. First, information will be collected on change in burial provision in smaller settlements in the two case study regions, so establishing a robust chronology. Second, thirty case study cemeteries will be chosen for more detailed investigation using a range of local documentary sources: this stage will establish a ‘cultural history’ of the selected cemeteries. Third, in ten of these sites, oral histories will be completed with local clergy, residents, funeral directors and parish officers to understand the contemporary meaning of burial space in rural communities. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0929","grantId":"RES-062-23-0929","fundValue":"258691","fundStart":"2008-04-21","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  There are three substantive measures of impact. First, the research will influence the ways in which burial culture in the UK in the historic period is understood. There are close links between the PI and relevant practitioner organisations, which means that - second - the findings will feed into the ways in which burial space is evalated for conservation purposes. Third, this research has an impact on current cemetery management practices, and has already helped to frame changes in management guidance notes.
