{"id":"E60CE7AB-FE0A-4C8E-A2F3-C3B52E69FE56","title":"Conservative Remeshing for Adaptive Modelling of the Atmosphere","abstractText":"This project will provide a vital step in creating next generation models of the atmosphere for weather and climate forecasting with adaptive meshes. Adaptive meshes mean that higher resolution can be used only where it is really needed, such as for tropical cyclones, extratropical weather fronts and mixing of chemical species, but without huge increases in computer resources. This will lead to improved regional climate predictions and extended weather forecasts. A vital link in creating accurate adaptive mesh models is transferring the solution from a previous mesh to a newly adapted mesh without losing or gaining mass - conservative mapping. During this project we will implement a number of different methods for conservative mapping and test them on simplified adaptive mesh models of the global atmosphere. One of the tests will be tracking chemical species around the atmosphere and providing higher resolution where the species change most rapidly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H002774/1","grantId":"NE/H002774/1","fundValue":"70976","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary  Weller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
