{"id":"49E7A225-E1A2-4EFB-9AC1-5ABCB9C2B6B5","title":"A sociological investigation into the everyday lives of recovering heroin users","abstractText":"<p>Enabling heroin users to overcome their addiction is widely accepted as a key social policy issue. Nonetheless, recovery processes are complex and those with heroin problems repeatedly relapse. The research to be undertaken will move away from the hitherto dominant preoccupation with heroin use as a deviant and dangerous activity and instead focus on the mundane aspects of recovering heroin users' day-to-day lives. Drawing on two theoretical traditions: the 'sociology of everyday life' and 'embodied sociology', this qualitative project will comprise four components. First, focus groups with ex-heroin users and consultations with key stakeholders will inform the conduct of the study; second, interviews with 40 recovering heroin users will explore their daily lives; third, follow up interviews with this same sample will investigate how their recovery journeys are proceeding; and fourth, 2-3 hour periods of non-participant observation with 8 ex-heroin users will generate knowledge of aspects of everyday life and body maintenance. The data will be analysed descriptively, to provide in-depth information on the nature and content of recovering heroin users' lives, and thematically, to identify issues which transcend the data and contribute to the development of sociological theory, policy and practice.<br /> </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1016","grantId":"RES-062-23-1016","fundValue":"267292","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne Sarah Neale","coPersons":["Sarah  Nettleton"],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
