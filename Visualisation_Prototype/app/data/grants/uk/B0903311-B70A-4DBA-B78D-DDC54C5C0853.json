It seeks to follow a cohort of young people, who in an earlier Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study were tracked from age 11 to 18/19, and to examine them for a further two years to the ages of 20/21.&nbsp; Findings from the earlier study suggest that the introduction of compulsory citizenship into the core curriculum in schools has been effective in encouraging pupils to participate in politics and undertake voluntary activities.</p>\n\n<p>The current citizens in transition study will examine if these outcomes are sustained into adulthood.&nbsp; Surveys of comparable groups in Scotland and Wales, who have not been exposed to the citizenship curriculum, will also be conducted.&nbsp; Key questions to be addressed include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How is political engagement and participation changing among young people?</li>\n\n <li>Are they giving up some traditional forms such as voting altogether, while getting involved in new forms, such as internet-based participation?</li>\n\n <li>How do we educate and prepare young&nbsp;citizens to undertake their rights and responsibilities as adult citizens and what changes need to be made in the curriculum?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H026312/1","grantId":"ES/H026312/1","fundValue":"499180","fundStart":"2010-08-15","fundEnd":"2012-01-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Whiteley","coPersons":["Avril  Keating","Joana Isabel Lopes","David  Kerr"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
