This is a particularly a problem for low probability events such as rapid climate changes. We will be holding a number of international workshops to look at these problems. These will bring leading scientists from around the world to discuss these issues with their British colleagues and with users of climate predictions. Two of our meetingss will be longer 'research playgrounds' where we will be able to work for short intensive periods with our international colleagues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D000777/1","grantId":"NE/D000777/1","fundValue":"282293","fundStart":"2006-04-10","fundEnd":"2010-04-09","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  As a series of workshops we did not have findings as such Environment Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Peter  Challenor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":" The project was a series of workshops to bring the climate and statistics communities closer together.
