{"id":"925A1219-C6D2-4EDF-AEFA-BFDA48C5C37D","title":"Modular Lie powers and applications","abstractText":"A module, in the sense used here, is a mathematical object consisting of a space and a group acting on the space. For example, we could take ordinary 2-dimensional space, choose an axis, that is, a straight line in the space, and then take the set of all possible rotations of 3-dimensional space about the axis, by any number of degrees. The set of all these rotations is an example of what mathematicians call a group: the key property is that the result of applying one rotation followed by another is again a rotation (for example, rotation by 20 degrees followed by a rotation by 15 degrees results in a rotation by 35 degrees). Modules are of fundamental importance in mathematics. If we are given a module then there are various natural ways of forming new modules from it. Among these new modules are the so-called Lie powers of the original module. (The construction of these utilise another mathematical object called a Lie algebra.) The purpose of this project is to investigate properties of the Lie powers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G024898/1","grantId":"EP/G024898/1","fundValue":"151344","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Michael  Bryant","coPersons":["Ralph  Stohr"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
