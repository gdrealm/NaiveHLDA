In common with most other RNA viruses, the replication machinery of FMDV makes errors when it copies the genome during replication. As a consequence, the virus evolves very rapidly and can quickly adapt to different environmental pressures. During the 2001 and 2007 outbreaks in the UK, we exploited these properties to finger-print FMDVs recovered from field samples to show how viruses collected on different farms were related to each other. These data provide valuable information to assist in epidemiological tracing and were used in real-time in 2007 to support Defra's control and eradication policy. It is likely that this type of analysis will be widely used to support any future incursions of FMD in the UK (or elsewhere in Europe). However, our current interpretation of these data is limited by our understanding of the fine-scale processes that underpin the genetic changes that are observed during transmission of the virus at the herd-to-herd (or animal-to-animal) level. The aim of this project is to use a 'next-generation' sequencing technology to reveal, for the first time, the complex mixture of viruses that are present within samples and are the starting material for fine-scale evolution of FMDV. We have conducted preliminary experiments to optimise and evaluate this method using a samples collected from a single cow that had been experimentally inoculated with FMDV. These data demonstrate that we are able to measure the frequency of even very rare genetic variants that exist in feet lesions from an infected animal. Many of these variants represent genetic intermediates that were previously undetected using conventional methods. We therefore, conclude that this new sequencing methodology is well-suited to revealing the fine substructure of complex viral populations and will be a valuable tool to quantify the high-resolution evolutionary dynamics of FMDV. During this project, we aim to extend this approach to generate data from a wider range of samples that have already been collected (and archived) from previous field outbreaks of FMD, and from controlled experimental transmission studies and develop models that quantify the effects of transmission on genetic diversity. In addition to improving our understanding of the way that FMDV evolves, we anticipate that the findings from this project will have broad application to the transmission biology of other acutely acting viral infections including viruses of human and veterinary importance such as classical swine fever, swine vesicular disease virus, rabies virus, influenza and corona-like (SARS) viruses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I013784/1","grantId":"BB/I013784/1","fundValue":"282855","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project is still ongoing.\n\nThe Bayesian transmission chain reconstruction method on this project has since been adapted and applied to other disease platforms, specifically rabies and equine influenza.

We have since used this method to investigate the dynamics of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak of 2007.\n2) Developed a computational method to effectively detect mutations in viral next generation sequencing data. We are using this method to detect low frequency variants enabling us to study viral micro-evolution and to quantify the size of the bottlenecks that exist between hosts in a transmission chain.\n3) We used next generation sequencing to examine the viral populations within and between animals in a transmission chain. We firstly discovered a large variability in intra-host viral populations - with different tissues of the same infected animal giving remarkably different viral populations. We discovered that the viral population complexity is influenced by small intra-host bottlenecks and relatively large inter-host bottlenecks. The dynamics of minority variants are consistent with the actions of genetic drift rather than strong selection.\n\nThe project is still currently ongoing, and we are currently investigated the variability in viral populations at the inter-herd level from a real foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, and also how vaccine pressure effects viral evolution within a controlled cow transmission chain. This project has generated a large amount of next generation sequencing data that we have used to investigate the dynamics of foot-and-mouth disease virus evolution and transmission. This data was also used to parameterise and test computational models for both the reconstruction of transmission chains and also for variant detection in viral NGS data sets. We believe that these computational models will be widely used by the scientific community in the analysis of similar studies in the future. Our aim is to carry on the development of these models, by improving their speed and accuracy, and applying them to similar but different data sets.
