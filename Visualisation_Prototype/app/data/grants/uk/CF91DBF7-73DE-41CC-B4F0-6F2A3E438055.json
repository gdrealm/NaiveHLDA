The main emphasis will be to characterise a special set of peacemaker lymphocytes (regulatory T cells) that have the capacity to curb inflammation. By understanding how these cells function we will be in a better position to exploit them, or even to bypass them, with new forms of targeted medication. This information should lead to improved strategies to harness natural regulatory mechanisms to control unwanted inflammatory and immune damage We have exhibited at Royal Society soirees and exhibitions, and have given lay lectures on ?reprogramming? and therapeutic antibodies to the Royal Institution and to school parties visiting Oxford. We maintain an active website http://users.path.ox.ac.uk/~scobbold/tig/welcome.html that lays out our research activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000215","grantId":"G1000215","fundValue":"1121650","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Herman  Waldmann","coPersons":["Stephen P Cobbold"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
