{"id":"E69668E8-6AD0-4DC5-9A10-4A1FF0CECF1E","title":"Multi-Band Superconductivity","abstractText":"Superconductivity in unconventional superconductors is often associated with the existence of several band gaps at the Fermi surface. Neutron SAS is an ideal experiment to examine such effects since the Bragg reflections from the ordered vortex state are sensitive to this characteristic as a function of applied magnetic field and temperature. Control of this feature can also be obtained by applying an external pressure. We have performed a number of neutron SAS measurements on this state at ambient pressure but no-one has yet attempted such measurements under an applied pressure. We believe from our previous experiments that it should now be possible to successfully perform such measurements. Such work is ideal for the training of a research student as it contains aspects of crystal growth, sample characterisation, neutron SAS experiments and data analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G067414/1","grantId":"EP/G067414/1","fundValue":"174126","fundStart":"2009-10-05","fundEnd":"2013-10-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Don McKenzie Paul","coPersons":["Geetha  Balakrishnan"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
