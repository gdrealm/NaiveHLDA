Affected individuals lose their ability to control movement, develop an impaired mental capacity and psychiatric problems and lose weight. The disease progresses for 15-20 years until death. There are effective treatments for some psychiatric problems (e.g. depression) but there is no way to halt or slow the disease progression. HD is inherited and offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of developing the disease. The only difference between the huntingtin gene (HTT) in people who become affected and those who remain disease free is the increased length of the DNA sequence CAG close to its beginning. This results in an extra long tract of glutamines (a building block for proteins) in the huntingtin protein (HTT). The extra glutamines cause the HTT protein to interact with itself and other proteins in an aberrant fashion but the mechanism by which this causes HD remains poorly understood. \n\nFragments of HTT have been detected in the brains of HD patients and HD mouse models and a considerable amount of research indicates that HTT fragments are more important for the disease process than the full-length protein. Most research into the origin of these fragments has focussed on identifying the relevant proteases (enzymes that cleave proteins), but despite this, the origin of most fragments remains unknown. \n\nWe have recently found that the smallest HTT fragment is generated by altered processing of the HTT gene and not by protease digestion. Most genes are composed of exons (DNA sequences that code for the protein) that are separated by introns. As the gene is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), the introns are removed by splicing prior to protein production. The HTT gene is comprised of 67 exons and we have discovered that when the HD mutation is present, exon 1 of HTT does not always splice to exon 2, producing a small novel mRNA that contains exon 1 and intron 1 sequences and terminates in a polyA tail, that marks the end mRNA. This is translated to produce a small exon 1 HTT protein that has been shown to be highly pathogenic in multiple model systems. These results are important because understanding how this HTT fragment is generated will allow us to devise strategies to prevent its formation and thereby determine the extent to which it contributes to the disease process. \n\nAn understanding of the processing of the HTT gene and the production of HTT fragments is a basic requisite to unraveling the pathogenic process that causes HD. In this proposal we shall:\n1. Further investigate the mechanism by which the HD mutation (extra long CAG sequence) results in the incomplete splicing of exon 1 HTT to exon 2. We have identified a splicing factor (SRSF6) that recognizes CAG repeat sequences, is known to modulate the splicing of genes and we have shown that it binds to the beginning of the HTT gene. We shall investigate the mechanism by which SRSF6 influences HTT splicing and identify other splicing factors that may be involved.\n2. Over the past ten years, we have performed an extensive characterization of various mouse models of HD. We shall use a new technology (zinc finger nucleases) to manipulate the Htt gene in HD mice in order to prevent the exon 1 HTT protein from being generated via this mis-splicing mechanism. This will ultimately allow us to determine the extent to which the exon 1 HTT protein contributes to the HD disease process.\n3. We have identified a number of additional HTT fragments in the brains of the HD mice. With the exception of exon 1 HTT, the identity and origin of these fragments remains unknown. We shall use a combination of chemical modification and protein sequencing to identify the ends of as many of these other fragments as possible. This may reveal strategies by which the formation of specific fragments can be prevented and their contribution to pathogenesis determined.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L003627/1","grantId":"MR/L003627/1","fundValue":"362545","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Bates","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
