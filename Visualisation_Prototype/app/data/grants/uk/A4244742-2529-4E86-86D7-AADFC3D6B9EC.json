{"id":"A4244742-2529-4E86-86D7-AADFC3D6B9EC","title":"Repair of replication-associated double strand breaks","abstractText":"The accurate inheritance of the genetic material (DNA) is key to the survival of all organisms. DNA has to be copied (replicated) and then divided into two identical halves which separate at cell division into the two daughter cells, ensuring that the daughter cells inherit identical copies of the genome. We want to understand how cells repair DNA breaks that occur during replication and how repair is coordinated with replication.\n\nDNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are dangerous forms of DNA damage. A single unrepaired DSB is can be lethal to a cell and inaccurate repair of a DSB can result in mutations or chromosome rearrangements. Cells are particularly vulnerable to DSBs that occur during replication. The break has to be repaired and replication restarted as it is vital that all of the genome is copied. Restart can be at the expense of an increased error rate leading to mutations and an increase in genome rearrangements. Since such changes can lead to cancer it is vital that copying is coordinated with repair and restarts correctly. \n\nEssentially all mechanistic models for DSB repair look at a single DSB in a linear molecule, ie it has two ends. In S phase breaks have one end. Here we have set up a system in fission yeast where we can induce a break during replication at a specific place in the genome. This enables us to study the events involved in repair and restart. We use fission yeast to study how DNA repair is coordinated to ensure copying restarts correctly because it is easy and cheap to manipulate and most importantly due to the biology of fission yeast we can induce a specific DNA break during replication. This unique system means that we can study repair and replication restart at a particular site in detail and this cannot be done easily in other systems. Since yeast cells repair and copy their DNA in a similar way to human cells we can use this system to model how human cells repair breaks associated with the copying of the DNA. \n\nThis information will be important and provides opportunities to rationally design novel cancer therapies. The aim of such therapies is to specifically target tumour cells. Since these are actively growing and often defective in DNA damage responses a knowledge of the processes involved in the repair of DNA breaks in S phase will in the long term inform the choice of therapeutic agents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K019805/1","grantId":"BB/K019805/1","fundValue":"478675","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant has been running for a year and while we have made good progress towards our aims the research is not yet at the stage to make a demonstrable contribution to society and the economy. However, as a research group we have contributed to the promotion of scientific careers firstly at a secondary school careers convention and secondly with the production of a BBC video on biochemistry as a career. This supports the training of a skilled work force. In addition, providing support and research materials to the BBC 'Bang Goes the Theory' production team for a programme on cancer promotes cancer research to a wide audience. The programme underlined how discovery science has led to and continues to lead to developments in treatment. Thus enhancing the quality of health.

Cells are particularly vulnerable to DSBs that occur during replication. The break has to be repaired and replication restarted in order to replicate all of the genome. Restart can be at the expense of an increased error rate leading to mutations and an increase in genome rearrangements, which can lead to cancer. \n\nWhen a replication fork encounters a nick a one-ended DSB is generated. Since this has no second end to re-join by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), it requires homologous recombination (HR) to re- establish a fork structure. This is assumed to be the critical lesion that makes recombination essential during S phase in higher eukaryotes but an incoming fork will convert a one-ended break to a two-ended break and potentially change the repair pathways used.\nWe set up a system in fission yeast to study repair at a site-specific DSB in S phase either in the absence of an incoming fork (single-ended) or when a converging fork converts the one-ended DSB into a two-ended DSB and are characterising the requirements for repair in the two conditions. Our analysis shows that homologous recombination is required for repair under both conditions and a detailed analysis of recombination factors is currently in progress to determine the dependencies of repair.\nIn addition we have set up live cell imaging in synchronised cultures to analyse the timing of repair events and compared the timing of repair of one-ended and two-ended DSBs. Interestingly the presence of an incoming fork did not significantly change the timing as judged by recruitment of Rad52.\nWe are currently developing methods to analyse the timing of events at the molecular level. This will enable us to correlate the timing of recruitment of repair factors in individual cells with the appearance of repair intermediates. We are also setting up systems to investigate the effects of repair on genome stability.\nSince the mechanism of repair of DSBs in S phase is not understood this study will provide a conceptual framework for understanding repair pathway choice and related processes in human cells. This is relevant to studies of cellular aging, genomic diseases and the development of cancer therapies and thus for human health. The assays being developed will benefit the yeast research communities and will inform the wider DNA repair and recombination research fields. The project will have significant impact for research progress in this area, as well as contributing to the understanding of diseases related to DNA repair defects, such as cancer. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms of DNA break repair in S phase could potentially have a significant impact on the development of novel therapies tailored specifically to target these important pathways.\nThe most significant impacts will be in:\n• disseminating results to the scientific/clinical, industrial and non-academic communities; \n• training/inspiring the next generation of scientists; \n• development of applications in drug development.
