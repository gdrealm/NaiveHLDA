{"id":"ECE6752A-E9AF-4319-AECF-3B3271130858","title":"Advanced ceramic matrix composites for energy generating gas turbine applications","abstractText":"The project will develop a high temperature oxide/oxide ceramic matrix composite (CMC) for use in power generating gas turbine applications. This will provide a step change in temperature capability enabling higher operating temperatures, improving engine efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. To achieve these objectives development of a CMC manufactured by a novel processing route is proposed. The programme will generate a fundamental understanding of the material, its failure/degradation mechanisms, optimised manufacturing process, NDE lifing, and repair issues. The academic partners will provide the CMC technology and the materials understanding. Industry will develop the NDE, lifing technologies, scale the process up to pilot plant level and provide the exploitation route.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G000549/1","grantId":"TS/G000549/1","fundValue":"424953","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bowen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
