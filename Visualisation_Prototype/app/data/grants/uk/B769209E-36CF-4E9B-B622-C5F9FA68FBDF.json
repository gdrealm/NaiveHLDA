Ballantyne and John Buchan. Completed essays on all three have been submitted as articles to academic journals; in addition, they will form the basis of three chapters of a book entitles Scottish Fiction and the Work of Empire 1815-1940 (a fourth chapter will discuss R.L. Stevenson). These have established the centrality of work to the representation of empire in popular fiction in this period, that stories about the empire are often ways of discussing the changing social and moral meanings of work, and that this is accordingly, also stories offering models for self-improvement or redemption (for example) through work. The importance of this lies in establishing the relations of Scotland to the British Empire as it was understood by contemporary readers, and in particular the way in which imperialism was experienced as an enabling force even by people who never left the UK. This work thus demands to be taken into consideration by those scholars and writers who insist either that Scotland was a colonised victim of Empire or that participation on the British Empire was the best thing that ever happened to us.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111761/1","grantId":"111761/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-05-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Irvine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
