{"id":"D01C446A-BD3F-4959-99F6-656C706BD76C","title":"Geographies of Mathematical Attainment and Participation","abstractText":"There is currently great interest in increasing participation, retention and attainment in post-compulsory mathematics, and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects more widely. This project goes beyond headline statistical trend analyses to examine, through a multi-layer, mixed methods approach, the social patterning and underlying causes of varied participation and attainment in school mathematics.\n<br />\n<br />Of particular concern is the impact of the school mathematics departments, but this unit of analysis sits between a) community and regional effects and b) the impact of learners' dispositions acquired in their particular social milieu upon mathematics learning trajectories. The study uses large-scale, longitudinal data sets of learner attainment to conduct analyses (eg multi-level modelling) of school effects and the impact of various social factors upon trajectories.\n<br />\n<br />Maps of participation and attainment will be constructed using GIS software to support Phase I analysis and identify case study schools. Following this, extensive questionnaire survey work in a range of schools (Phase II), and further qualitative research in the case study sites (Phase III), will tease out the social mechanisms that contribute to various mathematical trajectories.\n<br />\n<br />The study will contribute to scholarly debate and policy formation aimed at increasing and widening participation in mathematics-related further- and higher-education programmes.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0035","grantId":"RES-061-25-0035","fundValue":"188161","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main use of the findings has been academic. For example Noyes (2009) is one of the most highly cited papers in Research in Mathematics Education. The work fed into a parallel study funded by the QCA. The findings have influenced other work and have led to further funding from the Nuffield Foundation for a project that builds upon this ESRC study Education Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Andrew  Noyes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" The key findings from this study include\n\n1. Although boys are more likely to continue to A level mathematics, the relative proportions of boys to girls are reduced for higher grades. Targeting GCSE grade A/B girls would have the biggest impact on recruitment;\n2. Some ethnic groups are nearly twice as likely to complete A level mathematics as some of their White British peers;\n3. After accounting for prior attainment, social background and cohort mix, over 20% of the remaining unexplained variation in completion of A level mathematics is due to the school attended;\n4. Attrition is higher from AS mathematics than from any other subject. One of the unexpected developments of the research is the theorisation of multi-scale methodology that makes an important contribution to social-science methodology. \nThe patterning of engagement and attainment in post-16 mathematics (and science) needs extended examination, both over time and a larger geographical scale.
