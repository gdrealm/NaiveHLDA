We are working with a number of user groups and have proposed to use CIS as core evaluation tool in the large DFID/NERC global model development proposal IMPALA, led by the UK MetOffice. The idea is to use CIS to provide easy access to IMPALA data to African partners as well as the scientific community.

Many individuals in the community have codes, which can be used to some aspects of these tasks, but there are no publicly accessible codes suitable for use in large-scale analysis of large repositories of simulation data.\n\nThe Community Intercomparison Suite funded by this grant is an open source software tool for plotting, analysis and inter- comparison of atmospheric model, remote sensing and in situ data products with unprecedented flexibility in the handling of a multitude of very heterogeneous datasets. \n\nCIS is available open source but also deployed at the UK national JASMIN data analysis platform, holding a vast amount of physical climate datasets. CIS is an open software initiative and is being deployed for community use at the Centre for Environmental Data Archival. \n\nWe are working on with the MetOffice on the use of CIS for the UK Earth System Model evaluation Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
