Whilst individually these conditions are rare, the total population, and thus cumulative impact and need for specific advice and intervention, is substantial (Dodge et al., 2010). Despite the size of this unmet need, there is little evidence that it will be addressed without an initiative to increase research and actively disseminate information.</p>\n\n<p>In this project a sustainable website resource for parents, carers and professionals caring for individuals with six rare genetic syndromes will be developed and piloted. The impact of the resource will be evaluated. The website will have the following functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to disseminate our peer reviewed research findings to enhance knowledge, understanding and awareness of the needs of individuals with rare genetic syndromes</li>\n\n <li>to provide advice and guidance to professionals regarding assessment and intervention for behaviour disorders and make available the appropriate assessment tools that we have developed during our research</li>\n\n <li>to provide accessible, syndrome specific,&nbsp; information derived from our database to help identify those at risk for developing behaviour disorder.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000659/1","grantId":"ES/K000659/1","fundValue":"95703","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Oliver","coPersons":["Joanna  Moss","Lucy  Wilde","Deborah Jane  Allen"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
