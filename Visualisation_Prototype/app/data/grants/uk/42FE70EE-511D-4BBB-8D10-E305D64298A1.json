The elements each represent an eco-intervention such as passive ventilation, insulation, a heat pump and solar panels. A team of users that might include an architect, an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) company, a constructor and the owner 'play' at configuring the elements and exploring the multiple interrelated attributes of the interventions. In essence this is smart RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) devices meets Dolls-House. The aim of this research is to explore and quantify to what extent a dolls-house approach to eco-design enables improves stakeholder interaction and what elements and interface provide effective design aids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N009835/1","grantId":"EP/N009835/1","fundValue":"181947","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Childs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
