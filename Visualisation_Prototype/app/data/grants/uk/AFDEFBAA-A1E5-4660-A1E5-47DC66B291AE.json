Central to recent shifts in practice and redefinitions of self and community are local Islamist movements, which are engaged in long term projects of transformation of religious practices and subjectivites. Local Islamism is enhanced by modernity, the rise of a new middle class and intensifying links to global reformism - factors identifiable from the 1920s but intensified post 1970s, with the revitalisation of economic life and transformation of Kerala society generally which result from increased migration and business within the Persion Gulf region.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113210/1","grantId":"113210/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This award was part of the Research Leave Scheme and was awarded in 2006.

Islamism is enhanced by modernity, the rise of a new middle class and intensifying links to global reformism - factors identifiable in the region since the 1920s, but intensified post 1970s, with the revitalisation of economic life and transformation of Kerala society resultant from intensified traffic with the Gulf region. Issues around gender and family relations emerged as important: Calicut Muslims are conventionally matrilineal / matrifocal and men are often absent ‘Gulf migrants’. Economic liberalisation is also leading to shifts in expectations of family / married life. At the same time, the research highlighted the emergence of new forms of religiosity, and the connection between the latter and various forms of economic entrepreneurship. This project has had impact in several arenas beyond south Asian / Indian academic circles: expanding networks of Indian Ocean studies, placing south India into context with East africa and south-east Asia to discuss the role of (for example) trade or Islam in spreading populations, ideas and artefacts; discussions about ‘globalised’ Islam; the emerging field of ‘Gulf studies’, with an agenda quite distinct from pre-existing studies (dominated by strategic / international relations perspectives).
