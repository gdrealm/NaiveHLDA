'Transitions in Kitchen Living' aims to examine the role, function and design of the kitchen as it affects the lives of older people living in domestic and supportive housing in both urban and rural locations. A cross-generational perspective will focus on historical and contemporary aspects of kitchen life - through biographical, ergonomic and visual research. </p>\n\n<p>The research will be grounded in secondary analysis of two existing data sets:&nbsp; the EPSRC EQUAL funded 'Profiling the Housing Stock for Older People' and the ESRC funded 'Environment and Identity in Later Life'. A purposive sample of 48 older people will then participate in focussed research through in-depth oral histories of kitchen living, consideration of individual health and well-being, and ergonomic assessment of present kitchens capturing opinion and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Findings from this research will contribute to the oral history of kitchen living; provide greater understanding of person/environment fit in terms of individual morale; and lead to more inclusive design through the development of an on-line resource where the voices, experiences and actions of older people will enhance existing guidance on kitchen design.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-356-25-0030","grantId":"RES-356-25-0030","fundValue":"293306","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to discuss the impact of an ageing society on the future design of mainstream and supportive housing. We are beginning to see some examples of age-inclusive design in supportive housing. Discussions with the retail sector continue. However there is still ageism in terns of the market for new kitchen designs which are targeted at 20-60 years olds. The team is integrating the findigns into teaching both in social gerontology, design and ergonomics.

The kitchen has been seen as an important domestic space that enables people to remain 'staying put' within their own home as they age. However, the design of the kitchen to date has not taken onboard the needs of people as their health and wellbeing changes. There are issues relating to vision, reaching, dexterity and hearing that need to be taken on board in the doemstic space.
