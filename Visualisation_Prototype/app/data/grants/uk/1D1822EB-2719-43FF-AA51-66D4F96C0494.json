This led to a rapid expansion of exports, predominantly of clothing. Six African economies - Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, South Africa and Swaziland were the primary beneficiaries, accounting for more than 90 per cent of these exports by 2004. For the poorest of these economies, AGOA (and to a lesser extent, EU trade preferential schemes) provided for a major expansion of exports and employment. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of 2004, quotas limiting Chinese exports to the US and markets were removed. The consequences for SSA's clothing exporters were severe - total exports fell by more than 25 per cent in two years. But since then, the fall in clothing exports has been arrested. This overall stabilisation masked very different country experiences. Kenya's exports continued to decline in value, despite a reduction in unit prices.&nbsp; By contrast, Malagasy clothing exports grew in value as well as in unit-price.</p>\n\n<p>Through an analysis of secondary data and interviews with Kenyan and Malagasy firms, this research will examine the nature and drivers of this contrasting performance, seeking to determine the implications for SSA's future industrial development. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G036098/1","grantId":"ES/G036098/1","fundValue":"76343","fundStart":"2009-05-11","fundEnd":"2010-05-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Raphael  Kaplinsky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
