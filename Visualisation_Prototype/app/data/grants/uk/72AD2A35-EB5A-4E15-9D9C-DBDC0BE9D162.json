{"id":"72AD2A35-EB5A-4E15-9D9C-DBDC0BE9D162","title":"Language Learning in the Wild","abstractText":"The aim of the project is to produce a digital kitchen that speaks to the user in French, (or other language) and gives instructions on how to prepare a French dish. Sensors are attached to all equipment so that each time an item is correctly or incorrectly moved, participants can be given appropriate verbal feedback and further instructions.This project adapts the technology of our existing Ambient Kitchen for communication with people with dementia and adapts it to the field of language learning. Participants are equipped with a headset and microphone and can request a repetition or a translation of what the kitchen is saying to them. A situated language learning session will take students through the cooking instructions step-by-step, as is receives evidence from the sensors that the participants have carried out the stages of the task. In addition to verbal instructions and feedback, these are provided in writing on a large font digital display with translation facility. Prior to the task, a video is shown of the food being prepared, together with audio and text in the foreign language. Assessment of task completion will be both continuous, using the kitchen's sensors to detect and evaluate appropriate activity, and post-test, through an analysis of acquired vocabulary and structures. Once designed, the kitchen will be trialled in an authentic training setting, namely in one of Newcastle College's large training kitchens. Students from both the Catering and French departments will use the kitchens to develop their linguistic and culinary skills. The design of the kitchen and related software will develop through user input and result in a fully trialled kitchen, which will be installed in the National Centre for Languages (CILT) in London, the Government's recognised centre of expertise on foreign language learning. CILT's role will be as the primary dissemination and exploitation partner and their staff will demonstrate the kitchen to visitors. The pedagogical design of this study employs Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT), a well-established approach to language learning which prompts learners to achieve a goal or complete a task. Much like real-world tasks, such as asking for directions, TBLT seeks to develop students' language through providing a task and then using language to solve it. This project provides an opportunity for language learning to be combined with the completion of a motivating real-world task in an authentic setting (college catering kitchens) using the latest technology. It therefore offers the opportunity of taking the excellent research-based pedagogical principles and procedures developed by TBLT over the years out of the classroom and into use in real-world applications.In terms of the broader social context, the pedagogical design of the situated language learning system is intended to create a transferable, interdisciplinary model of task-based, situated learning which can be applied to many different technological settings and many different skill and knowledge sets. A significant challenge for the UK is how to employ the available digital technology to upgrade the skills of its workforce in a rapidly changing world. A specific challenge is how to improve the declining foreign language proficiency of the British workforce. The number of pupils gaining a GCSE in a foreign language has decreased significantly, whilst a recent British Academy report discussed concerns that the future of the UK's world-class research base might be threatened by the decline in modern language learning. The language learning and spoken interaction aspects of the project will be led by Prof Paul Seedhouse and the technological aspect will be handled by Prof Patrick Olivier, who developed the existing Ambient Kitchen for communication with people with dementia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043012/1","grantId":"EP/H043012/1","fundValue":"162525","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A task-based model of application of technology to language learning.\n\nWe generated and trialed a task-based model of application of technology to language learning.

This involved taking a normal kitchen and specifically adapting it for French language learning using activity recognition and sensor technology. We constructed a purpose-built kitchen that communicates with learners in French and gives them step-by-step instructions on how to prepare French cuisine and teaches aspects of French language. \n\nThe aim of our project was twofold. First we wanted to find out what kinds of learning processes occur when there is dual focus on cooking and French and second, we wanted to evaluate the French Digital Kitchen as a learning tool, with the ultimate aim of improving it.\n\nIn the French Digital Kitchen, this technology was developed so that the kitchen speaks to the learners in French, providing step-by-step cooking instructions in relation to learners’ completion of the cooking steps. It can also detect what the learners are (or are not) doing and this information is used by the kitchen programme to provide feedback such as a reminder or more details about a certain cooking action in French.\n\nEmbedded or hidden digital sensors were developed and inserted in or attached to all the equipment (for example, a peeler, a mixing bowl, a whisk or even the oven door) and ingredients (for example, a bag of flour, sugar or a tub of butter). The sensors use a technology similar to the Nintendo Wii™. The sensors hidden in the knife for example were designed to detect whether a ‘chopping’ action’ or a ‘scraping’ motion is being made and provide appropriate feedback. Learners are also able to communicate with the kitchen, using an interactive screen where they can request audio and textual help along the way in the form of repetitions, translations and the ability to move back and forward between the cooking instructions.\n\nOur findings have shown that this is an effective pervasive language learning environment when coupled with a task-based learning approach: \n\nLearners used French and engaged in specific types of learning processes to complete the cooking task. These processes involved a focus on attention to new language and applying existing language knowledge. They demonstrate the kinds of learning behaviours which are central to key concepts, processes and curriculum opportunities promoted in classroom learning for French. \n\nThey show how a ‘real-world’ task-based learning environment is able to foster and develop learners’ knowledge, creativity, strategies and skills outside the French classroom. \n\nImportantly, this is made possible in the French Digital Kitchen by providing an autonomous context for learning which is supported by user-centered technology through the use of the interactive screen and the provision of timely cooking instructions.\n\n\n\nWe have been able to develop a model of Task-Based Learning that will inform the creations of further materials and trials in order to arrive at accessible resources for teaching cooking and languages using digital technology. There is a lot of potential use of the materials we have produced during the research in non-academic contexts. The materials were aimed to be used in a wide range of non-academic learning settings such as for schools and in adult, higher and vocational education. The project's importnace for language learning was recognised by the award of the 2012 European Language Label for Innovation in Language Teaching and Learning by the European Union http://www.cilt.org.uk/home/valuing_languages/european_language_label_2012/winning_projects/2012.aspx The research will be put to use through the creation of multilingual materials for use with ‘portable kitchens’. The portable kitchens have been made possible through the cross-disciplinary work of the project. These multilingual materials are now being created through a further 3 year EU funded project www.europeandigitalkitchen.com. We are trialling a further design for the materials by carrying out further research with a view to then making these revised materials commercially available. We are currently (March 2013) setting up a univeristy spin-off company.
