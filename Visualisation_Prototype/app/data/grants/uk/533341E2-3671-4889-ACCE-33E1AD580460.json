{"id":"533341E2-3671-4889-ACCE-33E1AD580460","title":"The Future of Historical Sociolinguistics","abstractText":"People use language not just as a primary means of communicating basic needs but also to establish, interpret, and further social relations with each other. Language is used / consciously and subconsciously / as a marker of human identity and many current debates on what defines a particular national, regional, or ethnic group centre around the existence, usage, and prestige of vernacular languages. \\nThough the name Historical Sociolinguistics suggests that it combines history and linguistics, scholars in the field have principally been linguists, rather than historians. The proposed network aims to provide a platform to bring the two disciplines together to enable true collaboration and exchange of ideas.\\n\\nAs a discipline, historical sociolinguistics only emerged some 30 years ago. It is concerned with reconstructing the interaction of language and society in the past. Scholars realized that the findings of the sociolinguistic revolution pioneered in the 1960s could usefully be applied to the histories of individual languages in order to unravel complex linguistic developments, especially socially and historically driven language change. Particular linguistic features, such as the dropping of /h/ at the beginning of English words, or the use of *to do* as an auxiliary in German have very clear social connotations which are tightly linked with the emergence of particular social hierarchies, rather than with 'mechanical' linguistic changes. The processes of standardisation, but also the spreading of literacy and the stylistic stratification of text types have all played vital roles in the development of language change, either as innovating, accelerating or slowing down.\\nLanguage sciences have often borrowed insights and terminologies from other disciplines (e.g. the term 'morphology' from chemistry, or the similarity between S-curve shaped diachronic linguistic change and epidemics in biology). However, traditionally linguists have shied away from collaboration and exchange of ideas with experts from neighbouring disciplines, be this other languages or, more importantly for our proposal, from history, and, in the future, sociology and political sciences. \\nFinally, it is important that the future generation of academics will avoid the isolation of previous generations. To make this more than a simple appeal for widening of horizons, we will provide a summer school for young researchers which will provide a learning environment on the cross-fertilisation between history and linguistics, in particular with regard to data collection and interpretation methods as well as providing synthesis when looking at the 'bigger picture'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F00933X/1","grantId":"AH/F00933X/1","fundValue":"23912","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nils  Langer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
