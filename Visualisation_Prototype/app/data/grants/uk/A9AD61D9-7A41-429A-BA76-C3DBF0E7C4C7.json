The associated lack of oxygen supply causes death of the heart muscle supplied by this artery. Prompt opening of the blocked artery (eg by inflation of a balloon in the artery) limits the extent of this damage. However, the restoration of blood flow itself causes a degree of damage to the heart muscle. In this study we plan to investigate whether a drug called sodium nitrite given to patients suffering from heart attacks immediately before opening the blocked artery will reduce the damage to the heart muscle. This is important because when a large amount of heart muscle is damaged the patient is at risk of developing heart failure a condition associated with breathlessness and a poor survival.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001340","grantId":"G1001340","fundValue":"1234100","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Frenneaux","coPersons":["Graeme  MacLennan","Thomas  Redpath","Melanie  Madhani","Dana  Dawson","Stuart  Cook","Juan-Carlos  Kaski","Pitt O Lim"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
