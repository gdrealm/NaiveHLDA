Lungs from individuals with fatal cases of bird flu were filled with a subset of white cells (T lymphocytes) which were meant to protect humans from viral infections. Therefore, was there an over-exuberant response by these T lymphocytes and did they cause more harm than good? \nWe know that another group of immune cells (the natural killer T cells) can influence the behaviour of these T lymphocytes. We are using mouse models to determine if manipulating the natural killer T cells to put a brake on the expansion of the T lymphocytes might improve the outcome of bird flu infection in these mice. \nIf this is the case, it could lead to new ways of treating severe flu infection and improve survival rate from new lethal strains of flu viruses like the H5N1 strain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600371","grantId":"G0600371","fundValue":"299859","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ling-Pei  Ho","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
