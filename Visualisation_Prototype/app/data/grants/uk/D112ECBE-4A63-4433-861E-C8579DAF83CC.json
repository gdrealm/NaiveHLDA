In particular, it studied whether the presence of vertically-integrated firms could lead to foreclosure problems.The two key questions were the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>What are the implications for welfare and consumer surplus in case a planned vertical merger is allowed to take place?</li>\n\n <li>How should the assessment of market power in the upstream (“merchant”) or in the downstream (“retail”) market be affected by the presence of vertically-integrated firms?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Stimulus for this work came from the recently published new non-horizontal merger guidelines of the European Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Results show that, though at first intuitive, the guidelines’ asserted relationship between margins and foreclosure incentives misses some key economic effects. In fact, high upstream and low downstream margins may be associated with high incentives to foreclose downstream rivals, in contrast to what is asserted in the guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Case studies about vertical relationships in the health-care sector were also collected and reviewed.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2099","grantId":"RES-062-23-2099","fundValue":"147062","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tommaso  Valletti","coPersons":["Roman  Inderst"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
