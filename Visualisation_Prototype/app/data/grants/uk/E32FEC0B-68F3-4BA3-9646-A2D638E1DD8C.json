{"id":"E32FEC0B-68F3-4BA3-9646-A2D638E1DD8C","title":"Platform: Future Technologies in Power Electronics","abstractText":"To date, the PG has enabled blue-sky and applied research in AC-AC conversion, the latter, in particular, enabling growth of strategic collaborations in the aerospace, RF and energy sectors. Whilst the Group's strategic integration into the international aerospace sector is well advanced, that into the RF and energy sectors is at an early stage; this is because the mass penetration of power electronic conversion in to the respective markets has yet to be realised. The market potential and the opportunities for new partnerships and strategies are discussed in Section 2.Scientifically, the existing PG has enabled the PEMC Group to grow its base-expertise and knowledge transfer potential to span the spectrum of power electronic technologies in which AC-AC and multi-level, multi-cellular topologies are seen as particular solutions dependent on the nature of the application performance specifications. For example, in RF power electronics, all three topologies (and other paradigms) can be applied. The broad aim of the Platform Grant Renewal (PGR) is to provide the manpower base to exploit the Group's increased scientific potential in addressing existing and future challenges in power electronic conversion; and to apply this potential to selected application areas in order to develop new and existing strategic collaborations with industry and institutions, both within the UK and internationally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078792/1","grantId":"EP/D078792/1","fundValue":"758646","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-10-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  PROGRESS AGAINST OBJECTIVES\n1. To undertake scientific research relating to environmental, parameter and quality optimisation of PE converter\ntechnologies, both generically and application specific as appropriate, and to assess the impact of new developments in\ndevices, packaging, insulation, and heat transfer technologies.\n\nResearch in this area has led to levered funding from TSB via TULIP - Technologies for Ultra Integrated Power\nElectronics and DIPEC. Developments under industry funding - high power matrix converter with SiC diodes and\nintegrated wholly SiC matric converter, both represent World firsts.\n2. To maintain and develop new standard power electronic and control platforms, based on a modular, building block\napproach, in order to accelerate project progress and to formalise synergies and commonalities across strategic areas.\nStandardised control platforms and converter building blocks have been developed and have significantly accelerated\nresearch as intended. Control platforms and converter designs/hardware have been shared under agreements with\ncollaborators in Spain, Chile, Malta and the UK (Cardiff) - accelerating the progress of collaborative research through\nstandardisation of hardware/firmware across institutions. Additional funding has been levered through SCARLETT (FP7)\nand ELGEAR (TSB).\n3. To grow research activities in the energy and RF sectors through levered funding, and developing new industrial and\ninstitutional collaborations.\nResearch in the RF sector has grown significantly during the Platform period, with new research activities being funded by\nSTFC/DSTL and TSB and industry. Two of the Research Fellows funded under the Platform now work in industrial\nresearch in this sector. The Energy portfolio has also seen considerable growth with the Group playing a major role in the\n&quot;Energy technologies Research Institute&quot; at Nottingham and in winning funding from (?8M) for a new Micro-grid and\nRenewable Energy Laboratory - this includes ?589k (ERDF) for power conversion activities in the new facility. New\ninstitutional collaborations (Imperial, Strathclyde, Manchester etc) have recently been formed through the award of\n&quot;HubNet&quot; under the EPSRC Supergen call and through a bid into the EPSRC &quot;Energy Networks Grand Challenge&quot; call -\nNottingham's work in both of these focuses on power electronics and power conversion.\n4. To carry out pump-priming projects in new application areas with aim of seed-bedding future strategic growth.\nProjects in new areas have been established in marine power systems (fault location), micro-grid control, high voltage\nresonant power supplies and in silicon carbide matrix converters.\n5. To provide continuity of technical expertise in order to consolidate the Group's new strategic partnerships within the UK\nand international aerospace community.\nThe Group in now one of the leading research groups in aerospace electrical systems worldwide - evidenced by\ncontinued support from leading airframers, associate status in the EU Clean Sky JTI (?8.5M budget), ?5.3M (CIF +\nERDF) university award for an &quot;Aerospace Research Instutute&quot;, including ?2M for an &quot;Aerospace Research Center&quot; to\nhouse the PEMC aerospace research and a major share of an EPSRC equipment award (?1.5M) to underpin aerospace\nreearch at Nottingham.\n6. To provide technical assistance in the establishment of a technology transfer arm of the Group's activities funded\nthrough DTI and RDA.\nThe Group has established 4 KTPs and one EPSRC KTS in the area of the Platform Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics,Energy Societal,Economic","person":"Jon  Clare","coPersons":["Christian  Klumpner","Patrick  Wheeler","Pericle  Zanchetta","Mark  Sumner","Keith John Bradley","Greg  Asher"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Platform Grant: developments include - high power matrix converter with SiC diodes and integrated wholly SiC matric converter, both represented World firsts.
