The MACACO project proposes an innovative solution to this problem by focusing on data offloading mechanisms that take advantage of context and content information. Our intuition is that if it is possible to extract and forecast the behaviour of mobile network users in the three dimensional space of time, location and interest (i.e. 'what', 'when' and 'where' users are pulling data from the network), it is possible to derive efficient data offloading protocols. Such protocols would pre-fetch the identified data and cache them at the network edge at an earlier time, preferably when the mobile network is less congested, or offers better quality of service. Caching can be done directly at the mobile terminals, as well as at the edge nodes of the network (e.g., femtocells or wireless access points). \n\nBuilding on previous research efforts in the fields of social wireless networking, opportunistic communications and content networking, MACACO will address several issues in this space. The first one is to derive appropriate models for the correlation between user interests and their mobility. Lots of studies have characterised mobile nodes mobility based on real world data traces, but knowledge about the interactions with user interests in this context is still missing. To fill this gap, MACACO proposes to acquire real world data sets to model mobile node behaviour in the aforementioned three-dimensional space. The second issue addressed is the derivation of efficient data-offloading algorithms leveraging the large-scale data traces and corresponding models. Firstly, simple and efficient prediction algorithms will be derived to forecast the node's mobility and interests. Then, MACACO will provide data pre-fetching mechanisms that both improves the perceived quality of service of the mobile user and\nnoticeably offloads peak bandwidth demands at the cellular network. A proof of concept will be exhibited though a federated testbed located in France, Switzerland and in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L018829/1","grantId":"EP/L018829/1","fundValue":"284801","fundStart":"2014-04-30","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is still at an early stage (it started this year).

We have been collaborating to the design of an Android application for data collection developed mainly by INRIA, one of the partner of the project. The application collects data about mobility patterns and Web navigation. The application will be distributed across the different members of the project in the next months.\n\nOne of the major lessons learnt was the establishment of a common ethics framework for the project across multiple jurisdictions (UK, France, Switzerland and Italy). The project is still at an early stage (it started this year). However, we believe that the results of the project might be of strong interest for telecommunication companies and content providers.\n\nMoreover, the academic community might be interested in the type of data and analysis conducted in MACACO, in particular with respect to the interdependence of content usage and context (location, user activity, etc.).
