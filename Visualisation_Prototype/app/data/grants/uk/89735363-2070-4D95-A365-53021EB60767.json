In abnormal condition it is the focus of the most common epilepsy in adults called temporal lobe epilepsy. Proper function of the hippocampus requires a well-orchestrated activity of neurons. The synchronization in the neural network is maintained by inhibitory neurons, which make up only 10% of the cell population. As demonstrated before, different inhibitory cells have various functions in the network activity. Locally acting neurons are the best studied in the inhibitory cell group because the commonly utilized brain slicing method relatively marginally alters the connectivity of this type of cells. However, inhibitory neurons with long axonal arborization eluded researcher until today because the investigation requires intact brain preparation. I propose that long projection inhibitory neurons have a critical role in the hippocampal function and organization. This cell type can synchronize neural activity in large populations of cells through its extensive axonal arborization. I propose to investigate the functional significance of this special type of neuron in using a wide variety of research tools. A better understanding of the normal and abnormal brain function may in time provide new and more specific treatments for epilepsies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001235","grantId":"G1001235","fundValue":"545067","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Attila  Sik","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
