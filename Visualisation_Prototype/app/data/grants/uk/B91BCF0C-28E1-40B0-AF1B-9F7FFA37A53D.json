{"id":"B91BCF0C-28E1-40B0-AF1B-9F7FFA37A53D","title":"Memory (Routledge New Critical Idioms)","abstractText":"Since the early 1990s there has been a remarkable growth and expansion in the field of 'memory studies', but there has to date been no attempt to define or assess the area of study or to situate it in the context of the development of ideas about memory. \\n\\nThe monograph Memory seeks, first of all, to identify the current field of study and to highlight the main areas and terms of debate. I examine why the surge of interest in memory arose when it did and how it defines our understanding of the term. Secondly, I seek to analyse the history of the use of the term, analysing in chronological order a range of key literary and theoretical texts in order to assess how the concept of memory has changed over time. I also draw attention to the persistent connection between memory and metaphors of writing or inscription, and question whether these images have shifted according to different conceptualisations of the term. Finally, I ask whether there is an interrelationship between individual and collective processes of remembering. The theorisation of 'collective memory' is often regarded as a twentieth-century innovation, emerging out of the work of Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora, among others. My critical investigation of earlier conceptions of memory might provide an articulation of a complex tradition of thinking in this area, and complicate the understanding of 'collective memory' as distinctive to thinking about memory from the latter half of the twentieth century onward.\\n\\nMemory has been contracted to be published with the Routledge New Critical Idioms series. I regard this as the most appropriate means of dissemination because its format is ideally suited to the questions with which I am concerned. The aim of the series is to provide specialists, university students and the general reader with accessible guides to ascendant areas of study and to focus on the historical development of individual critical terms. As such the proposed work will be of interest to a wider audience than an advanced academic one only. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004458/1","grantId":"AH/E004458/1","fundValue":"25467","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2008-01-23","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Whitehead","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
