Bulatov, a Senior Scientist at the Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratoy, to enable two visits covering a total of threemonths over a 15 month period. We propose a specific short project ofwork to study the competition between two atomic-scale mechanisms ofcross slip in FCC metals: the Freidel-Escaig and the Fleischermodels. This is an unresolved question in dislocation theory:what are the conditions that favour the one process over the other? In additon we anticipate a fruitful interaction between our twoinstitutions to develop from these visits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006527/1","grantId":"EP/F006527/1","fundValue":"13565","fundStart":"2007-05-28","fundEnd":"2008-08-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Thomas Paxton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
