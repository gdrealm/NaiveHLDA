However, little is known about by what age infants are able to integrate complex visual and auditory cues such as a dog and its barking sound.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to investigate the age at which infants develop this ability and the effect of this multisensory integration on category formation in infancy. Nine to twelve-month old infants will be shown animated 3D-stimuli of two novel animals each producing a characteristic novel animal-like sound. Infants’ ability to link visual and auditory cues will then be tested by showing eg the first animal making the sound of the second animal and using eye tracking to assess whether infants are surprised by this ‘mixed’ animal.</p>\n\n<p>In a second study we will investigate if infants’ formation of animal categories is affected by the sounds the animal make. We will compare (with eye tracking) how infants categorise a group of animals viewed in silence versus when viewed making sounds.</p>\n\n<p>This project will make important contributions to our understanding of the development of multisensory integration and the progressive build-up of knowledge in infancy.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I032584/2","grantId":"ES/I032584/2","fundValue":"61738","fundStart":"2011-09-26","fundEnd":"2012-07-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  For the time being our findings have been disseminated in the academic community.

We studied this ability by creating cartoons of novel animals that made novel sounds and testing 10- and 12-month-old infants on their ability to learn this mapping. We found that 12-month-olds, but not 10-month-olds, learned the mapping, suggesting that 12-month-olds can rapidly learn the link between visual and auditory properties of novel objects. This basic research could be of interest, e.g., to toy manufacturers who aim to design toys that are interesting for infants. A related interest might be for creators of tablet apps for young children. Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education","dataset":"gtr"}
