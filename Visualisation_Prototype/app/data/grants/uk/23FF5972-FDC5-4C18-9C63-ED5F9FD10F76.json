The work will use ships of opportunity (ships engaged in other activities, commercial or research) as platforms to collect aerosol samples in remote regions of the ocean. The results will allow us to estimate how important atmospheric supply of key nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron is to the productivity of the oceans, and how this may change in the future. 2. The work will look at what controls the cycling of the key nutrient nitrogen in the Northern North Sea and how this affects the productivity of phytoplankton which ultimately influences the production of fish.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F017359/1","grantId":"NE/F017359/1","fundValue":"460855","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This grant supported work on atmospheric inputs to the ocean and on nutrient cycling in the North Sea Environment ","person":"Timothy  Jickells","coPersons":["Alexander Roberts Baker"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
