The unique properties of nanoengineered materials cannot be determined by extrapolating the properties of bulk materials, and the development of new nanoscale materials, structures and devices can be restricted by not knowing how the materials behave in real-time (due to lack of suitable nanoscale instrumentation and dynamical test methods). Therefore to enhance existing and future research capabilities in new advanced materials, advancements in sophisticated nanoscale imaging, microscopy, metrology and in-situ characterisation methods are required.\n\nThe Basic Technology Nanorobotics programme has successfully developed new NanoLAB instrumentation to measure the properties of individual nanostructures in real-time and down to atomic resolution. By applying advanced nanorobotics instrumentation and 3D nanomanipulation inside electron microscopes, the behaviour of nanostructures can be imaged in-situ, and their structural, mechanical, electrical and surface properties directly measured. The ability to video the movement of individual nanoparticles and surfaces whilst in contact and interacting with one another (TEM tribology) is particularly exciting, and a significant step forward in the EPSRC priority area of characterisation of materials at the nanoscale.\n\nThe project NanoLAB technology has been applied across an interdisciplinary range of nanoengineered materials, structures, and devices. Key advancements include:\n\nNanoscale Friction: The NanoLAB TEM Triboprobe is a transformative technology, which enables for the first time real-time nanoscale imaging of friction during the repeated rubbing of surfaces. Energy loss and damage caused by friction at material contacts is an extremely important industrial problem, with macro-scale damage often the sum of multiple nanoscale events. TEM tribology is a new way to characterise energy transfer and surface change due to friction, and has successfully demonstrated new nanoscale phenomena including frictional transformation of nanoscale carbon to graphene/graphite, friction formation of nanoscale liquid droplets, and dynamical nanotribology of ultrahard coatings. (Collaborators: IISc, Tecvac)\n\n3D Behaviour of Nanoparticles: Many 3D advanced materials are now composites incorporating nanoparticles, including strengthened alloys, bionanocomposites, lubricants, and coatings. However the contribution of nanoparticles to strength, integrity and wear resistance is frequently unknown. In-situ NanoLAB testing has revealed the complex 3D behaviour of nanoparticles when subjected to mechanical and electrical forces. TEM Tribology has been used to quantify nanoparticle dynamics, including crushing nanoparticle clusters, observing the birth of nanoparticles by fracture of rubbed surfaces, and tracking the 3D-movement of nanoparticles trapped between surfaces. (Collaborators: Unilever, IISc).\n\nNanostructure stability: Applying NanoLAB electro-mechanical testing to nanostructures, we find that nanoengineered structures do not follow the behaviour of their macroscale counterparts. Successful developments include advanced structural testing of Si MEMS/NEMS components revealing enhanced flexibility of nanoscale bridges, electrical manipulation of nanocarbons with fabrication of novel nanoporous spheres, and electrical manipulation of nanovolumes of metal enabling a new concept for site-specific joining of electronic components by electrical deposition of nanoscale solder balls. (Collaborators: QinetiQ, HEF R&amp;amp;amp;D, Atomising Systems).\n\n3D Nanotomography: NanoLAB technologies have enabled the development of novel methods of 3D materials manipulation and 3D structural/chemical characterisation using electron tomography including 360? rotation tomography, and tomographic nanofabrication. These methods have benefitted a range of industrial sectors including nanopowder and nanocomposite manufacturers (Ceramisys, Fluidinova, Promethean Particle, QinetiQ NM, eminate ltd, Smith&amp;amp;amp;Nephew).\n\nThe Project grant has demonstrated the capability and potential of NanoLAB technologies across a wide range of applications, and also carried out investigations at the cutting edge of nanotechnology research to underpin future research programmes. Future exploitation will include the developing fields of nanobatteries/nanoenergy storage and green nanotribology. Nanostructured products now exist in many industrial sectors, and the new NanoLAB technologies can be applied to many interdisciplinary fields to determine the real-time functional, structural, chemical and tribological properties of interacting nanoobjects and surfaces. \n\nKey industrial beneficiaries (non-exhaustive list) include manufacturers of nanopowders and fibres, wear-resistant surface coatings companies, biomedical materials and implants (eg hip and knee joints), developers of MEMS/NEMS devices, and medical and electronic nanotools. Energy storage/batteries is also a strong growth area, where new nanosized components may offer much higher battery performance, but only if sufficient structural and property stability can be attained over battery lifetime. The design of novel low-friction materials, reducing energy loss, is also an exciting exploitation opportunity where NanoLAB technologies will be able to give unique insights into the friction behaviour of nanocontacts, sliding surfaces and lubricants.\n\nExploitation of the project research has already led to new projects supported by the Technology Strategy Board, the EU and Industry. Future projects will integrate industrial collaborations with the new Centres for Doctoral Training in Energy Storage, and Integrated Tribology, at The University of Sheffield.
