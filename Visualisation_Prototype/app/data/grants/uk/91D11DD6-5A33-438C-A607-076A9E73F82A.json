There is also some evidence that disadvantage increases among families with a disabled child.\nDisabled children and young people are at greater risk of being bullied than non-disabled children, and these greater risks cannot be fully accounted for by other risk factors. \nDisabled children have more behavioural problems at age 3 than non-disabled children, which can only partly be accounted for in terms of differences in family context. These difficulties, for most domains, tended to diverge from those of non-disabled children, between the ages of 3 and 7. \nDisabled children have lower scores in cognitive test on average at age 3. Compared to children with similar scores, at age 3, they make less progress by age 5. And compared to children with lower educational and cognitive scores at age 5 they make less progress by age 7. \nDisabled young people have less ambitious educational expectations relative to other children with similar Key Stage 2 scores and with parents with comparable educational levels. However, neither their lower educational expectations nor their earlier educational attainment explain their much lower chances of achieving 5 A*-C GCSEs at age 16. The findings have already been used in a Government Office of Science POSTnote on the Special Educational Needs (SEN) reforms. \nThey have also been shared widely among academic and policy and practitioner audiences.\nThey are being taking up by organisations addressing bullying among children and by organisations working with disabled children. They have potential to be of use to Educational Departments and may also be of value to parents of disabled children. Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
