We also conducted follow-up one-to-one interviews with 43 of them a year later.</p>\n\n<p>The findings provide a rich picture of young people’s sexual lives and the factors that influence them - including gender dynamics, coercion and other societal influences - that will be useful to educators and policymakers.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1756","grantId":"RES-062-23-1756","fundValue":"215964","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have contributed to theory and understanding of young people's sexual practices. We have spoken to numerous practitioners about our findings both formally via conferences and meetings and informally in other settings. Our findings have been covered in national and international media and have reached the public. Members of the public have contacted us directly to us to discuss our work, and have provided commentary on the work via BBC radio 4 and on numerous internet sites. This has particularly been the case for our work on coercive sexual activity and we hope to continue these conversations in future.
