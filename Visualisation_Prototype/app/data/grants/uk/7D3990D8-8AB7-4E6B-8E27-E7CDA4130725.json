A range of converging methods will be used, including fMRI to establish the neural underpinnings of these representations, eye tracking to establish the behavioral consequences of the interference postulated to occur with such representations, and the Speed Accuracy Tradeoff (SAT) task to explore the consequences of such interference on the time-course of activation of such representations. The work lays the foundation for a novel understanding of both normal and disordered language and cognitive development (in which the ability to keep apart different representations of the same object is essential), and will further our understanding of how brain maturation controls such development.<br /><br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I000739/1","grantId":"ES/I000739/1","fundValue":"595844","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerry  Altmann","coPersons":["Yuki  Kamide"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
