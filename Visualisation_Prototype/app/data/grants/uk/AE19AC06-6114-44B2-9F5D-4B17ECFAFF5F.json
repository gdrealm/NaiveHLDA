{"id":"AE19AC06-6114-44B2-9F5D-4B17ECFAFF5F","title":"Phase II WIMRC","abstractText":"The Warwick IMRC will be active in two focus sectors as followsIntelligent and Eco-Friendly VehiclesThe future of road transport will undoubtedly require vehicles to become more intelligent. This will reduce accidents, improve infrastructure utilisation thereby reducing congestion and minimise environmental impact through more efficient vehicle dynamics. The application of intelligence will allow major changes to the construction of vehicles and the reduction of unladen weight since structures to absorb impact damage will become redundant if collision avoidance systems are implemented. The research will investigate the impact on vehicle design, the technologies required, changes in manufacturing processes, final test implications and vehicle maintenance and upgrade throughout the product lifetime. In addition aspects of the driver -vehicle interface will be researched to minimise the impact on driver satisfaction . The work will also encompass aerospace applications in areas such as autonomous planes for military and commercial use.Lean HealthcareA major challenge for the healthcare industry is to deliver high quality care at the time of need at minimum cost and with maximum customer/supplier (patient/healthcare practitioner) satisfaction. There are many challenges that can be addressed through the application of design, technology and management processes. Many of the lessons learnt in other industries can be adapted to address these challenges and in particular the successes in lean manufacturing are especially relevant. Projects in this area will include hospital based initiatives such as robotically assisted surgery, primary care research in health centres and doctors surgeries, remote diagnostic systems applicable to the long-term ill living at home and the application of best practice in new product introduction to improve the roll-out and acceptance of innovation in the healthcare industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E002773/1","grantId":"EP/E002773/1","fundValue":"8038190","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ken  Young","coPersons":["Vinesh Haridas Raja","Craig  Chapman","Richard Peter  Jones","John Duncan Garside","Peter  Bryanston-Cross","Gregory John Gibbons","Stewart  Robinson","Paul Anthony  Jennings","Gordon  Smith"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
