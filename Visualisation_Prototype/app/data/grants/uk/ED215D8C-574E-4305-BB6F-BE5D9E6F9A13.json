However, in recent research we found that emotional feelings can change people's moral judgments (Schnall, Haidt, Clore &amp; Jordan, 2007). In addition, we observed that such influences are especially pronounced for people who are generally sensitive to their own bodily cues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with the notion that disgust constitutes a powerful &quot;gut feeling&quot;, and as such, influences cognitive processes (eg Damasio, 1994; Haidt, 2001). The proposed research will expand on this work, and take it in new directions. In particular, the following research questions will be&nbsp;investigated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>To what extent do contextual manipulations influence &quot;embodied&quot; moral judgments?&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>How do moral norms emerge in &quot;disembodied&quot;&nbsp;virtual contexts?&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>To address the latter question, novel methods will be used involving virtual reality and newly emerging virtual online communities, such as Second Life. Thus, in addition to investigating substantive theoretical questions, the project will afford the opportunity to explore the extent to which recent technological advances can be utilized in psychological research.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F001231/1","grantId":"ES/F001231/1","fundValue":"207518","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Schnall, Haidt, Clore &amp; Jordan (2008) was the most direct demonstration that physical disgust causally shapes moral disgust, by making moral judgments more severe. According to Google Scholar it has been cited 547 times, with many researchers replicating and extending my findings. It was the most-cited paper in this journal between 2007 and 2013, and is the 18th most cited paper in the history of this journal. \n\nSimilarly, Schnall, Benton &amp; Harvey (2008) showed the opposite influence, namely that physical cleanliness makes moral judgments less severe, and this paper has been cited 213 times. There is now a highly consistent literature showing the link between physical and moral disgust, which has been summarized in comprehensive review papers (e.g., Chapman &amp; Anderson, 2013).

The following findings stand out as having already resulted in significant impact: \n\n1. Disgust makes moral judgments more severe (Schnall, Haidt, Clore &amp;amp; Jordan, 2008, PSPB). \n\nFindings from several experiments suggest that people conflate experiences of physical and moral disgust. In other words, a sense of &quot;that's disgusting!&quot; is interpreted to be indicative of moral rejection when in fact the feeling was actually based on the irrelevant bad smell, or the dirty environment surrounding the person while making the judgment. Thus, people do not always use reasoning when arriving at moral judgments. \n\n2. Cleanliness makes moral judgments less severe (Schnall, Benton &amp;amp; Harvey, 2008, Psychological Science). \n\nOn the flip side of disgust, additional support for the moral intuition of purity has come from studies manipulating physical purity and looking at the effect on morality, and these studies show that people somehow equate physical purity with mental and spiritual purity. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1), or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The findings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes rather than reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity. \n\n3. Moral elevation leads to increased helping behaviour (Schnall, Roper &amp;amp; Fessler, 2010, Psychological Science). \n\nFeelings of elevation, elicited by witnessing another person perform a good deed, have been hypothesized to motivate a desire to help others. In Experiment 1, participants experiencing elevation were more likely to volunteer for a subsequent unpaid study than were participants in a neutral state. In Experiment 2, participants experiencing elevation spent approximately twice as long helping the experimenter with a tedious task as participants experiencing mirth or a neutral emotional state. Further, feelings of elevation, but not feelings of amusement or happiness, predicted the amount of helping. Together, these results provide evidence that witnessing another person's altruistic behavior elicits elevation, a discrete emotion that, in turn, leads to tangible increases in altruism.\n\n4. Facial expressions measured by EMG predict moral judgments (Cannon, Schnall &amp;amp; White, 2011, SPPS). \n\nWe recorded the facial muscle activity relating to disgust and anger while participants considered third-person statements describing good and bad behaviors across a range of moral domains. Facial disgust was highest in response to purity violations, followed by fairness violations. In contrast, harm violations evoked anger expressions. Furthermore, the amount of facial muscle activity predicted participants' moral judgments: Perceived severity of purity and fairness transgressions correlated with facial disgust, whereas harm transgressions correlated with facial anger. These findings suggest that people automatically show a quick emotional response when exposed to moral offenses, which in turn relates to their explicit moral judgments. My findings have been described in textbooks (e.g., McBride, 2012; Music, 2014; Miner, 2011; Newton, 2014) and science books targeted at general audiences (e.g., Cummins, 2012; Gill, 2014; Goldman, 2013; Hall, 2010; Haslam, 2012; Lobel, 2014; Jones, 2013; Joy, 2010; Prinz, 2007, Tessman, 2015; Wielenberg, 2014; Wiseman, 2012).
