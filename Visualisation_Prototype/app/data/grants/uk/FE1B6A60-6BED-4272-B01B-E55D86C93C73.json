The ultimate aim of this project is to develop a tidal farm design tool that produces trustworthy results while requiring a level of computing power that is appropriate to industrial design. Once developed, the model can be extended towards analysis of sediment transport and thus can be used to understand the effect of large farms on the marine environment, which will be a key area of concern to stakeholders in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M019896/1","grantId":"EP/M019896/1","fundValue":"99382","fundStart":"2014-10-07","fundEnd":"2015-07-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna Mollie Young","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
