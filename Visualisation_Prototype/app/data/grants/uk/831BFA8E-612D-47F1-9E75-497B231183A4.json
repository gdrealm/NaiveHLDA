These structures, or vortices, exist over a wide range of spatial scales and generally at huge Reynolds numbers. Vortices are conspicuous features of planetary atmospheres in general, and they are believed to play a central role in shaping planetary-scale circulations. Their interactions can be extraordinarily complex, and to this day we have virtually no understanding how these interactions contribute toward the collective motion of the atmosphere and the oceans as a whole. The main objectives of this proposal is to provide a complete description of vortex stability and vortex interactions in geophysical flows.The planetary rotation is important when its associated vorticity is comparable to or larger than the relative vertical vorticity. This can be expressed by saying that the Rossby number Ro, the ratio of relative to planetary vorticity, is small compared to 1. On the other hand, the stratification is important when the buoyancy frequency is larger than the horizontal vorticity. Likewise this can be expressed by saying that the Froude number Fr, the ratio of horizontal vorticity to buoyancy frequency, is small. When the Froude number is smaller than or comparable to the Rossby number, itself small, the system of governing equation can be greatly simplified. Then, the flow is well modelled by the `quasi-geostrophic' (QG) equations. The QG model has enabled a comprehensive exploration of basic vortex dynamics, from isolated vortex equilibria and stability to 3D QG turbulence. We now understand why vortices in the QG model tend to be robust, how they react to external shear and strain, what precipitates strong interactions between both like-signed and opposite-signed vortices (potential vorticity anomalies), as well as general properties of vortex populations in turbulence. The important question is: how well do these results apply to finite Ro and Fr? Or, how are the QG results altered when using the full equations of motion? We intend to answer these fundamental questions.When Ro and Fr are not small, two new features arise. The first is the appearance of Inertia-Gravity Waves (IGWs) at super-inertial frequencies, i.e. at frequencies larger than those associated with the vortical motion. The IGWs often induce weak motions compared to those induced by the vortices, and therefore IGWs tend to be of secondary importance in many circumstances. Another feature arising from finite Ro and Fr is the added contribution of ageostrophic motions, which are missing in the QG model. Ageostrophic motions differ from the high frequency IGWs in that they are directly associated with vortices: they are generated in response to the instantaneous potential vorticity (PV) distribution and have a direct advective effect on the PV evolution. The retention of ageostrophic motion thus has a significant impact on the flow and implies potentially large departures from QG dynamics. It is this important difference between the full equations and the QG approximation that underlies the proposed work. We aim to understand and quantify these effects on vortex motions and vortex stability properties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H001794/1","grantId":"EP/H001794/1","fundValue":"313443","fundStart":"2010-01-05","fundEnd":"2013-11-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This gives a summary of the impact this grant has had or is expected to have.\n\nA very basic problem in the dynamics of the atmosphere and the oceans (and other planetary atmospheres) concerns the nature of coherent spinning masses of fluid such as cyclones, in particular their generic structure, stability and interactions with other fluid masses. In a much simpler context, this problem dates to the middle of the 19th century. However, only at the beginning of the 20th century did scientists begin to understand the effects of planetary rotation and stable stratification (density decreasing with height) on the fluid motions observed in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. And, not until the end of the 20th century did scientists begin to understand the dynamics of these coherent spinning masses of fluid - what we call vortices. These dynamics are complicated by the fact that the underlying fluid dynamical system in nonlinear, and moreover represents a continuum of fluid particles. Just how molecules at extremely small scales manage to coordinate their motions to produce coherent structures at planetary scales is a fascinating and currently unsolved problem. Yet, it is widely observed that the natural state of a fluid is to have structure: vortices, fronts in weather, currents, eddies in the oceans. Vortices exist at all scales, and remain under the control of planetary rotation and stratification down to scales of a few kilometres. This project set out to determine the conditions under which vortices remain under the control of rotation and stratification. The project built on classical results (only dating to the 1980s!) obtained in the limit of fast rotation and strong stratification. These results were used as a base to explore realistic flows for which rotation and stratification have less influence. This is a hard problem. We exploited a breakthrough in computational model which enabled us to explore the nature of vortex dynamics under very widely varying conditions. This, coupled with new theoretical analyses of the flow structure within vortices revealed the key features affecting vortex stability. As such, the fundamental nature of this research is likely to have a strong impact on the academic community's basic understanding of nonlinear fluid motion in geophysical flows. Moreover, our findings can be used to better interpret the behaviour of observed geophysical vortices. Lastly, the computational modelling advances may lead to practical improvements in weather forecasting, ocean and climate modelling.\n\nBeneficiaries: Academic community, practical researchers involved in weather forecasting, ocean modelling and climate modelling, postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in this wide research area\n\nContribution Method: A great deal of effort was spent on dissemination activities at all levels, from publishing peer-reviewed scientific papers, to presenting our research findings to international audiences of experts, to summer schools aimed at educating postgraduate students and early-career researchers, to public lectures aimed at general audiences, and to running science fairs to engage with members of the public. This we not only enjoyed but regarded as essential to communicating science at all levels, and to inspiring new researchers and new research. Most of our research is of a very fundamental nature - almost textbook material in years to come - and has deeply explored areas which were hitherto inaccessible due to limitations in both computational and mathematical tools. We have extended the frontier of research considerably by providing a comprehensive, detailed picture of the nature of geophysical vortices. While our approach has been idealised, it is this idealisation which has allowed us to be comprehensive and thereby reach a much more complete understanding of geophysical vortex dynamics than ever before. Our research is not over. The project naturally leads to other interesting and important questions, and in this sense the project will contribute for years to come in our quest to understand why structure emerges and persists in geophysical flows. We feel that we have interested a wide range of communities in our research, from the general public to fellow colleagues. We have sought to work with other colleagues to widen the impact of our research. For example, this research has inspired new work exploring the effects of a magnetic field on vortex motion (thought to be important in the Sun's interior), and how self-organisation in fluids takes place in general. More practically, we frequently discuss advances we have made in computational modelling with communities developing the next generation weather and ocean forecasting models, and we firmly believe (based on careful scientific tests) that the computational methods we have developed - in part through this grant - can lead to much greater efficiencies in modelling than currently possible. We are currently extending our computational modelling approach to more practical situations, and we hope to engage the modelling community more strongly in the future.

This is a complex problem depending not only on the shape of the vortex (governed by two parameters) but also on the strength of the vortex in relation to the background rotating flow. We have clearly identified the physical mechanisms responsible for instability and demonstrated that cyclones (spinning with the Earth) are more stable than anticyclones. This is a consequence of the internal stratification and vorticity structure of the vortices.\n\n\n\nAnother key result has come out of studying two-dimensional shallow-water flows, relevant to parts of the atmosphere and oceans. As in the above study, we have computed novel solutions for nearly steady vortices, both isolated and binary systems of generally unequal size. We introduced the term &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; to describe vortices which are steady for all practical purposes, as they radiate negligible gravity waves over any sensible time period. This paradigm has allowed us to comprehensively map the behaviour of vortices in shallow-water flows for the first time.\n\n\n\nIn an ongoing study with Prof M Oliver (Bremen) and G Gottwald (Sydney), we have developed a novel Lagrangian balanced model enabling one to better understand, theoretically, the nature of &quot;balance&quot;, that is the degree to which a single scalar field (potential vorticity) can induce all dynamical and thermodynamical fields (velocity, pressure, density, etc). For general flows, this is not possible, but rapidly rotating and strongly stratified flows exhibit a strong degree of balance. Our work represents a highly novel approach to generating balanced approximations to the dynamics, approximations that go far beyond those traditionally used. Our approach is mathematically rigorous and as a result guarantees all the conservation properties of the &quot;parent&quot; dynamical model. The key idea is to view balance as a near identity transformation of the &quot;flow map&quot; that automatically filters fast (unbalanced) gravity waves. The approach to balance, in particular, may find application to industry, for instance in image processing where one may wish to retain certain desireable properties in a mathematically rigorous manner. This research is of fundamental interest to researchers studying the dynamics of geophysical flows. It is an important, long-missing addition to our knowledge of nonlinear dynamical processes, and as such creates a solid base on which to develop further understanding of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. The new solutions we have found and the results obtained are likely to be used by other researchers in related contexts, e.g. as tests for new theories or new\n\ncomputational approaches. Our results are also important for basic education in the field; little is known about vortex dynamics due to its inherent nonlinear character compared with, for example, wave theories, where much of the research can be done analytically and much more simply. It is important, we believe, to present a more balanced view, incorporating in particular the one aspect that makes fluid dynamics challenging: nonlinearity. Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
