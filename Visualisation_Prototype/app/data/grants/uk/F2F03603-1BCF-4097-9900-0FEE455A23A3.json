{"id":"F2F03603-1BCF-4097-9900-0FEE455A23A3","title":"Leukaemia Trial Service Unit Special Project Grant","abstractText":"Although there have been substantial overall advances in the understanding and treatment of leukaemia, these large improvements have generally been achieved by a series of relatively small steps, each involving only a moderate survival gain. New treatments do not, however, always improve survival and large randomised trials are needed to compare new treatments with current standard treatment in order to determine whether there is further benefit. Meta-analyses of such trials, where all the worldwide data is brought together, help to establish the size of any benefits, and can be used to explore whether there are patients with particular characteristics (for instance older versus younger), or with particular types of disease, which benefit more than others. In addition, where the meta-analysis is based on updated (often unpublished) follow-up information on each randomized patient, the long term effects of treatment can be investigated reliably. This allows patients and doctors to make informed treatment decisions that weigh up benefits against side effects.\n\nSome types of leukaemia still have a relatively poor outlook, and very intensive treatments are being tested and new drugs sought for them. Some treatments, such as bone marrow transplant from a related donor, have a high risk associated with them, but if they are shown in proper trials to be effective they may offer long term survival to some patients who would otherwise have died. Conversely, the outlook for the most common type of childhood leukaemia has improved so much that the chances of being alive and free of disease long term are now over 75%, and we need to separate children with a high risk of relapse, who may benefit from more intensive treatments, from those with a low risk of relapse, where it may be possible to minimise side effects by reducing treatment. New laboratory techniques are helping to identify relevant risk groups, but national coordination is needed to address these questions in an appropriately large trial.\n\nCTSU has already provided definite information about the effects of certain treatments, and that information is now incorporated into clinical decision making. This application is for funding of currently running trials, for further meta-analyses, for the development of new trials and for getting rapid recruitment as soon as any trials receive MRC approval.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8223452","grantId":"G8223452","fundValue":"8601530","fundStart":"1983-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Peto","coPersons":["Mike  Clarke","Keith  Wheatley"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
