{"id":"3ABDFE70-4B3F-40C9-A733-4D3172DD8D7B","title":"Viewing Campaigns from the Candidate's Perspective: The 2007 Finnish General Election","abstractText":"<p>This research will use a standardised mail survey and selected interviews to gain a candidate's perspective on the 2007 Finnish general election. The project forms part of an international Comparative Candidate Survey and will target both the successful and unsuccessful candidates of those parties gaining parliamentary representation (n=1879). </p>\n\n<p>There are three research questions. </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>What sort of campaigns do candidates run? </li>\n\n <li>How individualised is the campaign in its organisation, funding and issue-identity? </li>\n\n <li>Do candidates run personalised campaigns distinct from their party? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The theoretical starting point is the 'individualisation hypothesis' which holds that party identification has declined, enabling individual candidates to have a greater effect on election outcomes. In Finland voters are obliged to vote for a candidate who then competes with others on the same party list, as well as those from other parties. The 'digitalisation' of elections, moreover, appears to have accentuated the individualisation of campaigning. The working hypothesis is that although party nominees, candidates do not campaign primarily as 'partisans' and are not expected to do so.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2376","grantId":"RES-000-22-2376","fundValue":"43178","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Arter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
