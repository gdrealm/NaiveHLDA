This seminar series aims to highlight more hidden aspects: citizenship as action or performance, and through that idea of the ‘good citizen’. From citizenship ceremonies, education, and consumption, to debates about corporate social responsibility, we are witnessing a wide and prominent array of practices which carry ideas about who good citizens are, and what they can and should do.</p>\n\n<p>To bring debates about the good citizen into the open, we will explore systematically the behaviour that the good citizen might be expected to display, and the knowledges that he or she might be expected to possess or acquire. A range of contexts will be discussed over a number of linked seminars, including</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Ethical and policy visions of the good citizen;</li>\n\n <li>Cosmopolitan versus local outlooks;</li>\n\n <li>Citizen capabilities, education and consumption;</li>\n\n <li>Corporate citizenship;</li>\n\n <li>Methodologies for researching good citizenship.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Participants will include national and local government policy-makers, political philosophers and policy-oriented academic writers, NGOs, corporate representatives, and policy advisors and think tanks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4039","grantId":"RES-451-25-4039","fundValue":"13441","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  DobsonMichael  Saward","coPersons":["A  Shaefer"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
