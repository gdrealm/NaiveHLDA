{"id":"2B4410FB-73B5-4610-BC5F-7F9DDFC43220","title":"Improving cyber security using realistic synthetic face generation","abstractText":"The grant application outlines a novel programme of research that questions the uniqueness of facial identity and investigates the use of computer generated face imagery in the area of cyber security.The popularity of the human face as a biometric remains strong despite the introduction of many competing modalities. People are accustomed to being identified by their facial appearance whereas other biometrics such as fingerprints and iris recognition feel more invasive. A programme of research that investigates the concept of identity that is highly relevant to cyber security is proposed. In addition we will develop a novel cyber security application based on facial identity and evaluate its practical security level. Work of this nature has relevance beyond the scope of the project. For example, border control officers routinely verify a person's identity using passport photos but what is the fundamental limit on the ability to achieve this task reliably?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M013375/1","grantId":"EP/M013375/1","fundValue":"155087","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Gibson","coPersons":["Christopher John Solomon","Julio Cesar  Hernandez-Castro"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
