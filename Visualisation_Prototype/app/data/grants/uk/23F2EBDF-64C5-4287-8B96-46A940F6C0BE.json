{"id":"23F2EBDF-64C5-4287-8B96-46A940F6C0BE","title":"Medieval Latin Dictionary","abstractText":"The Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources is a unique work of historical reference, based upon the largest corpus of named authors and the largest archive of literary, archival, and epigraphic sources anywhere in Europe. It covers not only the usages of the Classical Latin and Late Latin periods (from the beginnings to AD 200 and 200-600), but the entire period of the Middle Ages: the 1100 years from the sixth century to the sixteenth. It records in the standard format of the Oxford English Dictionary and the Oxford Latin Dictionary head-words, etymologies, definitions, and quotations that illustrate usage, documenting a complete range from high literary to archival and even demotic registers, incorporating words borrowed from a uniquely wide variety of other languages / Greek, Semitic, Celtic, Germanic, and Romance. As the Dictionary often illustrates use in Latin of vernacular words hundreds of years before their recorded use in vernacular texts, the work is essential to the study of medieval and modern languages and literatures as well as the long history of Latin. Even before its completion the Dictionary has established itself as pre-eminent, with widely acknowledged usefulness to students of language, literature, history, philosophy, genealogy, music, art and architecture, numismatics, onomastics, topography, and to editors and translators of texts. \\n\\nIts completion by 2011 by a combination of AHRC and Packard Humanities Institute funding will be an achievement of international importance. The Dictionary will be able to cover specific British vocabularies not dealt with in other editions. It will serve as primary and essential reference volume to the academy.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F010311/1","grantId":"AH/F010311/1","fundValue":"604806","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Medieval Latin Dictionary from British Sources is a crucial resource for anyone conducting research in (not just British) medieval studies. Since it is a basic reference work intended to cover a period of approximately a millenium, anyone who wishes to study literary works, documents of any kind, and inscriptions written in Latin during the relevant period will find it a useful and at times indispensable resource. The planned digitisation of the project (in two formats, one of which will be free at the point of use) will significantly increase its reach.

Work on the final fascicule beyond no. 16 is ongoing. Concurrently we are preparing for the digitisation of the dictionary, which will be undertaken once the printed dictionary is completed. The printed dictionary is expected to be completed by the end of March 2014, and final steps towards digitisation, notably the design of a web interface, will then be undertaken and, we anticipate, paid for by PHI (see below). The second major funder of this project, the Packard Humanities Institute, is committed to making the dictionary available online. Given the stated intentions of PHI, I would assume this to take the form of an open access version of the dictionary available to everyone. It is of course a Latin-to-English dictionary, but the hope is that everyone with an interest in the history of the British Isles during the medieval period, be it a scholar or a member of the public, will be able to benefit from the online resource.
