{"id":"C9137324-1C69-4F33-9524-9A042EEF0EF0","title":"Transcostal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Cancer","abstractText":"The efficacy of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the non-invasive treatment of cancer has been clearly demonstrated for a range of different cancers including those of the liver, prostate and breast. As a non-invasive focal therapy, HIFU offers considerable advantages over other techniques such as chemotherapy and surgery, in terms of invasiveness and risk of harmful side-effects. Despite its advantages, however, there are a number of significant challenges currently hindering its widespread clinical application, specifically: the need to transmit energy through the rib cage and the associated risk of skin burns and damage to the rib surface, the effects of organ motion on treatment accuracy, a poor understanding of cavitation processes in vivo and, finally, the lack of effective techniques for real-time image guidance and treatment monitoring. The overall objective of the research programme described in this document is to develop practical solutions for these issues. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a prototype clinical device for the safe and effective HIFU treatment of tumours of the liver, kidney and pancreas that has undergone preclinical testing and conforms to the necessary safety standards for patient use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F029217/1","grantId":"EP/F029217/1","fundValue":"2183150","fundStart":"2008-08-04","fundEnd":"2013-12-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Publications have been cited by others  ","person":"Gail Reinette Ter Haar","coPersons":["Ian Henry Rivens"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":" In this project, which follows on from GR/s64042, we have designed a 256 element therapeutic ultrasound transducer optimised for the delivery of ablative energy to liver tumours through the rib cage - which has previously been a major obstacle. In order to drive such a device we have collaborated with a commercial company to produce a 256 channel drive system which also has the capability to receive information on 128 of the channels during the delivery of treatment in order to both plan and monitor An objective of this project is to produce medical demonstrator equipment for future clinical work. This project is ongoing, but the intention is to find a commercial partner for this device, or create a start-up. As yet, the best way of doing this is not clear.
