Thus, our population is ageing at a rapid rate and so all of the problems outlined above become more pressing.\n\nThere has been much progress in the field of biomaterials in attempts to produce materials for bone therapies to address some of these problems. However, ideal solutions continue to evade us.\n\nIn Nature, living systems produce mineral structures like bones, teeth and shells by bringing together organic and inorganic materials. Engineers have clever tools such as microfluidics that enable reactions to be carried out on a minute scale. \n\nThis project aims to test whether or not microfluidics can be used to produce organic fibres with mineral associated (just like in Nature). The mineral-fibre complex could then be used as a temporary scaffold that would encourage the body to produce new bone, thus forming the ultimate bone therapy material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021083/1","grantId":"BB/J021083/1","fundValue":"120405","fundStart":"2013-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-07-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings have not been used outside academic research although presented at conference to disseminate knowledge more widely Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Maggie  Cusack","coPersons":["Huabing  Yin","Matthew John Dalby"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" The overall objective is to determine the feasibility of using microfluidics to prepare organic fibres in combination with inorganic materials as a potential bone replacement therapy.\n\nSpecifically, the three related work packages aimed to determine the following key aspects:\n1. the conditions required for tuneable control of nucleation of biomineral during fibre formation in microfluidics\n2. the strength and degradability of the fibre composites \n3. the response of mesenchymal stem cells to the composite fibres \n\nWe used microfluidics to successfully spin out fibres and we introduced bubbles, controlling size and spacing, investigating the material properties of the fibres and the cellular response to the different part of these structures. By using microbubbles, we created highly porous fibre scaffolds that allowed modulations in regions of stiffness that promoted cells to adhere and proliferate upon the surface. Others could develop more complex fibre structures with tuneable responses for novel bone therapies Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
