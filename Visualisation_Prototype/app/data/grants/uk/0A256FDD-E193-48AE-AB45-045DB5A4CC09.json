{"id":"0A256FDD-E193-48AE-AB45-045DB5A4CC09","title":"Lost Legacies and a Living Past","abstractText":"'Lost Legacies and a Living Past' is a research network which brings to contemporary attention the remarkable world of medieval science. The network exists to bring together medieval specialists and modern scientists, to create new ways to bring to life the breath-taking scope of medieval thinking on the world, the universe, and the place of man within creation. Putting medievalists and modern scientists together to re-examine medieval scientific texts reminds modern science of its deeper roots, and that a scientific approach to the world around us is older than the recent western scientific tradition suggests. In the Middle Ages the distinction between humanities and science did not exist; both formed part of the same intellectual culture. For medievalists, studying medieval scientific texts afresh alongside modern scientists offers opportunities to reflect on the process of interpretation, translation and presentation, and to confront modern scientific methodologies. The network aims to create the circumstances in which research communities both in humanities and in science can speak to each other, and together unpack the way in which medieval thinkers conceived their world. \n More than this, however, the network will take the research on medieval science into the classroom. Educationalists and school teachers focused on science learning at secondary school level will form an integral part of the network. In so doing, further questions will be asked about how the research between medievalists and modern scientists can be shaped for the secondary school curriculum, and help to offer a fuller sense of the history of science. Secondary school history of science starts in its present form with the 17th century. 'Lost Legacies and a Living Past' will open a debate on how to present the importance of the deeper past within the school science curriculum and the benefit of engaging the education communities with research communities. In so doing, the network aims to engage with wider public debate on the nature of science and the role of the past in defining the present and inspiring the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003658/1","grantId":"AH/K003658/1","fundValue":"35112","fundStart":"2013-02-17","fundEnd":"2014-06-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We have been working with schoolteachers, and the Pembroke College Access scheme to use material generated from our research project to inspire sixth form discussion about the longer cultural roots of science.
