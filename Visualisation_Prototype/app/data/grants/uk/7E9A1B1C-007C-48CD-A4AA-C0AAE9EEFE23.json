By selecting a range of well and lesser known figures this book illuminates the ways in which they attempted to represent themselves within discourses of civility and morality, while engaging in slavery. I offer a focused and original examination of selfhood in the context of slavery by examining the various genres in which theses figures wrote. I argue that their texts demand close reading that relates them to other contemporary discourses. I focus on the category of the self as a site, exploring the ways in which its articulation intersected with and drew upon other discursive formulations in the areas of philosophy, religion and fiction. In my approach to selfhood I draw upon the work of Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha among others. Throughout, the aim of my project is to highlight the relational, contextual and shifting nature of identity in slavery. We may be used to discussing the identity of the oppressed, marginal and colonised in terms that reject essentialist models of identity: I argue that the figure of the archetypal colonial master, the slave trader, must also be discussed as contingent and fluid. A main objective of my research, then, is to challenge an 'authentic' politics of identity. \\n\\nMy work can be seen as offering both additional and alternative arguments to those proposed in recent high-profile and influential publications, namely Marcus Wood's 'Slavery, Empathy and Pornography' (OUP), Srinivas Aravamudan's 'Tropicopolitans' (Duke UP) and Debbie Lee's 'Slavery and the Romantic Imagination' (Pennsylvania UP). I see my research as an important contribution to a current, lively debate that has a wide appeal to scholars and students of the long eighteenth century. Most importantly, my book offers extended close reading of substantial archival material, relevant to these slave masters, that has not yet been fully considered. My conclusions expose the fault lines between and within the discourses surrounding slavery. In this work an understanding of how slavery was possible, is deepened. \\n\\nEmerging from this research activity is an article, 'Beauty and the Breast: Ideals of Beauty and Economies of Sexuality on Slave Voyages' which I have presented as a conference paper at the MLA 2005. It comprises material that my main research project has generated but is an offshoot from the monograph itself. In this piece I discuss moments from slave traders' poems, letters and journals in which they select and describe slave women according to their breast shape. I argue that in these moments aesthetic ideals combine with economies of sexuality to dictate the fate of slave women who are both potential concubines to slave masters as well as the 'producers' of more slaves. I conclude that the breast in slavery is a site where we can read the competing forces of sexual and commercial desire juxtaposed with anxiety and unease about mastery and colonial proprietorship. \\n\\nThe findings of the project will be useful to scholars and students researching slavery, eighteenth-century identity and different modes of colonial writing. It will enhance their understanding of the relationships within slavery and will therefore be relevant to courses and modules that focus on these areas. Lay people will also find the figures discussed in my research of interest, especially as dissemination of the research co-incides with the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000673/1","grantId":"AH/E000673/1","fundValue":"20913","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerry Eleanor Sinanan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
