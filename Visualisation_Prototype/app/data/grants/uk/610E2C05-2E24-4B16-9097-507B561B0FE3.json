His knowledge, experience and interests are strongly aligned with those of the nanoscale ferroelectrics group in Queen's University Belfast (QUB), and his stay in QUB should be extremely useful both in terms of helping to accelerate progress in ongoing research, and in terms of performing preliminary work for potential future collaborative programmes. During his visit, we wish to pursue three themes of common interest:(i) PFM imaging of domain configurations in ferroelectric nanoshapes (contributing to a current EPSRC-funded programme: EP/F004869/1 Investigating the fabrication and dipole characteristics of complex ferroelectric nanoshapes );(ii) Modification of the PFM system at QUB to allow dynamical studies of switching in ferroelectric nanoshapes;(iii) Preliminary exploration of potential flexoelectric polarisation nanodevices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H04339X/1","grantId":"EP/H04339X/1","fundValue":"16812","fundStart":"2011-03-06","fundEnd":"2011-07-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"J M  Gregg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" The key outcome of this project was that Nagy Valanoor spent several months in Belfast helping with the piezoresponse force microscopy of PZN-PT single crystals and transfering his expertise. Using techniques that he shared with the research team in QUB, self-similar nested flux-closure objects were found around the edges of thin PZN-PT crystals. Results and insights were published in Nano Letters in 2013 and JAP in 2014. The focus of this project was to transfer knowledge and expertise from UNSW to QUB and to perform a specific study on domains. Complex flux-closure patterns were discovered which are the precursors of ferroelectric vortices, the toroidal moment of which has been cited as a potentially revolutionary binary memory technology (but has not to date been experimentally observed). None in a commercial sense, but the project funding has allowed an ongoing research collaboration with Nagy to develop which should lead to further science and potential applications in the future.
