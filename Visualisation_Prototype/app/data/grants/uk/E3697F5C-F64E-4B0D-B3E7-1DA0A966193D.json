{"id":"E3697F5C-F64E-4B0D-B3E7-1DA0A966193D","title":"Plasmon-Enhanced Chiroptical Biosensors","abstractText":"Polarimetry has been used for over two hundred years to detect and characterise inherently chiral biomolecules and\nbiomaterials. In this proposal we will use a 21st century &quot;re-boot&quot; of polarimetry, which uses chiral evanescent\nelectromagnetic fields produced by chiral plasmonic nanostructures instead of circularly polarised light, to achieve (sub)\npicogram detection / characterisation of an analyte. We will develop biosensors that use plasmon-enhanced polarimetry,\nsuperpolarimetry, to both transduce binding events and provide structural information on the bound analyte. These sensors\nwill provide label-free detection of analytes, and will be applied in an array-based format to the analysis of complex biofluids\nwhile providing fundamental information on nanoscale chiroptical phenomena.\n\nThe vision at the heart of our research is the creation of a new sensor platform based on plasmon-enhanced chiroptical\neffects. In addition to this goal, we expect that we will obtain fundamental advances in the understanding of chiroptical\nbehavior. In the course of our research we will develop new high-throughput methods to fabricate sensors, opening up\npotential real-world applications of superpolarimetry. Taken together, our expectation is that the proposed research will\nprovide the foundational research required to bridge the gap between fundamental discovery and a widely useable sensor\nplatform.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K034936/1","grantId":"EP/K034936/1","fundValue":"779670","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"M  Kadodwala","coPersons":["Graeme  Cooke","Nikolaj  Gadegaard"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
