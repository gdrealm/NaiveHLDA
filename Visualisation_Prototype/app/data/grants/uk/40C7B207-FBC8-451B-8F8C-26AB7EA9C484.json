{"id":"40C7B207-FBC8-451B-8F8C-26AB7EA9C484","title":"13-NSFABI: Arabidopsis Information Portal","abstractText":"For over a decade, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) has served as a data and analysis resource for a community of thousands of Arabidopsis and other plant species' researchers.\n\nSupported by a Research Coordination Network grant, IAIC-sponsored meetings and workshops produced a concept for a new Arabidopsis Information Portal (AIP).\n\nThis new resource portal is envisaged as a mechanism to bring together the ever-increasing amounts of Arabidopsis data into a single, user-friendly location using the latest web technologies and web services.\n\nIt will adopt a modular, federated development model which ensures that responsibility for generation and maintenance of valuable data to remains in the hands of the individual data providers and spreads the burden of supporting such resources across a potentially wider range of countries and funding agencies.\n\nThe AIP will be developed by a team with deep experience in scientific infrastructure, data integration, and community engagement, and will take advantage of significant NSF investments in the plant biology research community.\n\nIn addition to providing the community with access to broader and richer data sets, including genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data, the AIP will cooperate with the iPlant project to provide access to a sophisticated suite of tools that can be used to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data.\n\nAIP will continue the TAIR model of educational engagement with the plant science community. It will provide reviews and demonstrations of the developing AIP functionalities at appropriate national meetings and host workshops for potential developers of new tools and resources. \n\nNot only will AIP modernize the bioinformatics capacity of the Arabidopsis community, it will provide a foundation for multi-agency, multi-national collaboration in building and funding biological informatics capabilities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L027151/1","grantId":"BB/L027151/1","fundValue":"382301","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gos  Micklem","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
