Most such infections are usually found in the tropics, but a changing climate and globalisation means their range has spread at an alarming rate. One particularly worrying virus infection, called Chikungunya, causes a flu-like illness followed by a painful joint disease. Some of those infected are unable to move their limbs without pain for years after the first infection, and there are no effective treatments available. It has already infected millions of people in Africa and Asia, and more people are at risk, even in Europe. It is important we understand how viruses like the Chikungunya virus spread and cause disease, so that we can develop treatments and predict future outbreaks. This project will therefore first seek to understand the early stages of infection, to see how the virus spreads from the mosquito or tick bite to infect the blood. Through understanding what happens in the body during the infection, we will be better able to develop medicines, before Chikungunya and other related viruses spread to affect more people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001724","grantId":"G1001724","fundValue":"396519","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clive Stewart  McKimmie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
