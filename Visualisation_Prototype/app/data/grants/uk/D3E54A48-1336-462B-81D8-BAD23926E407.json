Although nicotine abuse is an important cause of premature death and disease, activation of nicotinic receptors enhances cognitive performance. How it does so is not known. We have recently discovered a powerful effect of activation of a subtype of nicotinic receptors on inhibitory transmission in a subset of neurons in the brain. We propose to explore the underlying mechanisms, and to investigate the consequences of this phenomenon for network function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501424","grantId":"G0501424","fundValue":"431113","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dimitri Michael Kullmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
