There is urgent need to understand what can be done to maximise health and quality of life in old age. The factors influencing healthy ageing are complex and include factors like nutrition, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and genetic inheritance. \nThe Newcastle 85+ Study will make a comprehensive investigation, involving about 800 subjects, into the health of those turning 85. The study design has been tested in a comprehensive pilot study, involving 116 85-year-olds. Out of those approached to take part in the pilot study, 92% agreed to be involved.\nThe Newcastle 85+ Study will record extensive information about many aspects of health, including functional measurements such as mobility, grip strength, etc. Participants will also be asked for a sample of blood, which will be used to examine how the body’s cells might have aged biologically, and for genetic analysis. \nThe research will be conducted within Newcastle University’s Institute for Ageing and Health, which has excellent links with groups such as Age Concern, Help the Aged and the Newcastle Elders Council. The research is supported by the relevant NHS Trusts and the Social Services Directorate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500997","grantId":"G0500997","fundValue":"2219390","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  Kirkwood","coPersons":["Oliver  James","Thomas  Von Zglinicki","John  Bond","Martin Paul Eccles","Carol  Jagger"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
