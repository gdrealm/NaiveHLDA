The concepts he developed, such as townscape, have been of enduring importance in the design and management of towns and cities. This project has made a unique collection of his personal papers accessible through archival cataloguing and conservation and the production of scholarly outputs. It has developed a web-site which includes a hand-list and searchable item-level catalogue, selected digitised items, an annotated\nbibliography of Sharp's published writings and plans, a biography and a finding aid for other publicly accessible Sharp material.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112091/1","grantId":"112091/1","fundValue":"89412","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Pendlebury","coPersons":["Melanie  Wood"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
