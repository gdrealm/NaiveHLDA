This ignorance is preventing us from accurately predicting how ocean biology and\nbiogeochemical cycles will respond to the ongoing climate warming.\n\nObservations are key to understanding. Satellite data have revealed previously unknown mechanisms, but are\nlimited because they can only detect surface processes and estimate a limited set of biogeochemical parameters.\nShip measurements can overcome these limitations, but are constrained by extremely high costs and thus\nseverely limited in spatio-temporal coverage.\n\nA network of Bio-Argo floats will complement satellite and ship measurements and synergistically allow us to\nmonitor biogeochemical variables over sustained periods of time. For the first time, scientists will be able to exploit sustained observations to understand biogeochemical processes occurring in the deeper layers of the\nwater column. The first Bio-Argo floats are already fundamentally changing our understanding of ocean biology\nand biogeochemistry (Bishop et al., 2002, 2004; Riser and Johnson, 2008; Johnson et al., 2010; Boss and\nBehrenfeld, 2010). This new understanding, in turn, will improve ocean biogeochemical models and long term\npredictions of the feedbacks between ocean biogeochemical cycles and Earth Climate. Improved predictions will\nthen inform policies. As such, the requested assets will boost NERC's science on marine ecosystems, global\nbiogeochemical cycles and Earth's climate predictions.\n\nThe ability to sustain biogeochemical observations in the Atlantic ocean over time and space will expand the\nscope of the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruise. In addition, the new data on vertically-resolved\nbiogeochemical variables and rates will naturally feed into NERC supported biogeochemical modelling and data\nassimilation activities. Finally, the novel data will significantly complement existing NCEO activities on ocean colour\nremote sensing by allowing us to extend the surface satellite data into three-dimensional observation fields.\nThe Plymouth Marine Laboratory hosts recognized international experts in marine optics and its application to\nocean biology and biogeochemistry. This knowledge will be fundamental to assess the quality and interpret the\nbio-optical data collected by Bio-Argo floats and will be used to convert the optical proxies into biogeochemically relevant variables that will be distributed to the wider UK and international communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L012855/1","grantId":"NE/L012855/1","fundValue":"502291","fundStart":"2013-11-05","fundEnd":"2014-04-04","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The main objective of this proposal was to acquire a fleet of 10 autonomous profilers (Bio-Argo floats) that can collect measurements of physical and, critically, biogeochemical measurements in the upper ocean.
