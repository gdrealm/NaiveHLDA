QCD forms a major part of the Standard Model and its understanding is crucial in producing an overall theory to describe the properties of matter and the fundamental forces of nature including a grand unification theory to explain how the Universe evolved from the Big Bang. \n\nThe principal purpose of our research is to use ultra-relativistic heavy-ion interactions to study QCD at extreme energy densities. Theoretical models predict that under very extreme conditions of high energy densities the quarks, which are confined in normal nuclear matter, will be freed and nuclear matter will undergo a phase transition into a hot, dense plasma of free quarks and gluons known as a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). It is thought that such a state of matter would have existed until about 10^-5 seconds after the Big Bang, after which time the Universe would have cooled sufficiently for protons and neutrons to form.\n\nThe physics aim of this research is to study the strong force under these extreme conditions and, in particular, explore the properties of this exotic state of matter. By studying the QGP, we hope to address the fundamental questions of quark confinement and how quarks gain a large effective mass in hadrons due to the strong force (accounting for 99% of atomic mass). \n\nIn order to create the conditions required to produce a QGP we must collide heavy nuclei together at the highest possible energies, creating tiny hot (~10^13K) and dense fireballs. As the resulting QGP will only last for about 10-22 seconds, before condensing in to thousands of elementary particles, we must also use the most sophisticated detectors to analyse these collisions. \n\nThe LHC collides lead ions at centre-of-mass energies of 2.76 TeV in ALICE. We also collide protons together as this forms an excellent reference data set. Moreover, the excellent particle identification and tracking make ALICE an ideal detector to study the global aspects of proton-proton collisions in their own right. \n\nThis field of research employs about two thousand physicists around the world and ALICE is the most sophisticated experiment ever built in the field, studying heavy-ion collisions at centre-of-mass energies over an order of magnitude greater than its nearest rival. It hence represents the pinnacle of research in this field. \n\nThe ALICE collaboration is now preparing for the second LHC upgrade scheduled to start in 2018. These upgrades are required to cope with the anticipated increase in lead beam luminosity which will increase beam intensities by an order of magnitude. The main motivation for the luminosity upgrade is to achieve a precise, quantitative understand of the properties of the QGP by focusing on rare probes both at low and high transverse momenta as well as on multi-dimensional analysis of such probes with respect to centrality, event plane, multi-particle correlations, etc. \n \nThe ALICE-UK Collaboration proposes to play a leading role in the ALICE Upgrade at the LHC (CERN), in particular the upgrades to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP) and the Inner Tracking System (ITS) where it has recognised international leadership. This will enable us to continue to be responsible for the vital CTP to bring our world-class expertise in Si Tracking Detector Systems to the ALICE ITS Upgrade Project. This will position us to play a leading role in the future, precision, measurements of heavy flavour probes of the partonic matter produced in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, building on the leading role we currently play in the measurements of light and heavy flavour probes with the exiting detector. This project will capitalise on the prior investment of STFC in the ALICE experiment by sustaining and enhancing the leadership role the UK plays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001598/1","grantId":"ST/M001598/1","fundValue":"1050570","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2019-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Marielle  Chartier","coPersons":["Peter Anthony  Cooke","John Bourke Dainton"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
