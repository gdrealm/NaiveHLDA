These new catalysts have been protected by a patent filing. The key feature of these catalysts is that they give higher yields that the current commercial catalysts. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028137/1","grantId":"EP/I028137/1","fundValue":"156810","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have discovered a new way of making oxide nanorods that can be used as catalysts for methanol oxidation Chemicals Economic","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":["Jonathan Keith Bartley","Stuart Hamilton Taylor"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" A new method of making nanorods that can be used as catalysts for the manufacture of formadehyde from methanol oxidation We are in discussions with a potential industry partner Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
