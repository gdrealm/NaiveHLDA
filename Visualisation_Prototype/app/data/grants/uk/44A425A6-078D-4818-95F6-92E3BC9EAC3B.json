Near-IR light provides a good tracer of the mass in evolved stars, and so this survey wiil be used to constrain the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the evolution of clustering of samples of galaxies selected by stellar mass.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004203/1","grantId":"ST/H004203/1","fundValue":"1600","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy at the University of Sussex runs an intense outreach programme, closely link to the research carried out within the Department. Our activities not only involve research talks, but also hands on activities that introduce the basics of our research to the public. During 2013/4, we worked with 16,000 people - 2,000 members of the general public, 5,000 school and college students at our stands at various science fairs across the South-East, and 9,000 school and college students in a classroom-type setting (including our travelling planetarium).
