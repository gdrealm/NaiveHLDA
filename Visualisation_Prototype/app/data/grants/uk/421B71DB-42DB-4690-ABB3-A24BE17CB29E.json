{"id":"421B71DB-42DB-4690-ABB3-A24BE17CB29E","title":"Creation of High Wycombe furniture electronic archive","abstractText":"High Wycombe has a strong furniture heritage, and this archive, which has been held locally within the University College, comprises over 16,000 images and accompanying technical papers. Material has been gathered and collated as furniture firms have relocated or gone into liquidation.\n\nThis project will transfer material into a new referenced digital archive, accompanied by a web interface, which will open up new avenues of research for socio-cultural historians, acting as a primary resource for researchers and students. This digitisation project will demonstrate High Wycombe's influence on the UK design and manufacturing industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119158/1","grantId":"119158/1","fundValue":"301568","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jake  Kaner","coPersons":["Sharon  Grover"],"organisation":"Buckinghamshire New University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
