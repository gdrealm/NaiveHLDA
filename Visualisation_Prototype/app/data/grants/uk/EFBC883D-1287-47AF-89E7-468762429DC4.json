{"id":"EFBC883D-1287-47AF-89E7-468762429DC4","title":"Spintronic Devices for Integrated Logic Circuits","abstractText":"In this proposal, we aim to develop four key spintronic devices in collaboration with Tohoku University in Japan and Technical University of Kaiserslautern in Germany as counterparts in a Core-to-Core Programme organised by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. We intend to investigate a spin transistor with an optical gate, an all Heusler alloy MRAM cell, spin-transfer torque induced by the spin See-beck effect and design a prototype logic circuit. Based on our ex-pertise, we anticipate to achieve three major milestones for next-generation integrated logic circuits: (i) instant power-on, (ii) low power consumption and (iii) less Joule heating. Each of these device concepts has the potential to be a component of an integrated spintronic logic and storage device. In addition to the technical activities this project will support an ambitious programme of exchange through the JSPS Core-to-Core Programme. We are committed to 9 exchanges per year giving a total of 45 exchanges to Germany but principally Japan over the 5 year period. This will be the largest programme of exchange in the field of magnetism ever undertaken from the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M02458X/1","grantId":"EP/M02458X/1","fundValue":"856918","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2020-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  O'Grady","coPersons":["Atsufumi  Hirohata","Vlado  Lazarov","Andrew  Pratt","Gonzalo  Vallejo-Fernandez"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
