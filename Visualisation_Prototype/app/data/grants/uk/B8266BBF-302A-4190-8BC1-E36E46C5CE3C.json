The instability arises due to complex interactions among acoustics, heat release and transport, and hydrodynamics, which occur over a huge span of time/length scales. In the past, various aspects of the interaction were modelled in isolation, and often on an empirical basis. Advanced mathematical techniques, matched asymptotic expansion technique and multiple-scale methods, provide a means to tackle this multi-physical phenomenon in a self-consistent and systematical manner. By using this approach, a first-principle flame-acoustic interaction theory, valid in the so-called corrugated flamelet regime, has been derived recently. The reduced system in the theory ratains the key mechanisms of combustions instability but is much more tractable computationally. In the present proposed project, the flame-acoustic interaction theory will be extended first to account for the influence of a general externally imposed perturbation. A more general asymptotic theory will be formulated in the so-called thin-reaction-zone regime. Numerical algorithms to solve the asymptotically reduced systems will be developed. The asymptotic theories and numerical methods provide, in principle, an efficient tool for predicting the onset of combustion instability. The fidelity of this approach will be assessed by accurate direct numerical simulations (DNS). It will be applied to the situations pertaining to important experiments in order to predict a number of remarkable phenomena, such as self-sustained oscillations, flame stabilization by pressure oscillations, parametric instability induced by pressure and/or enthalpy fluctuations and onset of chaotic flames. The theoretical models will be employed to develop effective active control of combustion instability by modulating fuel rate, and the effectiveness and robustness of the controllers designed will be tested by simulations using the asymptotic models as well as the fundamental equations for reacting flows.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I017240/1","grantId":"EP/I017240/1","fundValue":"392397","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been reported at serveral international conferences, including AIAA Aeroacoustics and fluid dynamics conferences as well as international congress on sound and vibration.

The resulting unsteady loading is damaging to structures and compromises the performance. The funded search provided new insights into cause of the instability, which involves complex coupling between the flame, flow and acoustics. Specifically, we find that the stability of curved flame is fundamentally influenced by its spontaneous acoustics. We show that flames claimed to be stable without considering spontaneous sound are actually unstable when this effect is included.\n\nWe develop new mathematical models, which describe the nonlinear dynamics. The models are include all key physical factors, and yet remain mathematically and computationally tractable. They are found to predict experimental observations rather well, and in particular are able to capture the so-called violent subharmonic parameteric instability. The findings can be used to explain and interprete experimental and DNS results on the basis of first principles.\n\nThe models can be used to develop and test control strategies for suppressing combustion instability.
