{"id":"2CD4DEB4-44E7-4C62-BEC7-4BF928D9DB8D","title":"Urgency Grant: Crowdsourcing conflict and peace 'events' in the Syrian Conflict","abstractText":"It is clear to all that Syria is currently undergoing a serious conflict and that many Syrians are suffering under violence. The character of this conflict however, is different for different places within Syria, and is changing over time. For example, we see that new armed groups spring up very regularly, and that local armed groups do not necessarily have established connections to the 'main' parties to the conflict. We aim to create a database that captures this complex situation and helps us understand what is happening in Syria, when, where, by whom and why. \n\nThis database will be a database of reported 'events'. An 'event' is defined as an instance of (1) the use of violence; (2) a local negotiation or cease-fire; (3) the formation or disbandment of armed groups. We aim to gather these events through crowdsourcing. This involves creating a web-platform where people in Syria with a mobile phone (text-messaging) or internet connection can report these events, as they see them happening. We have made contact with a network of local civil society organisations, many of which are involved in negotiating cease fires, and will encourage members of these networks to participate in the crowd-sourcing effort. The result is a database that records instances of the use of violence and attempts at peace-making, and that details the date and location at which these happened, and what parties were involved. \n\nThis is important information for a number of reasons. First of all, it gives a more detailed understanding of what happens in Syria and enables tracing patterns (e.g.: what are the most violent areas? Where are new armed groups being formed? What actors commit violence where?). Secondly, this data can be used to analyse why certain areas are more violent than others and what contributes to the formation of armed groups or the success of a local peace agreement. For example, are external interventions, or debates about military intervention, related to armed group formation or the use of violence? What makes successful local peace negotiations more likely? Finally, it is intrinsically important to record instances of human suffering and the successes of local peacemakers, as a matter of historical record.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L014955/1","grantId":"ES/L014955/1","fundValue":"156750","fundStart":"2014-05-15","fundEnd":"2017-02-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary Henrietta Kaldor","coPersons":["Tilman  Brueck"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
