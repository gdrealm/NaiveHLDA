This phenomenon is known as nuclear shape coexistence and understanding the fine balance between nuclear shapes is a challenge to state-of-the-art nuclear models. We propose to make a stringent test of shape coexistence in the light radon nuclei using Coulomb excitation at the REX-ISOLDE facility in CERN.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002987/1","grantId":"ST/I002987/1","fundValue":"4109","fundStart":"2010-08-20","fundEnd":"2010-11-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The work has been disseminated at conferences and a paper is in preparation.
