Honesty is important: markets, firms, communities and bureaucracies all work better when the people in them can trust each other. Yet if individuals could often benefit materially from dishonesty, why don't they? One reason is that honesty is a social norm - a rule of behaviour enforced not only by laws, but also informally, by gossip, social sanctions or moral disapproval. \n\nRecent years have seen a wave of interest in honesty, and norms in general, among social scientists. Experiments have shown that people do not always follow their self-interest; they care too about fairness and equality, for example. They are also very sensitive to other people's expectations, and for this reason will often follow social norms. At the same time, while lab experiments make it easy to study how norms are followed, it is harder to study how they are created. And, because experimental subjects are not typical of the general public, we do not know much about what kinds of families, communities, and institutions successfully encourage honest behaviour.\n\nThis is a practically important question. The general public and the government are increasingly concerned with Britain's social fabric, as David Cameron's &quot;broken society&quot; slogan suggests. Honesty and trust are an important part of this issue: they are valuable forms of &quot;social capital&quot; which help people to solve problems together, without central government control. Policy-makers would like to know how to rebuild honesty in our society; teachers and parents want to know how to encourage their pupils and children to be honest; and the public is interested in how serious the problem is and how to fix it.\n\nFinding out how norms works is hard, however. Informal rule enforcement is harder to observe than the formal, legal kind. The process of norm internalization, which leads people to follow social rules even when nobody is looking, is also hard to capture. Interviews and other qualitative research can generate deep insights, but cannot always pin down cause-and-effect relationships. Questionnaires risk measuring &quot;cheap talk&quot;, not real behaviour.\n\nTo address these problems, I will use a &quot;behavioural&quot; measure of honesty, which examines choices with real monetary consequences. The sender-receiver game, developed by experimental economists, gives subjects a straight choice between honesty and material self-interest. With it, I will run two related sets of experiments.\n\nFirst, I will run the sender-receiver game with a representative sample of the British population, from a large panel survey. The resulting measures of honesty will be linked to other survey data, including family and community characteristics, so as to test theories of norm internalization. Respondents, in particular 10-15 year olds, will also be tracked in later waves of the survey, linking honesty with future education, employment and criminal or deviant behaviour.\n\nSecond, I will run the sender-receiver game in a school. One important theory holds that norms are spread via friendship networks. The school head has agreed to allow pupils to be randomly allocated into different peer groups (&quot;forms&quot;). By conducting experiments with new pupils, and with the same pupils after one year, I can measure how friendship networks affect honesty, and also how honesty affects friendship networks - do honest pupils gain more friends, and are they more likely to befriend other honest people? The sender-receiver game will be combined with interviews with pupils and school staff, so as to pick up aspects of norm creation which simple experiments cannot capture.\n\nThis research will benefit academics and practitioners, including teachers and policy-makers. Project outputs will include academic articles, and a book on honesty aimed at the general public. The research will be publicized via a website, media articles and presentations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009214/2","grantId":"ES/K009214/2","fundValue":"174573","fundStart":"2015-04-07","fundEnd":"2017-04-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Hugh-Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
