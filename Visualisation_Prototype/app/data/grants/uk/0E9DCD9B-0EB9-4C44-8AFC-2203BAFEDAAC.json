{"id":"0E9DCD9B-0EB9-4C44-8AFC-2203BAFEDAAC","title":"Nordic Art. The Modern Breakthrough - exhibition project","abstractText":"The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was a crucial period of artistic, cultural and intellectual development in the Nordic nations, which had significant roots in European culture, but sought ever-more autochthonic ends. This project will bring to fruition in December 2012 and summer 2013 an exhibition and accompanying catalogue/book at two prestigious venues: the Groninger Museum, Holland and an European partner institution. It will critically analyse Nordic art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period of seminal importance in Scandinavia, utilising contributions from experts in each of the Nordic nations. It will investigate a series of research questions related to the cultural context of the production, display, consumption and aesthetics of Scandinavian art during this period, particularly relating to issues of national identity, internationalism and aesthetic experimentation. Unlike other case studies, where the visual arts played an ancillary role in imaging the construction of nationhood, the interventions of Scandinavian artists were of primary importance in the elucidation of these and attendant issues. Key practitioners will inform an examination of the highly influential role and legacy of the art of these nations, but also offer a point of departure to alternative readings and methods of critical assessment, seeking a more integrated critical understanding than has previously been forthcoming.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H033629/1","grantId":"AH/H033629/1","fundValue":"275570","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Jackson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
