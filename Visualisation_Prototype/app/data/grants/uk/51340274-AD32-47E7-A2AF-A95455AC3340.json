{"id":"51340274-AD32-47E7-A2AF-A95455AC3340","title":"EPICure@19 - the extremely preterm young adult","abstractText":"The EPICure study was established in 1995. All births between 20 and 25 weeks of gestation across the United Kingdom and Ireland were identified in a 10-month period. There were 309 surviving children from 4004 births, who have been followed up at 2 1/2, 6 and 11 years of age. The information from this study has been used to derive a range of policy and treatment options for extremely preterm babies. In view of the findings at 11y of continuing high rates of disability, learning problems, respiratory problems and psychological disturbances, and the suggestion from other more mature cohorts that adolescence may be a period of catch up, we propose to re-evaluate the subjects as young adults at 19 years. \n\nThe reasons we need to do this are to see whether there has been catch up in terms of their development and to evaluate the longer-term effect of changes we have defined in respiratory function and cardiovascular development, which may have important long-term consequences for their adult life. Given the independence of the young people in the study we will arrange an appointment at the Study centre, based at UCL in Central London. This will allow us to carry out better assessments including a brain MR Scan.\n\nWe will evaluate the following areas of functioning: cognition, executive function (attention, processing of information), memory, behaviour, respiratory function and blood vessel stiffness, and sensory thresholds. Our MRI scan will allow us to relate structural and functional measures to these outcomes using state-of-the-art analyses. In addition we will undertake a lifestyle interview with each child.\n\nThe importance of these evaluations is several fold: we will be assessing children at the peak of their physical performance as they transition to adult life making this the best time to assess the effects of being born so early on growth, lungs and blood vessels and to work out how accurate our childhood assessments of these were; secondly we can evaluate how predictive our assessments of cognitive and executive performance were in childhood, or to what extent there is catch up over the teenage years; thirdly we can work out which are the key outcomes in adult life that matter and look back at the early life measures we have already collected and suggest better focused targeting of interventions to improve the young adult outcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J01107X/1","grantId":"MR/J01107X/1","fundValue":"1836570","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Marlow","coPersons":["John  Hurst","Dieter  Wolke","Sebastien  Ourselin","Xavier  Golay","Samantha Jayne Johnson","Joan Katherine  Morris"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
