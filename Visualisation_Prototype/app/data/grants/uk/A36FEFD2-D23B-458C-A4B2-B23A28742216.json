{"id":"A36FEFD2-D23B-458C-A4B2-B23A28742216","title":"NEW CATALYSTS FOR CYCLIC CARBONATE PRODUCTION","abstractText":"The aim is to exploit a recent discovery concerning the production of a new high activity catalyst for use in the production of organic carbonates. The methodology uses a new gold catalyst supported on an acidic support. Initial results show the new catalyst is over sixty times as active as the current equivalent commercial catalyst and retains complete specificity for the carbonate product. This enhanced activity represents a step change in the manufacturing processes for these important chemical building blocks. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007679/1","grantId":"EP/H007679/1","fundValue":"141575","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have designed a catalyst that can react an alkene with oxygen and CO2 to make a cyclic carbonate Chemicals Economic","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":["David  Knight"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We have designed a catalyst which can react an alkene with oxygen and carbon dioxide in one step to for a carbonate It could provide a new way of making monomers Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
