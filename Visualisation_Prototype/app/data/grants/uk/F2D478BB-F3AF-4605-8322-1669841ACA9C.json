Although considerable research has been devoted to this topic, the role of human experts has been under-emphasised. \n\nOur aim is to investigate the impact of enhanced metacognitive awareness on prediction and confidence (uncertainty assessment) to improve the prediction practices of software professionals. This will be accomplished by developing metacognitive awareness during a series of experiments with software professionals as participants. The major outcomes will be a better understanding of (i) the factors that influence prediction and uncertainty assessment skills and (ii) how industry practice can be enhanced. The findings will impact the software industry, its clients and other sectors where accurate predictions are required in uncertain environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I037881/1","grantId":"EP/I037881/1","fundValue":"49796","fundStart":"2011-11-20","fundEnd":"2012-10-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"CAROLYN  MAIR","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Southampton Solent University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
