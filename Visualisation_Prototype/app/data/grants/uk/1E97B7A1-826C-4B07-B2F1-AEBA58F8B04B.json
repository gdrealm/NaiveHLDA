The focus of the workplan is on characterising physiological and biomarker responses of temperate and tropical chironomid species to emerging chemical/particulate pollutants. The partnership has been formed between groups with a common interest in understanding the mechanisms of action and links to higher organisation level effects of chemicals using physiological and molecular tools. This innovations are developed with a view to improving the risk assessment and monitoring of emerging chemical pollutants in freshwater ecosystems, Initial exchanges have identified common research themes in developing stress response assays for invertebrate species. Initial contact by email and extended discussion has resulted in the development of a workplan focussed on this theme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N00065X/1","grantId":"NE/N00065X/1","fundValue":"26847","fundStart":"2015-01-30","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David Jonathon Spurgeon","coPersons":["Maria Gloria Dos Santos Pereira"],"organisation":"NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
