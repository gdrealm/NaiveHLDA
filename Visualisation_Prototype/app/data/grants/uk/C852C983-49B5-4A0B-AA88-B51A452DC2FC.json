By exploring hate crime in a broader sense of 'targeted victimisation', the project aims to investigate the experiences of the more ‘recognised’ hate crime victim communities, including those who experience racist, religiously motivated, homophobic, disablist and transphobic victimisation, as well as those who are marginalised from existing hate crime scholarly and policy frameworks. The study will also investigate respondents’ perceptions of criminal justice agencies and other service providers in order to assess the needs of victims and to identify lessons for effective service delivery.<br /><br />The site for the research is Leicester, one of the most plural cities in the UK containing a diverse range of communities whose views will be accessed for this study. The research team will administer online and written surveys to victims of hate crime within these communities as well as undertake in-depth interviews to probe issues in greater depth. Regular updates on their progress will also be provided via a dedicated project website and through social networking media to establish a sense of accessibility and transparency.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J008109/1","grantId":"ES/J008109/1","fundValue":"295092","fundStart":"2012-09-10","fundEnd":"2014-10-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research project came to an end in October 2014. The economic and social impact of our work will be more evident in the months to come, but the research has already made a significant contribution in the following ways:\n\n1) Our findings have raised awareness of the different forms that hate crime can take and the range of groups and communities who fall victim to hate crime.\nDuring the life of the project we engaged with more than 4,000 people from some of the more established and emerging minority groups in Leicester to raise awareness of what hate crimes are and how to access support. This will make a difference to levels of understanding and reporting amongst some of the city's most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities. We also worked with a total of 120 statutory, voluntary and community-based organisations and networks to ensure that hate crime issues are afforded sufficient priority. \nAwareness has also been raised through the completion of 55 media engagements during the life of the project and a further 31 media engagements thus far on completion of the project. These include features on national and local radio, television, newspapers and online blog sites. \nThis project has also made an impact through its Twitter presence. For example, Twitter metrics show that the last 50 Tweets about the project reached a total of 30,079 accounts, with 10% of followers based outside of the UK within EU countries and the US, and audiences including policy-makers, practitioners, academics, community groups and community members.\n\n2) Our findings have influenced change and good practice in the context of responding to the needs of hate crime victims.\nFrom the outset our research was designed to help organisations across different sectors to develop evidence-based, cost-effective policy responses. We have shared our findings and recommendations with over 350 statutory and voluntary organisations who run services for people affected by hate crime locally, regionally and nationally. This includes police forces and other criminal justice and victim support agencies; health and social care providers; and some of the more tailored community support services including neighbourhood centres, international colleges, race equality groups, LGBT centres, and support groups for asylum seekers and refugees, the homeless, people with physical/learning disabilities and mental ill health.\nIn addition, we created a Victims' Manifesto in order to secure commitment to the project recommendations from key stakeholders, local community groups, associations and networks. Thus far key representatives from 50 national and regional organisations have pledged to incorporate these recommendations into their policies and strategies through their 'on the record' commitment to the Victims' Manifesto. Finally, in addition to disseminating findings through reports and briefing papers, the project team produced a short film entitled 'The Harms of Hate' based on the project findings. More than 200 DVD copies of the film were distributed to regional, national and international statutory and voluntary organisations, and the film has also received over 2,700 views on YouTube. It has been used by schools, colleges, youth groups, prisons, charities and faith groups to showcase key messages from the project. This film won the award of Best Factual Programme at the Royal Television Society Midlands Awards 2014, and is one of the featured films at the 2014 Aesthetica Film Festival in York.

Over the course of two years the research team engaged with more than 4,000 people from different backgrounds and communities, and the sample of hate crime victims included nearly 1,500 people who had been subjected to acts of violence, hostility and intimidation because of their identity or 'difference'. The research has generated new knowledge in four key areas:\n\n1) The nature and impact of hate crime victimisation\n\nThe research illustrated that hate crimes were a routine, and mostly unreported feature of many people's daily lives. This includes people who are targeted specifically because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or their gender identity, as well as those who belong to the kinds of more marginalised groups so often overlooked within research and policy such as Gypsies and Travellers, the homeless, new migrant communities and those who live alternative lifestyles.\nThese offences took a range of different forms, including physical violence, cyberbullying, damage to property and sexually violent hate crime such as rape or sexual assault. All forms of hate crime had a significant impact upon victims' emotional and physical health, with particularly high numbers of victims of disablist and transphobic hate referring to feeling vulnerable, depressed or suicidal. \n\n2) The profile of hate crime perpetrators\n\nHate crime perpetrators are often assumed to be complete strangers to their victims, and more often than not far-right sympathisers or extremists. However, in fewer than half of cases within this research was the offender unknown to the victim, meaning that more often than not the person perpetrating hate was someone familiar: a neighbour, a work colleague, a carer, a 'friend' or even a family member.\n\n\n3) Victims' expectations in relation to justice\nThere is often an assumption that victims of crime demand punitive responses to offending behaviour. This research, however, has challenged that assumption, with participants showing an overwhelming preference for the use of educational interventions and restorative approaches to justice, as opposed to extended prison sentences or harsher regimes. Moreover, this preference was shared by victims of different types of violent and non-violent hate crime and from different communities, ages and backgrounds. \n\n4) Implications for criminal justice agencies and other service providers\n\nThe research highlighted victims' lack of familiarity with the term 'hate crime' and their lack of awareness of how to access support services. It revealed that hate crime awareness campaigns are failing to resonate with people at a grassroots level, and especially those from smaller and emerging minority communities and from economically disadvantaged environments. The research also illustrated how few victims had reported experiences of hate crime to the police, and to other networks, organisations or individuals in a position of authority and trust. In addition to assessing barriers to reporting, the research identified ways of making reporting more accessible, reducing feelings of isolation and vulnerability, and meeting the needs of diverse 'hard-to-reach' communities. The research team produced a total of eight reports, including a Full Findings and Recommendations report; an Executive Summary; a series of themed briefing papers on Disablist Hate Crime, Gendered Hostility, Homophobic Hate Crime, Racist Hate Crime, and Religiously Motivated Hate Crime; and a Victims' Manifesto containing a 10-point plan outlining practical ways to support victims more effectively. These reports have been published in hard copy and online, and distributed to more than 300 organisations and networks across the criminal justice, local authority, education, health and third sectors.\n\nThe Victims' Manifesto enables practitioners and policy-makers to pledge support to the recommendations embodied within the 10-point plan put forward by the research team. Within the first four weeks of its publication over 50 organisations from different sectors across the UK and Europe have pledged to embed these recommendations into their existing and future policies, with many more likely to follow suit in the months to come.
