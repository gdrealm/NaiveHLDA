The event took place on Thursday and Friday 26-27 June 2014, at the University of Reading, UK. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together experts in the field of lifespan changes in cognitive and affective control, and provide a mix of research talks and open forum discussions with ample opportunity for informal interaction. \n\nContent-wise, the workshop covered how lifespan development characterises brain changes underlying cognitive and affective control. We particularly focused on two developmental stages - adolescence and older age - during which individuals are relatively more vulnerable to a loss of affective and cognitive control, with consequences for well-being. Methodological issues surrounding the analysis of how structural brain development interacts with brain function were a central part of the workshop. These topics have been gaining increased attention not only in cognitive neuroscience, but also in society (such as the increased calls for funds within the UK's National Health Services to address anxiety and depression in younger and older adults). As such, this workshop was at the forefront of identifying conceptual and methodological issues that require further development to capture developing brains and the consequences of this development for affective and cognitive control. \n\nWe were fortunate that a group of internationally renowned researchers in the field accepted our invitation: Prof Richie Davidson, UW-Madison, USA; Prof BJ Casey, Cornell University, USA; Prof Paul Whalen, Dartmouth College, USA; Prof Heidi Johansen-Berg, Oxford University, UK; Prof H?kan Fischer, Stockholm University, Sweden, and Prof Tom Nichols, Warwick University, UK.

The presentations and formal and informal discussions that took place as part of the workshop have led to collaborations between researchers in the US, UK and Sweden, and will lead to grant submissions formulated as part of the workshop. Furthermore, discussions that took place as part of Day 2 of the workshop have informed analytic approaches that require further development and have been tested on a multimodal brain imaging project funded by the BBSRC and linked to this workshop (BB/J009539/1).
