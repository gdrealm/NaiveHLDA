The Internet offers exciting possibilities for tackling this crisis since it offers a wealth of sexual health information and can reach so many people. However, information alone does not reduce risky behaviour. We are developing a website which will be interactive and tailored, helping young people achieve a healthier sex life through giving them the tools to make informed decisions about sexual wellbeing. The research team will work in partnership with young people to decide the best design of website. We will also develop a similar, information-only website to compare with the tailored and interactive website in a future experiment (randomised controlled trial). We will establish the best way to carry out the trial online, for example how to recruit people, whether to give incentives for the research, and what measurements to make and when. If the tailored and interactive website is effective, it could have an important impact upon sexual ill-health since the costs of an online intervention are low (after development).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701749","grantId":"G0701749","fundValue":"502094","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia Vivian Bailey","coPersons":["Tracy  Roberts","Caroline  Free","Fiona Anne Stevenson","Graham John Hart","Elizabeth  Murray","Rebecca Sophia French","Greta  Rait","Irwin  Nazareth","Andrew  Copas"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
