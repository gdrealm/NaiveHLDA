Through participant observation and virtual archival research it explores UK Uncut’s peculiarly twenty-first century approach towards activism. Instead of being connected to each other through newspapers and national meetings, this nationwide movement is gathered under its website and facebook page. Instead of slogans and marches, UK Uncut put on playful street performances called ‘actions’. Instead of offering a comprehensive political programme, they raise awareness of the impact of austerity policies by acting them out in microcosm. So the unemployment caused by public sector cuts on the day of the Chancellor’s third budget becomes a dole queue outside Whitehall, while the coalition government’s decision to block Legal Aid becomes a people’s road block in streets across the country.</p>\n\n<p>The study examines therefore, the ways in which their activism takes the form of certain creative theatrical engagements with ‘the spectacle’ (our social reality as constituted by the media), in order to convey their political message. More broadly, it situates the movement within its own cultural context: exploring how the movement’s vision of a moral society emerges from within a specifically British paradigm.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008420/1","grantId":"ES/K008420/1","fundValue":"155554","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  I have thus far given two papers at academic conferences in Exeter UK and Bergen, Norway.
