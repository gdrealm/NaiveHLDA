Our recent studies have shown that a small protein called galectin-3 whose concentration is highly increased in the blood circulation of cancer patients plays a very important role in promoting cancer cell spreading. Galectin-3 binds to cancer cells and increases the likelihood that any cancer cells released into the circulation will seed at distant organs and develop into secondary tumours. Therapeutic agents that can inhibit this action of galectin-3 therefore have considerable potential to prevent cancer spread and improve chances of survival. We have evidence showing that chemical modification of certain naturally-accurring glycan compounds can inhibit this effects of galectin-3 on cancer cell spread in the laboratory. The unmodified forms of those compounds are widely used in clinic as blood thinning agents to prevent clotting but our modificcations block these anti-clotting effects thus considerably increasing the likely safety of these compounds if used long term. This study aims to identify small fractions of these specific glycan compounds that have particular efficancy against galectin-3-mediated cancer cell spread. This will lay the foundation for identification of 1 or 2 lead compounds for subsequent clinical trials in cancer patients. The galectin-3 inhibitors developed from such a strategy could be useful for the treatment of most cancer types during several cancer stages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000772","grantId":"G1000772","fundValue":"413634","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lu-Gang  Yu","coPersons":["Jonathan Michael Rhodes","Jeremy Ewan Turnbull","David Mark Pritchard","Edwin Alexander Yates"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
