This project fits within this vision, and we propose an automated method for studying the process of bacterial infection of cells. Our approach makes use of the latest developments in optics and in fabrication of patterned surfaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802618","grantId":"G0802618","fundValue":"99391","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pietro  Cicuta","coPersons":["Clare  Bryant"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
