In fruitflies, where PCP signaling also controls the orientation of hairs and bristles, two pathways are known to be important: the frizzled PCP pathway and the Fat-PCP pathway. In vertebrates, including humans, the role of the frizzled PCP pathway is well known where, for example, it controls the orientation of hair cells within the inner ear enabling us to hear and the orientation of cell divisions in the kidney which allow the kidney tubules to extend and function properly. In addition, this pathway controls cell movement/shape changes allowing the extension of our body axis during development. When this does not take place properly, the neural tube (the developing spinal cord can not close). Recently, it was shown that the Fat-PCP pathway is important in not only fruitflies but in vertebrates e.g. humans and mice and also controls the orientation of structures and that defects could result in hearing defects and cystic kidney disease. By removing the function of dachsous, part of the Fat-PCP pathway in mice, we have shown that in addition to kidney and inner ear defects, the vertebrae and sternum do not develop properly. We now aim to determine how this pathway controls the morphogenesis (the shape) of the skeleton. Nothing is known about how the shape of our bones is determined, but the PCP pathways are very strong candidates to control morphogenesis. We think that PCP signalling will control the orientation of cell divisions which will allow a bone to expand in a particular direction and the movement of the skeletal cells to create the correct bone shape and we plan to investigate this idea by asking how the cells divide and change shape in developing skeletal structures when the Fat PCP pathway is not working.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G021074/1","grantId":"BB/G021074/1","fundValue":"402840","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Data still in process of being published.\n\nReagents generated for this project were also used for an additional project which was recently published in Current Biology in July 2014.

We have shown that Fat4 and Dchs1 control the shape of the sternum by controlling how cells behave and orientate themselves. This analysis is the first study to show how the sternum develops. We have shown that Fat4 and Dchs1 regulate cell proliferation in the developing vertebrae. In the absence of Fat4 and Dchs1 the vertebrae are split. \n\nThe data have relevance to our understanding of how the shape of different bones is controlled and how skeletal dysplasias may arise. Our data show critical roles of Fat4 and Dchs1 during development of sternum and vertebrae. The data are of relevance to our understanding of the morphogenesis of skeletal structures and how defects may arise. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
