One of the most significant changes that occurs during the life of a plant is the switch to flowering. Although flowers and vegetative shoots both develop from groups of stem cells at the tips of shoots (meristems), they differ from plant shoots in that they are usually determinate and stop growing once the female reproductive organs are made. In most plants, the switch from shoot to flower formation is controlled environmentally by daylength and temperature. Once the switch happens, it is very stable even if the environment is changed. This is important in ensuring that flower/shoot intermediates are not formed (these would not make seed effectively). Understanding how this stable commitment to flowering is controlled is important, for example for helping us to control when and where flowering occurs. We are studying a group of proteins that are important in both animals and plants for giving cells a 'memory' of their identity, so that / for example / skin cells don't change into gut cells during our lifetime (inappropriate changes in cell identity are thought to underlie many cancers). Unexpectedly, our recent BBSRC funded research showed that when these proteins (called Polycomb) are missing in flowers, flower/shoot intermediates are formed. We think therefore that the stable switch to flowering may in part occur because Polycomb proteins make sure that genes promoting shoot formation are not activated in flowers. In addition, we found that we could identify which genes are switched off by Polycomb proteins as there are characteristic changes which occur to the histone proteins which package genes in the nucleus. Our aim in this project is to use these techniques to identify which targets have to be switched off by Pc-G during flowering in order to make flower development stable.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F007442/1","grantId":"BB/F007442/1","fundValue":"363077","fundStart":"2008-04-14","fundEnd":"2011-04-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin  Goodrich","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" Not applicable this year Not applicable this year Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
