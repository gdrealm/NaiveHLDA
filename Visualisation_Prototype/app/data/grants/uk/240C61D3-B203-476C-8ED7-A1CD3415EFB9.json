{"id":"240C61D3-B203-476C-8ED7-A1CD3415EFB9","title":"The Shadow of Marriage: Singleness in England 1914-1960","abstractText":"This project addresses a much neglected area of history. It argues the importance of marital status for family, gender and social history, explores the construction of the single/married divide and foregrounds the lived experience of a numerically significant group of men and women who never married in mid twentieth century England. By examining the relationship between marriage and singleness and the different meanings attached to being single before the sexual 'revolution' of the 1961's valuable insights are offered for current debates on the supposed breakdown of marriage and family and new light is cast on singleness today.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113122/1","grantId":"113122/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine  Holden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
