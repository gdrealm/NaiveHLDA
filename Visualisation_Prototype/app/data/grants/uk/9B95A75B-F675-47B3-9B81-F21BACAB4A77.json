It will develop a 'proof of concept' (POC) planning support solution for hospitals and health facilities using anonymised, aggregated mobile network data (extrapolated to provide insights representative of the total and segmented population in an area, including demographics, footfall and movement), together with health sector data (e.g. types of condition linked to demographics, environmental factors) and environmental data that can impact on health (weather, air pollution forecasts etc). The project will be led by O2, building on their Dynamic Insights platform, with Cambridge city and Addenbrooke's hospital providing the use case. This approach has been successfully applied in other sectors, such as retail and transport where it has enabled improvements in the nature and location of offerings based on detailed knowledge of the customer demographic. This will be the first time it has been used in the health sector. Successful demonstration of the POC (and supporting business models) will lead to commercial roll-out across the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007255/1","grantId":"NE/N007255/1","fundValue":"45605","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David Vincent Ford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
