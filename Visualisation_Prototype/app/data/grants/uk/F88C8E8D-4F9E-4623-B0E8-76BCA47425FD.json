In two volumes it will provide outline biographies of authors and list their main works, and give detailed accounts of their writings on Christian-Muslim relations, including manuscript histories, editions and studies on them. \nThis is the first stage of a project intended to document the entire history of Christian-Muslim relations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119223/1","grantId":"119223/1","fundValue":"187112","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The first output from CMR 600 appeared in 2009, and since then have amounted to 5 volumes (2009-13) that cover the history of Christian-Muslim relations as it is represented in written works by Christians and Muslims in the period 600-1500. As yet, impact is almost entirely discernible in scholarly works, where entries are already regularly referenced, and the series has been acknowledged as the definitive history of the field.

The project has produced a comprehensive database of all the known works written by followers of the two faiths in this period, comprising separate entries on each in which the lives of their authors are outlined, their contents are described, their significance is evaluated, and publication details and studies are listed. \nEach entry provides an authoritative starting point for a research student or scholar to study the work.\nA major finding, which will be synthesised later, is the gradual emergence of stereotypical images of the religious 'other' that become increasingly fixed and unquestioned, and are transmitted from earlier to later works. As has been said above, researchers can use the database as an authoritative source for studies of individual authors or of groups. \nMore importantly, it is now possible to trace the transmission of arguments and attitudes as they are taken over from earlier authors and copied or developed. The searchable online version of the history, available on the publisher's website, makes this particularly easy.\nCMR 600 (together with its successor, CMR 1900) shows how projections of the 'other' have become stabilised in religious outlooks, and exert pervasive influences on attitudes towards the other faith.
