Sperm competition occurs when the ejaculates of different males compete to fertilize a given set of ova. This is a pervasive selection pressure in the evolution of ejaculate characteristics and other reproductive traits for diverse animal taxa. In particular, it is now well established that male investment in the sperm component of ejaculates is strongly influenced by sperm competition. However, sperm usually make up only a tiny fraction of total ejaculate volume (1-5% for humans) compared to seminal fluid. Since proteins in the seminal fluid are essential to male fertilization success, it is likely that male investment in non-sperm components of the ejaculate will also be critical to determining sperm competition outcomes. Hence, to maximize fertilization success, males should tailor both the sperm and seminal fluid components of their ejaculates according to competitive conditions. To test this, we will combine advanced quantitative proteomics techniques with carefully controlled experiments using rodent models. Recently, we have demonstrated remarkable diversity in the seminal fluid proteins of muroid rodents, consistent with rapid evolution under sperm competition. To test for evidence of adaptive plasticity in ejaculate components, as predicted by sperm competition theory, we propose a systematic exploration of how investment in these proteins varies within species according to competitive risk. For the first time in any animal group, the application of advanced quantitative proteomics methodologies will allow us to precisely quantify variation in both seminal fluid protein and sperm content of the ejaculate when sperm competition is experimentally manipulated under controlled conditions. We will test for adaptive variation in the relative and total amount of seminal fluid proteins in rodent ejaculates, and quantify their relationships with sperm numbers. Specifically, we will determine ejaculate investment strategies according to (1) cues of sperm competition risk at the time of mating, (2) population-average sperm competition risk or intensity and (3) male dominance status. As well as testing for predicted changes in the ejaculate content of proteins with known functions, our research programme will reveal if other seminal fluid proteins vary consistently in relation to competitive conditions, and thus identify further candidate proteins with likely functional roles in sperm competition. These findings will establish the role of seminal fluid proteins in adaptive variation of mammalian ejaculate composition. To assess the fitness consequences of different ejaculate investment strategies, we will determine reproductive success for males mating under competitive conditions. This will provide insight into the functional significance of adaptive variation in mammalian ejaculate composition. These findings will have general relevance to understanding the functional and evolutionary consequences of adaptive variation in mammalian ejaculate composition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I013008/1","grantId":"NE/I013008/1","fundValue":"553984","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Paula  Stockley","coPersons":["Jane Louise Hurst","Robert Jeffrey Beynon"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" • Significant new knowledge generated\nData analysis for the core outputs of the project is still in progress; however the initial results of our quantitative proteomics analyses provide clear evidence of adaptive plasticity in mammalian seminal fluid proteins under competitive conditions. Our initial findings also indicate significant fitness consequences of varying investment in seminal fluid production and ejaculate composition. \n\n• New or improved research methods or skills developed\nWe have applied novel proteomics methods to provide qualitative profiling and precise quantitative measures of competing ejaculates within the female reproductive tract. The methods we have developed for use with rodent models can now be applied to determine adaptive variation in ejaculate composition across diverse taxa. \n\n• Important new research questions opened up\nWe have identified proteins mammalian seminal fluid proteins that are particularly responsive to the social environment – i.e. whose production is altered significantly in response to competitive conditions and male phenotype. In most cases the functions of these proteins are still not well understood, and our research suggests important roles in sperm competition as a priority for future investigation. \n\n• Increased research capability linked to training\nThe project has provided unique interdisciplinary training for the PDRAs and associated PhD student. This training is now being applied in a government research agency setting (Food and Environment Research Agency) by our proteomics PDRA, and has facilitated an international research placement and prestigious PDRA position at a world-leading laboratory for our PhD student. \n\n• Summary information\nThe original aims and objectives of the grant have been met. To date 7 published outputs are linked to the project, with a further 10 (including core publications) currently submitted or in preparation. The team has engaged in multiple engagement activities, including KE with a major international animal breeding company and an associated international research placement. Interdisciplinary training provided during the project is now being applied both in a UK government research environment and internationally, via next destination positions of our team. The work has also received early recognition via international plenary and research talk invitations. The primary academic beneficiaries will be researchers in the fields of evolutionary biology, reproduction and fertility. For example, our findings can be applied to advance understanding of developmental and phenotypic plasticity, of benefit to predict how animals will respond to environmental change. Understanding of fundamental reproductive processes can also be advanced based on new insights into the role of seminal fluid proteins in enhancing male fertility. \n\nKnowledge arising from this research can be applied to benefit the wealth, competitiveness and health of the nation via applications to the UK farming industry, and to human and veterinary medicine. Farming industries can benefit from application of knowledge to improve the efficiency of artificial insemination technologies and food animal productivity. Human and veterinary medicine can benefit from application of knowledge to diagnose and treat fertility problems and to improve techniques for assisted reproduction. Quality of life can also be enhanced by knowledge resulting from this research through benefits to animal conservation and increased public understanding of science.
