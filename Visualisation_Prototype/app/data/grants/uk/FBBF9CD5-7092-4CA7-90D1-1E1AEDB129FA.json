The instruments are often expensive (over 1 million), and they require expertise to operate them well and to interpret the data.The Department of Materials at the University of Oxford has been an international leader in this field for decades. It has over 15 instruments, several of which are state-of-the-art; it has academic staff who are leaders in the field; it has staff dedicated 100% of their time to supporting users of the instruments; it has extensive ancilliary equipment (sample preparation facilities, data interpretation software); and it has well-developed training modules.All of these facilities and support will be made available to approved UK users through this Access initiative of the EPSRC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F01919X/1","grantId":"EP/F01919X/1","fundValue":"455222","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Burnett","coPersons":["John Laird  Hutchison","Crispin John Hetherington","Angus  Kirkland","David  Cockayne","Peter David Nellist","Michael  Jenkins"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
