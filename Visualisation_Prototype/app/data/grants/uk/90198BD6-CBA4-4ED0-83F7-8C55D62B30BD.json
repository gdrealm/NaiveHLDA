{"id":"90198BD6-CBA4-4ED0-83F7-8C55D62B30BD","title":"Flexible Working and Couples' Coordination of Time Schedules","abstractText":"<p>This paper uses previously unexploited data on time scheduling in the household and employment contexts to investigate the effect of flexible working on couplesâ€™ coordination of their time schedules in the UK for the first time. This question is of paramount importance to policymakers considering the effects of extensions to flexible working, yet the economics literature provides relatively little theoretical and empirical evidence on it. We find that when the woman in the couple has the freedom to choose daily work times subject to a weekly total number of hours (flexitime) there is greater spouse synchronization in working times. The effect is driven by couples with dependent children, who arguably value synchronization most. In contrast, when the man in the couple has flexitime at work it does not change the amount of spouse synchronization. Considering a broader measure of flexibility, control over working hours, we find that synchronous time is also greater when the man has working hours control. A third type of flexibility at work, annualised hours, does not seem to help spouses in synchronizing their daily time together.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J003271/1","grantId":"ES/J003271/1","fundValue":"33147","fundStart":"2012-01-15","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  PI and CO-I have adopted a very dynamic approach at disseminating the findings of this research to conferences and seminars. We presented the paper at four academic conference (two outside the UK):\n\n- European Society for Population Economics Annual Conference, Aarhus, Denmark, 12th June 2013\n- Recent Developments in Labour Economics conference, Queen Mary University of London, 26th June 2013\n- British Society for Population Studies (Families and Households strand), Swansea 9-11/09/2013\n- European Association of Labour Economists conference, Turin, Italy, 20th September 2013.\n\nIn addition, we have presented our work at two specially organised workshops in our own departments (ISER Work Research Group, 29th January 2013, ISER JESS seminar, 5th June 2013).\n\nBecause some of the conferences happened after the funding for this project had finished, (see Section &quot;Project changes&quot; above), we went through a great length to assure that the results got the academic audience it deserved while the project was being developed. In particular, we organized a conference entitled &quot;Recent Development in Labour Economics&quot; that brought together international experts in labour economics. The conference took place at Queen Mary University of London in June 2013. This conference allowed a relaxed atmosphere to discuss our findings and hear about the latest debates in the academic literature and policy arena. Among the presenters were Francis Green (Institute of Education), Alan Manning (LSE), and Barbara Petrongolo (QM). We had over 30 participants, including junior and senior labour economists and a big proportion of PhD students from all over the UK. \n\nAs planned in our original proposal, we have also organized a half day roundtable aimed at disseminating the results of our research to policy makers and practitioners. The event was held at Queen Mary University in London in June 2013 and was entitled &quot;Flexible working - looking beyond productivity to work-life balance&quot;. There we presented our results to members of third sector organizations, Mike Emmott, Chartered Institute of Personnel Development, Jenny Chanfreu, NatCen,Jonathan Swann, Working Families, Andrew Stocks, DWP, Katy Jones, The Work Foundation and Sarah Crown, Mumsnet. \nWe posed questions to spark new collaborations about the areas in policy and practice currently suffering from critical knowledge gaps.\n\nAs a result of the interest generated by this project, Louise Clarke Cullen (ISER Communications Manager) successfully submitted an article on the project to the ESRC's Britain in 2014 magazine, which will bring the findings to the attention of a wider public.

We also looked at whether there were distinct impacts among households with and without children, and with different working arrangements (dual full-time and part-time/full-time). \n\nWe used innovative and previously unexploited data on time scheduling from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to investigate the effect of the provision of flexible working by the employer on the ability of couples' to coordinate time together. The BHPS contains rich information about individuals and the households they belong to, including details of individuals' labour market experiences and use of flexible work. In its 13th wave in 2003, the BHPS introduced a novel set of questions about work timing which, to our knowledge, have never been exploited before. These questions allowed us to calculate time that spouses synchronize paid work, and thus give us a measure of time left to potentially spend time together outside labour market hours. \n\nWe found that in couples with flexitime there is greater spouse synchronization in daily working times by nearly one hour. The effect is driven by couples with dependent children, who arguably value synchronization most because of extra constraints in the provision of child care in the market.\n\nThe findings improve our understanding of how constraints in the labour market affect households' ability to optimise their time use, and have implications for policies designed to increase the work-life balance of families. We will publish the research as a working paper in the widely read series of both ISER and IZA (Institute for the Study of Labour in Bonn, Germany, which operates an international network of about 1,300 economists and researchers spanning across more than 45 countries) discussion papers. We will then submit the paper to a refereed journal: either a generalist economics journal or highly rated field journal in labour or population economics. Publication is expected in 2 years time, as usual in economic journals. Publication of the working paper and then the journal article will inform the work of other researchers investigating the impact of flexible work on the household and so contribute to advances in the field.\n\nWe will continue to showcase our findings to the general public via the project's website https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/projects/flexible-working-and-couples-coodination-of-time-schedules, which was developed at the beginning of the project. As findings from the project are published as a working paper in the next three months, we will work will our Communications personnel to achieve maximum media attention in both the press and online. \n\nWe will also follow up with round table discussants to see how we can best answer the questions that arose in the round table as partners, exploring the possibilities for obtaining new data on flexibility and joint leisure and funding for further work.
