{"id":"55A5A525-758E-404E-B0DB-9C6B32FB8BEB","title":"DPFS Resource Request (University of Glasgow)","abstractText":"The development of new treatments for a range of diseases requires both an ability to understand the disease as well as an ability to take this understanding and to use it for the development of new therapies. We have been active in this area and have moved, in a number of disease areas, from basic research to therapies which are almost at the point of being of patient benefit. We now wish to develop these therapies further and to take them to the stage at which they will be accepted as being of sufficient value for further clinical trials. To do this we need the help of experts who will be involved in managing these sometimes very complex projects. We have 3 main disease areas that we are interested in: cancer, heart disease and inflammatory diseases such as diseases of joints and lungs. These experts will develop our projects and will ensure that their potential entry into clinical practice is carefully and efficiently handled. In addition, some of the therapeutics we are interested in are experimental and we are also requesting some items of equipment which will be important in helping us to assess the effectiveness of these therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801687","grantId":"G0801687","fundValue":"240801","fundStart":"2009-05-18","fundEnd":"2011-05-17","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  McInnes","coPersons":["Anna F Dominiczak","Sally  Macintyre","Jim  Cassidy","Miles Douglas Houslay","Gerard  Graham"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
