This is especially true to the more remote and rural regions of the world.The portions of the radio spectrum used for satellite communication is becoming congested so there is interest in moving to other higher frequency bands which are less busy. The problem with doing this is that the effects of the weather on the radio signals becomes more severe.This work will explore the possibiity of using a mathematical model to predict the performance of radio systems based upon simple meteorological measurements. This is stark contrast to the more conventional approach which would require a very costly experiment involving recivers on the ground and a transmitter onboard a test satellite.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D057930/1","grantId":"EP/D057930/1","fundValue":"30422","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Watson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
