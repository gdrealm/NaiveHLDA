{"id":"8AB226B6-022D-4F48-A97E-61B09BE6F3CE","title":"G8-2012 Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research Funding","abstractText":"The research effort is focused on moving the modern cement plant towards a more efficient facility able to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels, by combining bio-derived fuels with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). This work will be based on experiments and modeling of oxygen combustion, and the replacement of air with produced O2 and recycled CO2. The research plan builds from this core to include affected ancillary\nprocesses. Experimentation in simulated oxyfiring, and modeling of the gas and solids flow within the kiln and calciner will feed results to the remaining work. Scientifically the approach starts from the known and then adds layers of innovation. The cement industry has been making incremental improvements for 100 years and any changes will build from this base.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K021710/1","grantId":"EP/K021710/1","fundValue":"300094","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Fennell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We have determined the effects of high oxygen atmosphere on cement clinker formation If they want to make low carbon portland cement Construction","dataset":"gtr"}
