However, while MRI for assessing global cardiac function is becoming routine in rodents, methods are lacking to assess the metabolic changes that occur in models of disease, or as a consequence of specific gene changes. Developing these methods will be highly relevant as a growing body of evidence implicates changes in energy metabolism is important in the development of heart failure, and the ability to study cardiac physiology allows the dissection of the molecular pathways involved. We have obtained funding to develop novel, multi-nuclear MRS techniques on our new 9.4 T MR system to non-invasively investigate cardiac energy metabolism and ion homeostasis experimentally. Our results should not only lead to a better understanding of cardiac pathophysiol&shy;ogy, but will also provide the basis for more comprehensive, multi-parametric tools for future basic and translational cardiac research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600829","grantId":"G0600829","fundValue":"593362","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jurgen E.
