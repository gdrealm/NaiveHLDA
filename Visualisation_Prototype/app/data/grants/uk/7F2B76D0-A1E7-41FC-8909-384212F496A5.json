Research suggests that ER is still developing in adolescence, but also that adolescence is a key time for the emergence of mental illness associated with poor ER.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to investigate how ER develops during normative adolescence between ages 11-16. It will investigate this both cross-sectionally (comparing adolescents of different ages tested at the same time) and longitudinally (comparing the same adolescents between one year and the next). ER will be measured using computerised tasks and questionnaires, completed at school. Parents and teachers will also complete questionnaires about adolescentsâ€™ behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>The study will measure both explicit ER (conscious use of strategies to control feelings) and implicit ER (the ability to maintain concentration in the presence of emotion). The study will also look at links between ER and symptoms of anxiety, depression and aggression: do specific aspects of ER relate particularly strongly to these symptoms? If so, this could provide a target for future attempts at improving adolescent wellbeing. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008951/1","grantId":"ES/K008951/1","fundValue":"245515","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Lucie Sebastian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
