China's international role is of paramount importance to us all. To understand that role we need to investigate China's historical relationships with Africa, the Middle East, South, Southeast and East Asia. The most influential period of China's cultural interaction with the wider world was the early 15th century; hence it is this period that is the focus of our research project. By researching early Ming China's courts, their cultural, military and religious activities, and foreign interaction we can present a new history of this period. This history can then be the foundation for future research. Key to the presentation of this new history is an exhibition for 2014-2015 to be shown in the new World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre (currently under construction) at the British Museum. The exhibition 'Ming Courts and Contacts 1400-1450', a book, planned academic conference and edited volume will disseminate this research to a wide range of audiences.\n\nThis project is led by two Ming specialists, Jessica Harrison-Hall of the BM and Professor Craig Clunas of Oxford University and . An essential aspect of this new research will be to bring together a range of different researchers to explore the key questions at the heart of this project. For the exhibition key institutional partners will be museums, libraries and universities in Asia, North America and Europe e.g. Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, Palace Museum, Beijing, and the National Palace Museum, Taipei. The research will draw on the expertise of scholars with backgrounds in archaeology, architecture, art-history, anthropology, economics and literary studies. The imperial court of China in the early Ming enjoyed an unprecedented range of contacts with other courts of Asia (the Timurids in Iran and Central Asia, the Ashikaga in Japan, Joseon Korea) but also with Bengal, with Sri Lanka, with Africa, and even with the heart of the Islamic world in Mecca. In addition to Clunas and Harrison-Hall key authors for the book are Lothar Ledderose Professor of the History of Art of Eastern Asia at the University of Heidelberg, Germany; David Robinson - Robert H.N. Ho Professor in Asian Studies, Professor of History Colgate University, USA; Marsha Haufler (Weidner) - Professor of Later Chinese Art, University of Kansas, USA; Timothy Brook, Professor of Chinese History at the University of British Columbia, Canada; and Yuan Wenqing of Hubei Provincial Museum.\n\nIn contemporary China 1400-1450 is popularly regarded as a golden age of international engagement and a model for modern China. This is demonstrated through contemporary material culture - films, postage stamps and advertising. Recent popular histories written for an English-reading audience have misinformed a general public about this period. This new research and the exhibition 'Ming Courts and Contacts 1400-1450' which will disseminate the findings will address this and present a new, well-researched history for academic and popular consumption.\n\nKey research questions are: \n1. To what extent Chinese culture and society of the period 1400-1450 was shaped by contacts with other cultures and societies of the time?\n2. What was the nature of that engagement - what did China appropriate from, and what did it contribute to, other cultures 1400-1450?\n3. To what extent was that engagement mediated through Chinese central and regional imperial courts, as key nodes of transnational or transcultural contact?\n4. What was the distinctive role of art and material culture in that engagement, and to what extent do they support or subvert the narratives derived from textual sources?\n5. How does that period of sustained transnational and transcultural contact affect current Chinese state and popular perceptions of China's role in the world ?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005479/1","grantId":"AH/J005479/1","fundValue":"421809","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The reserach has been used to inform a major exhibition at the British Museum.
