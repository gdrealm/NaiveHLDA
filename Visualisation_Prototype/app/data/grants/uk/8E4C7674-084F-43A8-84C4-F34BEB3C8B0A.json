{"id":"8E4C7674-084F-43A8-84C4-F34BEB3C8B0A","title":"Quantum Multiplexer","abstractText":"The split gate transistor was invented 22 years ago and has ben in wide-spread use ever since in the investigations of the fundamental physics of electron transport in low-dimensional structures. At most a few such transistors have ben used in very small circuits. We have devised a way of making over 1000 split gate devices on the same chip and the way to bias each gate, while needing only 40 contacts to read out the transport properties of the entire array. This advance will greatly accelerate both the physics investigations and the exploration of new device concepts, taking fully into account a statistical analysis of the results as a function of the intrinsic fluctuations from gate-to-gate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014268/1","grantId":"EP/I014268/1","fundValue":"520899","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael J Kelly","coPersons":["David  Ritchie","Geraint  Jones","Charles Gordon Smith"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" We have established how to make a multiplexer, and have made 256 split gate arrays. We have initial results that will allow the statistics of multiple gates to be more effectively collected. We have measured quantum interaction effects in many devices allowing statistical analysis of how these phenomena change with the measured confining potential. We are examining the methodology for zeroing all the gates simultaneously. A simulation tool is being developed.\n\n H Al-Taie, L W Smith, B Xu, P.
