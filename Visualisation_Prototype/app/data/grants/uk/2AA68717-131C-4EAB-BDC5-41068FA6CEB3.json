Moreover, more and more poultry seem to be affected despite widespread attempts to control the spread of the disease. In parallel, more cases of human infection and, tragically, human deaths have been reported in the last year from H5N1 bird flu. Nearly 250 people have been infected and at least 140 have died. However, these numbers could pale into insignificance if bird flu were to adapt by genetic change into a truly human virus. Given the known high rate of genetic change possible in influenza virus the fear, now, is that the H5N1 virus will mutate or combine with a human-adapted influenza, such as a conventional seasonal influenza, enabling effective human to human transmission. If this occurred - given the 50% mortality of H5N1 flu ? no-one can be complacent. Certainly many millions of people could die, even in the UK alone. Indeed some argue that it is inevitable that a global H5N1 pandemic will occur sometime although the time scale is almost impossible to predict. Governments in many countries, including the UK have responded with measures to stockpile an antiviral - ?Tamiflu? - in case a global pandemic emerges. However, new drugs are needed because of the emergence of virus strains resistant to ?Tamiflu?. Our research, carried out at Oxford University by George Brownlee FRS and Ervin Fodor at the School of Pathology and David Stuart FRS and Jonathan Grimes at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, aims ultimately to make it possible to find new antivirals targeted to an enzyme - the RNA polymerase - central to the influenza virus life cycle. By blocking the activity of an enzyme crucial for viral multiplication, we hope that such drugs will be particularly effective against this disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601190","grantId":"G0601190","fundValue":"449378","fundStart":"2007-08-27","fundEnd":"2010-08-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"George  Brownlee","coPersons":["Jonathan  Grimes","David  Stuart","Ervin  Fodor"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
