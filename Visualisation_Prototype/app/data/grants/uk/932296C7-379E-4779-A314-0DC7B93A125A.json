The significant presence of Jews in Irish literature since the earliest times deserves to be investigated because initial research undertaken shows the presence of Jews in Irish literature, whether as writers or as characters in writing by Jews and non-Jews, to be more widespread and potentially far more significant than has been realised to date.\nThis research will demonstrate how the representation of the Jew in Irish literature actually tells us much more about Irish than Jewish identity, how in fact a whole psychohistory, perhaps even psychopathology, of Irishness is hidden in these neglected representations. The project aims to investigate the topic in all eras of Irish literature, in both Irish and English, and to situate the findings within the discourse of Jews in other literatures, including English, American, German and East European. The outcome of the research will be an in-depth study of the topic, an anthology, a web database, and an exhibition in Belfast and Dublin, leading to an academic conference with published proceedings, all of which will establish permanently the significance and meaning of &quot;the Jew&quot; in Irish literature.\nThis examination of Irish attitudes to Jews as found in Irish literature is of potential interest to all bodies that are engaged with attitudes to racial, national and religious difference, in both Northern Ireland, the Republic and beyond. This includes political parties, immigrant and non-national bodies, and statutory bodies engaged with promoting equality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00526X/1","grantId":"AH/K00526X/1","fundValue":"408376","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"PÃ³l  O Dochartaigh","coPersons":["Elmer  Kennedy-Andrews","Frank William Ferguson","Donald MacLeod MacRaild"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
