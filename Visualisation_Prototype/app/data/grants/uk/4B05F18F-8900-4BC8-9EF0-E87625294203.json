Without this wake-up call or the switchboard operator, you cannot function properly and fall asleep at the wrong times of the day. Recently, we found that messages from switchboard operator can reset this daily alarm clock, and while we have identified some of the words, we do not yet fully comprehend the language of this operator. In our research we are seeking to understand how the switchboard operator and the daily clock converse to communicate the wake-up call throughout the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E00511X/1","grantId":"BB/E00511X/1","fundValue":"669941","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2010-01-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh David Piggins","coPersons":["John  Gigg","Denis  Burdakov"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
