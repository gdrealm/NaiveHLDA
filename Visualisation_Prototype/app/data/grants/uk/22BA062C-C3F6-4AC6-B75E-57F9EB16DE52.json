The results of these experiments (cross sections and fragment momentum distrubutions) can be analysed to learn about the structure of these rare nuclei. This involves combining information from theoretical models of nuclear structure and from nuclear reactions to (a) suggest measurements, (b) make predictions, and (c) compare these with the measurements.

This grant was awarded to fund exchanges and workshop attendances to allow theoretical reaction work, conducted and funded by STFC in the UK (under grant ST/J000051/1) to benefit from input from newly-available structure information from structure theorists in the SARFEN network and to assist the contribution of UK-supported work to the interpretation of experiments, thus advancing our understanding of the properties of exotic nuclei. UK-funded research work das been used to make theoretical predictions for experimental proposals at the NSCL (Michigan State University) and RIKEN (Japan) and to guide the interpretation of new experimental data from these facilities.
