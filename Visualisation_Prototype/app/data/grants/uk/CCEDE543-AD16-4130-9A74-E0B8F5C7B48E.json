{"id":"CCEDE543-AD16-4130-9A74-E0B8F5C7B48E","title":"A Corpus of Narrative Etymologies from primitive Old English to early Middle English","abstractText":"In Middle English (1150-1500) there are over 60 different spellings for 'she' and over 500 for 'through'; how has such variation come about?\\n One of the most striking aspects of the written language of the Middle English period is the sheer number of spelling variants for what are single words with fixed spellings in Present Day Standard written English. It is widely accepted that much of this spelling diversity is systematic, yet no history of English so far attempted has offered a set of etymologies to account for the diachronic and regional diversity. Traditional etymologies, as exemplified in the Oxford English Dictionary, are designed primarily to elucidate the semantic history of a word, and so tend to explain form changes only in very broad detail. Although the handbooks and grammars of early English contain descriptions of the major sound changes that account for some of the spelling diversity, such descriptions tend to focus on developments towards Standard English and so fail to chronicle the particular processes which account for individual word-forms. \\n Our goal is to create a radical re-shaping of the early narrative history of English. We aim to make and publish a 'Corpus of Narrative Etymologies' (CoNE). This will explicate in unprecedented detail the evolution of individual words and affixes in the input language to the Anglo-Saxon settlement into the variant forms attested in Early Middle English (1150-1325). Underpinning CoNE will be our 'Corpus of Changes' (CC), which will document and explain the linguistic changes referred to in our individual word-histories. CoNE will complement the content of existing historical English dictionaries, both in the systematic presentation of all changes and in explaining all attested form types as a set of branching narratives. Indeed, CoNE will make explicit many of the assumptions about form histories in the historical dictionaries, and will test and revise those assumptions on the basis of new and detailed analysis. CC itself will be a valuable resource for updating and correcting the existing grammars and philological handbooks to reflect any newly noticed and newly interpreted linguistic changes that it documents.\\n We have chosen as a set of 'targets' for our narrative etymologies all forms of Germanic lexical words and grammatical items (e.g. inflections, derivational affixes, articles and pronouns) recorded in the corpus of tagged texts compiled for A Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English (LAEME). We will take as the input form for each narrative the phonetic shape an item may be presumed to have had in the dialect-complex that served as input to Old English (i.e. 'North-sea Germanic'). We aim to formulate its story, over a time-depth of 700-800 years, by reference to the changes documented in CC, as far as the collection of shapes the item evidences in the LAEME corpus. This Germanic section of CoNE will account for the variant spellings of some 5,200 items.\\n The outcomes of our research will be of interest to students and researchers of the history of English in general, and Old and Middle English in particular. Within the broad subject of the history of the language, CoNE and CC will inform those who study: etymologies and the lexicon; the interface between orthography and phonology; historical dialectology. Students working with Old and Middle English texts will gain an important new resource, besides glossaries and dictionaries, to aid their understanding and interpretation. As CoNE and CC will be published through a free-access searchable on-line database, our material will also be accessible to those more generally interested in words and their origins, and in dialectal variation and how it is observable for past stages of the language. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H032517/1","grantId":"AH/H032517/1","fundValue":"683370","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger George Lass","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The variant forms of a word or morpheme in LAEME CTT are gathered under a 'tag' which taxonomizies the form lexically and / or grammatically with respect to each of its occurrences in one or more texts.
