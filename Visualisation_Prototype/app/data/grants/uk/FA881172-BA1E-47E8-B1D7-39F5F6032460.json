The company used the Knowledge Catalyst scheme, in conjunction with the University of Lincoln, to diversify its work into new media and creative design. It was worthy of special attention as its business aims - to champion new, high-quality design and become a national competitor - were unusual for such a small and specialist creative industry and required the benefit of academic expertise. To achieve its new goals Studio View employed a recent graduate from Lincoln University to develop and manage a new business plan under the supervision of Paul Middleton, Phil Eastwood and Michael Pool. In return the company have provided valuable insights into the industry. \\n\\nThe graduate incorporated new design techniques into Studio View's work to successfully distinguish it from its competitors and to target a new client base, outside of Lincoln. The graduate applied creative academic knowledge to a commercial context, and their unique expertise in new design helped to differentiate the company from its competitors. The graduate had to apply a working knowledge of marketing and strategic planning in order to reach new audiences and as a result the company is closer to their goal of becoming a regional and burgeoning national competitor, and have significantly diversified their portfolio of work.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F500181/1","grantId":"AH/F500181/1","fundValue":"29122","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Middleton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Lincoln","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
