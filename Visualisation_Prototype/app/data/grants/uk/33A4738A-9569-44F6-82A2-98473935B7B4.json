To capture all&nbsp; this,&nbsp; the project will involve intensive study of some&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; family households in Bristol. </p>\n\n<p>The interest is in 'ordinary' representatives of the class structure rather than the most marginalised, so participants will be households in which at least one adult has full-time work and at least one child is living at home. Households will be contacted through a randomised mailout to selected areas in Bristol and suitable participants will be selected. </p>\n\n<p>The project will deploy an innovative mix of research methods, including qualitative time-diaries, observation, photographic methods and interviews, to document the most taken-for-granted elements of their routine everyday&nbsp; lives.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2477","grantId":"RES-062-23-2477","fundValue":"183255","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Harriet Katharine Bradley","coPersons":["William James Atkinson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
