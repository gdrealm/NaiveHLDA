Ventricular assist devices (VADs) can address this need and have shown very promising clinical results. \nHowever, existing VADs are expensive, have high utilisation costs due to significant complications and require extensive invasive surgery for implantation. Calon’s MiniVAD addresses these problems with a smaller pump, reduced blood damage and significantly improved health economics. \nThis project proposes the development of novel blood damage assays and the subsequent detailed in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation of the MiniVAD to provide the performance and safety data necessary to support a regulatory application to begin human clinical studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13039","grantId":"MC_PC_13039","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Ann Thornton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
