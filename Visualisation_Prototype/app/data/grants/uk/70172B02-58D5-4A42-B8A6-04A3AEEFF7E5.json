Millions of people suffer from conditions such as chronic back pain, and pains related to damaged nerves in the skin, caused by conditions ranging from diabetes to AIDS. Pain caused by light touch is a particularly troublesome aspect of some pain syndromes. Surprisingly most drugs that are used to treat pain are quite old, and have undesirable side effects - for example morphine causes addiction and can inhibit breathing, whilst aspirin causes stomach bleeding and is not effective in many long term pain conditions. Thus considerably more than half of chronic pain patients (hundreds of thousands of people in the UK alone) are inadequately treated. One drug that seems to work (in about a third of people) called gabapentin has been proposed to act by blocking the actions of a protein involved with sending electrical messages into the spinal cord.\n In the programme of work described here, we show how we will use mice to identify the molecules involved in detecting painful mechanical stimuli. Once we have established how mechanical forces are sensed at a molecular level, we can design methods to identify chemicals that can block this sensation. Such chemicals can be developed into drugs, hopefully without side effects, that act to block mechanically-induced pain, but not the sensation of touch. We have found a snail toxin that blocks mechanically activated electrical signals in nerve cells. We can tag the toxin to find the proteins that it sticks to, and then find the genes that encode these proteins. Next we make mice where we have deleted the genes that encode the proteins to see if they no longer feel unpleasant mechanical stimuli. We know how to delete genes just in damage-sensing nerves. We are already using this approach to find out how important various proteins involved with electrical signalling are for pain perception. We can also use this technology to find out if Gabapentin, the new chronic pain drug, really does work in the way it is supposed to, and if not how it does work, and how various signalling molecules change pain thresholds by sending messages into the spinal cord. We are very confident our work will lead to useful new pain-killers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9717869","grantId":"G9717869","fundValue":"2513780","fundStart":"1999-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Nicholas Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
