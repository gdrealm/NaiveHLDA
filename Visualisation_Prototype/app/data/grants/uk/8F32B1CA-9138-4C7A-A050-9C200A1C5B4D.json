Healthcare is one of the largest sectors in terms of revenue and employment, and is expanding rapidly. But despite rapid economic growth there are great social and economic inequalities. </p>\n\n<p>The complex relationship between India's adaptation to the new global environment and Indian population heath needs and aspirations, local and international health systems, and healthcare related industries, is one that social scientists are beginning to study. </p>\n\n<p>The network proposes to strengthen and extend this activity by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Bringing together and examining the diverse literatures.</li>\n\n <li>Hosting workshops in London and New Delhi to enable key researchers from across the social sciences in India and the UK, and potential users of their work,&nbsp; to come together to discuss existing findings, emerging topic areas, and the new methods that may be required for investigating these.&nbsp;</li>\n\n <li>Publishing findings as Open Access papers in a journal special issue.</li>\n\n <li>Developing future research priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The network is coordinated by researchers from three key universities which bring together interests in social science, healthcare and health policy, globalization, and India&nbsp; -&nbsp; King's College London, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and London School of Economics&nbsp;and Political Science. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H032657/1","grantId":"ES/H032657/1","fundValue":"60639","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Open access journal (impact factor 1.83) special collection of 13 papers:\nhttp://www.globalizationandhealth.com/series/social_science_perspectives\nTwo of the papers are in the 'highly accessed' category.

Much of the material in the review and specialist papers is relevant to health policy, and well as to the general societal understanding of current developments in healthcare and health policy. The special issue series of papers give an overview and specific detailed insights into key issues concerning contemporary globalization and health, written from a range of social science perspectives.\n\nTwo collaborative research proposals based on these findings were developed and submitted:\n\n 'The contr Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
