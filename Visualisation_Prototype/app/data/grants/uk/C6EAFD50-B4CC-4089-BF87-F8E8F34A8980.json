Two examples&nbsp; are as follows. First,&nbsp; employees exert effort in order to be promoted in organizational&nbsp; hierarchies.&nbsp; Periodical reviews are conducted, and these reviews are then aggregated to determine who is promoted\n<br />and obtains the higher salary&nbsp; associated with the more senior position. Second, students compete to be ranked high in their class, and the professor must choose whether to conduct a final exam only or final and&nbsp; midterm exams. If the latter is chosen, then a rule according to which the results of the two exams are aggregated into ranking must also be determined.\n<br />\n<br />A designer of a tournament whose goal is to maximize the expected effort of the agents at minimum cost needs to decide how many reviews to conduct, and how the results of the different reviews are to be aggregated into a ranking. Moreover, the size of the prizes to be allocated as a function of the reviews' outcomes must also be chosen. Finally, in a dynamic tournament there is scope for an agent to learn relevant information from the other agents'\n<br />performances. These are the questions and issues that are addressed in this research project.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2284","grantId":"RES-000-22-2284","fundValue":"69215","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Abhinay  Muthoo","coPersons":["Motty Motty Perry"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
