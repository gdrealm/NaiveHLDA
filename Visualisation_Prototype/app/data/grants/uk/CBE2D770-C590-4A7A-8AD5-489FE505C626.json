{"id":"CBE2D770-C590-4A7A-8AD5-489FE505C626","title":"Rapa Nui Landscapes of Construction","abstractText":"The most prominent archaeological features of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) are the colossal stone statues (moai) dating to c. AD 1000 to AD 1600 that once stood on stone ceremonial platforms (ahu) positioned around the coastline of the island. The project aims to develop new interpretations on the organisation and meaning of these monumental construction activities and to unify the hitherto isolated research foci - of statue quarries, statue transport roads, and ahu, into an integrated Island-wide programme of landscape study, survey and excavation.\\n\\nExtant moai research focuses upon the socio-economic significance of monument production, particularly the pragmatics of competing access to resources, and the mechanics of how moai were transported to the ahu. Our project offers a different perspective by investigating construction as being socially-articulated, taking place at ideologically meaningful places, with the activities being as important as the final product. The fieldwork integrates five prospecting elements: i) Landscape Survey of ahu, statue roads and statue quarries including detailed topographic mapping; ii) mapping of the audio-visual qualities of locations; iii) Geophysical and deep-ground penetrating radar prospecting to locate buried quarry workings and obscured statue transport roads and associated features; iv) Laser scanning of quarry surfaces; and v) excavation of quarry floors and spoil.\\n\\nRapa Nui is at a fragile moment in its socio-cultural history. The island has a World Heritage status and tourism is rapidly growing with weekly air flights from Santiago and Tahiti. Concurrently, the Chilean Government is in the process of returning land, all of which is dense with archaeology, to the indigenous population. The majority of Rapa Nui's monumental archaeology is deteriorating from salt damage and the vulnerability of the island's archaeology is compounded by a lack of coordinated island-wide databases or co-operative research.\\n\\nOur aims are:\\n1. To date the chronology of statue quarrying, and compare it with known construction chronologies of the ahu .The longevity of Rapa Nui's statue production is a focus of debate. Our excavations aim to date key phases of the pre-eminent statue quarry of Rano Raraku, and of Puna Pau - the quarry for the large red 'hats' (pukao) that adorned the moai on the ahu. Rano Raraku is the only quarry to have had any excavation - by Heyerdahl's team in the 1950s, but the resulting radiocarbon dates are not refined enough to be useful. No absolute chronology exists for the use of pukao.\\n2. To explore the social organisation of Rapa Nui's monumental construction, particularly the organisation of quarrying. Visual inspection suggests that the Rano Raraku quarries were divided into distinct clusters of working units. We will investigate this through surface survey and geotechnical survey (see iiii) above).\\n3.To better understand the relationships between the landscape locations of statue quarrying, statue transport and ahu with statues. Work at the ahu has either been linked to reconstruction and conservation, or to characterising architectural components and their sequences. Our work instead focuses on them as landscape places and aims to characterise their topographic positions - together with the evidence from environmental reconstruction, and to elucidate their possible intervisibility and inter-audibility with quarries and roads.\\n4. For the processes and results of our work to transcend single methodological and academic traditions of the interpretation and public understandings of Rapa Nui's archaeology, and in doing so to aid broadly-informed management of the Rapanuian landscape and support Rapanuians in the self-determination of their own heritage. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I002596/1","grantId":"AH/I002596/1","fundValue":"642620","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1) Findings: The first dates and evidence of quarrying techniques and activities, and new evidence for roads at Puna Pau, the quarry for the famous statue hats that adorn the Rapa Nui (Easter Island) statues.

National Park guides and local tourist guides trained to disseminate the new information.\n\n2) Findings: The routes, and the distribution and types of archaeological features associated with, and in the vicinity of, the moai (statue) roads, leading to and from the Rano Raraku statues quarries.

Request from CONAF Rapa Nui to train park rangers in recording quarry petroglyphs and monitoring their fragile state of preservation. These petroglyphs are now mentioned on site tours by park guides and tourist guides and change interpretations of quarrying from a solely practical activity to one that had ideological associations.\n\n4) Findings: Evidence that the recumbent statues (moai) along many of the statue roads were not abandoned in transport but were originally standing monuments along the roads. This work is ongoing but will impact on traditional views of the so-called collapse of Rapa Nui statue-building societies.\n\n5) Findings: New evidence for numerous quarries associated with the construction of ahu (the ceremonial platforms on which the statues were placed) and new evidence for the regular presence of 'canoe' ramps associated with the ahu. Impacts: these databases of threatened unmapped sites which are key to the totality of understanding Rapa Nui's landscape-scale heritage, have been digitally filed with CONAF Rapa Nui for incorporation into the its listing of archaeologically sensitive landscapes and will aid the identification by the Chilean government of viable areas for land return to indigenous Rapanui.

A greater understanding of the associated domestic archaeology of ahu. This includes prehistoric domestic architecture, numerous stone quarries and agricultural features extending up to 2km inland from the coastal ahu. LOC has identified and mapped the settlement archaeology associated with more than 30 ahu on a landscape scale. This allows a better understanding of the spatial articulation of Rapa Nui societies at the time of statue construction.\n\n8). Approximately 100 hare paenga -- boat-shaped houses -- have been surveyed in detail to isolate their use and construction sequences and the diverse origins of the stones used in their construction. This provides a greater understanding of the use and conceptualisation of stone as a material of construction on Rapa Nui beyond the traditional focus by the public and academia on its monumental use for statues. Previous archaeological work on Rapa Nui has been disjointed and has not considered the archaeology of the societies that constructed the statues (moai) as an inter-related whole. By contrast, the links so far made by LOC between the moai and the moai topknot quarries, the 'moai roads', ahu, and the wider industrial, domestic and ritual landscape of the Island are new and evidence the essential role of construction activities in the belief systems and organisation of Rapa Nui prehistoric society. We have done this by combining a landscape scale of study with multiple methods and scales of science-based and sensory fieldwork. This combination is both new for Rapa Nui but also for the archaeology of Oceania generally and has potential to be developed in other Pacific island contexts. LOC's findings provide the academic foundations of linking Rapa Nui's archaeology to a wider Polynesian context, and this could be further explored for Rapa Nui's prehistoric art, and domestic architecture, as well as its traditions of monumentality and stone use. Rapa Nui has long had an iconic status of exemplifying social collapse through overuse of resources and a consequential cessation of monument construction. More thematically, in terms of understanding the emergence and collapse of civilisations and their associated traditions of monumentality, LOC's work shifts this simplistic focus on monumental statues to a society that had a sophisticated relationship with the use of stone resources at a domestic and agricultural scale. This provides an alternative perspective for the future exploration comparative regional scenarios of how societies utilize construction activities rather than monumentality to express ideologies and aspects of social coherence. For Rapa Nui today, the bigger interpretative picture that our work elucidates, broadens the active role of archaeological data to different Island stakeholders. CONAF for example has already started to use LOC's findings in heritage conservation and presentation. It is of ongoing value in land return in isolating complexes of archeological features, rather than individual monuments, for preservation.
