The project aims to create a full analysis of Scottish knowledge networking in this period. The interwoven relations of people, ideas and methods created Scotland’s leading edge internationally in the mid-20th century. We shall analyse and explain the influence of Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson in this network of Scottish educational research, and in intelligence theory and applications. The catalytic effects of the Scottish Council for Research in Education, the interest of the Educational Institute of Scotland and its members, and the financial support of the Carnegie Foundations in New York, all helped to organise the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey. The intensive and voluntary nature of the considerable Scottish activity in mental testing and educational research is unusual and has never been explained properly. The focus of this study will be on: the specific locations and cultural contexts of scientific research; the exchange in international networks of ideas, methods and results; the intellectual history of key individuals; and the relation between statistics and text, and between scientific advance and the governing of education systems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1246","grantId":"RES-000-23-1246","fundValue":"296425","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The original archival material obtained during the study have been lodged with Special Collections at EDinburgh University and are available for view and use by other researchers. \nThe information gained during the study has facilitated applications for further funding, and provided much-needed background information on the follow-up studies of the Scottish Mental Surveys.  ","person":"Ian J.

SCRE was a network representing key institutions (EIS, Directors of Education, Universities, training colleges) and significant actors which in turn mobilised wider networks. A pioneering research culture, in the UK and Europe, was formed with its own forms of inquiry, tools, institutions and models of engagement. The study explored the cultural, intellectual and social context of educational research in Scotland and its relations globally, in particular Scotland's involvement in the IEI, Boyd and the teacher testing movement, and the intellectual arguments used to explain society and the use of testing.\n\n\n\nThe project revealed the full range of the work of Scottish actors, particularly Thomson, in advancing theories of intelligence and assessment technologies, which underpinned the innovatory Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947, and were recognized in the core American and British debates on intelligence. For example, we have revealed the importance of Thomson's 'bonds' model of intelligence, a theory we have shown was equal to that of Spearman's 'two factor' model, and explored the debates and discussions between Thomson, Spearman and Thorndike. Thomson pioneered the use of factor analysis and maximum likelihood estimation: innovative work on a new mathematical model is taking Thomson's ideas into contemporary brain studies.\n\n\n\nA major component and outcome of the project has been the collection, catalogue, conservation and deposit of core documents and texts in Edinburgh University Special Collections. This material, with its analysis, is the basis for the claim for a significant 'Scottish School'. This new archive has created a novel, coherent collection from earlier holdings, combined with a major university retrieval process of undiscovered material relating especially to the scientific, testing lab and university research leadership of Thomson (and colleagues) at the combined research and training department (Moray House). This archive is now linked to other sites, connecting elements of the 'School' together, and will enable future researchers to research the significant work of the 'School', for example, in research organisation or on the history of testing. Until now, this rich period of Scottish theoretical, methodological and policy innovation, in psychology and educational research, has not existed as a place or subject of study. \n\n\n\nThe project has revealed the possibilities of studying disciplinary, scientific and the national/international in educational research and psychology through period, place and space by the re-analysis of contemporary documents; the relational study of separated events, institutions and actors; the flow of scientific data and processes, and the significance of cross border exchanges; and through the close examination of tools, concepts, training and projects. The collection of original archival materials has been lodged with Special Collections at Edinburgh University and is now available for others to view and use. \nThe collection of pre-existing archival materials remains with the study and is available as a resource for other researchers. \nFindings from the study have helped with planning further grant applications, and understanding more of the background to the follow-up studies of the Scottish Mental Surveys.
