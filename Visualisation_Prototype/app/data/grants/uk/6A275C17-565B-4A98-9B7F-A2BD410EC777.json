This is a very common disease and when it occurs the chances of survival are rather poor. Major issues in sepsis are that the patient blood pressure becomes very low and their blood vessels become leaky. Together this causes a lot of harm and many of the bodies organs are not supplied with enough blood and so they become injured. Recently we identified a new pathway that lowers blood pressure in healthy people. We have some preliminary evidence this mechanism becomes overactive in sepsis to uncontrollably and overly lower blood pressure. We will test if this is true and try and identify strategies that prevent this from happening as these may be protective to humans with sepsis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K003232/1","grantId":"MR/K003232/1","fundValue":"151405","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Eaton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
