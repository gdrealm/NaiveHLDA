This learning process, known as plasticity, involves the strengthening and weakening of synapses, the contacts by means of which nerve cells communicate with each other. \nThis projects aims at directly correlating functional changes in one part of the brain, the visual cortex, with events at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The visual cortex responds to abnormal visual experience during a so-called critical period early in life in a relatively predictable manner. Closure of one eye (for example, by wearing an eye-patch), results in a disconnection of that eye from the visual cortex and therefore loss of vision. This is mirrored by shrinkage of that eyeâ€™s ocular dominance (OD) columns. These are bands in the visual cortex innervated by the two eyes. They can be visualized using functional brain imaging methods. First, we will examine more closely the conditions which lead to loss of vision in animals and identify part-time patching regimens which allow normal vision to be maintained. Second, we propose to take very small tissue samples (biopsies), from OD columns representing the two eyes. We will then analyse the detailed make-up of a protein complex situated at excitatory synapses within each sample, a protein complex that is thought to be critically involved in the modulation of synaptic strength. We believe that this approach will tell us how learning works at a cellular level. Third, we are interested in how communication of neurons via inhibitory synapses controls their susceptibility to the effects of eye closure. To this end, we will manipulate levels of inhibition pharmacologically and examine whether or how this affects OD columns following patching.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500186","grantId":"G0500186","fundValue":"430871","fundStart":"2005-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Sengpiel","coPersons":["Peter Conell Kind"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
