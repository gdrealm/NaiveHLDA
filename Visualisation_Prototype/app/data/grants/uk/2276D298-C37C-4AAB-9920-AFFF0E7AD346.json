{"id":"2276D298-C37C-4AAB-9920-AFFF0E7AD346","title":"Building epithelial cytoarchitecture:regulation of actin dynamics by cell-cell junctions","abstractText":"Cell-cell adhesion and migration are key events in the life of many different cell types, and are essential for the organization of cells into higher ordered structures such as blood vessels, lung, skin, muscle, etc. Epithelial cells differentiate and form sheets of tightly packed cells: these sheets form protective layers wrapping up the body (skin) and the inside of internal cavities (i.e. stomach, intestines, etc). The choice of whether to migrate or stick to their neighbours has implications for epithelial function in health and disease. Thus, it is important to understand how a cell is kept inside an epithelial sheet or detaches and become shapeless, homeless and aimless. Epithelial cells can not function properly in the absence of tight cell-cell adhesion and a cuboidal morphology. We are interested in understanding how cells glue to their neighbours in order to regulate their shape and differentiation. We aim at identifying the molecules that participate in these processes and investigate their role in epithelia. Insights into how epithelial cell shape is established and maintained will provide clues on how to ameliorate diseases that have compromised epithelial function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D019400/1","grantId":"BB/D019400/1","fundValue":"330344","fundStart":"2006-09-26","fundEnd":"2010-04-25","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vania  Braga","coPersons":["Louise Pauline Cramer"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
