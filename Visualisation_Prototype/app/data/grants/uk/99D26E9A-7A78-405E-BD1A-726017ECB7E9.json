{"id":"99D26E9A-7A78-405E-BD1A-726017ECB7E9","title":"Understanding the Labour Market Impact of Immigration in Britain","abstractText":"<p>This research project aims to concentrate on the processes which affect population, society and the economy in contemporary Britain as a result of increased international migration flow in Britain and investigates the impact of immigration on the British labour market, with particular attention to the effects of immigration on the labour market outcomes of native workers. The research will fill a gap in existing knowledge about the impact of immigration on British labour market by exploring the relationship between skill levels of native workers, size and composition of the immigrant population, overall opportunity structure of the labour market and the labour market outcomes of native workers at the level of local labour markets. It will also offer inter-UK comparisons that enable the significance of differences in (a) policy (b) skill levels of immigrants and (c) socio-demographic characteristics of the native population within a shared UK labour market to be tested. The data sources selected (Labour Force Surveys [LFS], Annual Labour Force Surveys Local Areas data; the Annual Population Survey [APS] for 2004 and the Office for National Statistics supplementary data local areas data sets on ethnicity) provide excellent resources for secondary analysis. Multilevel regression technique will be used for the suggested analyses.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003641/1","grantId":"ES/F003641/1","fundValue":"75819","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marina  Shapira","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
