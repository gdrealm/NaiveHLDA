{"id":"31478728-8C26-459A-953D-099B5F798ECA","title":"Dropping in and dropping out: understanding cultural value from the perspectives of lapsed or partial arts participants","abstractText":"This project aims to explore attitudes towards the arts and cultural value amongst 'culturally aware non-attenders' (Winzenried, 2004; Dobson &amp; Pitts, 2012) - the sector of the population who are receptive to arts involvement, but are currently minimally engaged. Three interlinked interview and survey studies will include people who have previously learnt a musical instrument but no longer play, as well as those with an interest in one art form who are unlikely to attend another. For this substantial sector of the population, their perception of the value of the arts is only partially translated into action, making them a potentially rich source of arts advocacy and involvement, if the means can be found to further activate their latent interest.\n\nThe three studies will take place as follows:\n\nStudy 1: The violin in the attic - investigating lapsed musical participation\nThis study will focus on amateur musicians, exploring the experiences and attitudes of those who no longer play, and who commonly cite pressures of time, family, and work as having caused them to cease involvement (Pitts, 2005;2012). Through in-depth interviews with around 30 'lapsed' members of musical groups, this study will explore how the benefits and costs of musical participation are articulated by those who no longer actively participate, and will identify the factors in causing participants to cease their involvement. These findings will shed new light on cultural value as perceived by those who have other priorities in their lives, and will help to propose strategies for retaining and re-engaging such people as active participants.\n\nStudy 2: Loyalty and its limitations - exploring cultural value across art forms\nThis large-scale questionnaire study will explore the articulation of cultural value across genres, by questioning those who attend a narrow range of arts events about their experiences of their chosen genre, and their broader understanding of arts in society. Responses will be sought from audiences in a range of venues, including independent cinema, theatre, concert halls and museums; each will be asked about their frequency of attendance, factors in choices of events, openness to other art forms, and attitudes towards less familiar arts. The study will therefore highlight any differences between the attitudes and experiences of audiences at specific arts events - and so shed light on whether 'cultural value' is generic to arts engagement, or needs to be more subtly defined for different audiences.\n\nStudy 3: Cultural value in lives and localities\nThis study will return to the in-depth interview approach used in Study 1, so allowing for comparisons between lapsed arts participants and occasional arts attenders, as well as deepening the evidence from Study 2 with a closer exploration of how attitudes and patterns of engagement are formed in adult life. Around 30 volunteers from Study 2 will be interviewed using a life history approach (cf. Pitts, 2012) to explore their level of past engagement, and how this has shaped their perceptions of the contribution of the arts to their life and to the local community. This study therefore offers another perspective on the factors that promote and inhibit involvement in the arts, and on the articulation of cultural value that surrounds those participation decisions. \n\nThe project will generate data and discussion of academic interest (to be published in at least two journals of different related disciplines) and of practical value to arts organisations (to be reported through the Sheffield Performer and Audience Research Centre website - http://www.sparc.dept.shef.ac.uk/). Findings will be reported back to arts organisations, local government and Arts Council representatives, so fulfilling the aims of the AHRC agenda on a local, social scale as well as through contribution to academic debate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005476/1","grantId":"AH/L005476/1","fundValue":"30025","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings were reported to the Sheffield Culture Consortium, who expressed some interest in working collaboratively on future projects, but these have yet to materialise.\n\nMusic in the Round, a long-term collaborator of mine, have recently introduced a 'Concert Club', in which young people are taken in groups to concerts and encouraged to discuss the experience over a drink afterwards.

Four linked studies were carried out with arts audiences and participants in Sheffield, reaching the following headline findings:\nOn lapsed participants\no Musical participants generally face challenges of life transitions, pressures of work and family commitments, or illness and ageing - key differences emerge in the extent to which musical participation adds to or relieves other pressures\no Levels of musical confidence are affected by feelings of acceptance and belonging within an ensemble \no Experience of musical participation build skill levels and shape lifelong attitudes, with adults more likely to return to playing if they had formed a strong musical identity in adolescence\no Viewing music as an obligation or habit, rather than a passion, was often a precursor to dropping out\no Articulating participants' musical goals and personal needs could be a useful way to increase retention and satisfaction in ensembles\nOn audiences\no Audiences appreciate the quality of arts events, but are sometimes distracted by the small annoyances of booking systems and/or staff, or the lack of variety in programming\no Rising/high ticket prices make some audience members more selective about their arts attendance, seeking a guarantee that they will enjoy an event \no Audiences for different arts have different priorities, giving more or less emphasis to programming and repertoire, live experience and affordability \no New audiences have quite different experiences from regular attenders, often feeling they need more background knowledge in order to be enjoy an event to the full There are practical implications for arts organisations, seeking to recruit and retain audiences: the research suggests that publishing peer reviews of events (a 'Trip Advisor' style guarantee of a good night out) would overcome some of the reluctance of infrequent event attenders. Conductors of amateur groups might also usefully apply the findings to audit and meet their members' social and musical needs, ensuring commitment to the musical group.
