Some, presently taking data, continue to publish new results that advance our knowledge of the fundamental interactions of nature, and the others are in various stages of instrumentation construction and commissioning. Analysis techniques and physics simulation are also underway in order to allow results to be extracted from future data. Presently in operation: the BaBar experiment at PEP II, at SLAC, provides new measurements of CP-violation parameters that are testing the validity of present theories and their assumptions, while the H1 experiment at HERA, DESY continues taking data that has already contributed to testing the predictions of the Standard Model, and has potential for new discoveries. For our experiments being prepared for future machines: at the CERN LHC, at Geneva, installation, integration and final commissioning are in progress for the ATLAS experiment, targeted for first data in 2007, where we will test current concepts at the TeV energy scale, and reveal either the expected (but as yet) missing bosons, through new discoveries, or else impose new requirements within the Standard Model or its Supersymmetric alternatives. For operation beyond the LHC start-up we have developed accelerator-related instrumentation and techniques related to a operation of the international electron-positron Linear Collider which will explore the new physics identified at the LHC. The Queen Mary Group is also at the forefront of developments in a planned new long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan, and in providing massive in-house computing resources that will allow the maximum overall physics returns to come from our present and future ventures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000363/1","grantId":"PP/E000363/1","fundValue":"5488880","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Antony  Carter","coPersons":["Adrian John Bevan","Eric F.
