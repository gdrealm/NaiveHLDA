{"id":"AD194E9A-8BA6-468D-9163-FE22EDCF9998","title":"Modular Lie powers and applications","abstractText":"A module, in the sense used here, is a mathematical object consisting of a space and a group acting on the space. For example, we could take ordinary 2-dimensional space, choose an axis, that is, a straight line in the space, and then take the set of all possible rotations of 3-dimensional space about the axis, by any number of degrees. The set of all these rotations is an example of what mathematicians call a group: the key property is that the result of applying one rotation followed by another is again a rotation (for example, rotation by 20 degrees followed by a rotation by 15 degrees results in a rotation by 35 degrees). Modules are of fundamental importance in mathematics. If we are given a module then there are various natural ways of forming new modules from it. Among these new modules are the so-called Lie powers of the original module. (The construction of these utilise another mathematical object called a Lie algebra.) The purpose of this project is to investigate properties of the Lie powers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G025487/1","grantId":"EP/G025487/1","fundValue":"130301","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Karin  Erdmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" This studied the structure of the homogenous components of the free Lie algebra over prime characteristic p as a module for the general linear group.\n\nClosely related, it studied the structure of the Lie module of the symmetric\n\ngroup. \n\nAmongst the main results we show how this reduces to the case when\n\nthe homogeneous components degree a power of p.
