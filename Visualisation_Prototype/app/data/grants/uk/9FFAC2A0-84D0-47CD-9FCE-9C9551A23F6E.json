{"id":"9FFAC2A0-84D0-47CD-9FCE-9C9551A23F6E","title":"Biologically-Inspired Massively Parallel Architectures - computing beyond a million processors","abstractText":"The human brain remains as one of the great frontiers of science - how does this organ upon which we all depend so critically actually do its job? A great deal is known about the underlying technology - the neuron - and we can observe large-scale brain activity through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, but this knowledge barely starts to tell us how the brain works. Something is happening at the intermediate levels of processing that we have yet to begin to understand, but the essence of the brain's information processing function probably lies in these intermediate levels. To get at these middle layers requires that we build models of very large systems of spiking neurons, with structures inspired by the increasingly detailed findings of neuroscience, in order to investigate the emergent behaviours, adaptability and fault-tolerance of those systems.Our goal in this project is to deliver machines of unprecedented cost-effectiveness for this task, and to make them readily accessible to as wide a user base as possible. We will also explore the applicability of the unique architecture that has emerged from the pursuit of this goal to other important application domains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G015775/1","grantId":"EP/G015775/1","fundValue":"892622","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  see apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software) ","person":"Andrew David Brown","coPersons":["Peter  Wilson","Jeffrey  Reeve","John Edward Chad"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" This single project is a continuation of a strategic chain of grants, stretching back over around 6 years now. The original vision was - and still is - for a neural simulation system, based of a cohort of ARM processors, interacting via a communication infrastructure that was significantly different in concept to anything that had been previously utilised. The dominant property that set this computer ensemble apart from its peers was the untimed (asynchronous) nature of the peer-to-peer communication. Designed to simulate the behaviour of neural assemblies of hitherto unattainable size, it relies on the system communicating in biological real time, thereby eliminating the need for real-time clocks or timing, and, most importantly, synchronisation.\n\nThe project is currently (July 2012) half-way through, and we have just taken delivery of the first sizeable board-level realisation of the system - a card with over 800 cores on it. SpiNNaker is an extremely powerful computing concept, radically different to anything that currently exists. In the future, we hope to extend the scope and ambition, and focus as much on exploitation and use as on underlying development. Prototype hardware exists and functions (almost) exactly as it was intended (and is thus currently highlighting the things that no-one thought of). The next generation involves the original University partners, plus a portfolio of industrial and academic interests it would be disingenuous to report yet. The INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility) UK node will also be involved in shaping the course of some of the neural activities. In the course of execution of the first stages of the SpiNNaker project (now around half-way through) it became clear that the architecture was superbly suited to a whole range of problems, not just neural simulation. One of the activity threads in previous grants involved expending considerable effort in &quot;bridge-building&quot; with the neuroinformatics community, and one consequence of this was that it became equally clear that the biological application space was much larger than we had anticipated.\n\nSignificant additional funding has been obtained from the EU to assist various aspects of our work.
