The aim is to demonstrate similarity between the two versions in terms of meaning of social inclusion, questions used to assess it, and the wording and interpretation of questions used in each language. This will enable assessment of social inclusion among various Chinese-speaking populations, including disadvantaged groups.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>‘Concept mapping’ will facilitate comparison of views about social inclusion in groups of people in Hong Kong and the UK (already asked). SCOPE will be translated into Chinese, and back-translated into English, and any differences resolved and explained. SCOPE-C will be piloted to test appropriateness and acceptability before being used in UK and Hong Kong samples. Using these data and previously collected SCOPE data for similar UK mental health samples, it will be possible to compare Hong Kong and UK mental health services users, as well as resident Hong Kong Chinese, Chinese immigrants in the UK and other UK residents, in terms of their inclusion. SCOPE-C will also be compared with other standardised, validated measures to examine its relationship with similar or related constructs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005227/1","grantId":"ES/K005227/1","fundValue":"107050","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John HuxleySherrill  Evans","coPersons":["Ka Wah  CHAN","Wai Yee  Cheung","Marcus Yu Lung  Chiu","Ho Ting  Wong"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
