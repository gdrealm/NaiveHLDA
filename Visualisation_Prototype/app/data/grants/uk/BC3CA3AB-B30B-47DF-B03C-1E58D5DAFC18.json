The field is at the crossroads of several disciplines including physics, biology, materials, mathematics and chemistry. Following the rapid evolution of electronics subsequent to the invention of the transistor in the late 1940's, the coming decades will see photonics impact most areas of our lives including future internet infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, radical new approaches to Healthcare, Lighting and enabling a revolution in sensing and imaging. However, convention teaches us that focussing of light is constrained by the Abb&eacute; diffraction limit, that light penetrates tissue poorly due to Rayleigh and Mie scattering and that collimated, coherent light emission requires a laser. By challenging such established conventions with a transformative understanding of the fundamentals of light propagation, we can create a paradigm shift; while the 20th century was the century of the electron, we firmly believe that the 21st will be the century of the photon. In order to realize this vision, we need to explore the fundamental concepts of coherently shaping light in phase, amplitude and polarization - structuring light - to unveil startling advances. In particular, the structuring and shaping of light will break through perceived limits and open up the next generation of opportunities, particularly in the burgeoning areas of healthcare and biophotonics.\n\nFour projects will run in parallel and by combining their outputs, we aim to overcome current limits in Photonics and address major Challenges such as super-resolution microscopy, nanoscopic sensing, single cell proteomics, ubiquitous laser-like sources, spatially controlled optogenetics, therapy and imaging at depth","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01771X/1","grantId":"EP/J01771X/1","fundValue":"4450960","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kishan  Dholakia","coPersons":["Ifor  Samuel","Thomas  Krauss"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
