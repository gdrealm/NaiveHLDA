The current activities in research coordination will probably not lead directly to new research collaborations, but they will help raise awareness of our long-term plans and capabilities. The best outcome would be a joint project exploring genetic variation in European and Chinese wheat varieties Chemicals ","person":"Michael Webster Bevan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" The purpose of this travel award is to explore opportunities for coordinating research in wheat genomics and genetics between the JIC and Chinese laboratories. Various meetings have been held here, in China and at PAG in the USA where most academics in the field congregate. As this grant still has a year to run more work needs to be done to help coordinate work among potential Chinese partners. In the meantime excellent progress in genomics and assessing sequence variation in wheat diversity lines is being made that can form the foundations of association studies of complex traits such as yield The point of this project is to help align wheat genetic and genomic research between the UK and China. So there will be mutual benefit to several UK and and Chinese labs when the coordination activities have reached a successful conclusion Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
