The process is very fast - a hen can make an egg in about 20 hours. The shell itself has a complicated structure whose features are essential for the health of the embryo it contains. Recent experimental data have identified several proteins associated with the formation of egg shells. One class of proteins (C-type lectin-like proteins) appears to be particularly important in controlling calcite deposition for various bird species, although how the proteins do this is not well understood. Studies with ovocleidin-17 (chicken) and ansocalcin (goose) have showed that these proteins both encourage crystals to form and have a strong effect on their growth and shape. Simulations are essential to understand how this happens. We will model the interaction between ovocleidin-17 and various CaCO3 surfaces in the presence of water. This will enable us to understanding what parts of the molecule determine the shape of the crystal and why they are important. A particular highlight will be the use of metadynamics on HECToR to determine how ovocleidin-17 affects the free energy of amorphous calcium carbonate particles and their transformation to a crystalline phase. These simulations will provide extremely valuable information for experimental groups seeking to design new molecules to produce particular crystal types and shapes. This is part of biomimetics, the strategy of using biological ideas to guide the search for new materials and processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F055471/1","grantId":"EP/F055471/1","fundValue":"11096","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The paper has been cited 39 times in the literature since 2009 including a number of reviews. It has furthered the understanding of nucleation and growth and the way in which complex molecules can control the process of biomineralisation and encouraged the development of protein-mimics that can show the level of control suggested by our study of ovocleidin. On the biological side, it has also encouraged a detailed investigation of avian eggshells to see whether proteins like ovocleidin are common constituents of eggshells.

Our simulations modelled the effect of the protein on the crystallisation of calcium carbonate and showed two main effects. First, the crystal structure of calcium carbonate nanoparticles depends on the particle size with potentially no structure at small sizes. Second, we demonstrated that the presence of the protein could control the preferred structure of the calcium carbonate. These were used to develop a model of how the protein could generate calcite nanoparticles through a quasi-catalytic process. These simulations demonstrated the power of a new technique (metadynamics) to generate free energy surfaces for complex systems. The understanding of how proteins can control the size and shape of crystals is essential to the understanding of biomineralisation; the fundamental process whereby organisms make minerals. If we can understand the essential features that these molecules must possess to be able to control mineral characteristics, this would enable synthetic chemists to design molecules to make nanostructures with particular structures and properties. This is the goal of biomimetics; whereby ideas are taken from natural processes to develop new methods of synthesising complex structures.
