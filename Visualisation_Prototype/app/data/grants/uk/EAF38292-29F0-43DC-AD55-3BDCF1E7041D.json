{"id":"EAF38292-29F0-43DC-AD55-3BDCF1E7041D","title":"International Collaborations on High Energy Density Matter","abstractText":"High energy density matter is an exciting research field as it combines fundamental, astrophysical and energy research. The creation of such matter in the laboratory is very difficult as it is under enormous pressure after large amounts of energy are deposited (usually above 1 Megabar or 1 million times the pressure of our atmosphere). However, such large pressures naturally exist in the interior of giant planets (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn and many planets outside our solar system) and inside stars. Thus, enhancing our knowledge in high energy density physics increases our understanding of the universe and its development. The most exciting technical application that needs high energy density physics is energy production by means of inertial fusion energy. One way to make the energy source of the stars applicable for energy production is to compress the fuel 1000 times while heating it to over 10 million degrees. This approach is currently tested at the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, USA. When successful, this new energy source can revolutionise our modern world, but the first success as well as further optimisation will require an improved understanding of high energy density matter.The present project will address these problems in three ways: Firstly, the applicant will participate in an experiment on high energy density matter which uses the brand-new x-ray laser LCLS in Stanford, USA. Here, we (a large, UK-led international collaboration) will test the melting and further heating of carbon under ultra-fast energy deposition. Secondly, it combines the theoretical work done at Warwick with the expertise of the experimental team in Livermore. Here, the question of how such exotic states of matter can be diagnosed in the laboratory will be discussed. Thirdly, current issues in fusion research (especially heat transport and distribution) will be addressed. The applicant and the simulation group in Livermore will discuss how new models developed in Warwick can be implemented in the large computer models that are needed to simulate real fusion experiments. This can lay the ground for a very important UK-US connection on energy research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028994/1","grantId":"EP/I028994/1","fundValue":"7978","fundStart":"2010-11-25","fundEnd":"2011-10-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The travel grant enabled a number of trips were existing collaborations were strengthened and new collaborations were made.

Within this collaboration we have, e.g., discovered that the particles in dense matter interact very differently than older theories predict. This gives rise to a different microscopic structure as well as different macroscopic behaviour. The new microphysics discovered will serve as input for many theories and simulations. The new models have already been inplemented in analysis codes for experiments. Finally, it serves as a part of the science basis for inertial fusion energy.
