Although they do not manifest themselves directly in the macroscopic world, strong interactions account for the stability of matter, since they are responsible for forces that bind neutrons and protons inside nuclei. Neutrons and protons are members of a wider family of particles, the hadrons, all of which interact strongly. The hadrons are not elementary particles: they are made of more fundamental particles, quarks and gluons. In electromagnetism particles interact through their electric charge; in strong interactions particles interact through a charge which this time is called pictorially colour. In nature there are three different colour charges; we speak then of the red, blue and green quarks, referring by the colour to the particular charge carried by a particle (which has nothing to do with the colours we see in our everyday experience). The theory that describes quark, gluons and their interaction is QCD. Currently, QCD (whose fine details are going to be tested at LHC) is not fully understood: while we have clear analytical predictions for the high energy regime (energies of 1 GeV or more), analytical computation techniques we currently know can not be used in the low energy regime. Unfortunately this is the most interesting regime, since e.g. quarks inside nucleons have low energies. In the absence of analytical predictions, a successful numerical approach has been developed: Monte Carlo based simulations of the theory discretised on a lattice. In this approach, the theory is formulated on a discrete and finite spacetime of spacing a and linear dimension L. This simplified theory is formulated in terms of a finite number of integrals, which can be performed on a (super)computer. The continuous theory is recovered by extrapolating to the limits L going to infinity and a going to zero. In order to fully exploit the predictive power of the calculations, an analytical understanding is still needed. Much progress has been achieved on this side by considering QCD as a special case of a more general class of theories. One possibility in this sense is to take the large N limit for a SU(N) gauge theory coupled to quarks. QCD is recovered when N=3. The large N theory is simpler than the original N=3 one, and corrections to it due to a finite value of N can be expressed as a power series in 1/N. Recently the lattice has proved to be an useful tool for determining the unknown coefficients of that power series in the absence of quarks. We plan to extend that work also when Nf quarks are included in the theory. Another interesting direction is the Orientifold planar equivalence. This is a different large N limit that relates theories with generalised quarks: a SU(N) gauge theory with an antisymmetric quark on one side and a SU(N) gauge theory with an adjoint quark on the other. The predictive power of this framework is due to the fact that the latter is related to N=1 Super Yang-Mills, for which much is know analytically, while the former reduces to QCD with one quark when N=3. Open questions remain, like the size of the corrections to recover QCD with the correct number of flavours or to go from the infinite N case to N=3. One of the central points of our project is to answer those questions. This will require a non-trivial generalisation of currently used lattice QCD algorithms and techniques. Once we have developed the techniques to simulate a generic number of fermions in a generic representation of a SU(N) gauge group, we would have the tools to attack other interesting problems, like N=1 Super Yang-Mills on the lattice and alternative scenarios for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Both those problems have a high phenomenological relevance, and will be studied at the upcoming LHC experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E007228/1","grantId":"PP/E007228/1","fundValue":"190196","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The core software produced during the project finds various applications in various fields (finance, meteorology etc.) that require performing numerical simulations on state of the art supercomputers Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other Economic","person":"Biagio  Lucini","coPersons":["Adi  Armoni"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":" The recent discovery of the Higgs boson has advanced our understanding of the standard model of particle interactions. One of the principal roles of the Higgs field is to give mass to the carriers of the weak force. The mechanism through which this happens is called electroweak symmetry breaking. However, theoretical considerations show us that electroweak symmetry breaking through the Higgs field must be an effective mechanism. Hence, a more fundamental explanation is needed. One of the crucial questions in theoretical high energy physics is what is the fundamental mechanism that breaks the electroweak symmetry. Among other conjectures, an open possibility is that the symmetry is broken by a new strong force. We have studied with Monte Carlo calculations on state of the art supercomputers models of strong dynamics, providing solid evidence of the viability of this phenomenon as the fundamental mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The main beneficiary of our work in the short to medium term is the academic community, which can build on our results to propose new improved models of electroweak symmetry breaking and new experiments to test them. In addition, in order to perform our calculations, we produced an advanced simulation software that is very flexible and can be used for a diverse set of applications requiring supercomputers. As a demonstration, we have produced an advanced benchmarking suite for supercomputers called BSMBench. The tool is currently being commercialised.
