Effects on growth at these early stages of life can have profound consequences for adult health. Most of the events that determine final body mass and function are controlled by protein found circulating in blood. This factor is called Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF1). Traditional knowledge indicates that this factor is made in the liver in response to growth hormone (GH) signals. We propose that this is not the entire picture and another factor ? Cytokine Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1) - produced by the immune cells called macrophages contribute to the control the GH/IGF-1 system and thus contribute to the control of postnatal growth. We base this hypothesis on our data indicating that animals which lack CSF1 function have a range of developmental and growth abnormalities in common to animals deficient in GH/IGF-1. Although our preliminary data is compelling, the challenge remains to understand how these various factors interact to control growth. With this knowledge we will be better able to evaluate strategies to overcome growth impairment. To address these goals we aim to exploit new transgenic technologies in the rat. Specifically we will determine the consequence of reducing CSF1 signalling on growth and beneficial effects of elevating CSF1 levels as a possible treatment of impaired growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901193","grantId":"G0901193","fundValue":"650243","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2014-06-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Arthur Hume","coPersons":["Christopher Bruce Whitelaw","Thomas Grant Burdon","Colin  Farquharson"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
