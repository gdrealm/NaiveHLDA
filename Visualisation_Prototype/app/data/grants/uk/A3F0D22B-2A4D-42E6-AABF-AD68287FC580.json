An established division in psychology and neuroscience research has been between a flexible, map-like navigation system, and a habit-like, fixed route-learning system. We tend to become aware of the habit system when it exerts too much control over our behaviour, such as when we find ourselves driving to the office when we meant to take an alternative route, following a lapse of concentration. \n\nCurrently, two influential models of how these flexible and habit systems function in navigation have been developed, both accounting for important findings in behavioural and brain-systems research. One model focuses on differences between systems at the level of input. In this model the map system codes where things are based on their location with respect to large-scale environmental contours and boundaries, such as room shape in enclosed environments and fences, rivers, and tree-lines in open environments. In contrast, the habit system codes specific actions to be performed with respect to single landmarks e.g. turning left at the junction with the supermarket on the right. A second model focuses instead on whether the type of learning distinguishes flexible and habit-based navigation. In this approach, the flexible system is able to form a &quot;model&quot; of the world, such that if turning left at the junction is appropriate in some situations (such as going to the office), but not others (such as going to the supermarket), this system is able to take account of these contextual associations. The habit system however, accumulates only a history of rewarded responses, so for example if turning left for the office occurs more frequently than turning right for the supermarket, the habit system will exert behavioural pull to turn left, irrespective of one's current goal to go shopping.\n\nThe aim of the proposed research is to test which of these models is correct, which in turn will answer the fundamental question of how information is processed within and between brain systems. We will gather behavioural and brain scanning data from healthy humans navigating in virtual environments. These data will be used to address three objectives. First, do the brain systems responsible for flexible navigation and fixed route-learning rely on different types of input or different types of learning? That is, do different brain systems process different types of information, or do they process the same kinds of information differently? Second, route-learning has typically been thought not to rely on a brain region known as the hippocampus, yet recent research has shown that the hippocampus is necessary for some forms of route-learning. We hypothesise that this is because under some circumstances route-learning requires a model of the world. We will test the conditions required for hippocampus-based route-learning, and predict that the hippocampus will be required when a sequence of actions must be learned; that is, the action chosen at a particular point in time depends on the actions that came before. The third objective is to apply the factors found to be important in flexible route-learning (objectives 1 and 2) to fire evacuation behaviour in a virtual environment of a real building. This will enable us to optimise training strategies for rehearsing emergency escape behaviour. Some everyday behaviours, such as always entering and leaving one's place of work by the same route, may inhibit flexibility, such as using an unfamiliar exit during an emergency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M01066X/1","grantId":"ES/M01066X/1","fundValue":"362465","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  McGregor","coPersons":["Dina  Lew","Jason David Connolly","Shamus  Smith"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
