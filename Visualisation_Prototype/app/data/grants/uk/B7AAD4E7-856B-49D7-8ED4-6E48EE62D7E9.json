We find that if another European country were to introduce a Patent Box all countries could expect to see a reduction in tax revenues from patent income. We have successfully secured initial funding (from the International Tax Policy Forum) for Helen Miller to take this work forward. We will seek further funding to consider what the revenue maximising tax rates are for intellectual property in a context where governments strategically set a separate tax rate for patent income.

Intellectual property is very mobile, and can often be separated from the location of real activities. Policy makers face the challenge of formulating effective policy in this environment. A number of European countries have recently introduced a Patent Box - a reduction in the rate of corporation tax for the income derived from patents. \n\nThis project develops and estimates a model of where firms hold intellectual property in order to study the impact of corporate taxes; we apply it to data on the location of firms' patents. Our key contribution to the academic literature is to allow flexibility in the way firms respond along unobservable dimensions; we introduce unobserved heterogeneity into a model of location choice. This is important because it helps to provide more realistic substitution patterns across locations.\n\nOur results suggest that, on average, higher corporate taxes reduce the likelihood that a firm chooses a location, but there is significant variation around the mean response. We use the model to simulate the impact of recent Patent Box proposals and find that they do attract patent income but result in substantial losses in government revenues. \n\nInitial results suggest that, while there is a high degree of co-location of patent holdings and the underlying research, there is evidence of higher degrees of separation when there are sufficient tax incentives. One of our key aims in this project was to contribute to the academic literature. The central output of this project so far is the paper: Griffith, R., Miller, H., and O'Connell, M. (2011) 'Corporate taxes and the location of intellectual property'. We have submitted this paper to the Journal of Public Economics. \n\nProfessor Rachel Griffith (the PI) and Helen Miller presented versions of this paper at various stages of progress to a range of audiences.\n- Rachel Griffith presented at a number Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
