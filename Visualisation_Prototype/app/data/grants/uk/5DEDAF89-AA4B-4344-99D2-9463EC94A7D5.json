{"id":"5DEDAF89-AA4B-4344-99D2-9463EC94A7D5","title":"Strategic modulation of dynamic aspects of facial and vocal attractiveness.","abstractText":"<p>Physical attractiveness is very important in human social perception, and a biological approach has been successful by relating attractiveness to biological quality. However much facial research has relied on photographs which lack realism - after all, real faces are dynamic not static. This may mean that the attractiveness of a given face can change depending on how it moves. </p>\n\n<p>This project will measure the quantitative extent to which attractiveness is a fixed property of the face or depends on movement. This will be done by isolating static and dynamic cues using face-tracking methods to create motion-capture type stimuli. </p>\n\n<p>The project will also explore whether people can strategically modulate their attractiveness through the way they use their faces by isolating facial movement from people in conversation with same-sex and opposite-sex partners of different levels of attractiveness. If strategic modulation is possible, people should make themselves more attractive when trying to impress an attractive potential mate. </p>\n\n<p>The voice is also important in attractiveness judgments, but vocal properties such as pitch can be changed. This project will measure whether people strategically modulate physical properties of their voices to make themselves more or less attractive.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I009620/1","grantId":"ES/I009620/1","fundValue":"94698","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward Ralph Morrison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
