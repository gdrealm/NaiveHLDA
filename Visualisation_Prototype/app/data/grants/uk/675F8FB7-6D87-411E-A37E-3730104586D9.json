Such a process is even more crucial when it comes to the engineering novel nanometer-sized particles that can deliver therapeutic agents across the different barrier targeting only the damaged sites. Today such effort collectively known as Nanomedicine, is revolutionizing traditional therapy and enabling completely new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. Nanomedicine is a multifaceted discipline that involves physicists, chemists, engineers, biologists and clinicians. This interdisciplinary nature is possibly nanomedicine greatest strength and greatest weakness at the same time. Indeed while this allows a more complete understanding of the different physico-chemical aspects as well as the biological implications, often the methodologies and the approaches are substantially different across the different disciplines hindering the validation and the fast translation of the final results. Herein we propose a rigorous approach of synthesis and pre-clincial evaluation of many nanoparticles for the delivery of theraupetic genetic materials. These will be screened developing and employing state-of-the-art biological evaluations adapted for nanoparticles. We plan to screen for thousands of formulation and aiming to identify few that will have a tremendous impact in both cancer therapy and motoneuron-degenerative disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I001697/1","grantId":"EP/I001697/1","fundValue":"964752","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project was divided into two streams: one side we implemented new chemical method to create clinical compatible polymers. We have particularly builded on our previous finding to create alternative based on biodegradable and biocompatible materials.\nSee Themistou, E., Battaglia, G., &amp; Armes, S. P. (2014). Facile synthesis of thiol-functionalized amphiphilic polylactide-methacrylic diblock copolymers. Polymer Chemistry, 5(4), 1405-1417.\nand a further paper (using the same chemistry but for scaffold engineering) is under review with Biomacromolecules)\nSimilar we have also optimised a new method to study surface topology on polymerise using metal labelling to identify polymer clusters with single chain resolution\nManuscript under review with Polymer Chemistry\n\nFinally we established a group of protocols to perform nanomedicine discovery. These are performed in three stages, high content imaging using 2D cell culture assay based on cells associated with the targeted tissue (e.g. Brain endothelial cells for Blood brain barrier (BBB), or cancer cells for tumour targeting) whose uptake of nanoparticle is weighted against three sentinel cells (two immune cells and one stromal one). \nThis high content screening is followed by a 3D in vitro assessment where we borrowed tools from tissue engineering to re-construct important physiological parameters. \nFor the tumour models we constructed in vitro 3D solid tumour to asses tissue penetration and hence to identify nanoparticles capable of carrying therapeutic loads right to the core of the tumour. \nWe joined our data with another ongoing project in the group and this paper was generated:\nColley et al, Mol. Pharmaceutics, 2014, 11 (4), pp 1176-1188\nFor the BBB, we recreate a 3D polarised endothelial layer which contain CNS resident cells (e.g. Astrocytes) and perivascular cells (e.g. pericytes). This has allowed us to identify nanoparticles capable of actively trafficking across the tight blood barrier. \nFinally the successful formulations were tested in animal model with some very interesting outcome and validating our original hypothesis.\nThe BBB work has been the most fruitful with one paper submitted in Scientific Report and currently under review\nTwo more manuscripts are in preparation\nOne to describe our in vitro 3D BBB model and one to detailed the high content screening protocol.\n\nThe results are now being used to translate the technology to other clinical challenges including more focused Cancer targeting and several neurological disorders spanning from ALS, SMA, Parkinsons, Stroke and Alzehmeir.\nWe have however set up a series of screening protocols that can be translated horizontally in several clinical applications as well as integrating them for drug discovery tools. We are now in negotiation with several pharmaceutical companies to perform some validation studies as well as discussing with UCLB the possibility to set up a spin out company Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal,Economic","person":"Giuseppe  Battaglia","coPersons":["Mimoun  Azzouz","Steven  Armes","Nicola Jane Brown"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We have implemented a method to create nanoparticles based on block copolymers to be used for targeted delivery. The results have showed the creation of more complex and efficient systems that have been tested in both cancer targeting as well as targeting the blood system that control access to the central nervous system. We are now finalising our publication and we will also publish our protocols in our web pages to ensure maximum distribution.
