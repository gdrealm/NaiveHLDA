{"id":"9AF53992-5ACC-4343-9CDB-06F2B8461964","title":"Phase Change Materials based Tunable NEMS","abstractText":"Tunable resonators have wide ranging applications such as in positioning systems (eg. portable GPS) and in many satellite systems, as well as in almost all wireless devices such as the mobile phone. Better the resonator, more favorable it is for the application in terms of speed, as well as signal quality. MEMS and NEMS have potential for very high quality factors, which can be taken advantage of for designing such resonators. One of the important characteristics of a resonator is its ability to adjust its frequency quickly, so that it can lock in to a signal speedily. In this project we propose a novel NEMS resonator whose frequency can be tuned rapidly (on the order of a few nanoseconds). In addition, this resonator would use materials that have potentially dual-functionality, to help not only in tuning the frequency, but also in sensing the frequency. Such a resonator would reduce costs, take up very much less space than existing resonators, and would be much simpler to fabricate. Furthermore, this research project would shed light on physical mechanisms such as the piezoresistivity of phase change materials, as well as the mechanical properties of such materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00541X/1","grantId":"EP/J00541X/1","fundValue":"96399","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Harish  Bhaskaran","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" This was the initial part of EP/J00541X/2, and thus key findings are summarized there.
