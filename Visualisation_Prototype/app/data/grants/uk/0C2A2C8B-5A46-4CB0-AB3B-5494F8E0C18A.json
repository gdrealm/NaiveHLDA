{"id":"0C2A2C8B-5A46-4CB0-AB3B-5494F8E0C18A","title":"Brighton Fuse 2","abstractText":"Brighton Fuse 2 is a research grant continuing the previous Brighton Fuse project funded by AHRC to map, measure and enhance the Creative Digital Information Technology (CDIT) cluster in the City of Brighton and Hove (www.brightonfuse.com). Partners of the project are the University of Brighton (CENTRIM, Brighton Business School and Faculty of Arts), University of Sussex (SPRU), Wired Sussex and the Council for Industry and Higher Education. \n\nFuse 2 undertakes consolidating research in two areas: firstly, examining the freelancer communities within the Brighton cluster through a survey and qualitative data collection. This will assess the engagement of the freelancer communities with the digital firms in the city and the extent to which they represent a flexible resource that sustains the cluster. The survey will research the sectoral diversity of freelancers and their business and innovation performance. The qualitative work will research the conditions of work and the advantages and disadvantages of the 'portfolio career'. \n\nThe second work package of the project is a panel survey of CDIT businesses to provide a comparable dataset to the original Fuse survey to enable analysis of the dynamics of the cluster. This analysis will be aimed at understanding causal relations between variables, for example, networking activities, collaboration, and business performance. The panel survey will also provide evidence on the relative stability of the sectors such as digital marketing, social media, video games development and arts organisations. The project is aimed at considering the policy implications of the academic insights gained for the creative digital economy and for universities and interested organisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L504026/1","grantId":"AH/L504026/1","fundValue":"217766","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Sapsed","coPersons":["Alex  Coad","Megha  Rajguru","Roberto  Camerani"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
