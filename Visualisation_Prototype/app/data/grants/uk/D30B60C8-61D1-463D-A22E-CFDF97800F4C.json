Cardiac electro-physiology is sufficiently well established for developing a predictive model for the heart. However, successful simulations of cardiac dynamics requires not only well-validated mathematical model of cardiac electro-mechanics and anatomy, but also stable and efficient numerical algorithms for solving these models that are at multiple physical scales, highly complex and non-linear. The aim of this project is to tackle these challenges for human sinoatrial node - atria (SAN-atria) (the upper chambers of the heart), malfunction of that causes morbidity and mortality. We propose to develop a new generation 3D anatomical model of the SAN-atria with coupled electrical and mechanical dynamics, and a new family of numerically stable and efficient algorithms based on discrete element methods. Using the model, we shall quantify the functional impact of pharmacological interventions on atrial electrical and mechanic dynamics. The output of this project will be a family of novel computer models of human SAN-atria and efficient numerical algorithms for cardiac electro-mechanical modelling. The developed model and numerical solvers will be distributed for public access through our local research websites and international depository tools (www.cellML.org and www.fieldML.org).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J009482/1","grantId":"EP/J009482/1","fundValue":"301500","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jianqiao  Ye","coPersons":["Yong  Sheng"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
