{"id":"AAB7D19E-4FF5-432F-B0BF-96CE1CA5E7B3","title":"Two -Phase Polytropic Energy Storage","abstractText":"The University of Edinburgh team will work with engineers at Artemis Intelligent Power Ltd to design a compact grid-scale\nenergy storage facility. The energy storage concept uses a polytropic compression and expansion in a Joule or Brayton\ncycle to convert mechanical work to heat, and back. For these processes it uses large, slow moving, piston machines,\ngiving adequate time for heat exchange processes to occur with high efficiency. Secondary liquids are introduced into the\nworking gas to absorb and reject heat, so that it can be transferred directly into unpressurised thermal stores (without\nrecourse to large heat exchangers) - one very hot, the other very cold. All of the processes are theoretically fully reversible.\nEach process is being designed to occur with minimal losses, with the aim of equaling or exceeding the efficiency of\npumped hydro storage. Artemis Digital Displacement machines provide the controllable wide motion ratios required to\nefficiently interface the high-speed electrical generators to the low-speed compressor expander machines such that\nconstant power levels are maintained.\nThis being a first phase programme, it is anticipated that the end goals of this 12 month project will be an outline design,\nsystem simulation model, some critical-path component development to verify performance prior to moving onto building a\npilot energy storage facility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508573/1","grantId":"EP/N508573/1","fundValue":"115737","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Rampen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
