{"id":"F45E9536-4B9D-4EAE-BF9F-E4FAACD20B76","title":"Novel approaches to identify optimal outcome measures in phase II cancer trials","abstractText":"There are four stages of the drug development process, known as phases I to IV. Phase III of the process considers whether the treatment under investigation is better than, or at least as good as, the current standard treatment for the disease, and this is assessed in a large scale clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials are designed to find out if a new treatment works well enough to test in a larger phase III trial, or to find out about the types of cancer the treatment works for, and any side effects of the treatment and how to manage them. If the results of a phase II trial show that a new treatment may be as good as, or better than, an existing treatment, a phase III trial may be undertaken. When we carry out a phase II trial, we need to make sure that the measures we use to find out if the new treatment works well, are the most appropriate measures to make an accurate decision about whether to test the treatment further in a large phase III trial. Currently, many phase II cancer trials use a measure called response to assess whether a new treatment may be as good as or better than an existing treatment. This is a measure of how much the cancer has shrunk. However for some new treatments, this may not be the best way to measure how good the treatment is at controlling the cancer. By using more appropriate measures in phase II trials this will allow faster, more accurate, development of new treatments. This research aims to look at other measures to use in phase II trials of colorectal cancer, for example looking regularly at the actual length of the cancer, to assess whether treatments may be as good as or better than existing treatments, so that we don?t carry out large phase III trials unnecessarily, and so that we don?t miss treatments in a phase II trial that may be worth further investigation. A team of clinical trial researchers at the University of Leeds will carry out this research, using data from colorectal cancer trials that have already been carried out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701614","grantId":"G0701614","fundValue":"118912","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Walter  Gregory","coPersons":["Chris  Twelves","S  Brown"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
