{"id":"A57B7721-6C3D-4F55-9A5B-7D2EA062CCC8","title":"An edition of the poetry of Sara Coleridge","abstractText":"Sara Coleridge, best known as the daughter of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, was herself a writer of rare intelligence and great versatility. As a poet, her work has never had the readership it deserves, for the simple reason the most of it has never been published. I am compiling an edition of her poetry for Carcanet Press. To be published in 2006, in which about half of the works have never been printed before. The poems are unusually diverse: they include children's verses, album verses, translations from Aeschylus and Lucretius, love poetry, religious poetry, and a long incomplete balled on a chivalric theme. The poems are ambitious, accomplished and far from amateurish: She is among the best women poets writing between the end of Charlotte Smith's career and the state of Elizabeth Barrett's. at the very least her poetic voice deserves to be heard as an important one- alongside Hemans and LEL, for instance - in our recent reassessments of women's poetry in the early to mid-nineteenth-century. As well as a poet, she was an outstanding and exacting literary critic, ranging far and wide in her reading and opinions on poetry, fiction, politics, and religion. I have been in negotiation with Cacanet about editing a companion volume of Sara Coleridge's literary criticism, and the prospect looks very hopeful that this will be confirmed in the near future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113185/1","grantId":"113185/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-04-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Swaab","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
