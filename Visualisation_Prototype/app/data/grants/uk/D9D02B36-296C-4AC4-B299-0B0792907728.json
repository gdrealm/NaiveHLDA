To avoid soil borne diseases, nearly 40% of strawberry production (ca. &pound;90M in values) is grown in soil-less substrate under protection where nutrients and water are better controlled according to the crop requirement. This proposal addresses the efficient use of such resources, the management of which is recognised as one key driver in the delivery of sustainable intensive agriculture. Recent evidence suggests that under a substrate production system with standard fertigation, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase strawberry yield. The present proposal investigates whether application of AMF and PGPR (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) products in commercial substrates will result in increased resource use efficiency, fruit quality, and tolerance to powdery mildew over different combinations of cultivars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M011313/1","grantId":"BB/M011313/1","fundValue":"277504","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiangming  Xu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"East Malling Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
