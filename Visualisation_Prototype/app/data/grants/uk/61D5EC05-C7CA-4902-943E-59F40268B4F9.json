Yet impairments of movement, due to stroke, developmental disorder, and degenerative diseases like Parkinson?s Disease affect 1 in 20 of the population during their life span. Most of these disorders are likely to involve a change in the function of the basal ganglia. The latter are key but inaccessible motor centers deep within the brain. Their inaccessibility has meant that we have very little understanding of how the basal ganglia function in human disease. In this research we capitalize on the resurgence of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of diseases like Parkinson?s disease and dystonia, using this opportunity to record directly from the basal ganglia in different diseases at rest and during movement. Our goal is to understand how the basal ganglia interact with each other and with other motor structures like the cortex in organizing normal and contributing to abnormal movement. This research should provide a rational basis for the development of new treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400617","grantId":"G0400617","fundValue":"876426","fundStart":"2005-10-12","fundEnd":"2010-10-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
