{"id":"D30D85C4-74FD-4EA7-9C07-56BF607F669B","title":"PLAZZMID: Evolutionary algorithms from bacterial and bee genomes","abstractText":"Classical evolutionary algorithms have been extremely successful at solving certain problems. But they implement a very simple model of evolutionary biology that misses out several aspects that might be exploited by more sophisticated algorithms. We have previously critiqued the traditional naive approach to bio-inspired algorithm design, that moves straight from a simplistic description of the biology into some algorithm. PLAZZMID uses a more sophisticated process for developing richer evolutionary algorithms abstracted from various processes of biological evolution, with a corresponding richer analogical computational structure. The PLAZZMID approach will be used to explore questions from theoretical evolutionary biology, and to solve dynamic computational problems, such as evolving for homeostasis in a variable environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F031033/1","grantId":"EP/F031033/1","fundValue":"806662","fundStart":"2008-06-02","fundEnd":"2011-12-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Stepney","coPersons":["Tim  Clarke","Peter  Young"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" The project developed the novel Artificial Chemistry stringmol, a form of assembly language AChem. It exploited it in several scenarios to uncover the crucial importance of several properties needed by an AChem to produce a rich complex system of reactions. In particular, systems seeded with imperfect replicators exhibited several evolutionary properties shared by biological organisms. A detailed specification of the AChem is provided in a Technical Report, allowing others to experiment with the same system.
