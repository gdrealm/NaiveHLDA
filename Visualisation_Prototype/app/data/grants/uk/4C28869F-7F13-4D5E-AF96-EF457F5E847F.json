The project was fruitful in that it successfully generated four research papers, two new research projects, one new research grant, and two new research partnerships.\n\n(New Knowledge and Methods)\nWe formally established that Reducible Diffusion (RDs), which formed the foundation of our methodology, are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamics. Since RDs are nonlinear transformations of analytically tractable Underlying Parametric Diffusions (UPDs), they are substantially more flexible than conventional parametric diffusions and sufficiently tractable for making efficient statistical inference. The main achievement of this project is the development of four novel econometric methods for modelling RDs with applications to short-term interest rates.\n\nFirstly, we proposed a new univariate parametric RD model with time-varying transformations. Our time-varying specifications can potentially account for autoregressive, threshold, smooth-transition, and regime-switching types of empirically relevant dynamic effects, which significantly improved the goodness-of-fit to short-rate data.\n\nSecondly, we proposed a novel three-stage procedure for modelling multivariate short-rate series using a combination of univariate RDs and copulas. This approach is extremely flexible as it allows the users to model independently: (i) the time-invariant marginal distribution of individual series, (ii) the time-series dynamics of individual series, and (iii) most importantly the time-varying nonlinear dependence between multiple series. We derived the asymptotic distributions of the three-stage maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters.\n\nThirdly, we proposed a novel semiparametric univariate RD model which is crucially assumed to be an unknown transformation of a UPD. This approach yields a general class of dynamic models with parametric dynamic copulas and nonparametric marginal distribution. Very rich and complex dynamics can be generated by this model and its implementation is convenient and efficient. We derived the asymptotic distributions of the estimators of the nonparametric transformation function and the parametric component and studied their finite sample properties.\n\nFinally, we proposed a unified framework for modelling multivariate RDs in both parametric and semiparametric settings. This framework crucially assumes that our multivariate RDs are the so-called triangular transformation of tractable multivariate UPDs. This triangular structure induces significant flexibility while preserving substantial tractability. We investigated the issues of identification and likelihood-based inference and examined the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators.\n\n(New Research Questions, Collaborations and Funding Opportunity)\nThis project opened two important new research questions: (i) How to generalize our model so that the UPD can have latent components (e.g. stochastic volatility) and hence introduce additional empirically relevant flexibility? (ii) How to generalize our model so that the underlying parametric process can be non-stationary and possibly have jump components? \n\nThese research questions have created collaborations between the PI and leading experts in this field. Specifically, the PI is collaborating with Prof. Dennis Kristensen (University College London) on Project (i) and with Prof. Jihyun Kim (Toulouse School of Economics) on Project (ii).\n\nMoreover, the PI has secured new funding from British Academy for the next 18 months on Project (ii). While the main contributions of this project are primarily theoretical and methodological, our key findings have clear fundamental importance and profound implications for both academic and non-academic users in predominantly, but not limited to, the areas of statistical and economic analyses.\n\nAcademic users from a broad range of disciplines, such as statistics, economics, finance, biology, engineering, and so on, can potentially benefit significantly from the novel concept of stochastic modelling using Reducible Diffusions. More specifically, on one hand theoretical researchers from these disciplines can use our contributions to the theory of stochastic and econometric analyses as the foundation for further exploration of this useful framework with enhanced breadth and depth. On the other hand, empirical researchers from the same disciplines can directly use the new statistical models developed from this project, either as alternative or complementary tools, to improve the flexibility and efficiency in modelling random phenomena of their interests.\n\nNon-academic users, such as central banks, financial sectors, private business, biological, and engineering companies, etc., can similarly use the models developed from this project as additional tools to improve their understanding of, for example, economic dynamics, financial markets behaviour, asset valuation methods, investment and risk management strategies, and so on.
