{"id":"F4A1120F-ACF6-4D79-9D3D-7B59D19CE3CA","title":"General Preemption Games and their Applications to Industrial Economics","abstractText":"<p>The project will analyse the strategic interaction of many economic agents choosing the best time for an action, such as entry in a market or the adoption of a new technology. It will examine how the competitive environment and evolving technological constraints affect timing decisions and playersâ€™ incentives to preempt their rivals. In particular, it will identify conditions under which agents choose to act simultaneously, rather than at different points in time. The economic efficiency and the distribution of payoffs arising from strategic interaction in these settings will be addressed. The effect of policy measures on the timing of actions and welfare will be assessed.</p> \n<p>The type of decision problems described above have typically been studied in the economic literature as preemption games and has focused on environments with two players only. This project contributes to the literature by generalising these games to an arbitrary number of players.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1906","grantId":"RES-000-22-1906","fundValue":"30425","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philipp  Schmidt-Dengler","coPersons":["Rossella  Argenziano"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
