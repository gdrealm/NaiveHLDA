Influenza remains a major public health threat, causing seasonal outbreaks and potentially devastating pandemics. Although influenza vaccines and a limited number of antiviral drugs are available, we are surprisingly defenceless against this disease. These concerns have been highlighted by the bird flu outbreaks that have infected over 500 people and caused 306 deaths over the past 8 years (WHO report, 5 January 2011) and more recently by the emergence of the swine flu pandemic. We do not understand enough about how these viruses emerge and what causes them to kill people. A better understanding could lead to the development of treatments that could save lives and prevent the spread of disease. The aim of this project is to understand the regulation of a central complex of the virus, the RNP. There is emerging evidence that the RNPs are important in determining the severity of the disease and whether the virus can infect humans, but it is not understood how this occurs. In addition, the assembly of small modified RNPs could be used in antiviral therapy. I would like to determine the role played by one of the component proteins in the assembly and activity of RNPs and to determine whether proteins in the infected cell called nucleases play a role in RNP activity and the replication of the virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100138","grantId":"G1100138","fundValue":"323022","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank Theodoor Vreede","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
