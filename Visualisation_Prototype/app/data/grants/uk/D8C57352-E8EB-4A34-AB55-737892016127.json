{"id":"D8C57352-E8EB-4A34-AB55-737892016127","title":"RiftVectors: Vector competence of European mosquitoes to Rift Valley fever virus","abstractText":"RVFV is an arbovirus readily transmitted through several mosquito genera including Aedes and Culex\nmosquito vectors, and has a large host range. The recent expansion of the geographical range of RVFV\nclearly indicates that RVFV is not restricted to Africa. It has been proposed that a single infected person\nor animal that enters a naive country is sufficient to initiate an outbreak. This transmission scenario is\nbecoming more probable due to the expansion of worldwide trade and travel. The objectives of this\nEmida project, RiftVectors, will be to understand the biology of natural RVFV vectors and their counterparts in\nEurope as an indicator for assessing the risk of RVFV to be established in Europe.\nWithin this Emida project, we will further analyze, and develop new methods to distinguish vector and \npotential vector species, and analyze whether they can transmit RVFV- especially european mosquitoes which \nmay be able to transmit RVFV. We will also analyze how the immune system of mosquito vectors can control RVFV \ninfection, and how this relates to whether mosquitoes can transmit RVFV or whether novel antiviral targets \ncan be discovered. Interestingy, endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria of insects now are widely used in symbiosis-based \ncontrol strategies against arboviruses. We will analyze what the effect of Wolbachia on the vector competence of mosquitoes \nto RVFV will be, and if this could be used as a control strategy against this virus.\nOur international consortium of partners has the expertise to tackle these questions on the\nvectors of RVFV. We expect that our results will improve assessments of when and which\nmosquito species could spread RVFV, and we aim to identify novel ways of controlling\nRVFV emergence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K004506/2","grantId":"BB/K004506/2","fundValue":"227165","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our laboratory research in progress has not as yet had any cultural, societal, economic or policy impacts  ","person":"Steven Paul Sinkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" The objective of this project has been to assess the capacity of the Wolbachia bacterium to cause pathogen-blocking of the Rift Valley Fever virus in mosquito hosts, concentrating on the important amplification vectors of the Culex genus. This has involved experimental assessment of Wolbachia-host interactions both in a tissue culture system in vitro, and attempts to generate somatic and heritable transinfections in vivo. \nWe have successfully generated a working model of a stable Wolbachia transinfection in a tissue culture system by transinfecting cells of the mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus with the Wolbachia strain wAu, a high-density member of Wolbachia supergroup A that naturally infects the fruit fly species Drosophila simulans. After transinfection, the exogenous wAu Wolbachia strain has stabily co-existed within the host Culex cells for more than 20 passages, and results from quantitiative PCR and flourescence in situ hybridisation suggest that Wolbachia are capable of reaching and maintaining high density infections in these cells. Assessment of the effects of Wolbachia on the expression of a range of immune genes by qRT-PCR, a factor of potential relevance to the pathogen blocking phenotype, has relvealed significant upregulation of immune effectors known to be involved in the mosquito immune response to viruses, including genes of the cecropin and serine protease families. Upcoming viral challanges of these Wolbachia infected cells with live Rift Valley Fever virus in collaboration with researchers at the Pasteur Institute will help us to further our understanding of the potential for Wolbachia-mediated control of this virus. \nResults examining Wolbachia-mediated immune upregulation in tissue culture have been extended by assessing Wolbachia's effects on selected immune genes in somatically infected adult Culex quinqefasciatus, generated by injecting live purified Wolbachia into the hemolymph of adult mosquitoes. Those adults with persistent somatic transinfections were subsequently analysed by qRT-PCR, and once again revealed significantly higher levels of immune gene expression relevant to anti-viral immunity than controls. \nWe have made repeated attempts to generate a stable and heritable transinfection of a non-native Wolbachia strain in Culex quinquefasciatus. We initially concentrated on the transfer of embryonic cytoplasm from Drosophila melanogaster infected with the high-density Wolbachia strain wMel into C. quiquefasciatus eggs. A number of female Culex mosquitoes were obtained from these embryonic microinjections that harboured the wMel Wolbachia, and PCR analysis showed that transmission to the eggs of these females was occuring. However, higher embryonic developmental arrest of the progeny from these females was observed, leading us to conclude that the wMel strain may be too virulent to be successfully maintained long term in this species. We are currently attempting the transfer of embryonic cytoplasm containing the lower density Wolbachia strains wAlbA and wAlbB from the mosquito species Aedes albopictus. The findings will be of interest to those seeking to develop Wolbachia-based arbovirus control methods. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
