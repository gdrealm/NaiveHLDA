The initial Pathfinder project will explore the mechanisms of support from public, private and NGO partners towards a larger scale programme to improve water quality diagnostics and monitoring of UK rivers, with specific focus on the Lower River Thames. The Pathfinder project will: \n1. identify the most pertinent stakeholders for whom outputs from predictive river quality models for an improved and timely information on river water quality would be of value.\n2. define the optimal combination of new sensor technologies and community scientist participation to improve model output and build local support for an improved catchment management\n3. explore online platforms and new tools to allow stakeholders real-time access to forecasting results and information for decision support. \nThe project will focus on building support for the ongoing activities of all three partners arising from the POLLCURB project, exploring the impacts of long term changes in urban extent on water flows and quality in the lower Thames catchment. For the Pathfinder, CEH researchers and partners will optimise POLLCURB project products for use by potential private, public and NGO end users. This will require interactions with the partners (workshops), additional data collection through an expanded network and optimisation of sensor and online technologies. The workplan has a 6 month period of execution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007670/1","grantId":"NE/N007670/1","fundValue":"14608","fundStart":"2015-06-15","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael George Hutchins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
