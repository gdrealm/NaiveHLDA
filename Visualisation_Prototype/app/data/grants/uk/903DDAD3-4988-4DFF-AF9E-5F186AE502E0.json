One important obstacle to the development of treatments for such devastating diseases is the poor understanding of the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain a healthy brain. Studies done in many laboratories have identified a family of proteins, collectively called neurotrophins, as major players in supporting the development of the brain during embryonic life. Moreover, neurotrophins are essential for the normal functions of adult brain, promoting crucial processes such as nerve regeneration and the establishment and maintenance of new memories. The lack of neurotrophins late in life may explain the deterioration of brain functions. Consistent with this idea, many patients affected by Alzheimer?s disease show significantly reduced activity of neurotrophins in the brain. A recent study has shown that delivery of NGF in brain of patients affected by Alzheimer?s disease resulted in a dramatic improvement of clinical conditions (Tuszynski et al, Nat. Med., 2005). Thus, the increased understanding of how neurotrophins influence neuronal development and function could well lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat neurodegenerative disorders. The goal of my research will be to understand the role played by neurotrophins in developing and mature neurons and to identify novel genes linked with their activation in the adult brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500792","grantId":"G0500792","fundValue":"306816","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonella  Riccio","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
