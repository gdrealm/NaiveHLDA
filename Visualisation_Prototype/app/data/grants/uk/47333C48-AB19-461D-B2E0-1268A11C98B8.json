Over 6,000 ha of lettuce, with a market value of over &pound;80 million, was grown in the UK in 2005 (source DEFRA statistics, 2005). A major problem for lettuce growers is that the crop will sometimes initiate bolting (i.e. flowering) in the field before it is harvested. Whilst plants that are in the early stages of bolting are visibly indistinguishable from non-bolting plants, there are changes in the production of secondary metabolites in the leaves. These compounds may serve to protect the young floral buds from insect attack but give the lettuce plant a bitter and unpleasant taste and render the crop unsaleable. Delayed bolting, or greater holding ability in the field, is a desirable trait in commercial lettuce varieties as it preserves the quality of lettuces sold for consumption, and increases sustainability by reducing crop losses and wastage. This project will exploit the extensive knowledge on molecular mechanisms controlling flowering time gained from the study of model plants such as Arabidopsis. Lettuce genes that are homologous to genes known to control flowering in these model species will be identified. These will be good targets in which to induce variation in order to affect the control of bolting/flowering time. Inactivation of a gene that causes early bolting, for example, may cause later bolting which would mean that that lettuce variety will be less likely to bolt in the field before it is harvested. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling flowering in crop species, and the natural variation that has evolved in crops to exert a robust effect on flowering, will also broaden our understanding of the flowering process. This project is a prime example of knowledge transfer from model to crop plants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G007330/1","grantId":"BB/G007330/1","fundValue":"754528","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Derek Jackson","coPersons":["David Anthony Pink"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
