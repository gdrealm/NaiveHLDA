The use of X-rays to examine the structure and properties of crystalline materials is a topic that school students in the UK are relatively unaware of, and we would therefore like to resolve this by offering a public engagement activity for secondary school students.\n\nOur research utilises synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction at Diamond Light Source to investigate the mineral dynamics associated with the seasonal growth and melting of sea ice. We aim to use this example of sea ice, and the crystal salts that exist throughout its structure, as an analogue for how X-rays can be used to investigate the world at microscopic levels, which are otherwise inaccessible. We aim to deliver the project as a practical workshop that will last the duration of one school lesson. 1200 year 9,10 and 11 students in North Wales will receive the workshop via 12 school visits, with 4 session at each. The workshop will provide the students with a hands-on insight into crystals, and how their presence can effect the physical properties of materials that we observe. We aim for this intervention to help promote interest in science as a subject, and importantly how X-rays have many exciting scientific applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002454/1","grantId":"ST/M002454/1","fundValue":"6292","fundStart":"2014-09-17","fundEnd":"2016-03-16","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Hilary Anne Kennedy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
