{"id":"1FF8E133-4D35-4EE4-974A-7065E0C39474","title":"The Particle Physics and Cosmology of Supersymmetry and String Theory","abstractText":"In 2010, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will begin colliding protons accelerated to close to the speed of light, thus creating conditions that occurred in the universe just after the Big Bang. Experiments at the LHC will explore the origin of mass and search for new symmetries of nature, such as supersymmetry. Cosmological observations are also entering a new era, with the Planck satellite imaging the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and dark energy/dark matter probes such as the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). The theoretical understanding of supersymmetric theories, such as superstrings and their higher dimensional extension M-theory, has matured to a point where their structure and predictions can be compared with this new data. It is the purpose of this proposal to create an international and interdisciplinary research network, with participating institutions in the UK, the US and Germany, which will explore a wide class of superstring and M-theory constructions and relate them to experimental results from the LHC and to cosmological observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I02784X/1","grantId":"EP/I02784X/1","fundValue":"49168","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andre  Lukas","coPersons":["Philip  Candelas"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
