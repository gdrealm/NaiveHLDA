{"id":"9CE9F1F5-5A51-4D36-8CA4-E295F27AA3E0","title":"Preliminary Feasibility and SensitivityStudies for CLARREO","abstractText":"The monitoring of our climate system requires measurements from many sources, perhaps particularly from space. Such measurements must be of extremely high accuracy, in order to detect the trends and changes involved, in a timely way. The CLARREO proposal is to monitor, very accurately, the outgong infrared spectrum of the Earth from space, which contains characteristic signatures of the principal processes that control climate. CLARREO is being studied by NASA in the USA, and the Imperial College team, which has unique experience in detecting and interpreting these signatures, has been invited to join the project,. This is a great opportunityy for UK scientists to influence and be involved in perhaps one of the most significant projects in climate science for the coming decades.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H010017/1","grantId":"NE/H010017/1","fundValue":"47667","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"John  Harries","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
