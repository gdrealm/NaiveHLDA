{"id":"D21B1DB9-5705-41F8-832D-67363D86B891","title":"Our Own Image: The Legacies of Maori Filmmaking in Aotearoa/New Zealand","abstractText":"This project explores the pioneering generation of Maori filmmakers that began making films in the 1970s and 80s. These films, both documentaries and fiction, were the first to present film images of Maori to Maori in terms of their own world views, grounded in Maori experiences, as well as presenting aspects of life in New Zealand to a majority Pakeha culture that was, at that time, often ignorant of the lives of the indigenous population with which it shared a national space. Our research assesses their many achievements and legacies: continuities of philosophies and methods, public engagement, the diversification of media industries, questions of community and well-being, and more besides.\n\nThe project is follow-up research to work which the AHRC funded in 2006, when Stuart Murray was supported to complete his book Images of Dignity: Barry Barclay and Fourth Cinema (Huia Press: 2008), the first book-length study of a Maori filmmaker and one of the first books globally to focus on a single indigenous filmmaker. Since that initial funding, a number of that first generation have passed away: Barry Barclay in 2008 (as Images of Dignity was in production); actor/director Merata Mita in 2010; and actor/director Don Selwyn in 2007. Between them, these three figures produced arguably the most important feature films that marked the emergence of Maori cinema onto a national, and then international, stage. With its focus on legacy, this new project aligns perfectly with the AHRC's brief in its highlight/anniversary funding call. In specifically examining the impact of the first piece of funded research in the nine years that have passed since, we have a unique opportunity to discuss the legacy of a group of filmmakers that was foundational in paving the way for the now diverse world of Maori media production. \n\nThe project will be based around Barry Barclay's distinction, articulated in his 1990 book Our Own Image, between 'talking in' and 'talking out'. 'Talking in' was, in his words, &quot;a right and responsibility for any culture to present itself to its own people in its own way&quot;. 'Talking out' involves conveying the products of this to &quot;a world beyond&quot; (p. 74-75). We will have two hui (gatherings or symposia), one in the UK in November 2015 and the other in Auckland in April 2016. The UK event, to be held in Leeds in conjunction with the Leeds International Film Festival and organised with the assistance of the New Zealand Studies Network, will be the opportunity to 'talk out'. It will bring together academics, filmmakers, other relevant practitioners, students and members of the public to debate the work of Barclay, Mita and Selwyn in terms of global/Fourth cinema and indigenous film. We will screen two key features, Barclay's 1987 Ngati and Mita's 1988 Mauri, which will act as the focal point of the event. The Auckland symposium, at which we will screen more films, will work through 'talking in'. We will bring together current filmmakers and other relevant practitioners , community, whanau (family) of the three directors, and representatives of the country's major film and media institutions, as well as public health experts, to discuss the impact of the legacy left by these pioneers.\n\nOur intention is for the ideas for the second event to develop organically through the discussions of the first; the ideas of 'international' and 'indigenous' film explored in Leeds will be reconfigured in national and local contexts in Auckland, providing what will be a wide-ranging account of an overall legacy. At the same time, we will identify a number of pressing contemporary topics across both events on which each filmmaker contributed prescience and innovative vision during their careers. These are: issues of health. well-being and community; questions of settlement, belonging and ecocritical perspectives; and the archiving and guardianship surrounding intellectual property rights and the notion of 'living resources'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003594/1","grantId":"AH/N003594/1","fundValue":"35662","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Murray","coPersons":["Clare Frances Barker"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
