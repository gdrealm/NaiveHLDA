Members of the Group have been working on the design, R&amp;D, construction and commissioning of the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC which is just starting to see real data in the form of cosmic ray and a few beam splash events. They are being joined by colleagues from the H1 and BaBar experiments whose analyses are coming to an end after many years of extremely productive results including measurements of CP violation in the bottom quark sector that were recognized in the award of the 2008 Nobel Prize for physics. The ATLAS Group has also been joined by colleagues from the CDF experiment who are experts on the top quark. The ATLAS group will continue the study of the top quark at the LHC and the expertise gained will allow us to probe for new physics such as the discovery of the Higgs particle or Supersymmetry. We will also continue our study of proton structure at the highest possible energies. The Queen Mary Group is also starting to get involved in upgrades to the ATLAS detector for the higher luminosity Super-LHC, first by participating in the ATLAS Tracker Upgrade programme and later in possible Trigger upgrades. At the other end of the mass scale other colleagues from BaBar are currently building the T2K long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan which will continue the investigations of the recently discovered neutrino oscillations. In addition the Group will look to exploit new opportunities, such as Super B Factories or Linear Colliders when they become available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001042/2","grantId":"ST/H001042/2","fundValue":"2686970","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The discovery of the Higgs Boson captured the imagination of millions of people.
