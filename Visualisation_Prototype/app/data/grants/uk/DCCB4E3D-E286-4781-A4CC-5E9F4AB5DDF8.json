{"id":"DCCB4E3D-E286-4781-A4CC-5E9F4AB5DDF8","title":"Targets and Waiting Times: Exploiting a Quasi-Experiment to evaluate the use of targets in the provision of health care","abstractText":"<p>A key component in the drive to increase productivity and responsiveness in the NHS is the use of targets. NHS targets are not new, but the current administration has increased the use of targets. In contrast, the Scottish Parliament, which assumed responsibility for the NHS in Scotland on devolution, considerably reduced reliance on targets initially after devolution, preferring to promote co-operation and collaboration. Our aim is to exploit the divergence in policy between the two countries and use it as a natural experiment to assess the impact of targets on the behaviour of NHS hospitals in the two countries. We will examine not only behaviour with respect to targeted activities, but also behaviour with respect to non-targeted activities. Our end aim is to estimate the impact of targets on all hospital activity and to use the estimates to assess the overall effect on patient welfare.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0022","grantId":"RES-166-25-0022","fundValue":"97014","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Windmeijer","coPersons":["Matt Adam Sutton","Carol  Propper"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
