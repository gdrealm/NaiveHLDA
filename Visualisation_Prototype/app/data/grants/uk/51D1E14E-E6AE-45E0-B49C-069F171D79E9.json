Discussing exploration, landscape, flora, fauna, colour and vital forces, connection are traced between works of art, literature, philosophy, and science. It has argued that links between the aesthetic of nature and naturally theology, forged in the era of Newtonian Science, established the basis of a sensibility common to the arts and sciences; its disruption by Romanticism led to a cultural disassociation manifest by the mid-nineteenth century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111682/1","grantId":"111682/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter M Harman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
