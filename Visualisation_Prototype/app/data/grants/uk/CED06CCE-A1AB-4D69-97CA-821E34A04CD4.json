{"id":"CED06CCE-A1AB-4D69-97CA-821E34A04CD4","title":"Disposable, low-cost test kit for arsenic in resource limited markets","abstractText":"The effects of arsenic in drinking water have been called by WHO &quot;The greatest mass poisoning of a population inhuman history&quot; and whilst remediation is the long term solution the need for a quick, cheap, simple and accurate determination is immediate, to avoid poisoning, and necessary to prioritise and validate the remediation activities. In this project we intend to use the unique characteristics of an arsenite oxidising enzyme (specificity and catalytic activity) combined with the technology behind the glucose test strips used by millions of diabetics every day to produce a low cost and reliable arsenite biosensor suitable for field use in resource poor environments. The strips would give an accurate measure of arsenic levels at the 'well side' at a price point that will encourage widespread adoption.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024411/1","grantId":"BB/L024411/1","fundValue":"528411","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Edward Cass","coPersons":["Joanne  Santini"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
