It will offer insights about how to raise their game in pursuit of large research grants, high quality publications, and, in particular, the development of the mindset that facilitates interdisciplinary investigations of major questions with high social impact.</p>\n\n<p>The training materials will be developed from information gathered from expert social science researchers. They will be trialled and deployed in six training workshops, and publicised at a final dissemination conference. Participants in the training will be able to cascade the material to support the learning of their own students and colleagues. </p>\n\n<p>Areas of expertise to be explored include: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>integrating multiple methods; sharing work effectively across a team; </li>\n\n <li>anticipating and handling complications; </li>\n\n <li>identifying fruitful potential collaborations; </li>\n\n <li>communicating across disciplines; </li>\n\n <li>anticipating likely extra-disciplinary misconceptions in relation to the research foci, key findings, research culture and terminology in one's own discipline.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H023224/1","grantId":"ES/H023224/1","fundValue":"81682","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Margaret Wray","coPersons":["Mike  Wallace"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We interviewed top international social science researchers to find out how they defined research expertise, how they had developed it, and how they supported others in developing it. The findings showed that learning continues through the career, that there are major benefits to collaboration, and that communicating one's ideas effectively with others is a key requirement of research expertise. The informants were highly committed to creating and sustaining a strong research environment for themselves and others, and their approach was characterized by curiosity, willingness to work at the edges of their comfort zone, openness to others' ideas, and tenacity, especially in relation to getting their work published. Our main output was a handbook for research leaders to support the development of social science researchers. This contains outlines and materials for training workshops. The handbook has already been used by professional trainers. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
