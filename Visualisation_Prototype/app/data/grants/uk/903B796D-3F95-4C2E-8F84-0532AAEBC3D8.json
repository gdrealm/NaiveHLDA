On the one hand, the precise formulation of the main conjectures in noncommutative Iwasawa theory reached a certain maturity in the work of Fukaya-Kato. An important case of the noncommutative main conjecture was proven by the PI (and independently by Burns-Rtter-Weiss). On the other, the theory of automorphic forms (p-adic and lambda-adic) was systematically developed and applied to prove main conjectures in commutative Iwasawa theory beyond the classical main conjectures by several authors including Hida, Tilouine, Urban and Skinner. It is therefore an appropriate time to combine these two developments to prove new results in both directions. We propose to tackle three inter-related problems in this general area. Firstly, we want to extend our methods used to prove the noncommutative main conjectures for Tate motives to prove new results on noncommutative main conjectures for motives other than Tate motives. To this end we propose to systematically study p-adic and lambda-adic automorphic forms over various totally real fields and relations between these automorphic forms as the fields vary. Secondly, implicit in the conjectures of Fukaya-Kato are certain factorisations of p-adic L-functions. These factorisations, known only in a couple of cases, have deep arithmetic implications such as towards Greenberg's L-invariant conjectures. We propose a new strategy to attack these factorisation problems using the tools developed to tackle our first question. Lastly, we propose to study main conjectures over function fields. The algebraic techniques we have developed have already proven very fruitful in Iwasawa theory over function fields in the work of Burns. There is, however, another family of main conjectures over function fields (e.g. in the work of Trihan and his collaborators). Our third project is to use our algebraic results and techniques used by Burns to attack these main conjectures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L021986/1","grantId":"EP/L021986/1","fundValue":"99074","fundStart":"2014-04-15","fundEnd":"2016-04-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mahesh Ramesh Kakde","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" The grant for proposal &quot;Non-commutative Iwasawa Theory and p-adic automorphic forms&quot; began on April 15th this year. The goal of the proposed research is 3 fold. Firstly, to prove congruences between special values of L-functions associated to automorphic forms on unitary groups, to prove factorisation theorems for various p-adic L-functions and to prove main conjectures in function field Iwasawa theory. We have made significant progress on the last goal of the proposed research. One of the main steps towards proving main conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory is understanding K_1 groups of Iwasawa algebras and related rings. With my collaborator, David Burns, I have obatined very general results on K_1 of Iwasawa algebras and related rings. A paper including these results is in preparation. We are also writing a paper which proves main conjecture of non-commutative Iwasawa theory for isotrivial abelian varieties over function fields. \n\nThese algebraic results provided new insights into K_1 of power series rings over Iwasawa algebra and lead to the paper &quot;Non-commutative q-expansions&quot; where I construct q-expansions over non-commutative Iwasawa algebras which interpolate suitable modificaitons of Iwasawa theoretic Eisenstein series of Deligne and Ribet. We have submitted the paper for publication to a conference proceedings. \n\nThe first two goals of the proposed research are more ambitious and I have had visits from my collaborators Samit Dasgupta and Thanasis Bouganis. These visits did lead us to very plausible approaches to the problems and we are highly optimistic that they will eventually lead to major results. However, there is nothing concrete to report now. Since the proposed research is in its intial stage it is hard to say beyond what has already been said in the proposal. However, I believe that the techniques I use with my collaborators will surely be useful to solve several other problems in number theory. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
