{"id":"5717C923-EE11-4CE8-BAD3-78A65B8EE67E","title":"Digital Building Heritage","abstractText":"This proposal focuses on publicizing and brokering partnerships between De Montfort University Researchers and community heritage groups concerned with historic buildings and their related artifacts in the use of appropriate digital methodologies and technologies for meeting the needs of these groups. The digital trechnologies and techniques available at De Montfort University range from detailed surveying and recoding of historic buildings and structures to 3D laser scanning, virtual reality simulation, 3D printing, web-design, mobile and locative computing applications development and visitor display design amongst others. The project will have a public presence based around a high quality website linking community groups and De Montfort University researchers and in conjunction with a one-day conference for the establishment of collaborative partnerships and two follow on workshops it will act as a best-practice vehicle for discussions on planned, larger research collaborations and bids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013366/1","grantId":"AH/J013366/1","fundValue":"19779","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-01-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The grant was used to meet two objectives, hosting a one day international conference and separately two days of community heritage workshops to assist them to establish partnerships and to formulate Heritage Lottery Funded projects under the HLF's &quot;All Our Stories&quot; Program. Both objectives were achieved. A very successful one day international conference and technology open day was held at De Montfort University on the 25th May 2012 in the Hugh Aston Building. This was for Community Heritage Groups and other organizations who wish to use digital technologies which are being developed at De Montfort University and are seeking funding under the Heritage Lottery Fund's forthcoming &quot;All Our Stories Program&quot;. It was attended by 108 delegates. The two, one day workshops held a De Montfort University in mid 2012 enabled over a dozen community heritage groups from across England a Wales who had successfully won HLF funding under the &quot;All Our Stories&quot; funding to engage with De Montfort University as a preferred collaborative partner in planning and executing their projects. Eventually eleven community heritage groups committed to participating in collaborative digital heritage projects with De Montfort University in 2013. In addition to these original objectives the Digital Building heritage group completed a spin-off project in May-June 2012 for the BBC's Great British Story TV series to digitally reconstruct a &quot;lost&quot; Sir Christopher Wren / Nicholas Hawksmoor design for the 17th century Sir John Moore's School in Derbyshire as a demonstration both the HLF and community heritage groups of what could be achieved in future AHRC/HLF combined projects in this field of digital heritage. The reconstruction was presented at the BBC's highly successful launch event there in early July and received publicity with several BBC radio interviews.
