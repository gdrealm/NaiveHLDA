{"id":"663B082A-2A23-4A0C-A842-8848923DC99A","title":"Culture, Value, and Attention at Home","abstractText":"Elena Boschi's research has focused on popular music in cinema, which necessarily demands an expertise in how to understand low attention cultural consumption. Moreover, given her particular interest in British, Spanish, and Italian Cinema, she has developed theoretical approaches that are culturally-infused, combining formal analysis with an attention to social and political issues. Her background in popular music studies and film studies, and her current position as a lecturer in the Department of Media and Communication at Liverpool Hope University mean that Elena can offer the necessary interdisciplinary perspective that developing this expert workshop requires. She has served on the organising committee of the Biennial Conference of the International Association of Popular Music Studies at the University of Liverpool (2009) and has recently received internal funding to host a one-day symposium on Gender and Sexuality in British Cinema after Thatcher, which will result in a special issue of selected proceedings for the Journal of British Cinema and Television. She has co-edited with Anahid Kassabian and Marta Garc&iacute;a Qui&ntilde;ones (co-investigators in this project) the collection Ubiquitous Musics (Ashgate, 2013).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M504154/1","grantId":"AH/M504154/1","fundValue":"8212","fundStart":"2014-03-17","fundEnd":"2014-07-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Elena  Boschi","coPersons":["Marta  Garcia Qui√±ones","Anahid  Kassabian"],"organisation":"Liverpool Hope University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
