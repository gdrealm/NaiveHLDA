Image guidance scans can be done to include different lengths of the body; longer lengths facilitate the image guidance workflow, but at the expense of higher imaging dose. Imaging frequency can be varied, for example imaging on the first 3 or 5 days of treatment, or daily. The schedule alters the safety margin required, and in turn the amount of normal tissue receiving a high treatment dose, and affects the probability of accurate treatment delivery. \n\nA key concept here is the current perception of risk, which is quite different between professionals and regulators, and patients. Patients readily accept the notion that image guidance improves accuracy of treatment, and in general are keen to maximise image guidance for their own case. Amongst some professionals and regulators there is a fear about radiation exposure which begins to approach a &quot;dread risk&quot;. This has been partly responsible for inhibiting the uptake of image guidance in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007227/1","grantId":"ST/M007227/1","fundValue":"59022","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Gunn Burnet","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
