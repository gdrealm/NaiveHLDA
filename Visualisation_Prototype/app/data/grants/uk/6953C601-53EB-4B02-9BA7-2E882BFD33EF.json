By uniting academic disciplines tackling social and environmental issue related to the management of natural resources, and focusing on how to best convert world-class research into policy and action, this series directly addresses ESRC’s current “Environment, Energy and Resilience” research and impact strategy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001330/1","grantId":"ES/L001330/1","fundValue":"24146","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"K C  Twyman","coPersons":["Selina  Stead","Andrew John Dougill","Mark Jonathan Whittingham","Jewellord Tolentino Nem Singh","Lindsay  Stringer","Johan A Oldekop"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
