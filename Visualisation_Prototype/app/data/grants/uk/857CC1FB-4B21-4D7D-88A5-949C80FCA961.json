Our prior studies have demonstrated the unique ability of gene therapy (the use of a patient s genes to treat the disease) to prevent the vein getting blocked which is associated with graft failure. We wish to perform a clinical trial in patients undergoing bypass grafting and assess the safety and beneficial effect of gene therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001147","grantId":"G1001147","fundValue":"4029940","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Howard Baker","coPersons":["Keith George Oldroyd","Geoff  Berg","John  Norrie","Stuart Anthony Nicklin","Colin  Berry","Niko  Tzemos"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
