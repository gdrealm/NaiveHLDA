His research underpins techniques to reduce transmission errors in these applications, and has relevance to new areas such as optical storage media.Royal Holloway has a world leading group in cryptography, the science of making and breaking secret codes. Though cryptography often thought of in terms of its traditional role in preserving the confidentiality of messages, there are other applications which include authenticating messages (verifying that a computer is authorised to make an online transaction, for example) which have made cryptographic techniques vital to the modern world.The aim of the visit is to exchange ideas and problems in our respective areas of expertise, in the hope that progress will be made in solving problems that cannot be solved using techniques from one area alone.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E034632/1","grantId":"EP/E034632/1","fundValue":"29166","fundStart":"2007-02-05","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Robert Blackburn","coPersons":["Siaw-Lynn  Ng"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
