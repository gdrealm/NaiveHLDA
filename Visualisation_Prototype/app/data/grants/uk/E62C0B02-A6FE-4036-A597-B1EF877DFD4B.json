STFC will liaise with zCFD and LIDAR manufacturers to obtain\nsample data for study.\n3.3.2 Numerical tools for SWEPT Data Comparison\nSTFC will leverage our existing big data software to create a validation tool for CFD against LIDAR data. The figure below\ndemonstrates how this software will fit into the workflow; LIDAR and CFD output will be input into the software and\nMapReduce algorithms will be used to transform the data into a common format, perform comparisons and summarise the\nresults. The comparisons will be modifiable to produce different outputs depending on the requirements of the user.\n3.3.3 Numerical tools for SWEPT Data Comparison Report\nA report on the reliability, performance and scope of possible data comparison and analysis will be produced.\n3.3.4 Big Data for Windtunnel/CFD Validation\nThe tool developed in 3.3.2 will be used to validate the wind tunnel simulations from 3.1 against the experimental results\nfrom 3.2.\n3.3.5 Big Data for LIDAR/CFD Validation\nThe tool developed in 3.3.2 will be used to validate simulations from 3.1 against the LIDAR data gathered in 3.2 for a\nvariety of test cases.\n3.3.6 Big Data for Validation Report\nThe findings of 3.3.4 and 3.3.5 will be reported, detailing results from several MapReduce algorithms and presenting these\nresults in such a manner that they can be used to manipulate future CFD simulations to improve their accuracy.\n3.3.7 Automated Data Comparison\nThe potential for automated feedback from the results of CFD validation into the parameters of future CFD simulations will\nbe explored, beginning with the identification of areas of the simulation requiring a higher level of resolution. Such feedback\nwould add another level of innovation to the project.\n3.3.8 Automated Data Comparison Report\nThe findings of 3.3.7 will be presented and recommendations made on how automated feedback could form part of future\nprojects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508500/1","grantId":"EP/N508500/1","fundValue":"99856","fundStart":"2015-06-10","fundEnd":"2018-06-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Allan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
