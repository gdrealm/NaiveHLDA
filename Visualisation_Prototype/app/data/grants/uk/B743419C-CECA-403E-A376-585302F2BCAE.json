{"id":"B743419C-CECA-403E-A376-585302F2BCAE","title":"High performance X-ray detectors with sub-100eV energy resolution","abstractText":"Soft X-ray detection is used in a wide range of applications ranging from material research, medical imaging, to industrial manufacturing inspection. This proposal aims to develop a new class of detectors for soft X-ray (&lt;20keV) with potential to achieve better energy resolution and sensitivity than existing cooled Ge and Si detectors. These new X-ray detectors wil be made using InAs, a III-V semiconductor material which has a rare combination of properties for X-ray detection superior to Si, including high X-ray absorption coefficients, high number of carriers generated per absorbed photon, and ability to produce high gain without introducing excess noise (recently discovered at Sheffield).These InAs X-ray avalanche photodiodes (APDs) will be cooled to reduce unwanted leakage current. Our InAs APDs have the potential to achieve the fundamental Fano factor limited energy resolution rather than avalanche gain limited, thus improving on the best data from Si X-ray APDs. This could be the enabling technology to harvest the benefit of high internal gain without incurring significant energy resolution degradation, which has long been the main drawback of X-ray APDs. Its attenuation length, the distance by which the 63% of the X-ray is absorbed, is more than 6 times shorter than that of Si at 5.9keV photon energy, with increasing advantage at higher energies. This enables much shallower InAs pixel to be fabricated and could lead to a new generation of large format arrays that are compatible with digital X-ray imaging. Thus the ultimate aim of this proposal is to demonstrate shallow (&lt;30micron) single-pixel InAs APDs with high gain and excellent energy resolution for soft X-ray detection. This new capability could underpin the next generation X-ray detection for applications such as non-destructive imaging (failure analysis and inspection in material research, electronic component/circuit board inspections and mechanical parts/assemblies), medical imaging (large area imaging of patients, angiography to selectively show blood vessels in the body), real-time imaging (to assist surgeries), and security screening of concealed objects through imaging.Developing InAs X-ray APDs is now finally feasible, owing to exciting developments in wafer growth and device fabrication at Sheffield in the recent years for InAs infrared APDs. Although there are significant different challenges in the development of InAs X-ray APDs, progress in both projects will be accelerated by the synergy. The investigator, who has years of experience with APDs and is currently developing AlGaAs X-ray detectors for room temperature operation, is well-placed to carry out the work. In addition to demonstration of high performance InAs X-ray APDs, this project aims to develop a device simulator of X-ray APDs which will be available to other X-ray detector researchers. This simulator has the unique ability to predict energy resolution limit, taking into account the statistical contribution of the avalanche gain process. In addition to the X-ray APD simulator, the proposed work will establish wafer growth conditions and device fabrication procedures appropriate for InAs X-ray APDs and eventually demonstrate devices with high gain and excellent energy resolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010920/1","grantId":"EP/I010920/1","fundValue":"80181","fundStart":"2011-03-07","fundEnd":"2013-03-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There has been no tangible economic and societal impact as yet.  ","person":"Jo Shien  Ng","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We demonstrated good X-ray detection using InAs Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), when prior literature only consisted of reports of poor X-ray detection performance from InAs diodes. \nOur results showed that the X-ray detection performance in terms of energy resolution improved with the APDs' gain. For example, as the APD's gain increased from 1.6 to 5.3, the detected peak narrowed significantly. The detected peaks' full-width-half-maximum decreased from 2.0 keV to 0.95 eV, correspondingly. The reason for the large improvement is that the internal amplification provided by the InAs APDs boosted the signal, moving it away from noise. \nHowever, the performance of an APD is not solely determined by its gain. We needed to minimise the leakage current of the APD, which can degrade the APD's performance as an X-ray detector. The minimisation of leakage current required us to modify processes we used to produce the APDs and the packaging process that facilitate the actual measurements. \nAs part of our effort in device design, we developed an X-ray APD simulator that is free for anyone to download and use. It is available on https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee/research/smd/research/apd_simulator\n\nThe project also supported demonstration of another X-ray APD made using other materials, GaAs and AlGaAs. Again, the internal gain provided by the APD improved the energy resolution considerably. \nWe did not meet our original objective of achieving sub-100 eV energy resolution. This was largely caused by the experimental setup having fairly high system limit of around 1 keV (the project did not have resources to re-design the circuit). Further work is required to improve the sample production of the InAs X-ray APD to demonstrate its capability as an array detector, which is essential for target applications in defence, healthcare, and Manufacturing.
