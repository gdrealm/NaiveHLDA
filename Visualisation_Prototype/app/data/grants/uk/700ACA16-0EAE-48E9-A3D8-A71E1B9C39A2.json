International Trade and the Gendering of Work, Livelihoods and Survival Strategies","abstractText":"<p>Is international trade and the economic strategies of transnational corporations helping to empower women through the creation of the ‘decent work’ identified by the ILO (International Labour Organisation)&nbsp;as the prerequisite for poverty reduction and sustainable development? Or is global trade maintaining North-South inequalities through the growth in low paid and feminised work? The research seminars series will bring together academics, the trade union movement and development practitioners to engage in critical North-South debate on the changing nature of women’s work and survival strategies, including migration. The seminars will draw on recent research to examine the multiplicity of ways in which women are now working and organising in the extended market relations of the global system. They will explore the changing and developing role of trade unions, including the effort to extend labour codes and fair trade agreements to southern countries, and the challenges of supporting and representing women workers who work and will continue to work outside of protective regulatory frameworks. The seminars will debate how women may best defend their rights and livelihoods in the face of increasing insecurity and risk.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4342","grantId":"RES-451-25-4342","fundValue":"10005","fundStart":"2007-02-19","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Coyle","coPersons":["Ruth  Pearson","Jo  Morris"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
