Antibodies represent the fastest growing class of therapeutics, with over 20 approved for clinical use to date and over 150 in clinical development. It is estimated that the global market for antibody therapeutics is currently around $50 billion. Two particularly promising classes of antibody based therapeutics are antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) and bispecifics, commonly referred to as 'magic-bullet' therapies due to their ability to seek and destroy just diseased cells within the body (e.g. cancer cells). However, a major hindrance to the area is the lack of suitable chemical methods for the construction of homogeneous, well defined, antibody conjugates. Here we propose to exemplify a powerful new chemical technology that we have developed to overcome these limitations, to enable the design of superior next generation ADCs and bispecifics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024349/1","grantId":"BB/L024349/1","fundValue":"480085","fundStart":"2014-07-31","fundEnd":"2017-01-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research project has recently started (July 31st 2014).
