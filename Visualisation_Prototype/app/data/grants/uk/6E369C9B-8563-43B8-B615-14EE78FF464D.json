However, control of this weaponary is crucial to avoid collateral damage to our own bodies. As with all systems, faults sometimes occur and it is thought that some diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or insulin-dependent diabetes, arise when the immune system is not controlled properly. These are known as autoimmune diseases and occur when immune cells, called 'T cells', are triggered inappropriately. We are studying a major 'off switch' on these cells known as CTLA-4, which is extremely important in preventing collateral damage by T cells. However, CTLA-4 is similar to a powerful 'on switch' called CD28 so pressing the right button is critical. Surprisingly CTLA-4 is found inside cells, not on the cell surface like CD28, this makes it difficult to understand how it can work. One idea is that CTLA-4 gets delivered to the cell surface when it's needed, however our experiments show that it doesn't stay at the cell surface but continues to go back inside. We are therefore wondering whether it needs to be inside the cell to work properly. The experiments in this proposal will study the mechanisms used by CTLA-4 to get inside the cell and the bits of CTLA-4 that are needed for this process. Understanding these features will, in the future, allow us to directly test how important internalisation of CTLA-4 is to its function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D011000/1","grantId":"BB/D011000/1","fundValue":"263472","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  this work established our key skills in CTLA-4 endocytosis and cell biology. It provided an enhanced perspective on the cell biology of CTLA-4 underpinning 2 major discoveries: CTLA-4 was sufficient to transfer suppressive activity to T cells and that CTLA-4 removed its ligands by transendocytosis. \n\nthese findings have underpinned all our work in the field and have shaped the way this pathway is now understood and its role in disease.

Previous models for this essential immune regulator have largely ignored its highly endocytic behaviour. We have been able to study this in detail and have identified a novel mechanism which we believe accounts for much of the function of the receptor. In short, we identified that the receptor binds to its ligands on opposing cells and removes them from the cell surface by a process of Trans-endocytosis. The trafficking of the CTLA-4 receptor then directs the ligands to lysosomes for degradation. Possibilities for pharmaceutical development We are continuing to understand the molecular details for how endocytosis and Transendocytosis are achieved. This is providing novel molecular targets for drug intervention which may be useful in the settings of cancer and autoimmunity. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
