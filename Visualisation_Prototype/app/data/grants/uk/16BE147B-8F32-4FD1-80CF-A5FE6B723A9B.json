{"id":"16BE147B-8F32-4FD1-80CF-A5FE6B723A9B","title":"Application to STFC for Consolidated Grant Support for the Solar Physics and Space Plasma Research Centre (SP2RC) at The University of Sheffield","abstractText":"The Solar Physics and Space Plasma Research Centre (SP2RC) at the University of Sheffield seeks to understand the nature of key plasma processes occurring in the near-solar surface, the atmosphere of the Sun from photosphere to corona, solar wind and magnetosphere with particular attention devoted to the various coupling mechanisms of these apparently distinct regions. A large part of the energy flux released in the solar atmosphere travels into interplanetary space and impacts on the Earth's bow shock, energising the magnetosphere and having impact of our daily human life. The generation of energetic events in the solar interior and near solar sub-surface region and their propagation through the solar interior-atmosphere-space plasma system into solar wind and magnetosphere driving Space Weather will be investigated by using mathematical and numerical modelling and the analysis of latest available satellite and ground-based datasets. Particular attention is paid to the wave coupling processes in this complex and very dynamic physical Sun-Earth system. \n \nOur mathematical approach involves rigorous analytical work and the implementation of parallel computing (GRID and CUDA-enabled technology) where results will be tested and verified by making and using space (SOHO, TRACE, Hinode, SDO, IRIS, Cluster, THEMIS) and ground-based (Swedish Solar Telescope, Dunn Solar Telescope) observations. The proposed programme involves eight scientific projects: 1) The effect of fibril magnetic fields on the propagation of p-modes; 2) Kink wave energy transport and dissipation in the solar atmosphere; 3) 3D MHD wave forward modelling: Localised atmospheric waveguides and jets; 4) ROSA/IBIS classification study of MHD modes and their absolute/relative energy flux in the lower solar atmosphere ; 5) Advanced solar atmospheric MHD wave modelling; 6) Stochastic coronal global waves as means for global coronal seismology; 7) The formation, structure and evolution of collisionless shocks inside 1AU; and 8) Novel investigations of plasma waves in the inner magnetosphere. The programme also has a vibrant and vital Visiting Researchers project. \n \nWe request funding to cover salaries of the RAs, appropriate costs for research leadership/management and research time for the Principal Investigator and eight Co-Investigators, funding for two special project-related observational PhD studentship in order to train the future generation of experts in the field, funding for a modest but essential Visitor Researcher Programme, for travel &amp; subsistence, computing equipment and consumables.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000826/1","grantId":"ST/M000826/1","fundValue":"664327","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Von Fay-Siebenburgen","coPersons":["Viktor  Fedun","Michael  Ruderman"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
