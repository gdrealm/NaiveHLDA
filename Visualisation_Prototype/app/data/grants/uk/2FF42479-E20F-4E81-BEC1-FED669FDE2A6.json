It allows researchers to visualise biological structure and function on almost the molecular scale in live cells and organisms. Typically biological processes are visualised by attaching fluorescent molecules to proteins of interest forming images from the light emitted by these fluorescent &quot;labels&quot;. The optical resolution, which defines the smallest structures that can be visualised, has long been regarded as fundamentally limited to &gt;200 nm by the diffraction of light waves. Recent breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy, however, have exploited the ability to systematically switch the emission of fluorescent molecules on and off in order to break the &quot;diffraction limit&quot; and achieve resolutions down to 10's of nm - almost the scale of the typical biological proteins that are involved in signalling processes that determine the fate of cells and organisms and so are essential to disease processes. \n\nThis project builds on the partnership between the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC) and Imperial College London to develop a range of SRM instruments to advance our understanding of epigenetics, regulation of genes and cells, immunology and metabolism by resolving fundamental biological mechanisms inside the nucleus, inside live cells and at the synapses of interacting cells. It also aims to establish super-resolved microscopy as a widely accessible tool for the research community at the CSC and Imperial. \n\nThe first SRM technique would be structured illumination microscopy (SIM) that entails illuminating samples with patterns of light and observing the interference patterns between these patterns and the structure of the sample. This effectively doubles the resolution of a normal microscope. The second approach is an advance on laser scanning confocal microscopy, in which as sample is imaged by scanning a focused laser beam across a sample and collecting the fluorescence pixel by pixel through a pinhole that blocks out of focus or scattered light. The size of this focussed laser beam spot defines the resolution of this microscope. By using a second, collinear, specially shaped laser beam that is scanned synchronously and can switch off the fluorescence from molecules around the outside of the first beam focus, the fluorescence excitation is restricted to a smaller spot than the diffraction limit and thus resolutions below 50 nm can be realised. Because this technique can block scattered or out of focus light, it is particularly suitable for imaging in live organisms. The third SRM modality relies on having only a small fraction of the fluorescent labels being switched on at any time such that they can be treated like arrays of single molecules. Their individual positions can be determined by locating the centres of the &quot;blobs&quot; that represent each molecule in an image - which is possible to a precision of a few nm. By sequentially switching on different subsets of the fluorescent labels and determining their individual positions, one can build up a super-resolved &quot;image&quot; that is simply the map of the locations of all the fluorescent molecules.\n\nIn this proposal, we will develop and apply these new imaging techniques to visualise biological structures and processes that are simply too small or inaccessible for conventional microscopes. Starting at the surface of cells, researchers will be able to observe how immune cells communicate and nerve cells interact with each other, and how tumour cells relate to normal cells. Looking inside cells, we will visualise signals that communicate the energy status of cells and how the genome is organised. It will be possible to resolve how chromosomes behave in developing germ cells, which is relevant to the most frequent causes of infertility and birth defects. The research will deliver new insights into both normal biological processes and disease states.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015834/1","grantId":"MR/K015834/1","fundValue":"1973210","fundStart":"2013-02-13","fundEnd":"2017-08-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthias  Merkenschlager","coPersons":["Enrique  Martinez-Perez","Roy  Taylor","David  Carling","Christopher  Dunsby","Amanda  Fisher","Anthony Ian Magee","Mark Andrew Neil","Simona  Parrinello","Paul Michael William  French","Vincenzo  De Paola"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
