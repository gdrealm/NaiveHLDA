{"id":"FB71AB7F-BE22-45E3-8CA5-2CE6D928B807","title":"Measuring the effects of Space Weather in the UK using a network of school magnetometers","abstractText":"We aim to (1) build a network of magnetic field sensors to be deployed in schools across the UK, to add to the small existing network from AuroraWatch at the University of Lancaster and (2) help expand citizen science capability for space weather researchers. \n\nThis project relates to a number of STFC areas of science and technology: space science; instrumentation; physics of the planets and magnetosphere. It is intended to encourage students from 14 to 18 years old to look at how instruments can be used to collect data and integrate it together to give a wider understanding of physical phenomena. The proposed instrument involves learning that crosses several topical areas, such as electronics, computing and electromagnetism and links into the study of space from the planet's surface. It will also highlight the how remote processes on the Sun can affect the magnetic field of the Earth. The instrument is non-gender-specific so is suitable for all young people and anyone able to use a computer to run the sensor and visualise the data.\n\nThis will be a pilot study to recruit schools and teachers around the UK to trial the use of a custom-built three-axis magnetometer with a Raspberry Pi computer. The schools will receive support from Lancaster University and BGS and we will also produce bespoke educational materials to begin with. The schools will feedback about their experiences running the instrument and how they use it in the teaching of curriculum, allowing us to improve the materials. All data measured will be available via a centralised website, allowing the schools to compare their data with others across the country. With the building of a network, open to both schools and citizen scientists, we hope to encourage students and teachers to think about the magnetic field and the physical processes involved.\n\nOne of the reasons for doing this now is because, as a society, we are increasingly reliant on space-based technologies such as GPS and satellite communications. We have become more exposed to risks from Space Weather - primarily, the interaction between the Earth and the Sun's magnetic fields. Although the visible effects caused by Coronal Mass Ejections from the Sun are the aurorae observed during large geomagnetic storms, there are also invisible effects on the magnetic field that can recorded on the ground. The second aim of this project is to involve schools and other interested parties in making precise measurements of the magnetic field across the UK so researchers can understand these effects in more detail.\n\nUntil recently, equipment with the required level of sensitivity needed to detect the variations of the magnetic field due to space weather (around ten parts in a million) has only been available to the scientific community. The costs have typically been on the order of several thousands of pounds for a set of dedicated instrumentation. However, with advances in technology, instruments of almost-scientific quality can now be built for around two hundred pounds. We have spent the past year testing a number of different magnetic sensors and developing new prototypes. \n\nOn its own a single magnetic sensor (magnetometer) is not particularly useful, but tied into a UK-wide network of sensors, such a system can provide both an educational tool for physics, astronomy, geology and geography students and a means to participate in a scientific experiment to study the detailed variation of the magnetic field over the UK, particularly during a geomagnetic storm. The BGS runs three observatories in the UK, but these are located in an approximately straight line from Shetland to Devon. Additional instruments across the UK will help 'fill in the gaps' and provide longitudinal coverage in the UK, allowing more detailed maps of the magnetic field variation to be made.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006565/1","grantId":"ST/M006565/1","fundValue":"9998","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2017-01-11","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ciaran  Beggan","coPersons":["Farideh  Honary"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
