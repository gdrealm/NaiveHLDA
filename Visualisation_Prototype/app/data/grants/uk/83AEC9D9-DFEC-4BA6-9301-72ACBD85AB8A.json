{"id":"83AEC9D9-DFEC-4BA6-9301-72ACBD85AB8A","title":"Global Cult Cinema in the Age of Convergence","abstractText":"In recent years the use of the term 'cult' in relation to film and, increasingly, other media has expanded in many different areas, which include: postings by fans; promotional material and retail categorisation; academic articles; and journalistic discourse. With the growth of domestic viewing platforms and internet use, increasingly numerous avenues now exist through which cult followings can accrue. This leads to a greater mainstreaming of cult cinema as it increasingly enters everyday communication and as industrial forces continually incorporate cult activities and discourses into their marketing activities. While earlier studies of cult media focused upon cult as 'bottom-up' process through which fans took ownership of texts, it is now important to extend such perspectives by examining how particular cultural mediators - such as exhibitors, critics and producers - can also play a role within the emergence of cult status. This mainstreaming of cult media has been accompanied by an increasing international spread of the term, which has been intensified through the rise of global networks. It is the international dimension of cult cinema, alongside its shifting nature within a digitized global mediascape, which form the central focus of this network. The network will create connections between people interested in cult media, further facilitating understandings of likeminded research amongst a global cult community.\n\nCult cinema has often been linked to the celebration of a wide range of international films, but this internationalism is nevertheless limited. Many international cult films have gained their cult status in contexts outside of those countries in which they were produced. The reception contexts in which international films have gained cult status have tended to be metropolitan areas of the United States. This network aims to extend the study of international cult cinema to more fully come to terms with its global dimensions. This includes thinking about, for example: localized cult receptions around different parts of the world; particular ways in which the distribution and marketing of films in specific territories may have contributed to cult reputations; studies of cult films that are marked by internationalism at the level of production; cult films marked by the recycling of material originating from other contexts; the rise of international festivals and their significance for cult reputations. \n\nWe also want to address technological developments and how they have impacted upon the field of cult cinema, in particular how they have affected conceptions of the local and the global. Home viewing technologies and digital networks have hugely altered the ways in which films are consumed and how cult fans form connections with other fans. This network will seek to research how fans may perform cultism online though e-zines and journals, blogs, discussion groups, and how online communities are increasingly being established to share cult-related material via torrent files. Whilst issues of virtuality and space-time compression have aided the international dimensions of cult fandom, we still wish to explore how place continues to be important within a networked mediascape, and to scrutinise the extent to which such internationalism may be limited through addressing the extent to which certain regions may have privileged access to networks. \n\nThis network aims to create connections between researchers involved in cult media in and also outside of the UK, as well as selected figures outside of academia including cinema programmers and people involved in home entertainment services. It also encourages a broad range of approaches to cult cinema, including but not limited to: audience and reception studies; production analyses; considerations of controversy and censorship; adaptation studies; distribution and marketing studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005111/1","grantId":"AH/K005111/1","fundValue":"19764","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Impact has been mostly related to the film programme in terms of contextualising and discussing the films shown, and demonstrating academic findings to a largely non-academic audience in non-specialist language.

It has discussed developments in digital and global cult cinema, identifying issues that can be worked upon. Some of this knowledge is disseminated via the first publication output. We have also developed connections between scholars working in cult cinema and non-scholars - including DVD companies, journalists - to exchange perspectives.
