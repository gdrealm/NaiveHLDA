{"id":"2405018E-7C19-4A8E-B326-D3C4AB04E450","title":"Sequencing of Epigenetic Marks","abstractText":"The ultimate goal is to more accurately sequence the mammalian genome, for the first time identifying both of the modified DNA bases (epigenetic marks) of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in addition to the 4 primary bases. This will lead to better knowledge of cell function, have important implications in stem cell research, personalised and regenerative medicines, and show substantial commercial utility. All cells in the body have the same DNA sequence but its interpretation (epigenetics) results in formation of different cell types. 5-mC is a well-known epigenetic mark, but the function of 5-hmC is as yet unknown. Our method specifically locates and quantifies these epigenetic marks together in DNA. We will optimise this method to allow its commercial use more widely on more difficult cell types and the whole human genome. Decoding these epigenetic marks will provide greater understanding of cell regulation and could open up new ways of diagnosing disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K010859/1","grantId":"BB/K010859/1","fundValue":"129646","fundStart":"2012-11-14","fundEnd":"2013-11-13","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Experimental details and summary of kit produced TrueMethylTM Kit is currently being used to map methylation and hydroxymethylation within the human and other genomes. The importance of epigenetic markers such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is still currently under intense investigation but links between changes in epigenetic marks and disease states such as cancer are well established. Further, understanding of these epigenetic marks will translate into better diagnoses and stratified treatment for disease, primarily cancer.

The use of the kit will allow investigators to sequence 5hmC in genomes at single base resolution. 5hmC has been shown to have a link to certain cancers. Academic researchers are currently using this method to understand the role and occurrence of such epigenetic marks, which may ultimately lead to a diagnostic role in the clinic for such technology.
