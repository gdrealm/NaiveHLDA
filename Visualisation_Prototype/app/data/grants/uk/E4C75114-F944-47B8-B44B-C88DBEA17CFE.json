Thus far we have pursued the intellectual agenda through a large comparative monograph, three reports on multi-level and regional citizenship in the UK (focussing on England) and various conference papers. Our planning on our summer school is progressing and we are holding a meeting of the international network next month to further progress funding applications. Our research findings are of relevance to scholars on territorial politics, citizenship, regionalism and nationalism as well as methodologists and comparative survey experts.
