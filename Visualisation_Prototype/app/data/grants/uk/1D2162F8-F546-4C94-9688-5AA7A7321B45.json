Working scientifically is an area of the primary science National Curriculum (NC) that has had fresh light thrown upon it with the revised NC 2013, and teachers are actively exploring what this looks like, sounds like and feels like in a primary classroom, both indoors and outdoors. Similarly, the big ideas around Evolution has been introduced which builds on what children have learned about fossils in their topic on Rocks at an early age. Together these two aspects of work have inspired us to explore the work of palaeontologists and archaeologists at the University of Manchester (UoM) and at Diamond to provide children with a window into the worlds of contemporary science research in this area. \n\nThere is so much learning about what it means to work scientifically that can be discovered when school teacher collaborate with STEM researchers and it only takes the effort to make and support those collaborations for real learning to flourish. Through talk these professionals deconstruct the processes that they explore in their work with research and children and intrinsically talk through the topics they are working on. It will challenge the clinical look and feel of science that often is limited to standard fair test investigations and illustrate the fluid and sometimes chaotic nature of science endeavour whilst contrasting that with the precision and attention to detail that then must unfold. It shall explore the habits of minds that scientists and engineers use and develop to sustain work in their field. \n\nThe beauty of this project will be its focus on Diamond Light Source Technologies (LST) a resource that is unheard of in the world of most of the public. It is through the interrelationship of the UoM's Science Education Research &amp; Innovation Hub (www.manchester.ac.uk/fascinate) who have long standing experience in school liaison, CPD and curriculum development, with key faculty centres such as the Interdisciplinary Centre for ancient Life (ICAL) at the University of Manchester (www.ical.manchester.ac.uk) who bring a wealth of experience and expertise in the fossil excavation and there integral work with Diamond LST that we are confident we can develop ideas to intrigue and inspire children into this area of learning. What it is Diamond LST? What it is used for? Who works with it and why? Through this project we can be expose and showcase how it is applied into the work of leading palaeontologists work to intrigue and fascinate children, their teachers and their families about real world science and engineering innovations.\n\nThe involvement of the Ideas Foundation (IF) adds further uniqueness to creating this narrative and telling this story in a novel way. Their experience in the use of digital media as a means by which to engage learning will mean that there is a creative edge to the sharing of learning from this project. IF will support the project in the coordination of a pupil designed and made animation to showcase the practice of science and engineers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006557/1","grantId":"ST/M006557/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2015-05-14","fundEnd":"2016-02-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Lynne  Bianchi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
