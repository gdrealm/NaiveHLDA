The LEicester Data Archive Service (LEDAS) now offers a very wide range of facilities to UK astronomers including access to the full data archives of many recent X-ray astronomy missions. This application seeks the continuation of LEDAS funding during 1 June 2007 - 31 March 2009. This proposal is for continuation of the LEDAS service, and for enhancement to enable full virtual observatory access. We will provide a VO tool tuned to the needs of high-energy astrophysicists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G001278/1","grantId":"ST/G001278/1","fundValue":"189487","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Julian Paul Osborne","coPersons":["Robert  Warwick"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
