An understanding the underlying processes is necessary to promote effective transferable management strategies. This is especially important in the marine environment where there are few obvious boundaries to gene flow. Biodiversity is lost within populations by drift &amp; directional selection, and retained among populations by the same processes. The size of insular populations helps to determine the dominant process, since drift is stronger than selection in small populations. It is known that much natural diversity is divided among conspecific populations by these processes, but the fragmented structure of this diversity is often cryptic, especially in poorly understood environments like the deep sea. \n\nWe typically define populations a priori by geographic distance and according to apparent physical boundaries. However, in addition to spatial factors, environmental characteristics can affect patterns of connectivity by affecting the rate and direction of gene flow, and this influence will vary as environments change over time. Environmental characteristics also drive local selection, and selection can maintain differences among populations even with continuing gene flow. Without knowledge about how local populations may have adapted to local environments, we remain unable to incorporate that type of biodiversity into conservation strategy, and to address its potential importance to the long-term survival of species. Understanding the function and value of biodiversity requires a better understanding of the interacting processes of selection and drift leading to its evolution and loss. While much of the relevant theory is well established, empirical data are required to test theory and determine how environmental factors interact with evolutionary processes in natural systems. \n\nIn this study we will employ second generation sequencing technologies to investigate how environmental factors are associated with the evolution of population structure and speciation in the deep sea, at both neutral and functional loci. The particular focus will be on habitat depth and isolation by distance, however other environmental factors will be quantified at collection sites based on data collected from the same sites during the recent ECOMAR consortium study (during which samples for the proposed study were collected). The study species will be fish in the genus Coryphaenoides, a specious genus of deep demersal fishes, some of which are commercially important fisheries species (including the primary focal species in this study, C. rupestris). Initial studies have shown phylogenetic lineage division correleted to habitat depth. Other work has indicated selection at genes associated with adaptation to pressure in some of these species. Two focal Coryphaenoides species will be investigated in a comparative population genomics study. These species, C. rupestris and C. brevibarbis are sympatric, but the former is found at shallower depths than the latter. We will test hypotheses about how habitat division by depth or other characteristics (e.g. current systems or geographic distance) may determine the evolution of intra- and inter-specific diversity (including among multiple habitat-specialist species in the genus using an extended phylogenetic assessment) both by drift (through differential environmental pressures associated with dispersal) and by selection. Greater connectivity is predicted in the abyssal habitat, which may lead to larger effective population sizes and facilitate adaptive evolution. Taken together these data will provide novel insight into the interactive role of drift and selection during the evolution of diversity, and transferable inference about how diversity is structured in the deep sea.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K005359/1","grantId":"NE/K005359/1","fundValue":"397273","fundStart":"2013-07-31","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our research is still in the stage of development and data gathering, however we have already disseminated ideas and engaged in discussion through our working group (a panel of research biologists and resource managers established to provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions - each is an expert in different aspects of deep-sea biology, fisheries, and conservation).

From these data we have developed approximately 5000 loci in each species. Initial analyses are ongoing but these data will be used to improve our understanding of the way that key environmental and life history factors influence population structure and local adaptation. In particular, we will learn about stock structure within and among geographic regions, and test hypotheses about the implications for the role of life history and environmental factors (especially associated with habitat depth) in the evolution and loss of diversity. \n\nWe are also working to sequence whole genomes, initially of our two focal species (C. rupestris and C. brevibarbis). In March 2014 we submitted DNA for C. rupestris to the University of Liverpool Centre for Genomic Research for sequencing. To date sequencing sufficient for a draft genome of considerable resolution has been produced for C. rupestris. These data are being assembled by bioinformaticians at Liverpool. The goal of this ambitious effort is twofold: to produce annotated genomes of deep-sea fishes that will be invaluable resources to the broader scientific community and to identify regions of the genome that correlate with adaptation to depth. By directly comparing the genomes of these species we hope to identify regions that may have been involved in adaptation to abyssal depths. Then by sequencing these regions in many individuals across the genus, we hope to fully resolve the evolutionary relationships within this important genus of deep-sea fishes and gain a better understanding of diversification within the group.\n\nOur study will also investigate the broader evolutionary history through 'phylogenetics'). The genus Coryphaenoides is a specious genus of deep demersal fishes that is comprised of 66 recognized species. Recent phylogenies of the group show divisions among species that correlate with depth (abyssal vs those that live shallower than 4000 m) while others have identified two genes (LDH and MyHC) that are associated with adaptation to depth in this genus. Comparative assessments of these loci and those identified as potentially under selection using the RADSeq data will be used to determine which genes correlate with adaptation to depth. Multiple environmental characteristics will be assessed for possible correlation, and trees based on protein sequences will be compared with those based on neutral genes. Due to extensive efforts to obtain samples we now have fresh tissues from 27 species in the genus. Using our mitochondrial sequences we have produced a preliminary phylogenetic tree that includes 63 mitochondrial DNA 'COI' sequences that confirms the presence of two lineages: one that includes abyssal species and another comprised of shallower taxa. Working group: As part of our project and to ensure that the results of our work reaches end-users we have put together a panel of research biologists and resource managers to provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions. Each is an expert in different aspects of deep-sea biology, fisheries, and conservation. The working group meets via virtual workshops once a year. The first meeting was held in December 2013 with the second planned for January 2015. During the next meeting the working group will discuss project progress and the implications of our findings. Toward the end of the third and final year of the project a workshop will be organized at Durham University (2016) in which final results will be presented and a round table discussion will be held to outline the implications of our findings for conservation and management issues and to discuss possible future research directions. \n\nWorking Group members\n\n1) Monty Priede, Professor Emeritus at University of Aberdeen \n\n2) Rachel Jeffreys, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research \n\n3) Alex Rogers, Professor in Conservation Biology at the University of Oxford. \n\n4) Pascal Lorance, Marine Biologist at IFREMER\n\n5) John Gordon, Research Fellow at the Scottish Association of Marine Science \n\n6) Kerry Howell, Associate Professor at Plymouth University \n\n7) Francis Neat, Senior Researcher at Marine Scotland Science \n\n8) Ross Jolliffe, Divisional fisheries Director at Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas)\n\n9) Tom Blasdale, Marine Species Adviser at the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)\n\n10) Oscar Gaggiotti, Professor at the University of St Andrews\n\n11) Selina Stead, Professor of Marine Governance and Environmental Science at Newcastle University\n\n12) Ben Wigham, Lecturer in Marine Science at Newcastle University\n\nWebsite: To help facilitate dissemination of information both to the public and to relevant conservation agencies we have hired a web design company and are in the final stages of developing a website. The site is designed to be of broad interest and will be an important tool to help the general public understand how the environment shapes and promotes the evolution of diversity, and the implications for effective conservation management in the deep sea while providing a valuable resource for researchers and managers. This website has a front end that explains the science in lay terms, describes the problems faced by resource managers, and outlines how our project will address management concerns. The website includes a blog for public feedback, summary of working group meetings and links to other relevant and important websites.
