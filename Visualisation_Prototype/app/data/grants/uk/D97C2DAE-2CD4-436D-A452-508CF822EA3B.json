Social and political attitudes in the wake of devolution","abstractText":"<p>As a consequence of devolution, policy is now discussed within Scotland with little reference to equivalent discussions in England.&nbsp; Consequently, discussions take place in a crucially different context. The two main political parties are avowedly on the centre left, rather than one on the centre left and one on the centre right. Meanwhile, Scotland has traditionally had a higher level of religious attendance, and still has a more prominent Catholic community. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, people in Scotland would appear to be exposed to a different set of cues about what policies should be pursued by government. The advent of devolution may have set in train a process whereby social and political attitudes are growing apart from those in England.</p>\n\n<p>This project assesses whether such divergence is occurring by comparing trends in public attitudes in England and Scotland in three areas - attitudes towards equality and efforts by government to reduce it, moral issues, and charging for certain government services such as prescriptions.&nbsp; A module of 20 questions will be included on the 2010 British and Scottish Social Attitudes, all of which questions were previously asked (on both surveys) shortly after the Scottish Parliament was first created.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4108","grantId":"RES-000-22-4108","fundValue":"75055","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Kevin Curtice","coPersons":["RACHEL MARY ORMSTON"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":" When the Scottish Parliament was created, people in Scotland were somewhat more likely than those in England to express support for a social democratic point of view. Moreover, although many of the response distributions to relevant survey questions were only mildly different in the two countries, the differences that did exist could not adequately be accounted for by differences in their social composition or the distribution of party political sympathies. Rather, what mattered was that those with a strong sense of Scottish identity were more likely to adopt a social democratic outlook, implying that attempts by politicians and others to secure support for such an outlook by appealing to that sense of identity had some potential to succeed.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is no systematic evidence that during the course of the subsequent ten years public opinion in Scotland has become more social democratic relative to that in England. Rather, there has been a parallel decline on both sides of the border in support for a social democratic outlook, a decline that has occurred irrespective of people's sense of national identity (or indeed any other characteristic). Consequently Scotland still appears to be somewhat more social democratic than England, but no more so than ten years ago, while in absolute terms Scotland is less social democratic now than previously.\n\n\n\nThis remains the case even if we focus on a policy area for which responsibility has been devolved and where a very distinctive public policy has been pursued. Opposition to the idea that at least some university students should pay tuition fees, never much greater than in England in the first place, has fallen markedly in Scotland - in line with the trend south of the border.\n\n\n\nEven in 2000 there was no systematic difference between Scotland and England in the incidence of socially conservative views. That remains the case now. Moreover, where public opinion in England has become more liberal, as for example in the case of same sex relationships, much the same trend is also evident in Scotland.\n\n\n\nIt thus appears that the development of distinctive policy communities in Scotland has had no discernible impact on trends in public opinion north of the border. While the balance of opinion within those communities may be more social democratic and socially conservative than in England, the distinctive tenor of these debates does not percolate through to public attitudes. It seems we have to remember that while people in Scotland are exposed to the policy debates that take place north of the border, they are not insulated from those taking place in England too, not least because their content is disseminated in Scotland by UK-wide media outlets. Equally, where social attitudes are changing as a result of social change, that change may well be occurring throughout the UK. \n\n\n\nConsequently, there seems no reason to believe that devolution is widening differences in social attitudes - and thus giving rise to increasing pressure for divergent policies that may be difficult to accommodate within the framework of the Union. The research is highly relevant to the continuing policy debate about Scotland's constitutional status, and in particular whether the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament is consistent with the maintenance of the Union. It is thus of interest to all those concerned professionally and politically with that subject. Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
