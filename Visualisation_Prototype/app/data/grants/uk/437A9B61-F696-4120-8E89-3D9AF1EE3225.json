A common modification for example includes phosphorylation. Arginine methylation is now emerging as a mainstream post translational modification of proteins, similar to protein phosphorylation. It has recently been shown that the methylation of arginines can be antagonised enzymatically and it is therefore dynamic in nature. This offers exciting prospects that arginine methylation, as a eukaryotic post translational modification, may mirror phosphorylation in its level of complexity. Many RNA binding proteins undergo arginine methylation as a post translational modification. The methylation of arginine residues is thought to structurally alter the protein and therefore perturb protein-protein or protein nucleic interactions. We have recently used novel enrichment procedures to purify a multi protein nuclear complex from mammalian nuclear cell extracts in which PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor) is bound to p54nrb/NonO (Non-POU-domain-containing, octamer-binding protein) and identified sites of arginine methylation on the protein PSF. It is proposed to characterise the sites of arginine methylation of the multi-functional nuclear proteins PSF and p54nrb and further explore the roles of such modifications. The characterisation of post translational modifications (arginine methylation and citrullination) and exploring the roles played by such modifications on the multifunctional nuclear protein complex is an ideal forum for a multi-disciplinary experimental programme, encompassing aspects of biophysical techniques in the analysis of biological systems. The research will be performed within the Systems Biology group in the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering at the University of Sheffield.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D011795/1","grantId":"BB/D011795/1","fundValue":"201755","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Dickman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We have developed novel analytical methods for the identification of protein arginine methylation. We have developed novel peptide separations at neutral pH in conjunction with electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry that results in the enhanced analysis of arginine methylation. These approaches have been successfully used to characterise sites of arginine methylation of a number of important proteins including PSF both in vivo (in conjunction with heavy methyl SILAC) and in vitro following methylation of PSF with PRMT1 (Snijders AP et al. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom. 2010, 1, 88-96). Furthermore, we have shown that PSF can be citrullinated in vitro by PADI4 at arginine residues that are methylated in vivo, therefore demonstrating that citrullination blocks arginine methylation of PSF in vitro.\n\n\n\nUsing this developed methodology we also identified and characterised sites of arginine methylation in RNA and export factor binding protein (REF). Moreover, in collaboration with Prof Stuart Wilson, University of Sheffield, it was demonstrated that arginine methylation modulates its RNA binding affinity and ensures efficient handover of mRNA to TAP/NXF1 from REF (Hung ML et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2010, 38, 3351-61) \n\n\n\nThe development of mass spectrometry based approaches for the identification and characterisation of protein post translational modifications developed during the course of this grant also facilitated the the identification of a wide range of PTMs (methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation) of the Histone linker proteins H1 and H5 from chicken erythrocytes, providing further evidence that such PTMs of the linker histones play a role in chromatin remodelling and gene regulation (Snijders et al., J. Proteome. Res., 2008,7,4326-35). Furthermore, the funding and the tools developed acted as a springboard for a collaborative research to identify a novel toxin from Burkholderia pseudomallei (BPSL1549). Mass spectrometry studies revealed that the toxin promotes deamidation of glutamine-339 of the translation initiation factor eIF4A, abolishing its helicase activity and inhibiting translation (Cruz-Migoni A., et al., Science. 2011 334, 6057, 821-4). The UK proteomics development and user community including government-funded and industrial, and those who support it will benefit from the bioanalytical tools that we have developed. The UK pharmaceutical and biological industries will be able to take advantage of the these methods for application in their own specific biological systems. \n\n\n\nIn addition this research has provided further insight into important biological systems including RNA export and RNA transcription/splicing. These important phenomena are associated with human health and disease. The novel analytical tools we have developed for the identification and characterisation of protein methylation will be of significant interest to those groups both academic and industrial for application in there own specific biological systems of interest. Direct application of these tools can be utilised by academic and industrial researchers analysing protein methylation. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
