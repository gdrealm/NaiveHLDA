After its recent upgrade it is now capable of discovering ice giant planets in short orbits and the data from its first 2 year run is now being ingested into the WASP archive. We will continue our successful exploitation of this data in our exoplanet discovery and characterisation programme and prepare for the the first data from our new world leading NGTS experiment. NGTS is designed for routine detection of ice-giants and its red- sensitivity means it will be the leading source of rocky super-Earth planets that are confirmable with current equipment. This will allow us to lead in understanding the most common types of planet and allow us to take the first steps in looking at the different classes of planet and their characteristics.\n\nFor our brightest planets we will conduct follow up observations that will allow us to understand their dynamical histories and take the first steps to characterise their atmospheres.\n\nIn addition we will study the architectures of exoplanetary systems and in particular we will characterise bright multi-planet and circumbinary systems. Through our collaborations this will allow us to place strong constraints on their evolutionary histories. \n\nThis proposal is to allow the transfer of the PI's current fEC from QUB to the University of Warwick where he has recently taken up a new position.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006126/1","grantId":"ST/K006126/1","fundValue":"54585","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Don  Pollacco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
