It is timely because there have been considerable changes over the last decade both in the identification of hearing loss at birth and in the provision of sophisticated hearing aids&nbsp; - cochlear implants and digital sharing aids - that offer the possibility for deaf children to have greater access to spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>These positive changes would be expected to have a significant impact on the development of literacy, both in terms of rates of progress and on the underpinning developmental mechanisms such as use of phonological skills in reading and spelling. In order to understand the impact of these changes, children's performance in a range of reading and spelling tasks will be compared with the performance of deaf children who were assessed ten years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The aim will be not only to find out whether reading and spelling have significantly improved but also whether the way that deaf children learn to read and write has fundamentally changed. Our research will show what best supports the development of literacy for deaf children.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005251/1","grantId":"ES/K005251/1","fundValue":"316488","fundStart":"2013-06-13","fundEnd":"2016-06-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Harris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
