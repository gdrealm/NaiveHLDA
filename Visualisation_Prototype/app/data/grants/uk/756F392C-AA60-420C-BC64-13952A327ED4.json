{"id":"756F392C-AA60-420C-BC64-13952A327ED4","title":"Optimum detectors for artificial object recognition","abstractText":"Current digital cameras have a linear response and are only really suitable for simple picture imaging under controlled light conditions. In fact compared to human vision these cameras have two critical and debilitating limitations, a limited dynamic range and variability in object colour. The first of these limitations causes saturation when the dynamic range of a scene is larger than that of the camera. The second limitation is subtler and means that unlike human vision it is difficult to use colour information from linear cameras in artificial object recognition systems. Both these limitations can be overcome using pixels with a relatively narrow spectral response and an output that is proportional to the logarithm of the detected photocurrent. We intend to overcome these limitations by developing a new camera technology based upon organic photodiodes and a logarithmic response.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E009492/1","grantId":"EP/E009492/1","fundValue":"472302","fundStart":"2007-04-19","fundEnd":"2010-04-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Collins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The human visual system has a property known as colour constancy which means that the percieved colour of a surface is independant of the spectrum of the illuminating light. Unfortunately, camera-based systems don't have the same property and as a result it is impossible to use colour information when performing a range of tasks such as object recognition and tracking on the vast amounts of data that are increasingly available from cameras. \n\n\n\nWithin the project a pixel-level colours constancy algorithm has been developed and assessed using a computer model. This assessment shows that although the pixels in cameras are not ideal this algorithm can be used to extract reliable information from the red, green and blue pixels in a conventional camera when the scene is illuminated by daylight rather than artificial light. In addition results obtained within the project suggest that the algorithm can be also used with ultra-violet and near-infrared light. \n\n\n\nThe quality of the information that can be extracted from the pixel responses will critically depend upon the quality of the data available from each pixel. To avoid loss of information by under or over exposure wide-dynamic range pixels have also been developed within the project. These pixels are potential easier to use than existing wide dynamic range pixels. Results obtained within the project could be used within one of the many systems that use cameras to image scenes illuminated by daylight. An example of this type of system is the planned use of cameras within cars. If cameras are used that are sensitive to the near-infrared then it can be used to image invisible signs of stress in plants to help farmers detect nutrient stress, pests or diseases so that they can maximise yield whilst reducing the use agrochemicals. The two main results will have different exploitation routes. The wide-dynamic range pixels can only be exploited in collaboration with a CMOS image sensor manufacturer. The colour constancy algroithm can potentially be exploited in any system that includes colour cameras. Security and Diplomacy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
