DNA is composed of two polymer strands that are entwined to form a twisted ladder, known as the double helix. The rungs of the ladder are made up of a DNA alphabet A, C, T and G. These alphabet pieces, known as nucleotides, pair according to special rules; A will pair only with a T in the opposite strand, and G only with a C. Thus, each strand of the DNA molecule serves as a template to specify the sequence of nucleotides during duplication, or replication, of the complementary strand. The process of replicating our genetic material is awe-inspiring in its complexity, as it involves copying billions of nucleotides with exceptional speed and accuracy. This amazing feat is performed by a group of proteins that together form a &quot;replication machine&quot;. Understanding the function of each of these proteins is critical since failure of any one of them may result in a life threatening disease. In addition to the problem of accurate replication, DNA is under continual onslaught from environmental chemicals and radiation (mainly the sun's rays). These alter the DNA bases so that they no longer pair up, as they should, again a life-threatening situation. Biological systems have evolved a number of enzymes (biological catalysts) that are involved in repairing damaged DNA. An enzyme involved in both DNA replication and repair is Flap endonuclease. Without flap endonucleases and enzymes like them (known as a family of proteins) life cannot exist. Understanding how flap endonuclease and its other family members function at the molecular level is the principle aim of this work. Furthermore, the information garnered here would be invaluable for those who seek to develop new cancer therapeutics by creating inhibitors of flap endonucleases, as large amounts of flap endonucleases are present in cancer cells and its abundance in cancer cells allows cancers to progress more rapidly. Flap endonucleases are specifically involved in the removal of DNA 'whiskers' that form in two specialized processes; one in replication and one in repair. These whiskers of DNA have to be removed with extraordinary precision; otherwise, DNA replication and repair will be faulty and could result in cancer. Flap endonucleases are the molecular scissors that remove the whiskers with the necessary precision. Recently, we have obtained 'snap-shots' of the protein in various conformations or 3D structures (i.e., a picture of scissors in an open and a closed state), and this information has greatly increased our understanding of flap endonucleases and its family members. Unfortunately, snap-shots of various conformations do not tell the entire story. Just as scissors must move to be an effective tool for cutting, flap endonucleases must be able to move its parts to cut the DNA whiskers. We have proposed to use a specialized technique called nuclear magnetic resonance, which can probe the magnetic properties of atoms, to quantify the motions of the proteins. An understanding of the motions of flap endonucleases will solidify our understand of flap endonucleases and its family members and help guide pharmaceutical drug discover and design programs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K009079/1","grantId":"BB/K009079/1","fundValue":"474762","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2016-08-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Alison Grasby","coPersons":["Jonathan Peter Waltho"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
