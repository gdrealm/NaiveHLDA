{"id":"917FED2B-1323-4EC0-BD4B-370899D7C07C","title":"Qualifying mouse models of spontaneous, progressive age-related macular degeneration","abstractText":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic disease of the retina, which results in the loss of central vision and is the main cause of blindness in the Western World in people over 55 years age. More than 30 million people in the developed world suffer from AMD and with increasing life expectancy and changing environmental factors the incidence of AMD continues to increase. Though several treatments for AMD exist, they target ~ 20% of patients with the disease and are effective at restoring vision to a minority of those treated. Those with visual impairment or blindness have a significant impairment in quality of life and functional independence and are a considerable burden on healthcare resources. Recent scientific studies have led to the discovery of several genes linked to inflammation and the immune system, termed the complement pathway, that appear to play a major role in the onset and progression of AMD. However, there are many different abnormalities associated with AMD, including alterations to the neurons and support tissues of the retina, improper removal of waste products and in the most severe stage, growth of chaotic and sight-threatening blood vessels and oedema. Researchers are now focused on determining which of these abnormalities are caused by the complement pathway, and therefore could be targeted by new medicines that are now being developed by pharmaceutical companies. Animal models that mimic human AMD are urgently needed to begin testing these new potential medicines. By identifying animal models that accurately reflect the abnormalities observed in AMD, we hope to test the new therapies and identify at which stage of the disease, and for which abnormalities we should focus on in human clinical trials. We propose to work in partnership with a pharmaceutical company named Jerini Ophthalmic to evaluate two mouse models of AMD, compare them to the human condition, and use the models to test an inhibitor of the complement pathway that Jerini Ophthalmic hopes to test in human clinical trials within the next 1-2 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800946","grantId":"G0800946","fundValue":"348025","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Shima","coPersons":["Imre  Lengyel","Valerie  Lund"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
