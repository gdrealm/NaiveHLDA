This research seeks to address why this is the case. Previous research on recycling has identified 'push' factors, such as household size and composition as being important, as well as 'pull' factors, such as the existence of kerbside recycling. The analysis will show whether there is a 'local authority effect', as well as focusing on the capacity to recycle, which together with household demand for recycling might explain why the UK languishes in 11th position in terms of recycling performance across the EU15 countries. The methodology will consist of a theoretical explanation of the factors driving recycling rates and an empirical analysis using econometric techniques that can identify the key factors which are significant in influencing recycling performance across local authorities. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3738","grantId":"RES-000-22-3738","fundValue":"80364","fundStart":"2009-10-26","fundEnd":"2011-07-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings, one of which related to the inverse relationship between recycling performance and residual waste collection frequency was picked up by Dorset Waste Partnership and used to develop policy in streamlining their waste management services.

We focused on aspects of recycling and waste collection, as well as, socioeconomic factors such as household type, age etc. Furthermore we established that a social norm to recycle does exist. The norms studied related to what others of a similar age, income, education, ethnicity and living in close proximity do. We found that norms related to age, ethnicity and neighbourhood proximity did have an affect on households' recycling performance. By further extending our database we would like to investigate whether the relationship between recycling performance and residual waste collection frequency remains stable over time. We would also like to further investigate the role of social norms in promoting recycling in particular and pro-environmental behaviour generally.
