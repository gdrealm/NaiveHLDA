From complex inorganic macromolecules to the tertiary structure of polypeptides, self-assembled systems represent an extremely wide variety of systems. However, controlling self-assembly remains a formidable challenge, not least because there are usually many components present which lead to a range of different interactions and competing driving forces. To exploit self-assembled structures for the development of useful materials and tunable devices, it is a prerequisite to have deep understanding of the fundamental structural and dynamical processes underlying the self-assembly.\n\nOne particular class of material that displays a rich variety of self-assembled patterns is termed magneto-rheological (MR) fluids. MR fluids are formed by magnetic colloidal nanoparticles dispersed in a non-magnetic solvent (or non-magnetic colloidal nanoparticles in a magnetic fluid). Upon the application of an external magnetic field typically chain-like and fibrous structures appear, which sensitively affect the viscosity of the system. This effect is exploited in a wide range of applications ranging from MR seismic shock dampers to innovative prosthetic limbs. Furthermore, with their tunability of interaction, MR fluids are excellent model systems for fundamental network forming systems.\n\nHere, we propose to investigate the field-induced assembly of fibrous network materials in MR fluids using experiments, computer simulations and stochastic fibrous network theory. Because the typical colloidal length and time scales are of the order of micrometers and seconds respectively, the structure and dynamics can be analysed at the particle level using optical microscopy, which allows for detailed comparisons between experiments, simulations and theory. Furthermore, we aim to exploit the effect of the addition of impurities, confinement and flow to control the network formation, which will allow us to explore the development of tunable magnetic devices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00331X/1","grantId":"EP/J00331X/1","fundValue":"114324","fundStart":"2012-10-21","fundEnd":"2016-10-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  No applications yet outside our collaborative research grouping.

Under these conditions they form structures which depend on the strength of the magnetic filed and the concentration of the particles. We have written compute code to follow individual particles as the structures assemble and to measure how many other particles are in contact with each particle. \n\nWe have developed equations which describe the structures formed in dilute suspensions. We are writing an article about this, which is nearly finished and will soon be sent to a journal.\n\nWe are developing equations which describe the structures formed in more concentrated suspensions. We will finish this next year and write an article. \n\nWe will use the equations that we are developing to help explain what structures can be achieved under different conditions and why.
