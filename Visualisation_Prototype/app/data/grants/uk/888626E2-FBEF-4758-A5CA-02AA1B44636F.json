{"id":"888626E2-FBEF-4758-A5CA-02AA1B44636F","title":"A novel strategy for microarrays of selective binding agents","abstractText":"There is a continuing need for high-throughput assays of multiple substances at particular levels of biological organisation, the so-called omics methods. Microarrays have been widely used for transcriptomics, and occasionally for proteomics (protein microarrays). In the latter case it is necessary to select an antibody or equivalent binding agent for each target. We here propose to develop a novel strategy that can cut the development of selective binding agents by orders of magnitude, and will apply it to a variety of target determinands.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D017432/1","grantId":"BB/D017432/1","fundValue":"590475","fundStart":"2006-09-04","fundEnd":"2009-09-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip John Day","coPersons":["Jason  Micklefield","Joshua  Knowles","John Edward McCarthy","Robert Angus Dryfe","Stephen George Oliver"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
