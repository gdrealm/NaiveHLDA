This heat cannot be effectively utilised using currently available technologies due to their limitations of cost, size, portability, complexity of integration with other energy sources and the need for high operating temperature. This project aims to utilise a new approach based on the adsorption / desorption characteristics of highly porous metal organic frame work material to store this waste heat in the form of dried adsorbent material. Such dried adsorbent material can be\ntransported to any other sites where it can be easily integrated to exiting infrastructure to release the stored heat for either space heating/cooling or power generation. This novel approach of handling waste heat outperforms existing waste heat recovery technologies in terms of cost, efficiency and carbon emmissions. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a partnership between Weatherite Manufacturing Ltd and the University of Birmingham was established. The proposed project is crucial to the development of an effective energy storage system that hanress waste heat and contribute to the security of UK energy supply. The research will cover:\n\na) Assess the thermal performance of the MOF material in an adsorption cycle for heat storage application.\n\nb) Map the thermal performance of the proposed system for space heating, cooling and power generation.\n\nc) Explore various manufacturing techniques to develop a light weight, compact adsorber bed design.\n\nd) Demonstrate the integration of a dried adsorbent material bed into central heating system for domestic heating applications where the dried adsorbent material will undergo an adsorption process releasing the stored heat to be used for producing hot water for heating purpose.\n\ne) Integrating the adsorption beds with a turbine to demonstrate the power generation capability using the adsorption cycle.\n\nf) Demonstrate the integration of a dried adsorbent material bed into air conditioning system to provide cooling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505882/1","grantId":"EP/L505882/1","fundValue":"98147","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"R  Al Dadah","coPersons":["Saad Mustafa Mahmoud"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
