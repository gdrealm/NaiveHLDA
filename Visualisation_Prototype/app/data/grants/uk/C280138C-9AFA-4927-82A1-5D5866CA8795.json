These provide neurons with the ability to communicate information over long distances. Wiring patterns are essential for body functions, movement, coordination cognition, learning and memory. How neurons grow their axons over great distances to reach and connect to other axons from different neurons or to muscles is not well understood. Axon elongation is one of the essential properties in neuronal connectivity and it is believed that in the adult it provides neurons with the ability to remodel their connections. This plasticity of neuronal connections underlies experience, learning and memory. Furthermore, neurons need to maintain some capacity to elongate their axons and regenerate their axonal projections to repair possible damage during life. Little is known about factors that regulate axon elongation particularly that of motor neurons, which possess the longest axons in the body i.e. from the spinal column to the end of the fingertips and toes. Understanding how our nervous system is wired will give us insights into how it develops and functions. Once we master this we can manipulate various aspects of connectivity to correct defects and disabilities or repair damaged neurons and cure neurodegenerative disease. In this research we aim to examine the role of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein factors in motor neuron connectivity in mouse models and provide basic information that would be beneficial for Motor Neuron disease and for peripheral axon regeneration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J013331/1","grantId":"MR/J013331/1","fundValue":"726174","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Vasso  Episkopou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Motor neurons control movement via long axons that extend from the spinal cord to muscles as far as in distant limbs. Little is known about factors that regulate this extensive axonal growth in the periphery. Here we report that the ubiquitin ligase Ark2C (Arkadia2) is expressed in neurons and can serve to amplify neuronal responses to specific signals. We find that these signals belong to the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family of secreted factors, which are highly expressed in the periphery and known to regulate the development of the limbs. Loss of Ark2C gene function in mice results in inefficient growth of motor axons to distant muscles, and we show that this process is regulated by BMP signaling. Ark2C targets BMP inhibitors for destruction, and therefore the presence of Ark2C helps to enhance BMP signaling, which in turn is necessary for the innervation of distal muscles. Our experiments reveal a previously unknown function of BMP in motor axon growth and describe a molecular mechanism for how axons and limbs coordinate their growth. will form the basis of further research and knowledge Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
