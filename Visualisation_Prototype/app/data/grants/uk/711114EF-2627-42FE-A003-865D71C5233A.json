Around one hundred interviews will be conducted with prisoners at various stages of such sentences, as well a smaller number of interviews with prison staff and managers.</p>\n\n<p>The main aim is to provide a detailed account of the experiences of these prisoners, focussing on three main areas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>how they cope with (and develop during) such long sentences, and how they manage issues of self and identity</li>\n\n <li>how they adapt socially to imprisonment, in particular, their relationships with staff and other prisoners, and their levels of compliance, engagement and resistance</li>\n\n <li>how their sentence conditions and lives prior to imprisonment shape their perceptions of penal legitimacy. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The research will contribute to policy and practice in a range of areas, for example, by better informing relevant policymakers and practitioners about the consequences of new sentencing practices, about the needs of this group of very long-term prisoners, and about the operational challenges resulting from the growing number of prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007935/1","grantId":"ES/J007935/1","fundValue":"248233","fundStart":"2012-07-31","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben  Crewe","coPersons":["Susannah  Hulley"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
