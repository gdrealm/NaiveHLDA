Its key objectives are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>integrate transport researchers - often isolated in areas of applied research - in wider communities of social science/social theory.</li>\n\n <li>promote substantive and critical discussion around topics relating to transport, travel and mobility from a range of social scientific perspectives.</li>\n\n <li>develop a self-sustaining network of researchers in transport, travel and mobilities research that will provide a step-change in the research capacity of the community.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The network provides a means for research students, researchers and early career policy makers to meet, collaborate, publish and exchange ideas. Members of the network can use this website to set up profiles and find colleagues with common interests (Join at - http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/theforge/)</p>\n\n<p>The Forge also enables members to apply for moderate funding to organise and support meetings and workshops on specific topics of interest to other network members.</p>\n\n<p>The annual Summer School is a focal point for the network and its activities with 40 subsidized places available each year. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007315/1","grantId":"ES/J007315/1","fundValue":"67970","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gregory Richard Marsden","coPersons":["E  Shove"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
