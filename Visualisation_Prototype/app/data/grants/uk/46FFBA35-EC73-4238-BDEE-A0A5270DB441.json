Information Technology, Education and Welfare in Niger","abstractText":"<p>Despite massive improvements in enrollment over the past decade, over 775 million adults worldwide are unable to read and write in any language (UNESCO 2012). These indicators are particularly low in the landlocked countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In Niger, the subject of this research, fewer than 30 per cent of the population is literate, with large discrepancies between men and women.</p>\n\n<p>Building upon a successful mobile phone-based education pilot program in Niger (Aker et al 2012), this research will assess the impact of a mobile phone-based adult education program in Niger in an expanded population. Using both qualitative and quantitative techniques, including a randomized control trial, this research will address five primary research questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>it will assess the impact of standard adult education programs on adults’ learning</li>\n\n <li>it will test whether the impacts of the prior mobile phone education program are similar when the program is significantly scaled</li>\n\n <li>the research will assess the role of mobile phone technology in distance learning by providing educational content</li>\n\n <li>the program will assess the impact of the program on children’s educational attainment</li>\n\n <li>the program will assess the way in which education and technology affect intra-household and inter-village dynamics.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005433/1","grantId":"ES/L005433/1","fundValue":"377596","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jenny Carson  Aker","coPersons":["Frank-Borge  Wietzke","Christopher Johannes Ksoll"],"organisation":"Tufts University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
