{"id":"AD4D526A-5BC1-44E9-96E5-543ACEB024A7","title":"Ocean Satellite Research Impact Study","abstractText":"Remote sensing plays an increasingly important role in all aspects of marine science. Satellite sensors such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radar altimeters, radar scatterometers, optical imaging spectrometers, and passive radiometers routinely provide globally distributed data on surface winds, wave height, propagation of swell waves, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface height, sea level, currents, water clarity, sediment transport. Remote sensing also includes ground-based systems, especially radars, which can provide alternative means of monitoring aspects of the environment of relevance to the MoD. \n\nAn earlier collaboration between NOC and DSTL, along with the UK Hydrographic Office, has considered the utility of NOC's remote sensing and modelling capabilities to the MoD. This focused on remote sensing of bathymetry and the detection of objects on the seabed, although other applications were also briefly discussed. \n\nAn area of particular interest to the MoD, in the context of the proposed review, is the potential for satellite sensing to provide information about 'ocean volume', i.e. the ocean domain between the surface and sea floor. This calls for information about ocean currents, eddies and fronts, water clarity, biological productivity, salinity etc., all of which are available in near real-time from a range of Earth observation satellites operated by NASA, ESA and EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites). The development of systems that can take advantage of the various satellite technologies and use synergies between sensors to provide information on key variables of the marine environment is of high interest to the RN and MoD. Such systems would also have considerable commercial value and wider societal benefits. Marine and maritime remote sensing from satellites systems is therefore a key area where NERC research has a great potential for increased impact in relation to the RN and MoD. \n\nThe Ocean Satellite Research Impact Study (OSRIS) project proposes to review and assess NERC strategic research related to the development and application of remote sensing technologies with potential for providing marine data and information relevant to the Royal Navy (RN) and Ministry of Defense (MoD). This includes technical research to develop and test remote sensing instrumentation, satellite systems, geophysical inversion algorithms and data processing systems, as well as scientific research that exploits satellite data to monitor marine environments. The project will also considers research related to non-marine satellite remote sensing with potential for providing information of interest to the RN and MoD. \n\nThe overarching objective of the proposed project is therefore to identify NERC strategic research of current or potential benefit to the RN and MoD by carrying out a comprehensive review of past and current NERC activities involving satellite technologies, to assess their relevance to the MoD in discussion with the MoD, and to establish the potential of satellite remote sensing methods for supporting RN operations now and in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M007731/1","grantId":"NE/M007731/1","fundValue":"123847","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Valborg  Byfield","coPersons":["Paolo  Cipollini","Christine Pascale  Gommenginger","Christopher John  Banks","Roland Jeremy Rogers","Paul Simon Bell"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
