Recently, an overview has been completed on the state of the art of crop models to assess climate change risks to food. Progress on the number of simulated crops, uncertainty propagation related to model parameters and structure, adaptations and scaling are less advanced and lagging behind integrated assessment and modelling (IAM) demands. The limitations are considered substantial and apply to all crop models (to a different extent). Overcoming these limitations will require joint efforts, particularly for multi-model ensemble simulations and consideration of novel modelling approaches. The key challenges of CropM in MACSUR2 are to further advance crop modelling for improved assessment of climate change impacts on food security. Particular emphasis will be on cross-cutting activities to advance crop modelling as integrated part of IAM. Like in MACSUR1, the knowledge hub strategy includes the stimulation of excellent science, the support of capacity and network building activities, jointly work on explicit and comprehensive case studies on integrated regional and Europe-wide climate risk assessment in close interaction with stakeholders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N004825/1","grantId":"BB/N004825/1","fundValue":"43307","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mikhail  Semenov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
