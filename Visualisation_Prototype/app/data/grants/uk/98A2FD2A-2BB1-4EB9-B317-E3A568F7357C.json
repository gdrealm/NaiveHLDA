{"id":"98A2FD2A-2BB1-4EB9-B317-E3A568F7357C","title":"International comparison of living standards","abstractText":"<p>The international community, headed by the World Bank, has put a great deal of effort into comparing output and consumption across countries, through its International Comparison Program (ICP). This measures purchasing power parities (PPPs) and uses these to convert consumption per head measured in local currency into a common currency, conventionally the US dollar. <br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately these PPP-based measures suffer from a fatal flaw as measures of living standards: they assume in effect that rich people and poor people would spend the same proportion of their incomes on (say) food if they faced the same prices. But a mass of evidence rejects this, eg we know that poor people spend a higher proportion of their household budget on food than do rich people. In general, the shares of the household budget devoted to different products vary with income and not just with prices. <br />&nbsp;<br />This project will provide improved measures of average living standards for 146 countries covering 95 per cent of the world's population, using a recently discovered method. This new method takes the variation in budget shares due to income differences fully into account.&nbsp; The ingredients of the new measures will be the same as in the World Bank's, namely the underlying data gathered by the ICP, but the resulting answers for living standards will be different. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G036217/1","grantId":"ES/G036217/1","fundValue":"67301","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Oulton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
