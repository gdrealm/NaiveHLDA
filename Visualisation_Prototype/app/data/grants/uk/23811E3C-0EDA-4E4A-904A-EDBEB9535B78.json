{"id":"23811E3C-0EDA-4E4A-904A-EDBEB9535B78","title":"Promoting smoking cessation in Bangladeshi and Pakistani male adults: pilot randomised controlled trial","abstractText":"The countries of the UK have committed themselves to reducing the prevalence of smoking, as it is the single largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Many of the smokers of the UK are committed to this goal also; nearly one third try to stop each year. To assist smokers in their efforts, we have a national network of stop smoking services and make medication available on the NHS. However, most people who attempt to stop do not use the services, and people from Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups are particularly unlikely to do so. This is important because the services are effective, and without their support, very few of the more dependent smokers will succeed. Our proposal aims to develop service configurations that better meet the needs of smokers from these two ethnic groups. Thus we are proposing to offer better services to thousands of particularly disadvantage UK citizens for which their is a manifest need and Government commitment to meeting that need, yet currently manifest failure to do so.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501288","grantId":"G0501288","fundValue":"160590","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Aziz  Sheikh","coPersons":["Robin John Prescott","Phil  Shackley","Rajinder  Bhopal","Raman  Bedi","Paramjit  Gill","Amanda  Amos","Qaim  Zaidi","Martin  White","Paul  Aveyard"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
