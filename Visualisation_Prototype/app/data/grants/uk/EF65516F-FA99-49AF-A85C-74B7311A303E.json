Farm health planning, 1942-2006","abstractText":"<p>This project examines the history of farm health planning (FHP), an activity which lies at the heart of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsâ€™ (DEFRA) current strategies for animal health and welfare and veterinary surveillance, and features strongly in its considerations of future veterinary services. Formerly known as veterinary preventive medicine, FHP has been pursued in different forms and with varying degrees of success, throughout the post-WWII era.</p>\n\n<p>Combining a critical analysis of the science and practice of FHP, 1942-2010, with an investigation into its economic, social and political aspects, this research reveals how and why vets, farmers, scientists and government officials problematised and addressed impediments to production, and with what effects. It shows how disease targets were selected, the assumptions, approaches and outcomes of research relating to them, and the framing, selection and implementation of administrative and technical methods for their resolution. Historical findings are used to analyse present-day policy making, and form a basis for definite recommendations on the future framing, implementation and evaluation of FHP.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-27-0001","grantId":"RES-229-27-0001","fundValue":"220519","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Abigail Louise Woods","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
