Therefore, if we want to investigate how neurones communicate with each other, we need to record from many cells simultaneously. Thanks to new technologies, this is now possible. Impulses generated by neurones can be recorded with electrodes that detect electrical activity. Large arrays of many of these electrodes are now available, enabling us to record simultaneously from dozens of sites. Optical recordings, on the other hand, allow us to visualise changes in the concentration of various ions that are involved in the control of neural activity, while they are flowing across the membrane of the active neurones. These ionic fluxes can be linked either to neural excitation or inhibition and are therefore not necessarily reflecting impulse generation. Taken together, the combination of electrical and optical recordings over large-scale neuronal networks provides a powerful tool to help us understand the mechanisms of neuronal communication in much greater detail. In this proposal, we intend to establish a state-of-the-art system that will allow us to perform electrical recordings from a 60-electrode array at the same time as high resolution imaging of neuronal activity. The system will be used for several projects, ranging from investigating the behaviour of embryonic retinal networks to the generation and control of cortical and hippocampal oscillations associated with various cognitive states. Moreover, it will also represent an invaluable experimental tool to help in the design of a device that has the huge potential to become the platform for the development of a retinal implant that could help restore impaired visual perception following retinal dystrophic diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011415/1","grantId":"BB/F011415/1","fundValue":"85581","fundStart":"2008-02-07","fundEnd":"2009-02-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This equipment grant allowed us to purchase a system allowing us to perform multielectrode array recordings together with calcium imaging Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Societal","person":"Evelyne  Sernagor","coPersons":["Miles Adrian Whittington","Fiona  LeBeau","Mark  Cunningham"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" This equipment is continuously being used for various projects investigating the behaviour of small neural networks, allowing us to record electrical activity from a population of neurones while being able to visualise them as well. combining electrical and optical recordings is becoming more a more common in neuroscience research Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
