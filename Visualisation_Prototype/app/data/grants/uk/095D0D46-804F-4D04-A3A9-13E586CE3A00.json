There remain, however, three deficiencies in academic treatments of religious diversity which the proposed network is designed to rectify. These three deficiencies comprise a lack of attention to the experience of the BRIC nations (i.e. Brazil, Russia, India and China), a dearth of transnational theorisation and an overly static concern with the structuring-institutional-patterned profile of national contexts. Involving throughout comparison and contrast with the UK context, the network aims to rectify these deficiencies by: i) taking seriously the experience of religious diversity as it unfolds in the BRIC nations; ii) employing a transnational interpretative framework within which participants will reflect upon inter-contextual commonalities, differences and variations in respect of religious diversity at both national and international levels; and, iii) including an explicitly dynamic focus upon the processes and mechanisms through which religious diversity is engendered, sustained, restricted or diminished in the macro-structural, mid-range institutional and micro-social dimensions of modern society.\n\nCombining to stimulate new debate and advance understanding of religious diversity, the threefold contribution of the network will be articulated by the organising principle of 'globalising modernity'. In so being, the kinds and levels of religious diversity currently in evidence within the respective national contexts engaged will be explicated as typically modern phenomena engendered by the contemporary confluence of characteristically transnational dynamics and processes. Religious diversity will thereby be studied as intimately associated with the networks and flows of contemporary globalisation and exemplary of the differences, similarities and variations currently in existence across the variegated landscape of multifaceted modernity. Working against the backdrop of globalising modernity, the proposed network will explore the continuities and disjunctions of religious diversity as they pertain to comparisons and contrasts made between UK and non-western (i.e. BRIC) contexts. At the same time, the structures, institutions and patterns of particular national contexts will be engaged in respect of the manner and extent to which they manifest and mediate characteristically modern processes and dynamics such as, for example, rapid and wide-spread societal transformation, detraditionalisation, individualisation, globalisation and marketisation.\n\nTo best achieve its objectives, the proposed network draws upon: i) an international, multi-institutional and multidisciplinary team of five scholars whose academic engagement with religion involves a range of thematic concerns; and, ii) relevant stakeholders involved in formulating, enacting or working within policies, laws and programmes pertaining to religious diversity. Through face-to-face events and virtually mediated interactions, the network will allow its academic and stakeholder participants to engage in discussions which cross boundaries and stimulate new thinking, to exchange novel ideas and new research papers, and to reflect individually and collectively upon existing enactments of religious diversity. In addition to rectifying the three deficiencies in knowledge and understanding identified above, the network aims both to inform non-academic organisations and communities with immediate interests in religious diversity and to provide a springboard for strong and lasting international collaborations, particularly between the two UK institutions (Lancaster University and King's College London) involved and those of the other three key participants in Brazil, India and Taiwan.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L012960/1","grantId":"AH/L012960/1","fundValue":"28294","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-07-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Dawson","coPersons":["Ruby  Sain"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
