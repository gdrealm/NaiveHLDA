{"id":"FA95EB36-F932-4E4B-8AD2-4B8960282DEC","title":"Ultra-sensitive molecular detection","abstractText":"The technical ability to detect low concentrations of dangerous gases in the atmosphere is central to successful environmental monitoring. For example, warehouses containing chemical storage tanks with the potential for leakage, or sites where there have been toxic chemical spills, require continuous measurement of volatile compounds. Ultra sensitive monitoring is also important for battlefield detection of chemical warfare agents and at security posts in airports and tunnels. For these applications gas sensors based on optical absorption or chromatography and spectrometry are able to satisfy the molecular sensitivity and specificity requirements. However, the drawback with these detectors is that they are large, expensive, and delicate. Alternatively, electrochemical gas sensors are robust and relatively cheap, but they lack the necessary sensitivity and selectivity below the part per million threshold. The research carried out within this project will lead to the development of a gas sensor that has high sensitivity and selectivity combined with the technological simplicity of an electrochemical gas sensor. This is achieved through the use of a network of conducting molecules. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of a new family of light and rugged ultra-sensitive molecular detectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I015973/1","grantId":"EP/I015973/1","fundValue":"217446","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The exploratory work on the new sensor design that was supported through the EPSRC award led to some initial results that appear to support the proof of concept.
