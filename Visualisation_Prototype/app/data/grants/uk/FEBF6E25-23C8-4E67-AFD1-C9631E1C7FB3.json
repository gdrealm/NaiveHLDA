{"id":"FEBF6E25-23C8-4E67-AFD1-C9631E1C7FB3","title":"Restoration of pathways implicated in T cell exhaustion following HCV infection.","abstractText":"Of the estimated 200 million individuals worldwide infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), approximately 170 million people are chronic carriers, including 250,000 of the UK population. HCV infection can lead to chronic liver damage, cirrhosis and liver cancer: there is currently no broadly effective treatment and no vaccine. It is accepted that an effective immune response by the infected individual is required if the virus is to be cleared naturally. A major component of this response is generated through T cells. A greater understanding of this immune response, and the reasons for its failure, is central to developing effective antivirals for HCV. Development of in vitro replication systems to investigate aspects of viral lifecycle and interference thereof, has aided the field greatly, however, the availability of a suitable small animal model has hindered the discovery and development of antivirals for HCV. Since HCV only reliably infected man and chimpanzees, a surrogate model, the GB virus, B (GBV-B) infection of tamarins, is often used. GBV-B is highly similar to HCV: it is hepatotropic and its genome organisation and disease pathogenesis closely parallel that of HCV. \n\nSpecific pathways associated with a failed T cell immune response have been recognised in HCV infection in man. This failure is brought about by up-regulation of specific proteins on the surface of T cells, leading to an ?exhausted? phenotype. Recent studies have indicated that blocking the up-regulated proteins with specific antibodies may partially restore the normal function of the T cells. This highlights the potential for therapeutic intervention.\n\nThis programme of work is to confirm the identity of the T cell exhaustion pathways in GBV-B infection in the tamarin model. Using T cells isolated from the tamarins we will endeavour to reconstitute the function of the ?exhausted? T cells using cocktails of specific antibodies in vitro. Success with this study will enable us to consider a further application for funding to demonstrate the restoration of the normal T cell function in the animal model. This will establish the GBV-B/tamarin model as a suitable preclinical platform from which we can evaluate the effectiveness of these immune modulatory antibodies as antivirals for HCV.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900861","grantId":"G0900861","fundValue":"116765","fundStart":"2009-09-21","fundEnd":"2010-09-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Berry","coPersons":["Helen  Bright","Nicola Jayne Rose"],"organisation":"Nat Inst for Bio Standards and Control","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
