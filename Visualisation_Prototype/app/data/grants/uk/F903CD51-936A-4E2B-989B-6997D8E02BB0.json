The first is to know what is in each data set and what it is intended for. This is annotation or meta data - data about data. The second is to specify precisely what is meant both by the data itself and the meta data - which is the business of ontologies . \n\nWe are working together towards a database, common metadata and a simple ontology for psychosis. We will then test this system as a method of combining data from existing studies to answer clinically relevant questions. \n\nWe are also studying structural and functional brain imaging reproducibility within and between five research centres. \n\nThese developments will put us and other mental health researchers in a better position to conduct large multi-centre studies of earlier detection methods, more effective treatments and possibly even preventative interventions in people at high risk of or in the early stages of psychosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601652","grantId":"G0601652","fundValue":"335062","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Lawrie","coPersons":["Carole  Goble","Malcolm Phillip Atkinson","Rob  Procter","Bill  Deakin","John  Suckling","Alan  Rector"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
