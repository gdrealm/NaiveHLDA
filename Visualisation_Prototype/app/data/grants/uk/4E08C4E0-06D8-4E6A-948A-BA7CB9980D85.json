The seminar series brings together museum education practitioners, pre-eminent academics and funding bodies to unpick the complexities of learning in natural history environments and to develop a research agenda that will address critical questions around learning in natural history museums* within the UK.\n\nThe purpose of the seminars is to develop and disseminate a collaborative learning research agenda to inform how natural history museums can best use their resources to support learning in the 21st century. Learning in such places has been under-researched and under-theorised, hampering the field's ability to address policy and broader concerns around impact. When addressed, the research agenda will help transform what natural history museums do for and with their audiences. We will articulate and prioritise topics and issues that natural history museums most need to address in order to serve diverse audiences. These topics are likely to include:\n\nThe current landscape of informal science learning;\nModels for facilitation/interaction between the public and museum educators, scientists and curators;\nLearning from objects and the role of authenticity in learning programmes;\nAudience research to more fully understand audiences and their needs; and,\nNew technologies for discovery, learning and social engagement.\n\nMuseums and academics in the US have begun to address questions surrounding these topics but they remain under-researched in the UK. This seminar series is a timely response to urgent issues surrounding learning from natural history objects in the UK context. We will hold six seminars at the NHM during the course of the grant. Numbers will be limited to 30-35 participants in order to facilitate high quality, in-depth participation. Attendees will include arts, humanities and learning researchers as well as museum and educational professionals. An advisory group will also meet following each seminar to support translation of the discussions into the emergent research agenda, as well as to help develop subsequent seminars. \nDeveloping this research agenda is of strategic benefit both to academics and to museum practitioners, as it explores and extends relevant theoretical perspectives that have the potential to transform our understanding of learning within the museum sector. The series brings together individuals from a wider range of both academic and informal settings than have previous meetings, thus providing fruitful ground for the exploration of theoretical perspectives to underpin the developing research agenda. Perspectives from fields such as sociology and anthropology will inform the development of the research agenda itself and will highlight new methodologies well suited to exploring potential research questions.\n\nThe series and subsequent research will benefit museum practitioners and academics with interests in learning in informal settings and museology, as well as in related fields, such as sociology and anthropology. With its multiple theoretical and methodological perspectives, the research ultimately emerging from these seminars will help the field respond to questions about learning in museums with natural history collections and in other museums as well.\n\n*The term 'museum' is used to refer to settings with natural history collections (primarily, but not exclusively natural history museums), but can incorporate zoos, as institutions that hold specimens for natural history education.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00125X/2","grantId":"ES/L00125X/2","fundValue":"20677","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin  Dillon","coPersons":["Jennifer Eileen DeWitt"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
