It will build on a recent study of 1013 women in Burkina Faso which investigated the health, economic and social consequences of obstetric complications and normal births in health facilities up to one year after birth. The study will re-contact the participants at 3 and 4 years after birth, and include an additional group of women from the community who delivered around the same time. Information will be collected on what has happened since the index birth to household income, belongings, debts and consumption, to womenâ€™s mental and physical health and social situation, to their ability to earn money, work in production and in the home, the survival and development of the children, and to decisions about future pregnancies.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-183-25-0011","grantId":"RES-183-25-0011","fundValue":"412839","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This study is part of a body of work on the consequences of severe obstetric complications in Burkina Faso and Benin. This body of work has been used: (i) as part of broader discussions on the negative effects of user fees in maternal and child health (from 2007); (ii) in WHO technical discussions on the need to broaden the definition of maternal morbidity to the negative impact of diseases on functioning and wellbeing (from 2012); (iii) to generate hypotheses/research questions for three follow-on funded studies (from 2010) (evaluation of removal of user fees (EU); reproductive health costs in West Africa (Research Council of Norway/Hewlett Foundation); women's work, family planning and pregnancy (PopDev: ESRC/Hewlett Foundation) Healthcare ","person":"Veronique  Filippi","coPersons":["Nicolas  Meda","Rasmane  Ganaba","Steve  Russell","Katerini Tagmatarchi Storeng","Susan Fairley  Murray","Thomas Francis Marshall"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":" Empirical understanding (introduction):\nWe contributed to the empirical understanding of the relationships between reproductive health and poverty, with a unique study on the social, health and economic consequences of obstetric complications. The study is unusual because it collected longitudinal data, promoted inter-disciplinary at all stages, and used a range of approaches to assess multi-dimensional outcomes of resilience and vulnerability. It investigated a new hypothesis in maternal health that obstetric complications have far-reaching sequelae and demonstrated the importance of considering women's health and lives as a trajectory allowing for the interplay between reproductive and productive roles. \n\nResults in brief:\nOur quantitative analyses suggest that, even after controlling for confounders at baseline, severe obstetric complications and their associated direct and indirect costs can have a long lasting effect on the socio-economic status of women, children's development and female and child mortality. \nA more nuanced picture emerges from the analysis of women's narratives which explain how some women are able to exploit their bodily and social capital as well to overcome adversity presented by a sudden and acute loss of health. In this respect, the study challenges the narrow linear approaches which have been used to understand the social and economic consequences of reproductive ill-health.\n\nMethods and theory:\nThe study contributes to an emerging body of work using analysis of longitudinal qualitative data to inform understanding of social policy. We employed a modified version of Salda?a's matrix for the analysis of continuity and change to interpret women's trajectories of adaptation after a severe health crisis. Our study has enabled us to make empirically informed contributions to discussions of resilience as a process and to the 'network' view of social capital. We contributed to discussions on how mixed methods help disentangle the complex relationships between reproductive health and poverty.\n\nCapacity building:\n\nThe project increased AfricSant?'s research capacity in Burkina Faso. Patrick Ilboudo is doing a PhD in Oslo on health economics, in part using the project data. K.T Storeng went to Norway for post-doctoral training. We are.were involved in newly-funded projects with empirical or methodological connections with this study (Econpop, ES/I032967/1; PopDev and Femhealth). An alarming finding relates to the increased long term mortality in women and children in the group who have suffered a near-miss complication. Some of this was related to chronic diseases, but also to the social conditions in which women live.\n\nAvoiding these untimely deaths requires that governments apply a comprehensive continuum of care (from pre-conception to the extended postpartum period) that addresses the indirect and social causes of women's and children deaths.\n\nIn terms of research, three follow-on funded projects were initiated, at least partly, on the basis of this project. \n\nIn addition, the collection and/or analysis of other longitudinal datasets is required to verify our findings and document the changes experienced by women over time in their reproductive health, work and economic situations in different contexts.
