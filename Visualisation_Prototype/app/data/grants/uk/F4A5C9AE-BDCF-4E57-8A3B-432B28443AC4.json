{"id":"F4A5C9AE-BDCF-4E57-8A3B-432B28443AC4","title":"Urban Low Carbon Transitions: A Comparative International Network - Australia, China, India, South Africa, US and UK","abstractText":"<p>International research suggests that in response to climate change global cities are now engaging in strategic efforts to effect a low carbon transition. That is, to enhance resilience and secure resources in the face of the impacts of climate change, resource constraints and in relation to new government and market pressures for carbon control. But significant questions remain unexplored.<br /><br />First, limited research has been undertaken internationally to comparatively examine how different cities in the north and south are responding to the challenges of climate change. Second, it is not clear whether the strategic intent of low carbon transitions can be realised in different urban contexts. <br /><br />The international network involving leading scholars on urban climate change responses will address these deficits. The network will focus on the research and policy issues involved in comparing and researching the broader dynamics and implications of low carbon urbanism. This network includes Australia, China, India, South Africa and the US and builds on existing scholars and research teams with whom we currently have bilateral and ad hoc collaborations. The collaboration is designed to create greater density of network connections and enhancing the depth of each connection over a four-year period.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019607/1","grantId":"ES/J019607/1","fundValue":"25356","fundStart":"2012-09-29","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Marvin","coPersons":["Patricia  Romero-Lankao","Harriet Ann Bulkeley"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
