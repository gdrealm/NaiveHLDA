{"id":"C1D5CAC9-6112-4A35-BE3B-381D0624011E","title":"The Early Collaborative Projects of Wim Wenders and Peter Handke","abstractText":"To a film going public, the Austrian writer Peter Handke is perhaps best known for his contribution to German filmmaker Wim Wenders's 1987 film 'Wings of Desire'. However, their first joint project dates back to 1968, making the beginning of an intense period of collaboration which lasted until the mid-1970's. This project focuses on the works this early collaboration produced, identifying the nature of the reciprocal influence that informs them, establishing the parameters of the film and literary aesthetic developed within them, and exploring the continued influence of this period of the later work of both writher and filmmaker.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112726/1","grantId":"112726/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne  Leal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
