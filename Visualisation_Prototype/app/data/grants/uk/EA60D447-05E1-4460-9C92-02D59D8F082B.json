Currently, the main therapeutic strategy is drug administration, or chemotherapy. The drug chloroquine is one of the most widely used anti-malarial agents. Chloroquine enters the malarial parasite whilst it resides in red blood cells (erythrocytes). During this period the parasite grows by virtue of digesting the protein rich erythrocyte environment. This digestion occurs within a specific compartment of the parasite, known as the food vacuole. Chloroquine also enters the food vacuole and inhibits a specific pathway involved in digestion of erythrocyte proteins. In turn, this causes a build up of toxic by-products and ultimately leads to death of the parasite. Unfortunately, in many regions worldwide, the malaria parasites have built up a resistance to chloroquine, and many other anti-malarial drugs. There are numerous pathways contributing to resistance in malaria, but the main one associated with chloroquine resistance is caused by mutations in the PfCRT gene. The PfCRT gene produces a protein that resides on the surface of the food vacuole and is thought to confer resistance by altering the amount of chloroquine accumulating in this compartment. It is unclear what this protein does normally in the parasite and what consequences the mutations have on its activity.\nOur primary aim is to determine how the PfCRT protein contributes to resistance against chloroquine and whether its actions can be overcome.\nTo enable us to reach this objective, we have developed a novel experimental system to directly examine PfCRT activity in isolation. The system will enable us to examine the following key issues:\n(i) Providing information on which anti-malarial drugs (other than chloroquine) are targeted by PfCRT and therefore succumb to resistance.\n(ii) Catalogue compounds capable of inhibiting PfCRT, which could potentially restore chloroquine accumulation and overcome resistance. Positive compounds could be used in future chemical programs to develop more potent agents.\n(iii) Determine whether PfCRT pumps drugs in an energy dependent manner or by simply acting as a pore through which chloroquine can exit the food vacuole.\nProviding a greater understanding of how PfCRT causes resistance to chloroquine in malaria will significantly enhance future strategies to overcome its unwanted activity and thereby circumvent the resistance to chemotherapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801896","grantId":"G0801896","fundValue":"418406","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  CallaghanMarcus Christopher Allen","coPersons":["Ian Derek  Kerr"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
