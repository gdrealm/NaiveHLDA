{"id":"4F12E41B-AF50-4861-AC34-D7C30B61CC4F","title":"ADMIN: Administrative Data - Methods, Inference and Network","abstractText":"The main aim of the ESRC’s National Centre for Research Methods ADMIN (Administrative Data: Methods, Inference and Network) Node is to exploit newly linked administrative and survey data to develop and disseminate methodology for making the best use of (i) administrative data and (ii) survey data. The key methodological developments will concern how best to deal with: missing covariates or responses in administrative data; measurement error in survey and administrative data; and attrition, non-response and recall bias in survey data. The ADMIN Node will apply this methodology to deliver high-quality evidence on some key policy questions in the field of education. The ADMIN Node therefore seeks to add significantly to both the methodological and policy research agenda. Another central aim of the ADMIN Node is to build capacity for methodologically strong research that makes best use of linked administrative and survey data to inform public policy in the UK. This will be achieved via an extensive professional development training programme as well as through a working paper series, seminars, conferences, web-based resources, and visiting fellowships. ADMIN is directed by Professor Lorraine Dearden. The training and capacity building part of ADMIN is directed by Professor John ‘Mac’ McDonald.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-576-25-0014","grantId":"RES-576-25-0014","fundValue":"1353860","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorraine Margaret Dearden","coPersons":["John  Micklewright","Sophia  Rabe-Hesketh","Kirstine  Hansen","James John Brown","Anna  Vignoles","John William McDonald"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
