The input variables we consider are frequency of use, variability of form and presentational context (words in isolation, running speech).</p>\n\n<p>In Experiment 1 we:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>establish frequency of use of a child’s name, and variability in the forms used, in one-hour’s speech to 6-month-old infants </li>\n\n <li>then test infant response to target words repeatedly placed after their names in a passage of running speech. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Experiment 2 we:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>ask parents to read a specially prepared picture book to their 11-month-old child, with target words presented either in isolation or at the ends of sentences</li>\n\n <li>test infant response to these trained words and phonologically matched untrained words, as presented either in a word list or within passages of running speech. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The study will provide insight into the significance of quantity and variability of speech input to infants and of the context in which it is presented and can lead to more efficient and more solidly research-based intervention programs with parents of young infants.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J004952/1","grantId":"ES/J004952/1","fundValue":"77885","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marilyn  Vihman","coPersons":["Tamar  Keren-Portnoy"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
