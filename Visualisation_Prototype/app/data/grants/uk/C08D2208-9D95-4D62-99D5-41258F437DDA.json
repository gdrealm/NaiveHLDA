It will generate teaching-ready datasets based on &quot;Understanding Society&quot; (the ESRC investment in household panel data). It will also create associated workbooks and digital resources that will be available for other students to use. It will increase the amount of work using secondary data at the undergraduate level and underline the relevance of research methods to the study of social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>A programme of new courses is planned, taking undergraduate students from their first year through to their final year. This new approach will provide a solid foundation for employability and future careers using quantitative skills (whether in the public sector, in academia, or elsewhere).<br /><br />This work is based on a collaboration between the Department of Political Science and International Studies (including sociology) and the School of Social Policy. It is expected to run from March 2012 until February 2014.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011819/1","grantId":"ES/J011819/1","fundValue":"80217","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  McKay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
