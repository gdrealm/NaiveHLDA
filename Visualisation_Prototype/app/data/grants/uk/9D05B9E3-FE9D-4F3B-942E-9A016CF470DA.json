The odorants are added so that leaks of gas can be detected by the smell, however, they pose problems for any use the natural gas which is not tolerant of sulphur. in particular fuel cells use catalysts which are deactivated by sulphur. It is therefore necessary to remove the odorants before the natural gas can be used in these systems. An oxygen carrier uses oxygen held within the solid material to burn a substance, and can then be regenerated itself with air. We will\nlook at the selectivity and efficiency of various oxygen carrier materials towards the combustion of sulphur containing compounds. This process, if found to be suitable can then be used in a system which first combusts the sulphur compounds to sulphur dioxide so that it can be removed by standard methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509887/1","grantId":"EP/N509887/1","fundValue":"56113","fundStart":"2015-11-09","fundEnd":"2016-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart Ashley Scott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
