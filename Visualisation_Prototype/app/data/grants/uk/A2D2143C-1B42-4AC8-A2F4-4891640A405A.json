A newer representation, subdivision surfaces, promises to provide significant advantages: in particular, they do not insist on total regularity of grid, thus allowing a shape to be defined more naturally by grids which locally follow the features of the shape. A simple example is the bottom of the windscreen pillar of a car, where the flow of the shape down the pillar needs to be blended with the fore-and-aft flow of the shape of the side of the car. A NURBS-based modelling system requires that the geometry be specified as a set of separate NURBS pieces. These must be laboriously joined together to ensure appropriate mathematical properties (e.g. continuity of curvature) across the joins and such properties can, in general, only be achieved approximately. A subdivision-based system, by contrast, handles such situations as part of the basic mechanism. The problem that prevents their wide use in the computer-aided design industry is that they are not a true superset of NURBS, being based on uniform grid theory. We intend to address the generalisation of subdivision to the non-uniform case, thus opening the way for the acceptance of this generalisation as the next standard. There are three strands to the proposed research: (a) extending subdivision to the non-uniform, rational case, which will make subdivision a true superset of NURBS for low orders (in particular the widely used cubics) for closed surfaces and the interiors of open surfaces; (b) extending subdivision to handle edge conditions at the edges of mesh pieces in analagous ways to NURBS so that open surfaces can be handled in their entiriety; (c) extending subdivision to handle the higher orders which are used in some computer-aided design systems, in particular to quintics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025889/1","grantId":"EP/E025889/1","fundValue":"356618","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are not aware of our findings being used outside academia yet, but we maintain active communication and collaboration with other research groups in the area, including links with industrial partners.

NURBS are used in aerospace, shipbuilding, automotive design and increasingly in consumer items. NURBS specify a shape in terms of a regular grid of control points. A newer representation, subdivision surfaces provides some significant advantages: in particular, they do not insist on total regularity of grid, thus allowing a shape to be defined more naturally by grids which locally follow the features of the shape. Subdivision has thus been adopted widely in the computer animation industry. The problem that prevents subdivision from penetrating further, into other fields that use NURBS, is that subdivision is not a true superset of NURBS, being based on uniform grid theory. This means that subdivision cannot do everything that NURBS can and also that existing NURBS models are not compatible with subdivision-based modelling.\n\n\n\nOur project solved a major part of this problem. We were able to generalise subdivision to handle the non-uniform case, which means that any odd-degree NURBS surface can be represented as a subdivision surface. The main contribution of this project is summarised in the introduction to our 2009 SIGGRAPH paper:\n\n\n\n&amp;quot;Designers of freeform surfaces used to have to operate within the constraints imposed by NURBS. NURBS have a rigid rectangular control grid, so surfaces usually had to be represented as a collection of trimmed patches and continuity across the patch seams had to be manually enforced. Subdivision surfaces removed these constraints by allowing designers to introduce extraordinary points into an otherwise regular control mesh. The resulting flexibility led to widespread adoption for applications such as character animation, but NURBS are still an important industry standard in fields like Computer-Aided Design. In addition to bicubic patches, CAD models sometimes use the additional continuity available from biquintic, occasionally biseptic, and very rarely higher degree B-splines. High-class surfaces also use non-uniform parametrizations for handling boundaries, selectively reducing continuity, and integrating surface features at varying scales. No subdivision scheme, however, has been able to provide the full complement of NURBS features along side the flexibility of extraordinary points. We produced a new subdivision framework that is a true superset of NURBS at odd degrees. We provided rules that give a continuous tangent plane and bounded curvature at the extraordinary points. Any existing NURBS patch can be represented exactly, and the regular regions of the resulting surfaces are also exact NURBS, so surfaces can be exported as a collection of NURBS to within any given deviation tolerance.&amp;quot;\n\n\n\nIn addition to this, we also undertook a thorough investigation of the types of artifact that appear in both NURBS and subdivision surfaces. This allowed us to identify which artifacts are common to both representations and propose heuristics to allow designers to avoid the worst effects of such artifacts. CAD. CAD software developers can use our new methods to provide improved facilities to users of their software. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
