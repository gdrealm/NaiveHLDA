{"id":"79210404-4544-444F-A89D-D969EE5A2FB4","title":"Data-Driven Methods for a New National Household Energy Survey","abstractText":"We propose a programme of research leading to the establishment of a\nnew methodology for surveying household energy use nationally, to\ncomplement existing methods (e.g., the English Housing Survey\nand regional equivalents), which leverages the rollout of Smart Meters\nto achieve cost-effective, detailed understanding of energy use\nbehaviours. The key enablers of this new methodology are: 1) the\nSmart Meters themselves, 2) advances in semi-supervised disaggregation\nmethods which can infer the behaviours that result in energy use, and\n3) other wireless sensors placed in some households to bootstrap the\ndisaggregation methods. The output will be twofold: a validated\nscalable novel survey method suitable for national rollout, providing\nsignificant additional data on energy consumption in UK homes; and 2)\nan assessment of which variables can be effectively surveyed with this\nmethod.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M008223/1","grantId":"EP/M008223/1","fundValue":"596155","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2017-12-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Goddard","coPersons":["David  Shipworth","Charles  Sutton","DK  Arvind"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
