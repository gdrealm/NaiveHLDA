The proposed studies of contemporary urban and rural South African adolescent and young adults (generation 1) and their offspring (generation 2) will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes relating to risk factors for T2D and metabolic disease that are transmistted across generations. Primary research question relates to the effects of adolescent weight gain, pregnancy risk for T2D, and subsequent offspring disease risk.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001333","grantId":"G1001333","fundValue":"1879870","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Brian Dunger","coPersons":["Shane Anthony Norris"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
