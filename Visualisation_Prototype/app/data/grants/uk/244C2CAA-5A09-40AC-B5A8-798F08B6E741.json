{"id":"244C2CAA-5A09-40AC-B5A8-798F08B6E741","title":"RA to work on MINOS","abstractText":"Neutrinos come in three distinct flavours. MINOS is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment which can measure the transformation (neutrino oscillations) of muon neutrinos into electron and tau neutrinos as the neutrinos propagate 735 km from the Fermilab beam to the MINOS far detector deep underground in the Soudan mine. The experiment makes precision measurements of the neutrino properties that govern these transitions. This grant will allow STFC to continue to exploit the world-leading NuMI/MINOS facility thus capitalising the substantial investment made by STFC (and previously PPARC).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002804/1","grantId":"ST/I002804/1","fundValue":"114442","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Anne Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
