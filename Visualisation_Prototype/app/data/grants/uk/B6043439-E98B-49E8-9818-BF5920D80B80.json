The hope is that damaged tissue can be repaired by stimulating stem cells to divide, and that cancer treatments can be improved by killing stem cells in tumours. Our study will focus on stem cells of the epidermis, the outer covering of the skin. We will identify the signals that tell stem cells to make more stem cells or to mature into protective cells. We will also analyse the signals by which epidermal stem cells communicate with neighbouring cells in the skin. Some of the signals we are studying are altered in mouth cancer, a devastating disease that kills half of patients who develop it. We will investigate whether it is possible to identify the genetic changes that have occurred in the cancer cells and predict the course of the disease on the basis of those altered signals. By blocking the signals that encourage uncontrolled tumour growth we hope to develop better treatments for this type of cancer and others.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100073","grantId":"G1100073","fundValue":"2397540","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona M Watt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
