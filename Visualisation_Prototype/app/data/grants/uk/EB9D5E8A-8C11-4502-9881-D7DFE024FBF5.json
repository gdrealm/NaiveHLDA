Analyses have demonstrated that the two progenitor viruses were circulating undetected, probably in pigs, for around 9 years. The ability of influenza viruses to both combine with each other to produce new viruses and also to mutate rapidly are important features in their ability to transmit in novel mammalian species, including humans. Pigs are susceptible to a larger range of influenza viruses than most other animals and this makes them of importance as animals in which such viral mixing can happen. Swine flu infection is common in pigs in Europe and circulates through many farms on at least an annual basis. Experimental studies at VLA have demonstrated that pigs can be infected with the pandemic human virus and, importantly, can spread the virus to other pigs that they are co-housed with. Outbreaks of swine flu in pigs, caused by the human pandemic virus, have occurred in at least three countries, probably following infection of pig farmers who have transmitted the virus to pigs. In Great Britain, some pigs are farmed in large, very dense populations and, should these farms become infected with the pandemic flu virus, large amounts of virus would be produced with unpredictable consequences for the farmers caring for the pigs. The origin of the human pandemic virus from swine flu viruses, the susceptibility of pigs to the pandemic virus and the infection of pig farms around the world, against the background of their potential 'mixing vessel' role, raises several immediate and important questions and challenges for both human and swine health. This grant, along with the parallel population grant application, aims to answer some of them and, in doing so, to provide an immediate scientific evidence base to inform policies aimed at minimising the impact of the pandemic in both humans and animals. We will define the consequences of spread of the pandemic virus to pigs, considering the individual clinical presentation, including the host or 'patient' mechanisms that result in disease signs, and the transmission of the virus. These studies will take into account that some pigs may be naturally partially immune through prior 'normal' swine flu infection. We will use this work to estimate the likely challenge posed to public health by pig infection with the pandemic virus. Our detailed investigations will include genetic studies of swine influenza, immunological and virological studies of infection of pigs with the 'normal' swine and pandemic strains of the virus. We will study the level of transmission of the virus from pig to pig and investigate the clinical impact of the disease. This project will substantially add to the amount of data available on swine influenza so that we can properly estimate how much future risk is posed by this infection. Through comparing data from the pig studies and that derived from human cases occurring as the pandemic virus spreads we will be able to evaluate the pig as an animal model for suitability to studying pandemic influenza consequences for humans. The data generated from this grant will be used to study the rates of viral mutation and identify the specific mutations in influenza viruses that are associated with spread between pigs and people working with pigs. This will enable us to better predict the immediate threats from the pandemic virus mutating to become more virulent in people and pigs, particularly if the human pandemic virus becomes endemic in the pig population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014292/1","grantId":"BB/H014292/1","fundValue":"671921","fundStart":"2009-10-23","fundEnd":"2011-01-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Brown","coPersons":["Christopher  Stokes","James  Wood","Richard  Irvine","Kin-Chow  Chang","Alan  Archibald","Bryan  Charleston","Michael  Bailey","Wendy  Barclay","Tom Charles Freeman"],"organisation":"Animal Health & Veterinary Lab Agency","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
