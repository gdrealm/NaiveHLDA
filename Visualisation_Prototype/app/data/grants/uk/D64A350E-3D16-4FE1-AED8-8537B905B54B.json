{"id":"D64A350E-3D16-4FE1-AED8-8537B905B54B","title":"Crime and Punishment in Late Imperial Russia","abstractText":"This study of Russian legal consciousness combines an account of the practice of criminal justice in the Reform Era (1861-1917) with an in-depth analysis of theories of crime and punishment formulated in anticipation of a more humane penal system. A central role is played by the moral philosopher, Valdimir Solov'ev (1853-1900), one of the most original and influential thinkers of his day. Through the prism of his contribution to the debate on criminal justice, and analysis of the mixed responses to his ideas, the project will provide deeper understanding of Russian politics and society during the long, troubled prelude to revolution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112784/1","grantId":"112784/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Nethercott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
