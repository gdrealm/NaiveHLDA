{"id":"63D1C157-6BE9-4745-AC84-2BD6078C0301","title":"How do palaeontological data refine our understanding of adaptive radiation and the evolution of modern biodiversity?","abstractText":"Swordfishes (needle-nosed predators of the high seas), flounders (gastronomically familiar and bizarrely asymmetrical bottom dwellers), remoras (literal hangers-on that hitch rides on sharks using a suction cup on their heads): few fishes, or indeed vertebrates, show more strikingly different anatomies or modes of life. Divergent as they are, genetic studies indicate that these fishes, as well as several others, are closely related, forming a bough in the tree of life called Carangimorpha. Cases like this, where organisms with shared ancestry branch out over time to assume divergent bodyplans and lifestyles, are known as adaptive radiations. Previous research on this topic has focused on living groups with poor fossil records, like anole lizards, cichlid fishes, and Darwin's famous finches. However, fossils are the only direct means of timing evolutionary events, and yield unique evidence of anatomies pruned from the tree of life by extinction; as such, they are critical in understanding how modern biodiversity came to be. We will study this exceptional group of fishes as a laboratory to not only understand how their specialisations arose, but also explore the ways in which fossils can be especially useful for answering questions of biodiversity and evolution. Specifically, we will ask: (1) what are the steps leading to peculiar carangimorph body 'designs'; (2) when in geological time did these changes occur?; and (3) what do fossils tell us about the speed and manner in which these changes took place?\n\nFossils are critical in solving these problems. For instance, recent discoveries revealed how flatfishes evolved to have both eyes on one side of their head. Such transitional forms are typically rare, but the diversity of living carangimorphs is complemented by a trove of complete fossils. Modern preparation (chemical treatment or methods akin to sandblasting) and imaging (CT scan) techniques can extract fossils from surrounding rock. We will uncover details of exceptional fossils that show the early stages in the evolution of remarkable adaptations of living carangimorphs, including the rapier-like snout of billfishes and the suction disc of remoras.\n\nFossils cannot speak for themselves and we cannot simply trace evolution by peeling back rock layers. We must discover the relationships of fossils to living species. We will combine palaeontological data with anatomy and DNA data from modern fishes to place fossils in a tree alongside living relatives, allowing us to reconstruct the transformations leading to specialized modern bodyplans. Including both extinct and living species is also important because fossils influence estimated relationships among living species and vice versa.\n\nTo build a timeline for carangimorph evolution, we need to find out when in Earth's history each branch in its family tree split off. Fossilization is a rare event, and so even the oldest fossil of a particular branch might be a relatively late arrival. We therefore need to combine our fossil data with an indirect approach known as the molecular clock. If we know the rate at which genetic mutations build up, we can estimate how long ago living species split from each other and produce a 'time tree': a family tree with an absolute time scale. \n\nWith these components in place, we can test how fossils impact our understanding of adaptive radiation and the evolution of biodiversity, using carangimorphs as a test case. Our time tree allows us to apply statistical tools for finding the rate at which anatomical features changed over time. This can be used to see whether change was rapid early in evolutionary history or whether it was slow and gradual, and whether rates varied between marine and freshwater environments. We will conduct our analyses with and without fossils, allowing us to decide whether those based only on modern data might be misleading, and if other biologists should therefore strive to include extinct species in their studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J022632/1","grantId":"NE/J022632/1","fundValue":"280699","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our description of early fossil sharksuckers was used in several popular reports in the media (e.g., http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/17/what-good-is-half-a-sucker/).

Flatfishes have both their eyes on one side of the head, a remarkable adaptation for their life on the seafloor. However, many genetic studies have suggested that this unusual arrangement evolved multiple times. Using large datasets including over 1000 genes, we demonstrate that flatfish asymmetry evolved only once.
