Fundamental Science master classes for school teachers at KS2 and KS3","abstractText":"Think Universe masterclasses aim at training KS2 and KS3 teachers in a novel and simplified approach to fundamental views about the Universe (described in the case for support attached).\n\nThe Think Universe educational project has proven its value in a couple of pilot schemes at primary schools in North London, under Royal Society Partnership awards.\n\nNow it is time to escalate the project to a higher and wider level, where its impact will start to be significant. Is it time to train the teachers who will deliver it in the classrooms of partner schools and this is the main aim of this application.\n\nAlong the 15 months requested, there would be around 20 masterclass series to a total audience of around 300 teachers, and around 400 pupils will benefit in some way from part of this training as the masterclasses come to their classrooms.\n\nThe training includes the proper operation of delicate scientific equipment like microscopes, telescopes and hand-held spectroscopes, that are used in the classroom by the pupils (see case for support).\n\nThe equipment required for these demonstrations will be supplied by the applicant.\n\nIn the same way, the applicant will supply camera for stills and video recording of the events and interviews for evaluation. There is only a request for a few hundred pounds for digital storage and other minor components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002083/1","grantId":"ST/N002083/1","fundValue":"9481","fundStart":"2015-11-02","fundEnd":"2017-02-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Francisco  Diego","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
