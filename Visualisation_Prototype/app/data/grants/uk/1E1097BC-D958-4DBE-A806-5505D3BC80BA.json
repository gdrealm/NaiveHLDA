Even minor abnormalities in these processes can result in subtle defects that have devastating implications for brain function, or predispose an individual to later onset neurodegenerative disease. Genetic studies of inherited brain abnormalities and neurodegenerative diseases have provided a proven and valuable way to discover molecules which are involved in normal human brain development and function. However these studies are often hampered by the availability of only small families with these conditions, which have not previously been considered appropriate for new disease gene discovery. Recently a few research groups have shown that cutting edge genetic technologies may be used to investigate smaller families to expedite disease gene discovery. However despite these recent discoveries comparatively little remains known about the intricate molecular processes that orchestrate brain development or that underlie neurodegenerative disease. Consequently further neurological disease gene discovery is desperately required. \n\n\nThe Centre for Community Genomic Studies (CCGS) is a recently formed international consortium for the investigation of inherited diseases which occur amongst consanguineous communities (in the UK, Oman, Iran, Malaysia, India, and the Amish; USA). A main aim of the consortium is the translation of research findings into scientific and community benefit, and a number of our previous discoveries have enabled us to establish potentially lifesaving diagnostic testing programs. Through this consortium we have identified substantial numbers of families with forms of inherited neurological disease. In this proposal we aim to apply new sequencing technologies to discover the genes and mutations responsible for 10 neurological conditions for which we have already mapped the chromosomal location of the disease gene. We also aim to analyse 20 ?smaller? families with individuals with inherited forms of developmental delay to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach to accelerate gene discovery. Consequently by applying modern genomic technologies to hasten the identification of genes responsible for a range of neurological conditions made accessible through the CCGS, this initiative offers considerable potential to increase our knowledge of a range of neurological disorders, as well as provide more effective local diagnostic, counselling and educational programs to the communities involved in the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002279","grantId":"G1002279","fundValue":"635513","fundStart":"2011-04-21","fundEnd":"2014-08-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Crosby","coPersons":["M G McEntegart","Reza  Sharifi","Harold  Cross","Matthew  Hurles"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
