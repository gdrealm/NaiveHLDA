The market for components possessing these surfaces is huge (the annual turnover is over 75 billion in the UK) and growing by 25% per year (1996-2005) with great investment in the UK, USA, Germany, France and East Asia. The rapidly increasing use of nano scale and ultra-precision structured surfaces is wide ranging and covers optics, hard disks, medical devices and the micro moulding industries that all critically rely on ultra precision surfaces. The scale of the products does not limit the need for the surface precision. The James Webb Space Telescope project for instance requires 1.3 metre size complex freeform surface segmented telescope mirrors with less than 10nm form deviation.Ultra-precision multi-axis machining and micro-fabrication technologies are enabling technologies that allow the designed surfaces to be fabricated with the required sub-micrometer form accuracy and nanometric surface topography. There is however a fundamental limiting factor to manufacture of such surfaces, namely the ability to measure product with high level accuracy, and also on-line.The proposed project attempts to create a novel in/on line surface measurement system, which integrates the essential optical components of an interferometer, such as, light source, optical components, a detector, into a solid state chip device. The key and novel aspect of the research, within the project, is to study and develop techniques to fabricate and integrate optical elements onto the same motherboard chip. The feasibility of building a robust and miniature surface measurement system and applying it to on-line micro and nanoscale surface measurement will then be explored. The proposed project will involve an interdisciplinary team of researchers and industrialists: the Surface Metrology Group at the University of Huddersfield (UoH), the Centre for Integrated Photonics (CIP), instrument manufacturer Taylor Hobson Limited (TH) and Ultra-Precision Surfaces at the OpTIC Technium (OpTIC) in North Wales. The group's combined activities include 'state of the art' capabilities in surface metrology, integrated optics, metrology instruments and ultra-precision surface manufacturing. The aim is to demonstrate a unique and novel technique for micro, nano scale manufacture that represents a step change in the field of surface metrology, integrated optics, nanotechnology, and instrumentation. The inclusion of the partners demonstrates the supply chain required in such systems / the research group (Huddersfield) developing the fundamental measurement system approach, a technology translator and device manufacturer (CIP), a measurement tool manufacturer (Taylor-Hobson) and an end user (OpTIC). Should the project succeed as planned, then there is an excellent chance of downstreaming this approach into commercialisation.CIP is a subcontractor on this project responsible for the delivery of the advanced optoelectronic devices used in the project and the final optoelectronic hybrid chip. CIP - a not for profit organisation - has a track record of working with university groups in this way for the development of advanced components for research. Previous examples being the EPSRC funded projects PRINCE and PORTRAIT where CIP were (and are) responsible for the development of leading edge research devices for telecommunications, terahertz imaging, biophotonics and sensing applications within these projects. The centre provides an open acess R&amp;D facility for industry and universities. The EPSRC have agreed to support the access to CIP for academics by funding full economic costs on individual research grants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E03733X/1","grantId":"EP/E03733X/1","fundValue":"456405","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiangqian  Jiang","coPersons":["L  Blunt"],"organisation":"University of Huddersfield","findingsText":" This 3 year research project investigated an integrated-optic chip interferometer device for application in high/ultra precision surface metrology. The concept was to combine modern telecommunications and hybrid silicon photonics in order to develop a fully miniaturised measurement system that could usefully be employed for online surface metrology. The project served to address some of the timely metrology needs in high/ultra precision manufacture by expanding the gamut of online techniques available.\n\nThe project was carried out in collaboration with the Centre for Integrated-Photonics (CIP), a UK company who are world leaders in the design and development of silica-on-silicon hybrid photonic devices. In this type of manufacture, hybrid photonics structures such as light sources and photo-detectors are produced on daughter boards that are mounted on a single silica on silicon substrate (motherboard) containing waveguides enable light transfer. The integrated-chip device used the concept of wavelength scanning and a dispersive probe to effectively sweep a beam of light across a profile on a surface in the manner of a stylus, but without any destructive contact with the object to be measured. The analysis of the surface height variation was based upon phase shifting interferometry. The wavelength scanning was produced by an integrated tuneable laser module formed from an extended cavity laser diode. The tuning mechanism was provided by using a custom designed thin film filter, which passes a single cavity mode. The resonating mode (and thus wavelength) is changed by altering the angle of the filter using a pivot/sprung lever arm mechanism actuated by a miniature linear piezo motor. Other structures, necessary for operation as an interferometer, are an optical-coupler and photo-detector which were also integrated into the device, yielding a fully integrated measurement system. A remote optical probe, coupled to the chip interferometer by optical fibre, was designed to produce the beam scanning over the surface and re-couple the reflected light for analysis.\n\nThe optical interferometer was fibre coupled to an optical probe comprising of the diffraction grating and phase shifting mirror. Software and hardware was developed for data acquisition and control of the measurement system as well as analysis of the data. After assessments of various algorithms, the Carr? method was implemented for calculating surface height because of its insensitivity to the phase shift interval. The final measurement device was contained within a package dimension of 100mm x 50mm x 20mm.\n\nThe results generated by this research work have produced six refereed journal papers and four refereed conference/seminar papers. The chip interferometer device resulting from the research has many potential applications where an instrument is required to have both small size, nanometre scale measurement resolution and a remote scan head which can mounted on a machining tool. Non-academic contexts are in industrial applications requiring on-line metrology for high/ultra-precision manufacture, high added value manufacture. These manufacturing requirements may be found in industrial fields such as aerospace, optics manufacture, biomedical and the energy sector, specifically internal confinement fusion research. The international patent associated with this research will lead to the technology being released to industry, with IP licensing as a potential pathway. Follow on research funding has been acquired to study and optimise and develop the concept further. Further research into the developed concepts form part of ERC Project ERC-AdG-228117 (1.9 million euro). The technology also forms a core part of research Theme II: Underlying techniques for &quot;factory on the machine&quot; in the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Advanced Metrology (9 million GBP).
