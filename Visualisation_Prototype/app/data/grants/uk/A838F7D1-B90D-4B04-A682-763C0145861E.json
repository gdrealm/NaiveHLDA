{"id":"A838F7D1-B90D-4B04-A682-763C0145861E","title":"The Feminist Judgments Project","abstractText":"<p>In recent years in the UK there has been considerable debate and policy development on the issue of judicial diversity. Questions have been asked about the possible impact of more women judges and, in particular, how the introduction of women's lived experience and feminist theoretical perspectives might affect the development of the common law and the interpretation of key statutes. </p>\n\n<p>The Feminist Judgments Project represents a timely, dynamic and innovative next step in this debate. The project is a unique, imaginative collaboration in which a group of feminist socio-legal scholars will write alternative feminist judgments in significant legal cases. Thus, rather than simply critiquing existing judgments, the participants will engage in a practical, 'real world' exercise of judgment-writing, subject to the various constraints that bind appellate judges, including consideration of the extent to which, and the form in which, a judge's political commitments and social experience may or may not be introduced into her decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>The project will inaugurate a new form of critical socio-legal scholarship, one which seeks to demonstrate in a sustained and disciplined way how judgments could have been written and cases could have been decided differently.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3039","grantId":"RES-000-22-3039","fundValue":"56161","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rosemary Claire Hunter","coPersons":["Clare  McGlynn","Erika  Rackley"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
