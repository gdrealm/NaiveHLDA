The nature of much EHS work is applied, and we have good links with Prof. Sykes. The University also works jointly with @Bristol, a hands-on science centre to work with the community and engage young people and teachers. EHS and University websites and Faculty of Social Sciences and University newsletters will include brief non-technical descriptions of the study, the results and their implications. With the support of the University external relations department, press releases will be produced to disseminate findings of publications to the public. The results of the study will be provided to participating schools and research staff will help the principles of activity measurement and GPS be integrated into the children?s learning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501311","grantId":"G0501311","fundValue":"252738","fundStart":"2006-05-15","fundEnd":"2009-11-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley Ronald Cooper","coPersons":["Alan  Montgomery","Ken  Fox","Melvyn  Hillsdon","Russell  Jago","Angie  Page","Richard  Harris"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
