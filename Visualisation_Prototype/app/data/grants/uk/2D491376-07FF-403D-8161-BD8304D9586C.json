These extracellular signals may be hormones, growth factors, cytokines, proteins of the extracellular milieu, and so on. These exogenous factors transmit signals from the surface to the nucleus of the cell where they control gene expression (that is the production of particular proteins), and to other parts of the cell where they control shape, motility and metabolic activity. In disease cells may receive abnormal or excessive signals or they may respond inappropriately.\n\nThe intracellular signalling pathways consist of chains or cascades of enzymes (active proteins) which sequentially alter each other. In some pathways small molecules are generated which alter the properties of these enzymes.\n\nOur group is elucidating the signalling pathways which control cell growth (derangement of these pathways is found in cancerous cells), inflammatory responses which mediate diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and pathways which control behaviour of cardiac muscle cells and are important in heart disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9900166","grantId":"G9900166","fundValue":"628035","fundStart":"2000-01-17","fundEnd":"2010-01-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Saklatvala","coPersons":["Brian M Foxwell","Anthony Ian Magee","Andrew R Clark","Matilda  Katan","Peter Howard Sugden","Chris  Marshall","Martin  Turner","Angela  Clerk","Robin  Wait","Richard  Marais"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
