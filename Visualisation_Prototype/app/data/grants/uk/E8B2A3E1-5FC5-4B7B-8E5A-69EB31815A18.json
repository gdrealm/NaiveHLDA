Therefore our identification of the role of this protein degradation pathway offers a timely and unique window of opportunity to understand how targeted proteolysis regulates ABA signalling. The key hypotheses that need addressing are: 1. That germination induced endo-peptidase activity initiates the degradation of a key component(s) of ABA signalling through the N-end rule pathway. 2. That the ABA-related transcription factor ABI3 represents a substrate for the N-end rule pathway. 3. That the endosperm is the major site of action of the N-end rule pathway in the control of germination potential. 4. That the N-end rule pathway influences germination potential through a genetic network of mutually-exclusive repression and activation of key enzymes of endosperm functionality, via the transcription factors ABI3 and EIL4. 5. That the N-end rule pathway may have other functions during plant growth and development associated with removal of ABA sensitivity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G010595/1","grantId":"BB/G010595/1","fundValue":"453859","fundStart":"2009-07-20","fundEnd":"2012-10-19","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Discovery of the mechanism of plant sensing of oxygen Further scientific research Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education","dataset":"gtr"}
