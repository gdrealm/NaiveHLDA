This impaired skin wound healing has been attributed to changes in the cells of the skin which may be altered by the disease. Currently, no suitable diabetic wound model exists and so inadequate animal models and human testing are often undertaken. This project will develop a simple, reproducible, laboratory-based diabetic wound model system to permit rapid, low cost testing of materials, reagents and drugs and importantly reduce unnecessary animal experimentation. We have already isolated normal and diseased (diabetic) cells from patients, altered them so that they grow forever and identified diabetic wound disease marker genes. This new project will use these disease marker genes to develop a cell-based reporter system, enabling automated testing and pre-screening of reagents which may ameliorate the diabetic wound disease state. It is our aim to develop this bioassay commercially, producing a high-throughput screening system which will reduce the amount of unnecessary animal studies undertaken with respect to wound products/materials testing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800696/1","grantId":"G0800696/1","fundValue":"243612","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Phil  Stephens","coPersons":["David  Kipling","David William Thomas"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
