Astronomers in Armagh make observations of the Sun with a view to better understanding the nature of flares and how they may impact on space weather. They also undertake surveys to identify stars which are varying in their flux on short timescales. These stellar systems can, for instance, be sources or intense gravitational radiation or pulsating stars. Other observations are made to study specific stars in detail to determine what they are made from and the structure of their magnetic field. Closer to home, observations are made to study small objects in the Solar System which gives insight to how the planets were made and how they evolve over time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001680/1","grantId":"ST/N001680/1","fundValue":"9059","fundStart":"2015-12-06","fundEnd":"2017-12-05","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Ramsay","coPersons":["Jorick Sandor Vink","Simon  Jeffery","John Gerard  Doyle","Stefano  Bagnulo"],"organisation":"Armagh Observatory","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
