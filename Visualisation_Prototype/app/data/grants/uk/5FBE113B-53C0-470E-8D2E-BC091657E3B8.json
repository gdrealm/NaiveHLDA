{"id":"5FBE113B-53C0-470E-8D2E-BC091657E3B8","title":"Franco-British network on cultural relations","abstractText":"This proposal aims to throw new light on the cultural relationship between Britain and France over the past century. It will bring together scholars from a number of disciplines on both sides of the English Channel in a research network. In the short term, it will lead to two workshops and resulting publications. One will study cultural relations between the two countries during the difficult years of the Second World War. The other will focus on exchanges between the literary and artistic avant-gardes of the two countries during the turbulent 1920s and 1930s. In the longer term, the network will address a wide range of cultural relations since the end of the nineteenth century, contributing to shared understandings and new insights. It will have the important benefit of developing greater collaboration between the academic communities in Britain and France.\\nThe results of the network's activities over a two year period will be a better understanding of how cultural relations operate in practice. An interdisciplinary approach will enable a clearer understanding of how different elements combine: how, for example, government policies, institutional frameworks and commercial interests interact with intellectual and artistic developments.\\nThe network will have two overlapping audiences: the wider scholarly community engaged in researching cultural relations, and a broader non-specialist audience with particular interest in Franco-British relationships.\\nThe funding requested will enable a secretariat to be established for the network, and the holding of two workshops in Britain, to match parallel workshops that are being planned by French members of the emerging network.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E010172/1","grantId":"AH/E010172/1","fundValue":"25063","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Howard Kelly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
