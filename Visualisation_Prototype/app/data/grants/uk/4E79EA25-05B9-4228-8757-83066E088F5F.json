This urges us to re-examine our conventional understanding of this crucial period. Traditionally, histories of performance art have tended to concentrate on a well-documented (mostly US-based) canon of works, neglecting local scenes outside of the centres of art production. This project aims to chart the manner in which performance art as an international artistic movement was negotiated in response to the particularities of specific cultural situations during its formative years - here examined in the context of Wales between 1965 and 1979.\\nThe emergence in Wales of what came to be called 'performance art' dates back to the mid-1960s, when artists joined in the international movement away from the production of art objects toward the creation of events. In 1965 art instructors at Barry Summer School staged happenings to test new teaching approaches; one of the first festivals of Fluxus art in Britain occurred in Aberystwyth in 1968, six months after Fluxus' most famous artist, Yoko Ono, had made a piece for Cardiff; that same year Ivor Davies brought destruction in art to Wales by responding to the era's violence with timed explosions; throughout the 1970s, from their base in Swansea, sculptor Shirley Cameron and drama-graduate Roland Miller explored the field between fine art and experimental theatre; and the National Eisteddfod, the major Welsh-speaking cultural festival, in Wrexham 1977 included a controversial performance art programme involving European artists such as Joseph Beuys and Mario Merz, whose contributions were overshadowed by local artist Paul Davies' performative protests against the suppression of the Welsh language. A context characterized by traditions of political radicalism, a lack of art institutions, a small and multidisciplinary artistic scene and a growing activism around issues of language and identity became a model breeding ground for an art form that was ephemeral, interdisciplinary, engaged and direct in its address to audiences. In this, Wales both mirrored and refracted developments elsewhere in the art world.\\nThe project proposes to reveal this hitherto neglected aspect of performance art history by compiling as comprehensive a record as possible of events that were created in Wales by local and visiting artists between 1965 and 1979. It will undertake extensive research into extant documentary material held in institutional archives and scattered across the private collections of artists and organisations. Complementing this research, the project will draw on oral history approaches to solicit the recollections of key figures who shaped the development of performance art in Wales during this period, a generation that is slowly disappearing. Analysing the documents and testimonials alongside one other, the project will also examine the complex manner in which memory interacts with documentary remains to constitute our knowledge of past performance events.\\nThe project will make freely available to other researchers in the field not just the analysis of the research findings (published in journal articles and conference papers) but these additional resources: a fully searchable online database of performance art events in Wales 1965-1979, which also indexes the current location of available documentation on these events; and a range of oral history recordings and transcripts, to be deposited in key archives. The resources will be accessible also to a non-academic audience interested in performance art, among them the current community of performance artists, for whom the project hopes to provide a sense of its history - the now over forty year long tradition of an art form that once originated through a forcefully asserted break with tradition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G012369/1","grantId":"AH/G012369/1","fundValue":"165779","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  'It was forty years ago today...': Locating the Early History of Performance Art in Wales 1965-1979 (IWFYAT)'s research into the history of performance art in Wales has achieved its most significant and sustained impact through informing the professional practices of Welsh arts practitioners. These fall into two groups: artists engaged in live art, past and present; and art curators and policy makers who have responsibility for the presentation, conservation and funding of contemporary art in Wales. In uncovering, documenting and making publicly accessible Wales's rich but underappreciated heritage of performance art, IWFYAT has given the first generation of performance artists a renewed stake in its history; inspired younger artists in the creation of new work; and helped to raise the public profile of the artform to the extent that performance work is now routinely included in exhibitions, publications and media coverage devoted to Welsh contemporary art. Three partnerships with major organisations allow IWFYAT to inform directly how performance art in Wales is funded, administered, exhibited and conserved.\n\nThe National Museum Wales Amgueddfa Cymru (NMW-AC) first worked with IWFYAT on the inaugural displays for its new National Museum of Art in 2011, which was informed directly by the research. NMW-AC and IWFYAT currently collaborate on a major retrospective of Ivor Davies's performance in the context of Destruction in Art, supported by an AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Award (CDA, 2013-16). NMW-AC's Head of Contemporary Art has called the partnership 'a model for the way academic research can reach wider audiences'. In response to the research the Museum has also begun to consider how it will collect and conserve Wales's performance legacy. IWFYAT collaborates on a further AHRC-CDA (2012-2015) with Chapter Arts Centre, which is informing the art centre's directions in audience development and innovative programming through a re-evaluation of its early history in the 1970s. And the Arts Council of Wales (ACW) hosted an exhibition which drew on IWFYAT's research at the National Eisteddfod 2011, thus enhancing the project's profile among Welsh-speakers. The ACW has furthermore taken an active interest in the project through the presence of its Arts Director on IWFYAT's steering group. In 2012 Roms was appointed a National Advisor to ACW to advise on its support for a variety of performance companies and projects.

'It was forty years ago today...' produced a comprehensive record of performance art practice in Wales between 1965 and 1979, thereby demonstrating that such work was not limited to singular events in London, Paris or New York but impacted on art making more widely and deeply. By paying close attention to the emergence of performance art and related art practices (happenings, performance poetry, body art, physical theatre, new music, expanded cinema, etc) within a specific context, the research also found that performance making did not just produce ephemeral events but often resulted in tangible infrastructures: networks, festivals, venues, educational programmes, funding schemes and publications, many of which still play a role in the arts in Wales today.\n\nThe project compiled information on nearly 650 performance events made in Wales during the period. The team spent two years undertaking extensive research in over 55 archives and private collections, digitizing more than 4,500 documents in the process. This was complemented by forty oral history conversations with artists, administrators and audience members, which used a variety of formats such as life-story approaches, group conversations and guided tours to significant locations. New findings included examples of early performance experimentation dating back to the late 1950s, the important role university art festivals played for experimental art in the 1960s, the emergence of a dedicated performance pedagogy in the 1970s and the centrality of artistic collaborations for the British scene of the period.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are being made freely available to other researchers. They include a fully searchable online database of performance art events in Wales 1965-1979, which also indexes the current location of available documentation; and the full range of its oral history recordings and transcripts, which have been deposited in key archives. The hope is that the information will be used to gain a better insight into the manner in which performance art, as an artistic movement of trans-national reach, and its affiliated networks and institutions emerged and developed within specific local contexts, in Wales, the UK and beyond.\n\nThe bilingual website for the project (www.performance-wales.org) features extracts from all interviews, transcripts and access to the database, addressing itself also to a non-academic audience with an interest in performance art and art in Wales. Since the completion of the research in 2011, the project's findings have already been taken forward in academic and in non-academic settings.\nBy focusing on long-term developments in a defined geographical area, the research has brought to light several neglected features of the early history of performance art: the activities of neo-avant-garde networks; the emergence of innovative teaching approaches; the role of university patronage; the formation of a support system of venues, festivals, platforms and funding schemes. These findings are receiving increasing attention among historians of performance and live art (see, for example, Heddon and Klein 2012). \nThe research has also been generating considerable interest in its methodologies, which have included publicly staged oral history interviews, group conversations, participatory memory installations and re-enactment formats. Its approaches have been adopted by performance researchers in locations as diverse as Israel, Singapore and Switzerland. Roms's accompanying historiographic writings on performance archiving, performing memory and performative evidence have been cited by scholars interested in documentation, marginalised performance histories and applied performance, but also by oral historians, art archivists and scholars with an interest in practice-based research methodologies.\nFurthermore, the project's findings on the history of performance art in Wales have been taken up by artists engaged in live art, past and present in the creation of new work; and by art curators and policy makers who have responsibility for the presentation, conservation and funding of contemporary art in Wales.
