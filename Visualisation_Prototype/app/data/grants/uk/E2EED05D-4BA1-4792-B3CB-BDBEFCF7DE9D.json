However, numerous research groups in Sheffield and beyond have either provided samples for structure determination, or have used the equipment themselves. The use of this equipment has been fundamental in determining the structures of proteins, enzymes and complexes with inhibitors, DNA, substrates and binding partners, benefiting research in such areas as antimicrobial discovery, herbicide design, DNA metabolism, bacterial pathogenicity and photosynthesis. In addition structures of liquid crystals have been extensively studied, in the area of semiconductor design.

These atomic structures have led to a greater understanding of molecular basis of the function of these molecules in diverse areas such as herbicide design, antimicrobial discovery, DNA metabolism, enzyme function and the infection and pathogenesis of some disease causing bacteria. The equipment funded has been used to determine the structures of proteins, and other materials, by many groups in Sheffield, and beyond, with these structures aiding the understanding of numerous different research themes.
