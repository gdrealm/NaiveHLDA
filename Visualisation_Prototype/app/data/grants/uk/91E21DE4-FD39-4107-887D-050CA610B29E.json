This affects a\npermanent genetic change in the target which is propagated through to its progeny. While there are several means of\ngenetic modification, few are capable of permanent modification of target cells. Amongst all vectors for gene delivery, LV\nare unique in unparalleled efficiency, safety, lack of toxicity and ability to modify non-dividing target cells. They have\ntherefore come to be recognised as a key reagent required for the efficient development of the burgeoning cell therapy, as\nwell as gene therapy industries. However, although LV represent a well understood and robust technology, there is no\nmanufacturing methodology for very large-scale LV production. This is now an acknowledged bottle-neck both for clinical\ntrials and for commercial exploitation of many cell and gene therapy products in current development. We propose to\naddress this unmet need","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N003853/1","grantId":"BB/N003853/1","fundValue":"584844","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Farzin  Farzaneh","coPersons":["Lucas  Chan"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
