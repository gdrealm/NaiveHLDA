Concerned with how philosophy might be 'described' through film, the output of this project will constitute the third film of a series of films that address this issue.\\n\\nThe outputs from this project will be of interest to a wide range of scholars across the arts and humanities engaged in practice led research and interdisciplinary theoretical work, particularly in the fields of film and media studies, philosophy, cultural studies, literary studies and fine art. The outputs will facilitate new ways for disciplines to talk to each other allowing for cross fertilisation and a fresh perspective both from within and outside of the disciplines. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002003/1","grantId":"AH/J002003/1","fundValue":"48142","fundStart":"2012-01-17","fundEnd":"2013-07-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The work has been used to reconsider some of Jacques Derrida's ideas in contemporary times and to highlight the unique contribution that practice-based work can make to the development and re-framing of theoretical ideas.
