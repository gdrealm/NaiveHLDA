We will use new methods to directly watch viruses crossing the cell boundary in real-time to observe new details of this important process. We will see how antibodies alter or stop this process and this will help us understand how antibodies prevent viral infection. This will allow us in the long-term to design vaccines in a more rationale way for importatnt diseases such as HIV and flu.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701057","grantId":"G0701057","fundValue":"301375","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Klenerman","coPersons":["Helena  Browne"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
