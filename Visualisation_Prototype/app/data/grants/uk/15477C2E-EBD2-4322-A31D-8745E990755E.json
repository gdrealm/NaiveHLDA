Major Themes which will be covered by our Rolling Grant programme include: solar physics, in particular the use of high-cadence imaging to study activity and variability in the solar atmosphere and how these affect energy transport; the investigation of solar system bodies, including comets and asteroids and in particular Near-Earth Objects, which may represent an impact hazard to the Earth; astrochemistry, specifically the development of theoretical models of star formation regions and circumstellar discs, including those which may form planets; studies of hot stars, both young massive OB-type objects and those at an evolved stage of evolution, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars; the discovery and characterisation of planets orbiting stars other than the Sun (exoplanets), including possible Earth-sized objects; studies of supernovae and their progenitor stars, and how they influence galaxy evolution through dust production and chemical enrichment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F002270/1","grantId":"ST/F002270/1","fundValue":"2095140","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Publications in journals have been cited by other researchers who have then themselves undertaken further work in the research field (as indeed have the authors of the original publications).
