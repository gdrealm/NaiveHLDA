{"id":"5105DAB6-91AB-4388-B827-C78438EAAAD1","title":"Anglo-Franco-German Representation Theory Network","abstractText":"Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that seeks to understand an abstract algebraic object such as a group, associative algebra, or Lie algebra, through its actions on a more concrete object, for instance a vector space. The subject, whose origins may be traced back to the late nineteenth century, is \none of the most vibrant fields of mathematics today, interacting fruitfully with geometry, number theory, topology and mathematical physics. Representation theory is visible on the general mathematical scene through large-scale research programmes with a distinctive inter-disciplinary flavour and it abounds with problems which are the subject of intense research coming from several different points of view. \n\nGiven this background, it is necessary to provide researchers with opportunities for interdisciplinary interaction, the chance to develop a broader vision of the fundamental underpinnings and future directions in representation theory, and to learn about neighbouring disciplines. Seminars, meetings and workshops, as well as short-term informal visits, are a key source of information about what is happening at the international level, despite the growing importance of electronic communications. The proposed project is a networking initiative &quot;Anglo-French-German Representation Theory&quot; to bring these benefits to researchers in representation theory from the UK, France and Germany.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K016326/1","grantId":"EP/K016326/1","fundValue":"109819","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Radha  Kessar","coPersons":["Iain  Gordon"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
