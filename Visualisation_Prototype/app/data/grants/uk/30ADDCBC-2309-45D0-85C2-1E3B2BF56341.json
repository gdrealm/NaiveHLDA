For these migrants, thrust into an alien cultural environment, ethnic associationalism and social networking are among the most common responses to life in the new home. Yet despite its long history, the persistence of ethnic associations and networks among migrants in the Far East has received little attention.</p>\n\n<p>This project offers the first sustained reading of present-day expatriate social networks and associational forms in Asia within the wider context of their historical antecedents, moving beyond the traditional focus on Anglophone cultures in the former British Empire in Asia by comparing contemporary migrant community life of British and German expats. The principal project objectives are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to provide a close analysis of the emergence and development of contemporary ethnic associations among migrants from Britain and Germany</li>\n\n <li>to offer a knowledge-shaping reading of cultural organisations and diplomatic missions that operate within the wider circles of expatriate community life</li>\n\n <li>to interact with current expatriate groups, the stakeholders of the organisations to be studied in this research, as well as policy makers.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008161/1","grantId":"ES/K008161/1","fundValue":"234810","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanja  Bueltmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
