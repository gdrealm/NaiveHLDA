{"id":"DC199E65-8790-4B74-B78B-2B65B0BED1DF","title":"Manchester Magnetic Resonance Neuroimaging Co-operative","abstractText":"Functional imaging is increasingly becoming an important tool in Neuroscience. It provides a way of identifying the regions in the human brain which are active during various tasks. The technique is safe, entirely non-invasive and can be applied equally to volunteers and clinical patients. In this group, there are researchers who are interested in how the brain processes chronic pain (particularly in arthritis), how eye-hand movements are co-ordinated, what brain regions may function differently in individuals in anti-social personality disorder, how inflammation plays a role in the development of brain damage following stroke, and how recovery of function after a stroke can be helped. Although the problems are diverse, the methods used to investigate them have much in common, using a core of similar techniques. By bringing the researchers together under the umbrella of a co-operative group, interchange of ideas will be facilitated and methods developed in one area of research will be available to the other groups to exploit in their own programmes. In addition, the co-operative will foster collaboration between research groups led by people in different disciplines, including basic scientists, physicians and psychiatrists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300653","grantId":"G0300653","fundValue":"143495","fundStart":"2005-07-04","fundEnd":"2010-07-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bill  Deakin","coPersons":["Stephen Ross Williams","Nancy Jane Rothwell","Graham Robert Barnes","Anthony Kenneth Jones"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
