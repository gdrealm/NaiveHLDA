While some evidence does suggest greater levels of oxytocin - and certain variants of the oxytocin receptor gene - are associated with greater kindness and well-being, new research suggests that the effects of oxytocin are not universally positive.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the present research, the researchers propose to develop a new model that integrate social factors related to interpersonal sensitivity (eg, how sensitive people are to others) with the oxytocin system in predicting well-being. The model is predicated on the principle of balance - specifically, that greater interpersonal sensitivity is beneficial to a certain a point, after which its effects can become maladaptive. To test predictions stemming from this model, the present research will incorporate both correlational and experimental designs to investigate how two social factors related to interpersonal sensitivity (attachment and self-construal) moderate the oxytocin system in two areas: At the gene level (oxytocin receptor gene) and at the hormone level (through experimental manipulation of blood oxytocin levels).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008331/1","grantId":"ES/K008331/1","fundValue":"245714","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research is still ongoing; thus, our findings are as of yet not used.

We are currently collecting data for the experiments and thus do not have any findings at this stage. Once we complete our research, our findings will be of interest to researchers who are working in the areas of sociability, well-being, and oxytocin. Furthermore, our findings will be of interest to policy makers and regulators of oxytocin. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
