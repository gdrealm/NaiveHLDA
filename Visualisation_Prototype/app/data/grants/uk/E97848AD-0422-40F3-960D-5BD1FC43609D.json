","person":"Dov Joseph Stekel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" This research has been jointly conducted between laboratories in the UK and Japan. Our main findings are about the way in which E. coli cells regulate the amount of zinc that they contain. This is important because, on the one hand, E. coli pathogens need zinc to be able to establish an infection, but on the other hand, too much zinc is toxic, so zinc is also used as an antimicrobial Although there have been a number of publications that have benefitted from the collaboration on the grant, the main publication is currently under review at a leading journal and so we are not yet aware of how the research may have been used by others.
