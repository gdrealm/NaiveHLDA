It addressed fundamental questions about what policy-makers do when they go to work and how this is represented in the accounts that researchers and practitioners themselves give of policy making. </p>\n\n<p>The series thereby generated a much-needed dialogue about the practice of policy making between academics, researchers, and national and local practitioners. This dialogue confirmed the continuing difficulty faced by social scientists in formulating concepts of policy and practice that make sense to those we think of as policy-makers. At the same time, it made us newly aware of the difficulty practitioners themselves -&nbsp;especially those at the local level - have in recognising that what they do is to make policy. As such, we rediscovered the institutional importance of often very mundane policy instruments and artefacts of policy-making, such as policy documents and commissions of inquiry, as well as different policy 'persons', be it the consultant, adviser or civic entrepreneur. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the series make it clear that there remains a need to break down distinctions between academics and policy-makers so as to generate new ways of co-producing knowledge. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0613-A","grantId":"RES-451-26-0613-A","fundValue":"7009","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This seminar series facilitated the development of new networks of inquiry and dialogue between UK and European researchers, as well as between academics and practitioners. Practitioners who attended the workshops undertook their own critical reflections of the practice of policy-making. These reflections led to the creation of the knowledge transfer partnership between the Association for Public Service Excellence and De Montfort University (KTP008212).

Equally, it surfaced a new awareness of the difficulties practitioners face in recognising what they 'do' as policy-makers. Indeed, investigations revealed the significance for the practices of policy-making of 'mundane' policy instruments and artefacts such as briefing papers and plans, as well as the different roles open to individuals, be it the 'consultant' or 'advisor'. As a result the series concluded that there is a pressing need to develop new spaces of co-production of knowledge between academics and practitioners. Future work should look to examine further the 'everyday' practices of policy-making, bringing to the fore novel methods of co-production between social scientists and policy practitioners. It is through such studies that we might begin to reconsider how we communicate with, and offer guidance to, those charged with formulating and implementation policy.
