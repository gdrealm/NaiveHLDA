It includes an analysis of their positive and negative interactions in regard to army employment, civilian employment and home lives, as well as the attitudes and perceptions of their civilian employers, regulars and significant others. \n\nA small number of international studies have examined inter-role conflict with community roles (e.g., emergency services volunteering), and suggest links with such conflict between volunteering and family life and outcomes including reduced satisfaction and intention to remain a volunteer (Cowlishaw et al., 2014), as well as partner distress (Cowlishaw et al., 2010a) and support for volunteering (Cowlishaw et al., 2010b). However, as far as can be ascertained, there are no studies which have explored the interface among additional and simultaneous competing roles, including the army reserves, primary employment and family life. This interface may be extremely complex, and reflect both positive and negative impacts of organisational and operational demands from the army reserves on primary employment and family, as well as bi-directional impacts of demands from these competing roles on the army reserves. \n\nGroup identification has been positively related to improved interactions with others including perceptions of enhanced coping ability for individuals who feel supported by a member of a group they identify with as opposed to someone they consider an outsider (Platow et al., 2007). Furthermore, Sani et al. (p782, 2012) suggest that group identification gives individuals a &quot;sense of meaning, permanence and stability, which protects against existential anxiety.&quot; This implies that in terms of role preparedness, there is a need to ensure that reservists are not only fully integrated into an organisation but they also feel a core part of a team. This is highlighted by Lang et al (2010) who discuss the distinct nature of reservists' life because of the need for a normal day to day civilian existence but at the same time being ready and motivated in case of a call up and a sudden disruption. This study aims to identify resources for army reservists and their partners that can help minimise potential conflicts as well as enhance positive experiences of enrichment across the Reserve service and civilian roles.\n\nGorman and Thomas (1991) argue that although poor economic conditions have historically favoured regular Army recruitment, this may not be always the case for reservists because of the tendency for people to relocate away from low-employment areas to elsewhere to seek better opportunities. Moreover, as reservists are likely to be employed on a part-time basis by the Army their regular involvement may be impeded because of other priorities including employment, family and leisure activities. Indeed, Griffith's (2008) study into the motivations of American reservists identified two distinct groups - those that are motivated because they have a sense of duty and those that are materially motivated, with the author identifying the latter group as not only less committed but also less combat ready. This study will engage with reservists as well as their families, employers and regular service colleagues in order to explore the issues critical for their successful recruitment and deployment.\n\nIn addition to the literature review, focus groups and semi-structured interviews, further information will be gathered using documentary analysis and employment statistics to develop an understanding of the context within which these changes are taking place in the Armed Forces and how these may impact upon reservists' active participation in the army, as well as their families and employers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L013002/1","grantId":"ES/L013002/1","fundValue":"234058","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sabir  Giga","coPersons":["Alison  Collins","Susan  Cartwright","Sean  Cowlishaw"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
