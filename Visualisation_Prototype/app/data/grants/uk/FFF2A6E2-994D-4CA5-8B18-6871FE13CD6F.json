We do not completely understand what controls these processes but the birth defects cleft lip and palate can result when they go wrong. Affected patients often experience difficulties with eating and speaking, which can be corrected to some degree by surgery, dental treatment, and speech therapy. We know that cleft lip and palate result from genetic and environmental factors, but we do not know all of the genes involved. \nThe aim of this project is to build a more complete picture of the genes involved in formation of the lip and palate. This will be achieved using the mouse, in which development of the lip and palate is very similar to that in man, and the chick, which has a naturally cleft palate. The results of this project will help us to understand the processes underlying normal development of the lip and palate and how these are disrupted in cleft lip and cleft palate. The results of this research will be made available via the internet in the form of movies that can be viewed on personal computers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400955","grantId":"G0400955","fundValue":"182329","fundStart":"2005-05-23","fundEnd":"2008-05-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael James Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
