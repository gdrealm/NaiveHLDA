Those with an academic chemistry background should ignore them.\n\n2012 is the 150th anniversary of the reaction of chloroform (CHCl3) with sodium hydroxide. This reaction is a versatile source of the carbene CCl2, that readily undergoes cyclopropanation with alkenes [a]. Unfortunately, despite 60 years of 'modern' research attempting to 'entrap' free CCl2 (or its cousins CF2 and CBr2), or to release them in suitable chiral [b] environments, absolutely no success has been realised in selective chiral addition of CX2 units to one of the two faces of prochiral alkenes [c]. There is a general belief that such reactions are 'impossible' due to the exceptionally high reactivity of free CX2 compared to any of its derivatives. The lack of a suitable catalytic asymmetric reaction is highly regrettable as the derived chiral cyclopropanes often have biological activity, that is intimately dependent on their chiral 'shape'. There is a pressing need to overturn this established dogma by finding an alternative approach to using indiscriminate 'CX2' carbenes in these reactions - by attaining a fundamental new mechanism that avoids them completely. Hints in the primary literate indicate that this is a way forward - the immediate precursors to 'CX2' are CX3- anions and these have appreciable lifetimes and suitable reactivity to certain alkenes. Under appropriate catalysis these anions add to electron deficient alkenes [d] faster than free CX2 is formed or direct cyclopropanation of such alkenes. Our research will focus on designing new catalytic cycles whereby CX3- or CX2(LeavingGroup)- anions undergo conjugate addition to electron deficient alkenes leading to an intermediate that loses the leaving group generating the cyclopropane indirectly [e]. This approach has not been attempted before, for dihalocyclopropanation, but there are sufficient clues in the literature to show it is valid idea. If this mechanism can be turned into a very efficient process, with suitable chiral derivatives, then new routes for effective asymmetric dihalocyclopropanation will become available to pharmaceutical chemistry [f].\n\n[a] A carbene is a carbon atom with only 2 attached substituents (as opposed to the normal 4). Cyclopropanation is the formation of 3-membered rings (in this case from CCl2 and a derivative of CH2=CH2).\n[b] Chiral objects are related as non super imposable mirror images - your hands are a good example. Many drug molecules are chiral and the two mirror images can have profoundly different effects, e.g. one mirror image of Ethambutol cures TB, the other causes blindness.\n[c] A substituted alkene (e.g. RCH=CH2) has two equivalent surfaces to its central pi (=) bond. Reaction at one with CX2 generates the opposite mirror image to the other; controlling this is very challenging.\n[d] An alkene as in [c] were the R group removes electron density from the central pi (=) bond.\n[e] A 'leaving group' is part of the molecule that can be easily displaced. Addition of CX3- (or indeed, many other anions) to the terminus of an electron deficient alkene.\n[f] Pharmaceutical chemistry is the use of chemistry to produce 'drug' molecules primerily for human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000578/1","grantId":"EP/K000578/1","fundValue":"312653","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Preliminary results only realized in 2014 so hard to comment.
