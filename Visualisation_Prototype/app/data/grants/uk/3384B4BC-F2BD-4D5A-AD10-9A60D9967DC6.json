{"id":"3384B4BC-F2BD-4D5A-AD10-9A60D9967DC6","title":"(r)agency? Lived Practices of Anger","abstractText":"(r)agency? The Creative Practices of Anger is a multi-disciplinary network, drawing together a team of early-career researchers, working in a number of different fields - both creative and critical - and a series of research activities and case studies that together form a research project on what the role and potentialities of anger might be in communities. Drawing on a range of methodologies and including cross-diciplinary approaches, the project will undertake research with a number of communities, representing different ages and locations, experiencing rage and anger (of different kinds for different reasons). The research asks questions about what brings people individually, or collectively, in community, to experience their anger in productive or transformative ways and create, what Bourdieu terms, new &quot;cultural capital&quot;. \n\nThe activities and analyses that make up this project, have been framed by the investigators' existing research interests, their disciplines, their critical (and in some case creative) practice, and their engagement with communities. Bringing this network of scholars together enables the exploration of patterns of relating/being with anger across the different communities and contexts. It does this by understanding the role of anger in acknowledging and transforming social and structural injustices across a range of communities and contexts. It is hoped that new understandings about how anger can be reconceptualised as a positive force will come about through bringing together these diverse experiences through the proposed knowledge exchange events and final community reflection and consolidation event.\n\nActivity title: \n\nPerforming Rage: young women and their expression of anger - led by Dr Helen Limon\n\nIn Angry Tongues: creative practices of anger in politicised poetry, song writing and performance - led by Dr Geoff Bright \n\nNarrating Injustice Artfully: how anger towards animal cruelty and species loss is enacted and told through story - led by Alex Lockwood \n\nSikh-ing Understanding: expressions of 1984 - led by Dr Jasjit Singh \n\nThe Angry Brigade: service veterans and the Aden conflict - Led by Community Co-I Colin Hutchinson with Dr Limon and Alex Lockwood","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M009114/1","grantId":"AH/M009114/1","fundValue":"33655","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Limon","coPersons":["Jasjit  Singh","Nigel Geoffrey Bright","Alex  Lockwood","Colin  Hutchinson"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
