Computer simulation methods are extremely useful for predicting the properties and behaviour of individual molecules - e.g. of a potential new polymer or a newly-discovered protein - but how will that behaviour relate to the real world situation when we have maybe 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them together? It is completely beyond the power of computers to deal with this number of individual molecules, but fortunately we don't have to. As long as we can study a big enough sample of them, our predictions of the properties of the bulk material should be reliable. The required sample size is often very large, but fortunately increasingly within the range that the most powerful modern-day computers can deal with. The aim of this project is to develop the software necessary to support these types of 'ensemble' calculations; software which will be very versatile and so theoretically able to applied to very many different areas of science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039512/1","grantId":"EP/K039512/1","fundValue":"550938","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benedict  Leimkuhler","coPersons":["Iain  Bethune"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" Nil return October 2014 Nil return October 2014 Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
