These results will illuminate, and be\nilluminated by, analysis of the relationships amongst the two classes of model that can currently explain some, but not all,\naspects of the existing results.\n(Objective 1): To what extent is context-induced acuity loss due to the oblique effect? Using a surrounding context, we will\npsychophysically map how acuity varies with target and surround tilts, and describe any departure from the baseline\noblique effect (obtained without a surround).\n(Objective 2): How do bias and acuity vary as a function of flank phase, orientation and position relative to the target? For\nthese psychophysical experiments we will use localized flanks in addition to annular surrounds. Previous psychophysical\nwork has systematically varied both position and orientation at spatial scales commensurate with individual receptive\nfields in V1. By systematically varying the size of our stimuli we will be able to identify those fundamental contextual\neffects that are more-or-less independent of spatial scale.\n(Objective 3): How do the fovea and the periphery differ in terms of bias and acuity, and is there any interaction between\nstimulus configuration and retinal position? We will use stimuli at various spatial scales and separations in order to\novercome the effects of finer foveal sampling. From a modeling perspective, this experiment will provide critical\ninformation as to how orientation processing is translation variant, which is important for both classes of models.\n(Objective 4): How do bias and acuity vary as a function of the contrast of target and surrounding context? The V1 model\nincorporates the known dynamical balance between excitatory and inhibitory contextual influences, favouring the latter for\nhigh contrast targets and the former for low contrast ones. The Bayesian model suggests that there is greater uncertainty\nassociated with low contrast targets, and therefore a greater effect of the surround. By parametrically varying the\ncontrasts of the surround and the target, we will gather critical information on the interaction.\n(Objective 5): How are detection and contrast discrimination affected by the contexts that change acuity and bias?\nSensitivity to contrast and acuity for orientation are likely limited at the same, early stage of visual processing, where\nvisual stimuli evoke a profile of activity across a population of oriented filters. Measurements of detection and contrast\ndiscrimination made using the same stimuli described in objective 2 promise to provide tight constraints for any unified\nmodel of sensitivity and orientation perception.\n(Objective 6): As is apparent, the models are inter-related in a complex set of ways. Using the rich data collected\nthroughout the project, we will study these relations, to understand lateral excitation and inhibition as an extreme, and\ngeometrically reduced, abstraction of the dynamical model of V1, and how or whether the Bayesian model can be seen as\na computational-level description of both. Forging a theoretically tight link will allow apparently disparate insights and\nevidence about each to be applied to the other. It will also highlight differences susceptible to experimental test.\n\nObjective 1: Met. See Solomon &amp; Morgan (2009).\nObjective 2: Partly met by another lab! Levi and Carney (Current Biology 2009) parametrically\nmanipulated flanker size and position, and reported their effects on acuity.\nObjective 3: Met. See Mareschal, Morgan, &amp; Solomon (2010).\nObjective 4: Met. See Solomon &amp; Morgan (2006).\nObjective 5: Met. Initially covered in See Solomon &amp; Morgan (2006), but re-considered in\nSolomon &amp; Mareschal (in press).\nObjective 6: Pretty vague objective, but certainly met by Dayan &amp; Solomon (2010) and Schwartz,\nHsu, &amp; Dayan (2007). Forty years of neuroscience have cemented the notion that vision depends on a population of brain cells whose individual\nresponses depend both on the contrast and the spatial orientation of visual stimuli. Consequently, our ability to\ndiscriminate between different contrasts should be related to our ability to discriminate between different orientations.\nHowever, it is only recently that biologically inspired models have had any success in explaining both of these abilities.\nNaturally, these early successes have focused on simple targets, like line segments, which are thought to optimally\nstimulate individual neurons.
