However, NK cells sometimes fail to control tumours and have been implicated in recurrent miscarriage and the development of inflammatory diseases. Consequently, manipulating the function of a patient's NK cells, or giving them extra NK cells that function properly, are attractive approaches to ameliorating disease.\n\nTo achieve this, it is important that we understand the factors that determine whether NK cells are protective, destructive, or ineffective. We believe that a key factor regulating NK cell function is their ability to migrate through, and localise correctly within complex tissues. For example, NK cells may fail to properly control tumour growth when they become stuck in the dense tissue deposited around tumour cells, preventing them from directly interacting with, and killing, the tumour cells.\n\nIf we can understand the factors regulating NK cell migration through tissues, we can alter NK cell function to prevent or cure disease. However, mammalian tissues are highly complex, and our understanding of the signals that control the movement of NK cells is currently very limited. Two-photon microscopy is an imaging technique that allows us to look deep inside living tissues and observe the behaviour of immune cells in real time. Using this technique, we have shown that NK cells use a specific protein on the cell surface, called a2b1 integrin, to stick to bundles of collagen in infected tissues. This controls the speed of NK cell migration, and may either ensure that NK cells are retained where they are needed, or may prevent NK cells from seeking out and killing &quot;target&quot; cells. While this finding offers a potential candidate for therapeutic modulation of NK cell behaviour and function, we do not yet know how a2b1 activity is regulated on NK cells, or whether a2b1 is critical for NK cell function. In this project, we will use two-photon microscopy, together with genetically engineered mouse models, to address these points.\n\nInfectious agents can manipulate cells of the immune system for their own benefit, and understanding how they do this can give us important information about how the immune system normally works. Toxoplasma gondii is a common parasite of humans and other warm-blooded animals that forms cysts in the brain. T. gondii can invade immune cells, alter the way they migrate, and use them to travel around the body. My work suggests that the parasite is capable of detaching NK cells from the collagen, allowing them to move faster and further. This provides a useful tool to understand how a2b1 activity is regulated on NK cells, and the molecular pathways regulating NK cell migration. In this project, we will use innovative proteomics techniques to determine how T. gondii alters a2b1-mediated interactions between NK cells and tissues. Together with our imaging data, this will allow us to uncover the molecular pathways underpinning NK cell migration and function in tissues. Increased understanding of the molecular pathways regulating NK cell migration and function will allow us to identify candidates that could be targeted therapeutically to optimise NK cell activity and ameliorate disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M023540/1","grantId":"BB/M023540/1","fundValue":"471399","fundStart":"2016-01-11","fundEnd":"2019-01-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Janine  Coombes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
