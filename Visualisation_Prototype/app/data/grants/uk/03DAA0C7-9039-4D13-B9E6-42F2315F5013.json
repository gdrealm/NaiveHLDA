{"id":"03DAA0C7-9039-4D13-B9E6-42F2315F5013","title":"Values of Environmental Writing: Inspiration, Communication, Action","abstractText":"The 'Values of Environmental Writing' network is designed to raise levels of critical academic exchange and public debate about the possible relations between reading habits and preferences, levels of environmental literacy, and wider patterns of pro-environment behavioural and lifestyle change. It will do so in the context of sustaining quality of life, in Scottish society primarily, but not exclusively. The Network will focus on a broad literary category: Creative Environmental Writing (CEW).\\n \\nPresently, through styles as varied as prose essay, travelogue and poetry, CEW is a highly popular means to represent difficult or complex matters of living with environmental change, and at the same time recall longer traditions of natural history and country writing. CEW is of interest to researchers in Geography, and English Literature, not only for its appealing qualities of language and voice, but for its potential to energise, and politicise, a wider public readership concerned by environmental issues. CEW will be examined for its potential to inspire, to communicate and to prompt diverse forms of environmental action and social engagement in society, in the context of contemporary environmental change. As such, Network activities will use CEW to investigate precisely what communities and individuals value, why they value it, how they value it, and how values are defined, identified and transmitted.\\n \\nStyled as a 'Conversation on Environmental Change' the series of three day-long events will be structured around a single theme, and are arranged to develop progressively: \\nEvent 1: Environmental Writing as Inspiration\\nEvent 2: Environmental Writing as Communication\\nEvent 3: Environmental Writing as Action\\nEach Conversation on Environmental Change will be contributed to by a diverse range of participants, chosen specifically to represent different academic and non-academic research communities, creative environmental writers, environmental artists, policy-makers and politicians, the general public readership, and relevant sector interests, heritage interests, social movements and civic coalitions. Funds will be made available in support of travel and accommodation, normally for participants based within the UK. \\n\\nConversations will pivot on a range of questions, including: How are habitats, ecosystems and scales of environmental change represented and made affective? What are the limits of CEW as inspiration for change? How do different genres of CEW drive creative environmental endeavour and action, and for whom? What kinds of environmental writers are upheld as authoritative voices, and why? What kinds of environmental action are produced by what kinds of CEW? And, is CEW only read by the already active and concerned?\\n\\nThe Conversations series will be organised by academic staff from the Departments of Geographical and Earth Sciences and English Literature, University of Glasgow, and hosted at three attractive university venues: Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Environment, Loch Lomond; the Hunterian Museum; the Department of Geographical and Earth Sciences. \\n\\nNetwork activities will place a clear and consistent emphasis on the generation of critical and inclusive Conversation. A novel format has been designed for this purpose: each day-event will be organised around four set-piece Conversations. Accordingly, a representative Network Members Group will be assembled in advance of Events 1, 2 and 3 and, working collaboratively with the Network Organisers, these individuals will take responsibility for the devising and collating of questions to be asked of four identified Conversationalists at the day-events. This will extend Network dialogue beyond set-piece events.\\n\\nThe research outputs of the Network will be:\\n- three interlinked 'Conversations on Environmental Change' \\n- an interactive Network website, containing a discussion forum - an edited book comprised of essays, conversations and interviews.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039309/1","grantId":"AH/H039309/1","fundValue":"24414","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Project findings/report on activities continue to be accessible through the website:\nhttp://www.valuesofenvironmentalwriting.co.uk/ Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Hayden  Lorimer","coPersons":["Rhian  Williams","Alex  Benchimol"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
