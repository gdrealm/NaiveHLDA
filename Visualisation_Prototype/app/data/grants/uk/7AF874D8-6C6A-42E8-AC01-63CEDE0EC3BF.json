{"id":"7AF874D8-6C6A-42E8-AC01-63CEDE0EC3BF","title":"Defects in invariant NKT cell function in lysosomal storage disorders","abstractText":"We are interested in a family of rare diseases called lysosmal storage disorders in which fatty molecules (lipids) build up over time, within cells in a specialised part of the cell called a lysosome. The lysosome is the waste disposal and recycling centre of the cell. These diseases tend to affect babies and young children and the main organ affected is the brain. In many ways these diseases can be considered as the childhod equivalent of Alzheimers disease combined with severe physical impairment. \nWe have found that in these storage diseases there is a gradual loss of a very specialised cell type of the immune system that plays an important role in regulating the bodies response to infection. These cells are called iNKT cells. This study aims to try and understand why these rare diseases cause the partial loss of this specific cell type and how this type of cell may be involved in these rare diseases. For example, we want to find out whether these cells enter the brain and contribute to the disease process leading to the severe neurological symptoms charactersitic of these diseases. We also aim to better understand how the fatty molceules recognised by iNKT cells move within the cell in healthy cells and cells storing lipids in the lysosomal diseases. These studies will give us unique insights into the normal biology of iNKT cells and the lipids they recognise so will be of fundamental importance as well as offering insights into storage disease pathology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700851","grantId":"G0700851","fundValue":"359204","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Platt","coPersons":["Vincenzo  Cerundolo"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
