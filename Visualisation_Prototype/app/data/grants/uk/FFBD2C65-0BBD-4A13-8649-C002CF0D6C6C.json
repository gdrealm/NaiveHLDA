Another way to prevent disease is to block infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) types that can lead, usually after many years, to the development of cervical cancer. Vaccines are available that protect women from two of the most common types of HPV which should lead to a reduction of about 70% of cervical cancers. However, as there are other HPV types that also cause cervical cancer it will be necessary to maintain the cervical cancer screening programme, a significant recurrent investment by the NHS, to protect the UK population from this devastating disease. In this study, we will examine the antibodies produced by animals and humans in response to HPV immunisation and work out how effective the vaccines are against other types of HPV. This information will be used to map the relationships between HPV types and help predict what will happen to each HPV type when the population is vaccinated. We will also use this model to describe potential gaps in protection that can be filled by the next generation of vaccines. This information may also help to target limited NHS resources to those individuals who may not be sufficiently protected by vaccination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701217","grantId":"G0701217","fundValue":"596909","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Beddows","coPersons":["Kate  Soldan","Mark  Jit","Elizabeth  Miller","Dianna  Wilkinson","Morag  Ferguson","Stephen  Inglis","John  Parry"],"organisation":"Public Health England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
