This figure is likely to increase over the coming decades as the population is expected to increase by 2.5 billion to reach 9 billion by 2050. Consequently, one of our biggest challenges will be to meet a growing demand for food, especially in the developing world. Animal diseases have a major impact on the productivity of the livestock industry and safeguarding animal welfare will be a major component of maximising food production. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. The World Organisation for Animal Health lists FMD as one of the most economically important viral diseases of livestock and a major threat to global food security. FMD is endemic in many regions of the world and in 2010, large outbreaks have occurred in South Korea and Japan. Future incursions into Europe and the UK will undoubtedly occur with the potential to inflict substantial economic losses. Methods to control FMD are limited to vaccination and slaughter. The effectiveness of the current vaccines are limited by a number of factors and an urgent need to develop new control measures (improved vaccines, anti-viral reagents and diagnostic tests) is highly desirable as such developments could reduce the incidence of FMD and have enormous economic and social value worldwide. However, the development of novel treatments for FMD virus (FMDV) will require a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between the virus and its host. \n\nFMDV dramatically alters the internal membranes of infected cells to form membrane-bound vesicles that provide specialised sites for formation of a viral replication complex and hence, replication of the viral genome. However, little is known of the mechanisms that generate these vesicles or the properties that make them favourable for replication. Our preliminary results suggest that the vesicles used for FMDV replication are generated by exploiting the normal cellular processes that form secretory transport-vesicles at specialised sites on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called ER exit sites. In this proposal, we plan to investigate how FMDV diverts ER exit sites to supply membrane vesicles for virus replication. We will also attempt to identify the unique properties of the virus-induced vesicles that promote virus replication. We will carry out a series of interlinked experiments that investigate the interactions of FMDV with ER exit sites. We will define the viral components of the replication complex and determine which ER exit site components are also present. We will also determine the role in FMDV infection of key proteins that normally regulate ER exit site function by depleting them from cells prior to infection. Furthermore, it is an intriguing possibility that FMDV concentrates its own proteins onto membranes by mimicking the normal cellular mechanisms that target secretory proteins to ER exit sites. We will investigate this possibility by looking for direct interactions between viral proteins and ER exit site components. We have also identified potential signals for ER exit site targeting in the viral enzyme that catalyses replication of the viral genome and these will be investigated as potential membrane targeting sequences. \n\nThis work is an exciting area for study, as the results will give novel insight into how FMDV interacts with its host-cell to achieve its replication. Analysis of this critical stage of the viral replication cycle may result in the discovery of novel antiviral approaches to control FMD. In the longer term, this could make a difference by reducing the overall, worldwide incidence of FMD. Furthermore, the impact of our studies will not be limited to FMDV as the results will have a wider significance providing underpinning knowledge for studies with similar viruses that infect humans such as poliovirus, coxsackieviruses and human rhinovirus","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J005479/1","grantId":"BB/J005479/1","fundValue":"469457","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have added important understanding to FMDV replication and have led to follow-on studies on the role of cellular membranes in FMDV replication.
