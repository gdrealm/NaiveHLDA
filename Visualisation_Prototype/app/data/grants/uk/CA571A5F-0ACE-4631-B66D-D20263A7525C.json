{"id":"CA571A5F-0ACE-4631-B66D-D20263A7525C","title":"Glyconanoparticle-based Synthetic Carbohydrate Anticancer Vaccines","abstractText":"Many cancers are associated with the over-expression of sugar molecules on the surface of cancer cells, which provides scientists with the possibility of creating vaccines against these cancers. However, the sugars themselves do not lead to the production of the required antibodies - they require assistance from other molecules (peptides) that will stimulate the immune system. In this work, we will prepare very small (10,000 times less than the diameter of a human hair) gold particles that will carry many copies of i) sugar molecules known to be associated with certain cancers and ii) peptides to stimulate the immune system. This will be achieved by first of all making the correct sugar molecules, modifiying them to make them able to be converted into polymers (long chain molecules that have many copies of the sugar attached to the chain), then making the required polymers. The method of making the polymers produces chains with one ?sticky end?, which will allow them to be attached easily to the surface of the gold particles. At the same time, we will attach to the particle surface the correct peptides molecules, producing the particles loaded with the necessary components. We expect that this will result in a simple method of producing materials that act as effective anti-cancer vaccines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700080","grantId":"G0700080","fundValue":"293667","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2010-01-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Cameron","coPersons":["Benjamin  Davis"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
