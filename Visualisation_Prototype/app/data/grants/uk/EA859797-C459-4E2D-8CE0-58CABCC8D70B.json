Frequently affecting a relatively younger age group compared with other dementias they collectively constitute a major socio-economic and human burden. FTLD commonly runs in families with many patients having a particular genetic mutation as the cause of their disease. The heritable nature of FTLD amplifies the human cost of these diseases but also creates a unique opportunity for making an earlier diagnosis and intervening at an early stage of disease. The understanding of FTLD has hugely advanced in recent years but this has yet to lead to any effective disease-modifying therapies. It is likely that any further progress towards this goal will depend on collaboration between specialist centres. The GENetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI) aims to unite the expertise and resources of five internationally recognised research departments in the field. The objective of GENFI will be to set up a multi-national consortium with a common platform for the assessment of genetic FTLD patients. Clinical, behavioural, brain imaging, spinal fluid and blood sample data will be collected with the aim of developing markers of the onset and progression of disease in FTLD. Ultimately, the study will explore the feasibility of using the common framework developed here to support future large-scale studies of FTLD, in particular the development of clinical trials of disease-modifying interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J009482/1","grantId":"MR/J009482/1","fundValue":"211669","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Neil Rossor","coPersons":["Peter  Nestor","Jason  Warren","Jonathan Daniel  Rohrer","James  Rowe","Nick Charles Fox","Sebastien  Ourselin"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
