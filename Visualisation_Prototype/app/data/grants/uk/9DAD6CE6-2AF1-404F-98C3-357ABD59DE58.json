In other words, the themes and dynamics of desistance identified in this research are likely to be distinct from the risk factors that are well known in the research literature.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This contribution would have obvious and direct benefits for the development of theory and therapeutic work aimed at supporting desistance among those convicted of previous sexual offences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006061/1","grantId":"ES/K006061/1","fundValue":"182509","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have not been used at the time of reporting - data analysis has just been completed and we are 15 months in to a 40 month research project.
