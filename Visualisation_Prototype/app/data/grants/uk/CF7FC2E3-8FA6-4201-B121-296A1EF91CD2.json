{"id":"CF7FC2E3-8FA6-4201-B121-296A1EF91CD2","title":"High-Performance Portable Isotope Identification","abstractText":"Hand-held radiation sensors are of high value to a wide range of industry and areas such as homeland security. Key requirements for such sensors are high energy resolution and good bulk efficiency. Conventionally, it is difficult to achieve both with the same device. Semiconductor detectors like CZT have high resolution but small volume, hence, low efficiency, while scintillator detectors have high efficiency but much poorer energy resolution. \n\nWe have developed a scintillator-based hand-held radiation sensor product with Kromek, a UK-based company, as part of a short KTP project. This project aims to substantially improve the performance of this product by exploring next-generation scintillator materials and novel photosensors. This will allow Kromek to stay ahead of the market and develop new products.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M000044/1","grantId":"ST/M000044/1","fundValue":"113762","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  We are working with Kromek PLC based in Sedgefield, Co.
