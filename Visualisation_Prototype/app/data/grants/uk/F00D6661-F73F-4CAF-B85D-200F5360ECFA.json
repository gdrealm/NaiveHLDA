{"id":"F00D6661-F73F-4CAF-B85D-200F5360ECFA","title":"Magnetic Resonance Guided Therapy of Cardiac Arhythmia ( MaRGiTA)","abstractText":"This project will develop novel devices and imaging technology for minimal-invasive treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, a major healthcare problem affecting 5.3% of the UK population. Currently diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmia is performed under X-ray guidance. This imaging modality offers no 3D information and no soft tissue contrast, the procedure takes several hours, resulting in significant radiation exposure to patient and medical staff. This project will develop the first Magnetic Resonance (MR) guided arrhythmia therapy procedure using a novel catheter device. The new procedure will avoid radiation dose completely. Furthermore, non-invasive MR-techniques will also be developed as a biomarker of the arrhythmia treatment. The project will be performed in three phases.Phase 1. Prototyping: In the first phase catheter prototypes and MR-tracking techniques will be developed. In parallel, MR-techniques to image and quantify ablation lesions will be developed and tested with lesions made by standard ablation catheters under X-ray and subsequent evaluation under MR in our X-MR facilities. Phase 2. Preclinical Test: During the second phase catheter prototypes and MR ablation lesion imaging will be optimized and tested in a preclinical model.Phase 3. Clinical Feasibility. During the third phase clinical catheter prototypes will be developed and after obtaining regulatory approval, these will be tested in a limited number of patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G002142/1","grantId":"TS/G002142/1","fundValue":"493428","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tobias Richard  Schaeffter","coPersons":["Reza Sarvghad  Razavi"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
