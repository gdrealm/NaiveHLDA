{"id":"354241A9-EE45-4312-8B72-2BDFCFF2BF26","title":"Translating Tales of the Trickster","abstractText":"The research will create an open space for creative and critical discussion of the ways in which trickster folklores are being translated, written, performed and lived within contemporary cultures. We will consider how trickster folklore is being translated into new forms of fiction and will explore how trickster narratives are lived and performed in everyday life \n\nThe main vehicle for research will be a network of academic, creative and public partnerships that will respond to the theme &quot;Translating Tales of the Trickster&quot; through a series of micro fictions, performances and papers that are intended to stimulate debate across disciplines and contexts. The network will explore the feasibility of creating a digital archive of established and emerging trickster tales.\n\nThe mythical trickster character often possesses magical abilities and may transform his/her/its own identity and that of any surrounding people or environment. A core characteristic is that she/he/it is never as first appears. S/he is the friend who turns out to be an opponent, the witch who helps the hero return home or the lover disguised as a monster. In folklore, the trickster appears in the guise of a fool, a hag, a fox, a hare and a coyote. In modern fiction, the trickster is the false-love in romance stories or the criminal in detective stories. Finally, in contemporary contexts of new writing and performance, the trickster steps out of a magical circle of fiction to perform actions that have consequences in the physical world.\n\nThe rational for the proposed network is to engage with the, as yet, unexplored opportunities to develop a new body of research into the continuing translations of trickster mythology across new cultures of writing, performance and lived experience.\n\nIn order to stimulate ideas, we will be holding two workshops: the first will focus on traditional folklore and the second will introduce new examples of trickster narratives. In the latter workshop, we will explore the use of performance and creative writing as means with which to feedback research findings to relevant stakeholders groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J01267X/1","grantId":"AH/J01267X/1","fundValue":"23901","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-08-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research took place over six months, beginning and ending with interdisciplinary workshops. Soyinka curated a series of Trickster performances (including new works produced through the research) and collaborated with artists to create Trickster visualisations. To share and progressively focus research insights, she presented these resources within workshops and through a prototype, online archive. \n\nTranslating Tales of the Trickster was disseminated through a range of cultural and creative institutions, including The Pervasive Media Studio, the Tobacco Factory, The George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling and Beyond the Border International Storytelling Festival. The online archive reached international audiences and research findings were presented in a keynote speech at an international conference at the University of Maine in 2013.\n\nThe knowledge created through this project has been used to develop workshops within schools and as stimulus for Anti-Bullying workshops in community centres. See, for example, &quot;As Good as You Give&quot; a performance and workshop that brings awareness to the problem of bullying in the community. \n\nThe Trickster Tales Archive, in addition, influenced the development of Book Kernel. Book Kernel is a system and service for recording live events and translations. It has been used by major national and international organisations including The Guardian and the British Council.

The process of interdisciplinary dialogue around this theme highlighted significant differences between the social-cultural function of Trickster within oral storytelling sub-cultures and mainstream cultures. In oral storytelling circles, Trickster is represented as a complex, poetic and ambiguous character. His social function, beyond the story, is to encourage audiences to explore moral thresholds and to consider values and limits to disruptive action. In mainstream culture, Trickster is most typically represented as a one-dimensional psychopath. The contemporary focus of Trickster as a criminal &quot;passing&quot; for someone else may relate to our dominant networked culture of appearances, in which it is increasingly difficult to separate a &quot;real&quot; person from their online identity/ image. More generally, Trickster appears to hold salience within times of strain, trauma and socio-economic transformation.
