However, the body itself is rarely in central focus either as the subject or the object of experience.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar stems from the conviction of a group of UK psychology researchers that the body is not just an irrelevant backcloth to other psychological functions, but is an essential foundation of many higher cognitive functions, and of our sense of self and identity. The seminar will explore theoretical perspectives on how the basic sensory, motor and integrative mental functions related to the body underpin mental life, and establish continuity of the self through time.</p>\n\n<p>UK psychology is a healthily broad discipline. The body provides an important unifying concept across psychology generally. The mental representations of the body therefore perform important theoretical work, ranging from highlighting the relation between the self and the other in social situations, to providing a basic neurobiological mechanism related to self-consciousness.&nbsp; Few concepts in psychology could be as fundamental, and yet be taken for granted by so much psychological research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4332","grantId":"RES-451-25-4332","fundValue":"13616","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Haggard","coPersons":["Ellen  Poliakoff","Charles  Spence","Stephen  Jackson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
