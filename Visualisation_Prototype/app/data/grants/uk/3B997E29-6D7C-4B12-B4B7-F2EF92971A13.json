{"id":"3B997E29-6D7C-4B12-B4B7-F2EF92971A13","title":"A Quarter Century of Change At the Workplace","abstractText":"<p>This project examines the key changes in British employment relations between 1980 and 2004 using, inter alia, the five Workplace Industrial/Employment Relations Surveys (WERS). These contain many questions that span the whole period, panel surveys that link each of the cross-sections and, for the two most recent surveys, data collected from samples of workers at each workplace. A particularly interesting feature is the timing of the last two surveys, which allows a direct comparison of the impact of the Thatcher/Major Conservative administrations of the period 1979 to 1997 and the Blair Labour administration from 1997 to 2004.</p> \n<p>Each of the chapters will be co-authored by one of the projectâ€™s investigators and an expert in the subject-area concerned. Dissemination will be via a monograph published by a leading international publisher, and an accompanying conference.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1603","grantId":"RES-000-23-1603","fundValue":"143204","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Whitfield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
