The ever-increasing convergence in form between film, broadcast and computer games mean that audiences can simultaneously and seamlessly engage with all three on multiple devices. Although there is some reuse of resources and content across these domains (for example the CGI that is generated in films can then be used by the games industry), single-media IP frameworks and licensing strategies have remained largely in-place, which has restricted the wider sharing of the rich materials generated by these industries with their audiences, other practitioners, researchers and educationalists in this new and converged landscape.\n\nThis shifting context requires a convergence in thinking about how to manage and protect IP to facilitate cross-media sharing, access, use and reuse. The problem is compounded by the fact that the complexities of digital audiovisual content are at such a level, that potentially every frame of film, video or CGI, individual element of a set, phrase of a script or CGI character, could potentially have a different set of licensing and IP issues attributed to it. In current and emerging digital asset management technologies, such legal, contractual and rights data can be generated within the production cycle and recorded within the metadata that accompanies each piece of content, but access to this by external stakeholders is limited; contractual rights, privacy, legal implications are all hidden from view, and there is a lack of transparency and clarity around how such materials can be discovered, accessed, used and reused by different audience constituencies.\n\nThe TRI-PACT project draws together a group of key stakeholders (practitioners, researchers, educationalists and industry partners) to rethink and re-imagine current IP structures within Film, Broadcast and Games production toward a new enabling model of IP management and protection that facilitates cross-media sharing, access, use and reuse. Each domain has its own unique set of challenges, with divergent practices and structures whilst also sharing many commonalities. By bringing together key representatives of these three fields, the project will facilitate knowledge exchange, evolve shared understandings of IP, develop requirements case studies through cross-domain dialogue and explore novel approaches to IP management, through technical sketches which extend current and emerging digital asset management technologies to incorporate explicit, detailed modelling of IP. \n\nThe key deliverables from the project will be a set of guidelines to support stakeholders wishing to engage with the approach in their IP management practice and a shared roadmap towards more substantive professional and technical integration and support, augmented by the case studies and associate technical sketches to provide a more detailed exposition of the main principles of the approach.\n\nTRI-PACT directly benefits from the work of the AHRC-funded cross-disciplinary 'Deep Film Access Project' (DFAP), which explores how digital assets and associated metadata can be mapped, organized and interlinked to enable richer and enhanced appreciation and understandings of the materials generated by film production and its concomitant work processes. TRI-PACT partners include researchers working internationally across Film, Broadcast and Game with a specific interest in IP. Commercial and cultural partners from Film, Broadcast and Games include BFI, BBC and UKIE","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M010481/1","grantId":"AH/M010481/1","fundValue":"39586","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Atkinson","coPersons":["Roger  Evans","Helen Wendy Kennedy"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
