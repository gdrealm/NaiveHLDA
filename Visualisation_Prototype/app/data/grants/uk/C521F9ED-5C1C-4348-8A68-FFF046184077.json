{"id":"C521F9ED-5C1C-4348-8A68-FFF046184077","title":"Using a synthetic biology approach to engineer urban water system biofilms","abstractText":"&quot;Synthetic biology aims to design and engineer biologically based parts, novel devices and systems as well as redesigning existing, natural biological systems&quot; (The Royal Academy of Engineering (2009) Synthetic Biology: scope, applications and implications. ISBN:1-903496-44-6). This exciting and emerging technology is largely directed at providing solutions for challenges within the manufacturing, healthcare and energy sectors. Synthetic biology offers exciting and new possibilities that have the potential to transform the water industry by offering new biologically based solutions to address global water challenges. However little attention has been directed at developing synthetic biology solutions to address urban water systems challenges such as increased performance, enhanced water quality and energy saving. Current synthetic biology activities in the water arena tend to address specific research challenges (e.g. biosensors, biodesalination, microbial fuel cells) and are yet to be translated to application beyond the laboratory scale. What is missing is a demonstrated synthetic biology led solution that not only addresses the technical challenges of deploying such a solution within the urban water environment, but also engages the appropriate stakeholders to address and debate concerns over governance, acceptability and risk. The bright IDEA is to provide such an example. Here, a synthetic biology approach is used to design and engineer urban water system biofilms, transforming their current negative image into a positive resource. More specifically, an engineered biofilm will be designed and tested to reduce frictional losses and repair wall defects to increase hydraulic capacity and reduce in/ex filtration within sewers. This will be achieved within a controlled urban water environment at different engineering scales. As well as addressing the technical challenges of engineering biofilms with desired characteristics, within a complex environment, the social issues and implications will also be discussed through various stakeholder engagements and a focused workshop. This project will therefore provide a synthetic biology led solution for increasing performance within sewer networks, and provide the basis to investigate the translation and implementation challenges for deploying the solution within the urban water environment. This project will also provide the foundation for UK based research centre focused on urban water challenges that ensures effective engagement and communication with the appropriate stakeholders to set the research priorities and deliver synthetic biology solutions both now and in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M017680/1","grantId":"EP/M017680/1","fundValue":"246458","fundStart":"2015-01-31","fundEnd":"2017-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Anne Biggs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
