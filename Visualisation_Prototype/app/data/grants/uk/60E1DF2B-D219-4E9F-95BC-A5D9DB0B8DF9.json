The structures are produced in the form of a series of thin nanoscale layers, the thickness of which can be controlled to within just a few atoms. Such structures offer new physical effects related to their small dimensions which enable the invention of a wide range of devices such as lasers for optical fibre telecommunications, precise drug delivery and pollution control. Other devices made from these structures can detect a wide range of optical wavelengths for imaging systems and form efficient solar cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D505712/1","grantId":"EP/D505712/1","fundValue":"4612330","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter A.
