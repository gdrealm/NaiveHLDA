{"id":"7B411237-58F5-4095-A5EB-4EB27034DFD2","title":"Managing Medical Performance: a pilot study to investigate the impact of surgical performance upon clinicians and managers","abstractText":"The publication of clinical performance data aims to increase accountability of the medical profession and to respond to rising patient expectations. Its impacts may be felt within clinical teams, organizations and the regulatory health-care regime but such effects may be highly variable and contradictory. Published performance data pose conceptual questions relating to the nature of professions and organisational change, especially organisational culture, socialisation of doctors and professional-managerial relations.\n<br />\n<br />The study will examine the motives, meanings and impacts of different interpretations of performance and mechanisms to improve performance. This project will undertake a pilot study to investigate the nascent impacts of the publication of performance data relating to cardiac surgery upon stakeholders at micro, meso and macro levels. Qualitative methods will include interviews and observational data (of clinical teams and organization practices). Fieldwork will be conducted at St. George's Hospital Trust (SGHT), one of the leading hospitals in publishing performance data in the UK. This study represents a unique opportunity to examine, in collaboration with the NHS Trust, the evolution and impact of a major initiative which will have wider practical and theoretical implications across clinical and managerial domains\n<br />\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003889/1","grantId":"ES/F003889/1","fundValue":"73029","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Exworthy","coPersons":["Ian Rees Jones","Jonathan  Gabe"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
