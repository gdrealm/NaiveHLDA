The aim of this new project is to gain a detailed understanding of how the arrival of a new baby affects womenâ€™s productivity and how family planning and other reproductive health services can help women returning to good health and work.</p>\n\n<p>This multi-disciplinary project includes three sub-studies.</p>\n\n<p>Sub-study A is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected in Burkina Faso from 2001-2006.</p>\n\n<p>Sub-study B is a cohort study of women identified in the community during pregnancy and the first trimester after childbirth. Over a period of nine months, women will be interviewed three times about their health, preparations they made for childbirth and the period after childbirth, changes in paid work (or education) and domestic work, fertility intention and contraceptive needs. Interviewers will measure women's blood pressure and whether they have anaemia.</p>\n\n<p>In sub-study C, qualitative methods will document how women and their family make decisions on work, childbirth and family planning. Sub-study C will re-interview a sub-sample of cohort women, observe some of them in their daily activities, and interview men, policy makers as well as health care providers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011049/1","grantId":"ES/K011049/1","fundValue":"292513","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Veronique  Filippi","coPersons":["Katerini Tagmatarchi Storeng","Maurice  Yaogo","Jenny  Cresswell","Timothy  Powell Jackson"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
