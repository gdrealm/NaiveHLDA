The Siberian region in particular is experiencing one of the largest warming trends on Earth. The Eurasian Arctic, containing one of the largest carbon reservoirs on the globe trapped by permafrost, might therefore be at risk. Amplified warming could cause a general reduction of the total volume of permafrost causing the remobilization of large amounts of this trapped carbon. It is presently unclear to what extent this remobilization is already happening and what will happen to this carbon after it is transported off the permafrost areas to the Eurasian Arctic Shelf (EAS). This area is also known to contain vast amounts of methane trapped in submerged permafrost and not much is known about the effects of a warming climate on the release and subsequent microbiological cycling of this potent greenhouse gas. As stated by Prof. Chris Rapley, on the NERC website 'the polar regions are an integral part of the machinery of this planet' meaning that changes in the Arctic region have potential feedbacks to the entire global carbon-climate system. Therefore if we want to understand the effects of climate warming on the global carbon cycle we must understand the processes occurring in the Arctic region, making the EAS a highly important area for research. However, this is an understudied region, mostly due to limited access to non-Russian scientists, and research is currently limited by the availability of good representative samples from this region. \n\nIn the summer of 2008, state of the art sampling of both sediments and the overlying water column was performed during the ISSS-08 expedition along the entire EAS seaboard as well as over detailed cross-shelf transects, both off Russian Arctic Rivers and areas of extensive coastal erosion. This also included areas with high methane concentrations in the water column. The PI participated in the cruise in collaboration with a group of internationally renowned scientists from Sweden, Russia, the UK and the USA.\n \nWe will use the sediments collected for this internationally competitive research program to study (1) the fate of the vast amounts of terrestrial carbon currently liberated from the Russian Arctic tundra/taiga areas, and transported to Arctic shelf regions by the Russian Arctic rivers and through coastal erosions and (2) the effects of climate warming on the remobilization and degradation, of this material on the EAS, ultimately to the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and also methane, which is already being released from melting submerged permafrost. \n\nIn this project we are collaborating with a Pan-Arctic group of researchers. The contribution from the UK group, lead by the University of Manchester, will focus on the testing of hypotheses associated with the (climate induced) remobilization and degradation of the macromolecular part of the terrestrial carbon, such as polysaccharides and polypeptides. We will analyse the composition and age (using compound specific radiocarbon dating) of this macromolecular material allowing us to determine the reservoir/residence time and to what extent (part of) this carbon is microbiolically degraded on transport. We will also, lead by Newcastle University, investigate the significance (the source, transport and fate) of organic material produced or recycled by microorganisms, including the greenhouse gas methane. \n\nIn addition to using the obtained data to test our own specific hypothesis, we will also combine the results of these analyses with those of the other Pan-Arctic partners to deliver an improved terrestrial organic carbon budget for the EAS. Finally the samples will also form the bases for future research proposals/collaborations with an international network of scientists working at the forefront of Arctic research, ultimately leading to many new interdisciplinary research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I027967/1","grantId":"NE/I027967/1","fundValue":"158827","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings have been used in a public display aimed at the general public at the Manchester Museum.

These have been extracted and analysed for their microbial biomarker composition, glycerol dialkyl glycerol dialkyl tetraether lipids (GDGTs) and bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs).\n\n\n\nInitial analyses revealed differences in the distribution and composition of the BHPs throughout the Bour-Khaya Bay and the East Siberian Shelf. Characteristic BHPs indicate significant amounts of microbial derived terrestrial soil organic matter throughout the Bour-Khaya Bay. This suggests a stronger preservation of these soil derived BHPs in the bay, when compared to the abundance of soil derived GDGTs. \nInitial work also highlighted the need for a better understanding of the signatures contained in terrestrial endmember materials (soils/peat/permafrost/lake sediments). Whilst these investigations are ongoing, initial results suggests permafrost BHP signatures comprise a highly unusual fingerprint which can be traced into the Arctic Ocean. The effects of climate warming in the Arctic region may have a direct effect on the global carbon cycle and ultimately on global society. Therefore many different groups will benefit from the outcomes of our research including politicians and policy makers dealing with sensitive areas such as carbon dioxide emission rights. This is a highly topical subject of great interest to the general public; hence our research will be of widespread appeal. Consequently, some of our targets will primarily be aimed at the general public with an interest in the Arctic region and/or the effects of climate change.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that (specific) end-users have the opportunity to benefit from our research we use a variety of mechanisms including press releases, websites and participation in public events. We maintain a high profile of our work by presentations at national and international conferences and by publishing in high quality peer-reviewed journals. We will also archive our results and make sure that results can be widely and transparently accessed. \n Research on the large amounts of terrestrial organic carbon currently being remobilized from the Russian Arctic tundra/taiga areas and transported to the Eurasian Arctic Shelf is critical to our understanding of both the biogeochemical fate of this material and the effects of climate warming on the remobilization/release and degradation/microbiological cycling of this material in the Eurasian Arctic region. In turn, these processes have potential implications for the entire global carbon-climate system. \n\n\n\nThose interested in (Arctic) climate change will benefit from this research via a better understanding of the impacts of warming climate on the redistribution and degradation of ‘old’ carbon that was frozen in time in the Eurasian Arctic region for thousands of years. Scientist modelling the effects of global climate warming in the Arctic or the global carbon cycle in general will particularly benefit. Our UK based research is linked to a high profile research program where we collaborate with Swedish-Russian-British-American-Swiss based scientists. The data sets we generate will be combined with those of the pan-arctic consortium and when combined these data will, even by first-order interpretations, significantly increase our understanding of terrestrial organic carbon processing in the Eurasian Arctic region.\n\n\n\nThe outcomes of our work will also be of significant interest to scientists interested in processes and consequences of land-ocean interaction in other areas of the globe. Formation, erosion and subsequent export of soil organic matter to the ocean along with ambient vegetation debris and continental nutrients is a key element of global biogeochemical cycles that ultimately controls e.g. shallow marine organic productivity and benthic life. For obvious reasons, these processes are not restricted to any specific location or time period but are important to understand and improve prediction of future conditions.
