{"id":"C5AE00A5-86EE-45B6-A2AE-1B918012743B","title":"Open image informatics software for biological microscopy","abstractText":"Biological microscopy has always required an imaging capability: traditionally, an image of a sample was drawn on paper, or with the advent of light-sensitive film, recorded on media that conveniently allowed reproduction. However, the application of digital detectors to microscopy has converted the biological microscope into a quantitative assay device. The clinical and research applications for digital imaging microscopy are enormous, but these applications generate large amounts of data/a single time-lapse image can easily be 500 Mbytes. Four years ago, we began developing a data management tool for digital biological microscopy. Our project, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME; http://openmicroscopy.org) is now the leading provider of open source image management software for biological microscopy. This proposal seeks funds to support the integration of image data storage technology created by OME with genome sequencing data generated over the last ten years. The genome sequences of humans and many of the organisms used in modern biomedical research are now known and available on the Web (e.g., http://www.fllybase.org). However, there is an increasingly rich set of accessory images showing effects of genetic mutations, gene expression, etc. that should be served by these sites, but no standard data format is available to allow delivery or sharing of this information with or between researchers. We will therefore incorporate the experimental data models built by other projects into the existing OME Data Model that describes the results of an imaging experiment, and develop tools to help scientists record experimental data about an imaging experiment (e.g., kinds of cells, gene mutations) in a single, coherent, shareable format. Finally, as the OME project grows, we have real need for resources for generating user-targeted documentation, FAQ's, etc., as well as managing user and developer questions. Currently, our developers are providing these services, but we have no resources for managing or logging contacts, and ensuring coherent support is provided. This support will go a long way to ensuring the usefulness and dissemination of the OME tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D00151X/1","grantId":"BB/D00151X/1","fundValue":"398637","fundStart":"2006-01-04","fundEnd":"2009-01-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This was the first example of using structured annotations, defined by ontologies available in the Ontology Lookup Service in the OMERO system. This was then translated by Glencoe Software into the CELL Image Library (http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/) which used the underlying annotation technology to annotation several thousand publicly submitted images with terms from a defined set of ontologies.

We have deliberately limited the scope of our work, and especially our data modelling to imaging--essentially, our tools are focussed on everything that occurs AFTER a user sits down at a microscope, and have left the modelling and definition of experimental protocols, reagents, biological systems to others. In this project (BB/D00151/X), we proposed the extension of OME's tools, with the aim of integrating many of the existing tools and specifications from other projects into OME applications, specifically with the aim of integrating experimental definitions like MAGE-ML and specific ontologies into OME applications. This work has been successful, with the development and release of OMERO.editor, a cross-platform Java application that uses defined templates and protocols to capture experimental data, provides an indexed search facility, and serves as a bridge between a user's own customised descriptions and defined data specifications and ontologies. A full description of the use and scope of the EXISTING application is available (http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola/wiki/OmeroEditor) and a demonstration of this application is available as a screencast video (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/videos). OMERO.editor was first released in June 2008 as a standalone application that integrated a user's own definitions and protocols, defined data models (e.g., MAGE-ML, OME-XML, Gel-ML), and any ontology available on OLS (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/). With the release of OMERO-Beta3.1 (Oct 2008), the standalone OMERO.editor has been enhanced to include a smart text parser to convert text protocols into fields in OMERO.editor (and thus parseable and searchable data structures) and CSV importer that enables any spreadsheet file (including tab-delimited MAGE-TAB) to be imported into OMERO.editor (see http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola/wiki/OmeroEditor). Moreover, OMERO.editor files can be uploaded to an OMERO server and indexed using the OMERO.search facility, and viewed within the data management, visualization, and analysis client application, OMERO.insight. OMERO.editor is a standalone experimental metadata application that can be used to store data for many different experiments. Several novel uses in many different areas have been mentioned on our OME Forums.
