In particular, we are interested in the ways in which use of the courts in judicial review proceedings influence the quality of public services and the extent to which public law litigation matters to those delivering services at the local level and to the public.&nbsp; Two principal questions will be explored: </p> \n<ol>\n <li>How, if at all, does the level of public law litigation affect the quality of services provided by local government? <br /></li>\n <li>How, if at all, do decisions of courts affect the quality of public services? </li>\n</ol> \n<p>The research will have three overlapping components. The first will investigate whether there are any significant correlations between the levels of public law litigation against local authorities in England and Wales and key quality indicators such as those compiled by the government.&nbsp; The second will involve a comparative study of three pairs of ‘frequently’ and ‘infrequently’ litigated against local authorities. The third will consist of case studies in these authorities based on significant judicial decisions that might have general implications for quality. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-153-25-0081","grantId":"RES-153-25-0081","fundValue":"119908","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maurice  Sunkin","coPersons":["Lucinda  Platt","Todd  Landman"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
