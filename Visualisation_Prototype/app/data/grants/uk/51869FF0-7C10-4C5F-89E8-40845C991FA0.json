Amongst the most important signals that cells receive are from circulating small proteins called growth factors. These bind to specific proteins, called receptors, that are found on the surface of cells. Binding of growth factors causes the receptors to alter their pattern of interactions with many molecules inside the cell that control cell growth. In this way growth factor receptors act as essential bridges between the cell exterior and interior to stimulate so-called mitogenic responses, which enable cells to grow and divide. In order to prevent these responses continuing endlessly, which would lead to uncontrolled cell division, the growth factor receptor must be sent to an environment where it can no longer communicate with other cellular contents. Ultimately, it is sent to a specialised compartment within the cell, called the lysosome, where it is destroyed. Movement, or trafficking, of the receptor from the cell surface to the lysosome involves the receptor being sequestered into regions of the cell surface membrane that invaginate and pinch off to form spherical packages, or vesicles, within the cell interior. These vesicles first move to and coalesce with an intermediate compartment called the endosome, which is rather like a balloon. Importantly, the growth factor receptors are still active when they reach the endosome. To ensure they are stopped from working, they are enclosed within little vesicles that are forced within the inside of the endosome. This occurs by a process of inward budding, rather like poking deep impressions into a balloon and imagining these could pinch off to form internal packets. This process means that the mitogenic receptors are now completely separated away from the rest of the cell contents and unable to work. The endosome, along with these internal packages, is then sent to the lysosome. The aim of this project is to understand how activated mitogenic receptors, once they reach the endosome, are packaged into the interior of the compartment. The project will focus on identifying the function of a new protein involved in this process, and ask how delivery of new vesicles to the endosome is coupled to the formation of internal vesicles, so the whole process of receptor inactivation works with maximum efficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I012109/1","grantId":"BB/I012109/1","fundValue":"341900","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip George Woodman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" We have identified the function of several cellular proteins, and specifically have found that these proteins mediate the downregulation of mitogenic receptors such as Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFR). When activated, EGFR is transported via the multivesicular body to the lysosome, where it is degraded. Two novel proteins, UBAP1 and LITAF, participate in this process. The findings are published in open access peer reviewed journals and hence can be used by other scientists investigating this key cellular process Other","dataset":"gtr"}
