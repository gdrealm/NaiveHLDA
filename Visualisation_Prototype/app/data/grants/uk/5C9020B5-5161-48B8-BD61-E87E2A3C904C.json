In addition, to prevent rejection, high doses of toxic drugs are used to dampen the immune response. These can not only harm the transplant, but can have lethal side effects on the recipient. \n\nSince it started in October 2007, the Centre has made significant progress towards improving the health of people who need transplants. We have devised ways to make their transplanted organ survive longer. This includes the development of engineered proteins which, when planted in donor kidneys, reduce inflammation and blood clot formation after transplantation. In addition, we have pioneered less harmful, more natural methods to coax the immune system into accepting the transplant, using cells taken from the patient. Remarkably, as a result of monitoring the immune system, we are close to being able to judge which patients can stop taking conventional therapy without rejecting the graft. At the same time, we are developing advanced scanning techniques that will enable physicians to diagnose whether a transplant is inflamed and to offer appropriate treatment. \n\nAs we approach the next five years of development, we shall conduct clinical trials to establish whether these innovations can benefit healthcare as the basic research has promised. Potential benefits include extending the life of the transplant and offering transplantation to more of those in need. We are also supporting new branches of science that make success more likely. \n\nAdvances of this complexity are made possible by bringing together a large workforce of scientists, clinicians and technologists under the same roof. The MRC Centre for Transplantation has created this capability within the UK. It collaborates with the Centre for Medical Law and Ethics at King's College to ensure a high standard of communication and public engagement regarding the regulation and ethics of transplant research. A programme of special events and media coverage will help keep the public and patients informed during innovation. Health economists are also to be part of the Centre to provide the opportunity to make more accurate forecasts about the costs and potential benefits of our research. \n\nFuture success will depend on recruiting and training the brightest minds to deliver this work through the next 5-10 years of development and ensure the research is translated into social and economic benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J006742/1","grantId":"MR/J006742/1","fundValue":"2042050","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven H Sacks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
