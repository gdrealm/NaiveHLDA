{"id":"23D104C7-74BB-41EA-BF1E-3838888447E6","title":"The UK Gemini Support Group","abstractText":"The Gemini Observatory operates twin 8m diameter telescopes on the mountains of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and Cerro Pachon, Chile. These telescopes are used by astronomers in the seven Gemini partner countries. The smooth running of the telescopes is the responsibility of observatory staff based in Chile and Hawaii. However, astronomers from partner countries who use the telescopes need help before they make observations, for instance to decide the best strategy and also after their observations have been taken, when they have to understand their data. Help for UK astronomers is provided by the National Gemini Office (NGO) based in Oxford. As well as helping astronomers, the NGO also manages the process by which astronomers compete for observing time on the telescopes. The Gemini telescopes have a mode of observing called Queue mode. In this mode the astronomer does not go out to the telescope to take her own observations. Instead the observations are put into a queue, and observed by a member of observatory staff when the atmospheric conditions are optimal. This mode has proved very popular and NGO staff are now also required to go out to the telescopes and take Queue mode observations. The requirement from the UK-NGO is to make six visits per year. Another important NGO job is to find out the opinions of UK astronomers on issues such as the future plans for the observatory. The UK position is then represented by NGO staff and other UK astronomers at various meetings. In the next few years the number of complexity of instruments available at the Gemini telescopes will increase. There will also be significant developments in adaptive optics, a technology which reduces the effects of the atmosphere and allows for much sharper images, equivalent to those produced from the space-based Hubble Space Telescope. Plans are already underway for the second generation of instruments, which will not be ready until 2010 at the earliest. The NGO staff will be involved in the planning and consultation required over the next few years, to ensure an exciting future for Gemini.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/C50352X/1","grantId":"PP/C50352X/1","fundValue":"1206220","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick Francis Roche","coPersons":["Isobel Mary  Hook","Roger L Davies"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
