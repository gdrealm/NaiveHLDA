Antibodies are proteins that recognise alien entities in the body and trigger their destruction by immune cells. Antibodies recognising surface proteins (antigens) on cancer cells are now generated in the laboratory, designed to specifically seek out tumours displaying these surface antigens. To work, antibodies must also bind to immune cells, which in turn target those cancer cells. Antibodies come in five types, but only one, IgG, has been used in cancer therapy. Unfortunately, IgG binds relatively poorly to immune cells and works inefficiently in tissues, where tumours grow. Another antibody type, namely IgE, known as the key component of allergies, may be better suited to cancer therapy, because of its excellent binding to immune cells and ability to activate these cells in tissues. Our earlier work on designing IgE antibodies in relation to the therapy of ovarian cancer has already elicited encouraging results that engender optimism and we plan to test this antibody in patients soon.\nWe are now working to apply the same principles towards the treatment of the most lethal skin cancer, malignant melanoma. Melanoma cells are subject to immune scrutiny, that is they display on their surfaces antigens, the targets for an antibody. To investigate this, we produced CSPG4 IgE, an antibody specifically recognising melanoma cancer cells. When we tested this antibody in the laboratory, it was very effective in activating immune cells to destroy cancer. We now plan to complete these studies so that this therapy may benefit patients with malignant melanoma for whom few effective therapies are available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L023091/1","grantId":"MR/L023091/1","fundValue":"977992","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophia N.
