{"id":"5B99FC1E-F498-4C25-82E0-BF603D96EC51","title":"Placode patterning by the anterior neural border and the Wnt signalling pathway","abstractText":"This project aims to identify the key molecules controlling the formation of the nose and adenohypophysis. These organs develop from adjacent discrete ectodermal thickenings called cranial placodes. These placodes are therefore essential for the development of both sensory and neuro-endocrine systems. We have identified a specific cell population located in the very early central nervous system that is crucial for development of the telencephalon (forming the cortex in human). This special signalling cell population also lies adjacent to the precursors of both nose and adeno-hypophysis. We will explore the role of the signalling cell population (and its known secreted molecules) in controlling the development of these placodes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment of both the nose and the hypophysis are not yet understood and this study will bring some novel understanding of these processes. It will also participate to the understanding of human genetic abnormalities affecting the development of olfaction, and hormonal dysfunction due to failure in hypophyseal development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600198","grantId":"G0600198","fundValue":"404632","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Corinne  Houart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
