This work is crucial for understanding how the genetic and developmental mechanisms forming animal body plans changed and diverged over evolutionary time to produce the diverse types of animal body plans we see in nature today. It is also important for understanding how the common ancestor of all animals developed its body plan, deep in evolutionary history, over 550 million years ago.\n Humans, and other vertebrates, possess a segmented body plan: internal parts of our body are divided into separated and repeated structures, for example our vertebrae and ribs. Vertebrate embryos grow during their development, with head structures formed first and the trunk grown in an anterior to posterior sequence. During this process, the cell populations that will later give rise to ribs/vertebrae are determined early, and one-by-one, in an anterior to posterior sequence. This process is controlled by a network of genes that are repeatedly turned on and off to define each group of cells (i.e. each future rib/vertebra). This complex oscillating network of genes is called the vertebrate segmentation clock. \nArthropods, including fruit flies, beetles and spiders, also have a visibly segmented body plan. The abdominal body segments of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum form sequentially, one-by-one, in an anterior to posterior progression during beetle development, in a process similar to that described above for vertebrates. I have recently shown that this developmental process is also controlled by a network of genes that oscillate to sequentially pattern abdominal segments - the arthropod segmentation clock. Interestingly, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has evolved to speed up its development, such that all body segments form simultaneously in the egg in a process that is already well understood at the genetic level by biologists.\nThe first objective of this work programme is to determine whether the gene network underlying the arthropod segmentation clock is organized in a similar way to the vertebrate segmentation clock. If striking similarities are found, it could suggest that the segmentation clock was a feature of the common ancestor of arthropods and vertebrates. Alternatively, if there are striking differences, it could suggest that disparate animal groups have evolved similar genetic mechanisms independently and in parallel. Either way, this research promises to reveal important information about our evolutionary history.\nThe second objective of this work programme is to determine how a sequential segmentation mechanism involving a segmentation clock was modified in evolution to produce the mechanism controlling the simultaneous formation of segments in Drosophila. Identifying the changes in gene regulation that facilitated this transition could reveal general principles by which developmental mechanisms evolved to produce the wide variety of animal body plans we see in nature today.\nThe third objective of this work programme is to develop new genetic techniques that will advance Tribolium castaneum as a cheap, amenable, ethically acceptable, invertebrate model with which to study segmentation clocks. \nThe general public will benefit from this research via an increase in our understanding of human and animal evolution, through the development of a powerful invertebrate genetic model for studying the genetic principles underlying segmentation clocks thus reducing the current dependence on less ethically acceptable vertebrate models, and through better value for money from future research on segmentation clocks via the use of Tribolium, a cheaper and potentially more amenable alternative to vertebrate models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L020092/1","grantId":"BB/L020092/1","fundValue":"359076","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2018-01-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew David Peel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
