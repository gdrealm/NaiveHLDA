{"id":"0F590D4E-E541-4D9C-80B7-93DAC0C51FC1","title":"ProSPECTuS: Preclinical Trials","abstractText":"Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a widely used imaging modality in medicine which uses radio-pharmaceuticals labelled with gamma emitting radioisotopes. Existing SPECT systems have a limiting position resolution of about 10 mm for body imaging and 7 mm for the head. The proposed system will offer an image resolution of 2-3 mm with a sensitivity a factor of ~100 larger than existing systems, while simultaneously enabling SPECT/MRI multimodality imaging. The ProSPECTus imager will open existing markets worth in excess of &pound;300M pa to UK companies, covering medical, pharmaceutical, homeland security, science and defence. The consortium brings an internationally leading reputation and many years experience with semiconductor radiation detectors, electronics and software design. Key clinical input and trials are provided through Clinicians at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology , the University of Liverpool Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis Research Centre [MARIARC] and the Interventional Radiology and Medical Imaging Group at the Royal Liverpool University NHS Trust.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002988/1","grantId":"ST/K002988/1","fundValue":"126995","fundStart":"2013-03-02","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  A new state-of-the art SPECT/MR demonstrator has been realised.
