{"id":"738B8860-5FE8-45FA-A1D6-2FFE9A6EC52D","title":"CDK inhibitors as drugs for trypanosomatid parasitic protozoa","abstractText":"The leishmaniases and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) are predominantly diseases of the developing world. 350 million people are at risk of infection with leishmaniasis in 88 countries worldwide and sleeping sickness threatens over 60 million people in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Within affected countries, the diseases are most prevalent amongst the most impoverished. Existing treatments are inadequate: the most commonly used treatments cannot be taken orally, they cause unpleasant, and sometimes life-threatening, side effects and increasingly are ineffective due to drug resistance. Through our work on the parasites that cause these diseases, we have identified a protein, CRK3, which regulates the parasite?s ability to replicate and is essential for its survival. We want to utilise the expertise of a small drug discovery company, Cyclacel to find compounds that are more potent and specific for the parasite protein. These compounds, which are similar to some of those in development for cancer, will then be tested to determine whether they could be developed as drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400028","grantId":"G0400028","fundValue":"695328","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Charles Mottram","coPersons":["Karen Margaret Grant","Nicholas  Turner","Peter Martin Fischer","Simon  Croft","Malcolm  Walkinshaw"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
