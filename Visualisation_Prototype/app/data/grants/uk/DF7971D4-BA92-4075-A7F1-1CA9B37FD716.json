Two key high-level factors are knowledge of where targets are likely to appear and knowledge of target appearance. Our research investigated how these two sources of information guide search.&nbsp;We collected eye movement data as participants searched scenes in which the objects appeared in expected or unexpected locations. We also varied the type of information participants were provided with before each search: either a picture of their search target or a word naming their search target.&nbsp;We found that both object appearance and likely target location guide search. Following a picture of the target, search is not strongly influenced by where the target is located. Following a word naming the target, we often search the scene region in which we expect to find the object even when it is not there.&nbsp;These findings reveal the visual system's strategy in utilising high-level information to guide search: where we expect to find an object has a key influence, but this influence is greatly diminished if we have detailed knowledge about the precise appearance of the target object.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4098","grantId":"RES-000-22-4098","fundValue":"78164","fundStart":"2011-07-15","fundEnd":"2012-06-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin  Tatler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" Experiment 1 showed that expectations about both target appearance and placement are utilised to guide eye movements from the beginning of scene inspection. In both search initiation and subsequent scanning, the availability of a visual template was particularly useful when the spatial context of the scene was misleading. The availability of a reliable scene context facilitated search mainly when the template was verbal. Therefore, the visual system can utilise target template guidance and context guidance flexibly from the beginning of search, depending upon the amount and the quality of the available information supplied by these high-level sources. Experiment 2 explored the effects of spatial inconsistency in scene search, teasing apart any effect of attentional prioritisation due to inconsistency (context/local information conflict) from the disrupting impact of unreliable expectations. We considered objects that were placed plausibly or implausibly in scenes and how search behaviour relates to the precision of the target template prior to search (verbal/visual). Search for targets in unexpected locations was less efficient during initiation, scanning and verification phases of search than for targets in expected locations. When target objects were incorrectly placed, eyes were directed to the expected region on around 50% of trials following verbal search templates. When the expected region was searched initially, eye movements targeted plausibly- and implausibly-placed distractors equally often. Thus, spatial inconsistency of a distractor object does not result in attentional prioritisation of that object and so does not disrupt search.\n\nThe project has provided key contribution to our understanding of visual search: 1.Both expectations about target appearance and expectations about target placement in scenes are used to guide search form the first eye movement. 2.If precise (visual) target information is known prior to search, object placement within the scene is unimportant. If only imprecise (verbal) information is available, search is disrupted if the target is not where expected. 3.Extrafoveal processing of objects must occur sufficiently to compute their degree of matching with template features in working memory, in order to orient subsequent search. \n\nThe experiments conducted have acted as catalysts for further work in our lab. Three follow up experiments have been run: 1.The role of object colour; comparing search following coloured or greyscale templates. 24 participants tested. 2.The importance of assimilation time after the search template; comparing 100ms/900ms ISIs between template and scene following verbal or visual information . 48 participants tested. 3.Functional specialisation of the hemispheres in search guidance. When targets in scenes are lateralised the hemispheric specialisation for language (LH) or visuospatial information (RH) may result in different search after verbal and visual templates. 24 participants tested. \n\nWe have created the first publicly available online resource containing not only eye movement data and experimental scenes but also ratings of scene complexity and the subjective salience, semantic importance and plausibility of placement for target objects (from 10 individuals). This will be an invaluable resource for researchers studying plausibility of object placement in scenes. Experiment 1 data and images are available at http://www.activevisionlab.org/ Experiment 2 data available on publication of findings. Our work provides new insights into the role of consistency in eye guidance and visual search. This will be of importance to those working in vision research and psychology and will extend our current scientific knowledge. We are the first to demonstrate an effect of inconsistency that is separable from effects of template guidance and spatial expectation guidance in scenes. Our method in experiment 2 provides a means of separating these different influences on eye guidance that has not previously been described or used. This the method and images will be of benefit to the field. \n\nUnderstanding how the eyes are guided to regions in scenes where objects are expected and how inconsistently placed objects capture (or do not capture) attention in scenes has potential wider benefit outside academia. Specifically it may inform understanding of situations in which search for unexpected or misplaced objects is essentially, such as security tasks like CCTV surveillance and baggage screening. In particular if the precision of target knowledge influences the extent to which the eyes are distracted by inconsistency or by spatial expectations about placement, this can be used to refine search protocols in security settings (e.g., providing an image of a search target will help avoid distractions compared to providing a verbal description).
