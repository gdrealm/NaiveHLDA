We have devised a novel strategy to target the topographic distribution of memory T lymphocytes following vaccination. Specifically, we have observed that T cell priming in the presence of tissue-specific factors (particularly chemokines) favors the development of specific T cells with homing preference for the tissue, and therefore seek to fully establish the molecular mechanisms of this novel protocol of immunization and its potential application in clinical settings. Our preliminary studies and the forward experiments proposed will provide the opportunity for new therapeutic vaccination designs in the short-term. Besides its relevance to highly prevalent human gut infections (such as those induced by parasitic infection), this model will pave the way for the application of similar strategies to organ-selective targeting of T cell immunity in a range of diseases, including cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901084","grantId":"G0901084","fundValue":"608072","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Federica M Marelli-Berg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
