{"id":"6CF5CA52-3CFA-4C8E-938F-8A0CEC5E0187","title":"Adhesive mechanisms and dynamic performance in smooth adhesive pads of insects","abstractText":"Many insects are capable of running upside down on a smooth surface, carrying loads and withstanding pull-off forces equivalent to more than 100 times their own body weight. The mechanisms of how this impressive performance is achieved and of how they master the conflicting tasks of running and of making stable adhesive contacts, are still largely unknown. We will investigate surface attachment and locomotion in ants and stick insects, which possess smooth adhesive pads at the tips of their legs. Experiments will be conducted to clarify whether attachment forces are due to 'wet' or dry' adhesion, i.e. whether they are mainly based on the properties of a fluid film between pad and surface or on the direct contact between the adhesive pad cuticle and the substrate. We will investigate whether the fluid secretion enhances adhesion and if so, and under what conditions. Attachment forces of single legs (adhesion and friction) will be measured while simultaneously filming their area of contact with the surface. The physical properties of pad cuticle and secretion will be analysed with modern microscopy techniques, and used to compare pad performance with theoretical predictions. To clarify the mechanism of adhesion and the scaling of forces with body size, we will study how adhesive pads detach from the surface. In general, forces are reduced when pads are detached by peeling. We will investigate whether insects are able to avoid peeling and if so, how they do this. To understand how insects manage to combine surface attachment with locomotion, we will study the movements of legs and adhesive pads during attachment and detachment. By analysing high-speed recordings of running insects, we will explore how running is influenced by surface attachment and how insects adjust their legs and feet to cope with different attachment conditions. Our project will clarify how insects adhere to surfaces and how they manage to control attachment forces. Even though numerous potential applications exist, no controllable technical adhesives have yet been developed. Understanding the mechanisms of how insects elegantly control attachment is likely to lead to the discovery of general principles useful for the design of novel 'biomimetic' adhesives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004156/1","grantId":"BB/E004156/1","fundValue":"501304","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used by other researchers, and have led to the development of biomimetic adhesives, and to the development of insecticide-free substrates that are insect-repellent.

Investigating the role of pad secretion for attachment, we showed that accumulation of secretion resulted in a loss of friction and adhesion on smooth substrates, but increased forces on rough substrates. Thus, the fluid does not generally increase attachment but does so only on rough substrates, where it helps to maximize contact area. Adhesive pads generated considerable static friction even when secretion had accumulated. Analysis of footprint volumes deposited during repeated press-downs showed that smooth pads secrete fluid into a storage volume, which is depleted exponentially over consecutive steps. Re-analysis of the fluid film between cuticle and substrate using interference reflection microscopy revealed that a thin epicuticular layer modifies the interference pattern, resulting in a reduced estimate of the fluid film's thickness of 0-50 nm. This suggests that direct cuticle-substrate contacts are possible. Dry contacts are also supported by our finding that pads produced different attachment forces on substrates of varying surface energy, unexplained by the variation of the fluid's contact angle. We demonstrated that the two-phasic nature of insect adhesive fluid provides a mechanism to increase friction and prevent insects from slipping. By manipulating adhesive secretion in vivo using water-absorbing polymer substrates, we found that friction forces were significantly smaller once the watery phase had been removed. Our finding has revealed a new principle for insect-repellent coatings, which are more durable and environment-friendly than existing coatings. To analyse the mode of pad detachment, we measured the scaling of adhesive forces with body mass. Scaling coefficients were much higher than expected if pads detached by peeling. This indicates that insects are able to distribute stresses across the entire contact zone. To understand how insects control surface attachment during locomotion, we studied the effect of pull-off angle on adhesive forces in ants. Adhesion strongly increased for smaller angles, but much more abruptly than predicted from peeling models. The sudden transition facilitates rapid control of attachment and detachment. When compared with upright locomotion, ants walking upside down made shorter strides, had a smaller speed and a higher duty factor. Inverted ants loaded with additional weights reduced their tarsus angle, thereby bringing their pads into a position where adhesive forces are maximised. Using rapid displacements of the substrate, we showed that ants and stick insects were able to double their adhesive contact area within less than a millisecond. Passive, mechanical control was also found to be responsible for the use of claws or adhesive pads, depending on surface roughness. Although both attachment devices are controlled by the claw flexor muscle, their movements occur one after the other, with the movement of the adhesive pad being last. As a result, interlocking of the claws on rough surfaces mechanically prevents full engagement of the adhesive pad. We found that insects possess different tarsal pads specialised for either pulling (adhesion) or pushing (friction). Both pad types differ in ultrastructure, adhesive properties and use during locomotion. The principle of division of labour between tarsal pads had not been recognised before but is widespread among arthropods. We investigated how adhesive structures cope with contamination by measuring attachment before and after contamination with microspheres. Smooth and hairy pads exhibited self-cleaning properties and rapidly recovered adhesion over consecutive steps. Many findings of this project will be relevant for the development of biomimetic adhesives. - inspiration for synthetic adhesive systems\n- identified mechanisms for non-adhesive and non-toxic insect-repellent surfaces Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
