This is made possible by the discovery of a mouse strain called anarchy with defects in these pathways, due to mutation in a previously uncharacterised gene called Anarchin. The Anarchin gene is similar in mice and humans and is first member of a new gene family with unknown functions. In this project we will discover how Anarchin normally regulates the selection of T cells, generating immunity against infections but preventing autoimmunity. Poor immunity against infections and autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes, place a major burden on human health worldwide. Therefore the discovery of Anarchin creates an important opportunity to identify new targets for the treatment of such conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700830","grantId":"G0700830","fundValue":"451434","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard J Cornell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
