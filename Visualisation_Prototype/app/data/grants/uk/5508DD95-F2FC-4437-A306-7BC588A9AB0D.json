{"id":"5508DD95-F2FC-4437-A306-7BC588A9AB0D","title":"American Tropics: Towards a Literary Geography","abstractText":"Most literary history is governed by language or nation state. Neither approach can do justice to the complexity of the literary history of the Americas, especially to those areas where more than one European power (and therefore language) has had influence. This project approaches literary history in a completely different way, focused on place. It defines the American Tropics as a broad region (from Charleston to Bahia) where plantation cultures flourished. From within that region it focusses on six places, giving intensive consideration to the writing associated with those places - irrespective of the language or national origin of the writers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119179/1","grantId":"119179/1","fundValue":"258851","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Hulme","coPersons":["Maria Cristina Fumagalli","Owen  Robinson"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" We aimed to test the validity of a larger, non-national unit --American Tropics -- for the analysis of literary texts written without the area of the extended Caribbean: Caribbean islands and adjacent mainland as far north as New York and as far south as Rio de Janeiro. The number and richness of the resulting outputs has proved its validity. The American Tropics will retain its validity and be used by literary and cultural researchers. Other projects might deploy a similar literary-geographical methodology to challenge entrenched units of current literary analysis.
