This included elaborating on processes of mobilising publics, how different objects and events provoke public concern, and how communities of affected interest are mobilised around these concerns; practices of public feeling, exploring the multiple registers through which participation in public action is mobilised, and exploring the reconfiguration of identifications based on solidarity, care, and faith; and the production and circulation of different forms of public knowledge.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0373","grantId":"RES-451-26-0373","fundValue":"18468","fundStart":"2008-03-11","fundEnd":"2010-03-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"CLIVE  BARNETT","coPersons":["Nicholas  Mahony","Janet  Newman"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
