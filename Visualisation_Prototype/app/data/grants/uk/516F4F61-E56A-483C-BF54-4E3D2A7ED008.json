Recent work, for example has suggested that a personâ€˜s ability to cope with stress may reduce their risk of having a stroke by around a quarter.\nWe hope that the knowledge gained in this research will strengthen the scientific evidence linking social and psychological factors with medical outcomes including cancer and heart disease, and also inform health promotion, health prevention and approaches to improve public health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300128","grantId":"G0300128","fundValue":"183229","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Surtees","coPersons":["Nicholas  Day","Kay-Tee  Khaw"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
