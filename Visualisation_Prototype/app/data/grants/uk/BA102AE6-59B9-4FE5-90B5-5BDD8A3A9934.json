{"id":"BA102AE6-59B9-4FE5-90B5-5BDD8A3A9934","title":"Embedding of RFID tags into an electrically conductive track - TRACK-TRONIC","abstractText":"The project is part of a proposal submitted in the context of the Spring Competition of the DTI. The Liverpool part of this project will be to design a rudimentary rfid tag for implementation in prototype Organic Electronic circuits on low cost flex substrates. The tag will have immediate applications in simple label based off-on-off tags which will indicate whether a particular item in a supermarket or other retail outfit will be been paid for. This is quite demanding in terms of reading distance and necessarily involves the simplest circuits to maximise radiant power, from flex to reader, by minimising power dissipation in the tag itself. The circuits will be based on p channel electronics rather than CMOS and will introduce design techniques that minimise internal power dissipation. The prototypes will be made on the most advanced high mobility polymers or small molecules currently available. They will be compatible with ultra low cost manufacturing. The interconnect system will be compatible with the UVASOL laser and inkjet systems and the related expertise of the other participants. A test system is currently under construction which involves moving the tag through a reader coil that also generates the output signal. The data from the prototypes will be made available to the partners including Mentor Graphics. This will greatly assist with marketing of the designs worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010520/1","grantId":"DT/E010520/1","fundValue":"188572","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2009-07-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Eccleston","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
