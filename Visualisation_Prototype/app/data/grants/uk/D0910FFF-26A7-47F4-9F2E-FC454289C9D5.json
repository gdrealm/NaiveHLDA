In total, UK grasslands account for more than 50% of the land area and 70% of all agricultural land use and the market value of UK agricultural grassland in 2006, measured in terms of meat and milk production, is estimated to have been c. &pound;4.8 billion. In addition to conventional agricultural use, grass and grasslands are of fundamental importance in amenity situations, including sports fields and landscaping, and there is also increasing interest in the development of alternative grassland uses, such as for biofuel and platform chemical production. IBERS is the major centre for ryegrass breeding/germplasm resources within the UK as well as being the focus of bioenergy grass improvement. It has an established infrastructure allowing the interplay of research in plant genetics, genomics, physiology, biochemistry and environmental analysis with breeding and sustainability objectives, thus, it is in a unique position to exploit new genome technologies. A major aim of grass scientists is to be able to define genomic regions that play an important role in determining target traits in these crops, as our ability to influence these traits (eg., drought/heat tolerance, nitrogen use efficiency, flowering, bioenergy traits) is fundamental to maintaining sustainable grasslands. A major step in comprehensive genome analysis is the establishment of a physical map. This involves a number of sequential processes: A) Develop extensive large-insert (BAC) genomic DNA libraries which, effectively, fragment and partition the genome into smaller pieces which can be catalogued. B) Generate distinctive 'fingerprints' of each of these BACs. C) Define the physical order of BACs within the genome by identifying overlapping fingerprint patterns (contiguous clones, or contigs). D) Relate the identified contigs to existing genetic o chromosome maps. Extra information can be obtained by sequencing the ends of each of the BACs. This information can be used in confirming overlapping fingerprint patterns and in helping to define the genome structure. The outcome is that the genome is broken down into an ordered series of manageable fragments. These can be used for targeted DNA sequencing of particular regions of the genome / or for large scale whole genome sequencing. The aim of this research is to develop this resource for grass and other monocot researchers to enable a greater understanding of the genome structure and function. In order to make this information widely available, an open-access web-interface will be developed which will display progress in the project and allow for the raw data to be downloaded, so that other researchers can use it in their own analyses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G012342/1","grantId":"BB/G012342/1","fundValue":"1445640","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Further time will be required to assess this.

These consist of between 2851 and 4050 contigs and identify minimum-tiling-paths of between 19372 and 39250 BACs. The physical map versions have been produced using 2 different softwares (Fingerprint Contig and Linear Topology Contig) and using either all 212923 fingerprints or a subset of 154836 low-repeat-content fingerprints. This allows for validation of contig structure through comparison between methods.\nThe construction of PCR-screenable BAC library pools has allowed us to screen &gt;1500 mapped markers and associate &gt;800 contigs with genetic map positions. This was achieved using standard PCR and adapting KASPar technology. An additional 198 BAC-ends have been assigned genetic map positions using HindIII RAD sequencing.\nThrough collaboration with Aarhus University, Denmark, we are integrating the physical map with an NGS-based sequence assembly developed from the same L. perenne genotype. As part of an overall programme to develop a reference genome for Lolium perenne this work contributes to the understanding of the genome structure and assaying the genome variability of this forage grass species. This, in turn, is contributing to the development of molecular breeding approaches Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
