This is predominantly addressed in current public debates in terms of trafficking and exploitation. </p>\n\n<p>Interviews with 100 migrant women, men and transgender people working in all of the main jobs available within the sex industry, and from the most relevant areas of origin (South America, Eastern Europe, EU and South East Asia), suggest that although some migrants are subject to coercion and exploitation, a majority are not. The research shows a great variety of experiences and trajectories within the sex industry, which were influenced by key factors such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>social-economic background</li>\n\n <li>family history</li>\n\n <li>educational aspirations and achievements</li>\n\n <li>immigration status and policy</li>\n\n <li>professional and language skills</li>\n\n <li>gender and sexuality</li>\n\n <li>individual emotional history.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research findings show that the current emphasis on concepts such as trafficking and exploitation to explain the variety of the trajectories of migrants into the UK sex industry risks concealing their individual and shared vulnerabilities and strengths, the understanding of which could form the basis of more effective social interventions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E002706/1","grantId":"ES/E002706/1","fundValue":"201011","fundStart":"2007-01-25","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research informed and shifted public policies and media debates towards a distinction between migrants' involvement in the sex industry and trafficking (i.e. see Guardian article by Nick Davies on 'Prostitution and trafficking - the anatomy of a moral panic', 20 October 2009). The ECP (English Collective of Prostitutes) used the research in their campaign against the 2009 Policing and Crime Act and 'the increased criminalization of sex workers and the closures of premises justified in the name of clamping down on trafficking'. Following the launch of the research findings, Mai was consulted by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) during the preparation of the 'Setting the Record' report, so far the only official police quantification of sex trafficking in England and Wales, confirming that only a minority of migrant sex workers are trafficked. The findings were presented at the ACPO 2010 and at two of the UKNSWP (UK Network of Sex Work Projects) yearly national conferences in 2009 and 2010. The research completed a tradition of participative and ethnographic research engaging sex workers directly in identifying their needs and priorities. It has 'directly informed policy development at a national level and informed support service practice across the UK' (UKNSWP representative) and was pivotal in producing a forceful impact on current UK government guidelines and strategies on trafficking, which are now separate from those on prostitution and acknowledge that a minority of migrants working in the sex industry are trafficked. The findings of the research inform the influential 2012 report 'Silence on Violence' on the violence experienced by sex workers in London and on the way anti-trafficking campaigns exacerbated their vulnerability. The report was authored by a London GLA member, according to whom Mai's research 'helps both quantify and qualify' the 'options and choices open to trafficked people' and provided 'invaluable' insight in an area characterised by 'little data'. \n\nMai's film 'Normal' (2012) is informed by the ESRC project's research findings and was selected at the Raindance International Film Festival 2012. It was screened at several projects and events of the UKNSWP, as well as at a range of national and international academic, policymaking and activist settings. The film has been regularly included in syllabi of teaching modules in Criminology, Gender and Sexuality, Public Health, Anthropology and Sociology at several UK (Leeds, LSE, LSHTM) and international (Paris - EHESS, Nijmegen - Radboud) universities and has impacted on the training of prospective practitioners and policymakers. It has been seen as helping sex workers to 'voice their own experiences of migrating to the UK' (Open Doors director) and 'helping break down stereotypes' (ECP) while project practitioners have seen it as 'an important resource to inform their partner agencies and the general public about migrant sex work' (UKNSWP representative). \n\nThe ESRC research impacted directly on public debates and policymaking. It informed the parliamentary debates of the Policing and Crime Bill 2009 and several news items, including: three BBC programmes (Newsnight, BBC London News and London Politics Show); the Economist's advertising campaign in Winter 2011; two articles in the Guardian; two articles in Metro; one article in the Evening Standard, the Hackney Gazette, the Islington Informer, the Herald Scotland (Glasgow) and the Telegraph, and over 100 mentions in internet based newspapers and policymaking websites. They are also mentioned in at least 30 internet based UK and international newspapers - the list can be made available on request. In April 2013 Mai was interviewed by Danish TV in the context of a national debate on the criminalisation of sex work and by 'Information' and other national Danish newspapers.
