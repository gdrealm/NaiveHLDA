This proposal will take an important step towards the provision of a set of well characterised particles by using methods that are in routine use in our laboratory to make nanoparticles of three different sizes and three different chemical compositions. We will determine the toxicity of these particles to a fungus, an aquatic alga and a freshwater invertebrate, examine whether the particles are taken up by these organisms and determine how particle size and surface chemistry alter uptake and toxicity.

Polar particles were of low toxicity, but hydrophobic particles were very toxic to Daphnia, with toxicity increasing sharply at smaller particle sizes. \n\n\n\nWe examined whether the particles increased or decreased the toxic effects of three common pollutants. Some alterations of toxicity were observed, but the effects were small in magnitude.\n\n\n\nThe results allow us to start drawing generalisations about the likely environmental impacts of nanoparticles and the ways that the physical and chemical characteristics of the particles alter their biological effects. They show that both particle size and particle composition are important influences on nanoparticle toxicity and that nano-sized particles of normally inert materials can be very active biologically. The nanoparticles that we have synthesised may be of value as reference toxicants Chemicals,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
