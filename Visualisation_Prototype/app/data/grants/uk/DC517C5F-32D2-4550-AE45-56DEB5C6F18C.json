The suriving patients, who are relatively young (usually in their 50s), are being followed to make sure that the coiled aneurysms do not bleed more often than the aneurysms which have been clipped, and thus potentially lose the initial benefit we saw.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700479","grantId":"G0700479","fundValue":"1131620","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew James Molyneux","coPersons":["Richard  Kerr"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
