{"id":"5CD85A1E-DBCE-4954-8399-D0FB80298122","title":"Modeling of Condensed Phase Reactive Fluid Flow","abstractText":"Research in the field of condensed phase reactive flow encompasses a broad range of interests ranging from safety considerations in the chemical processing industries, to commercial mining activities and defence related research. This proposal is concerned with the establishment of a network amongst these disparate technical communities in the UK. The aims are to provide a means of developing joint research applications, providing bibliographic data support, benchmarking UK research on modelling techniques and further extending international links.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03664X/1","grantId":"EP/D03664X/1","fundValue":"63399","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Braithwaite","coPersons":["Anna Barbara Crowley"],"organisation":"Cranfield University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
