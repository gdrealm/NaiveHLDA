{"id":"0F51793C-0CD8-48FB-87D1-013CF33DA14F","title":"Social Cohesion and Civil Law: The Family and Religious Courts","abstractText":"This research seeks to address concerns which were raised in the aftermath of the Archbishop of Canterbury's lecture on Religious and Civil Law in 2008, which provoked an animated debate concerning the extent to which English law should accommodate religious legal systems, such as Sharia law. The project explores how religious law already functions alongside civil law in the area of marriage and divorce, by examining the working of three religious courts in detail: the Roman Catholic Portsmouth Diocesan Tribunal; the Jewish London Beth Din, Family Division; and the court of the Birmingham Central Mosque. It will focus upon the organisational structure and legal status of these courts and the jurisdiction they have in relation to marriage, divorce and remarriage, areas which are of considerable importance in both religious and State law. The research will involve scrutiny of a sample of files concerning the cases dealt with by the courts and a series of interviews with court personnel. The project is ground-breaking in that although there have been some empirical investigations into the courts or tribunals used by particular religious traditions, no work to date has sought to compare the work of courts or tribunals of different religions and how they relate to the law of the State. \\n\\nBy providing the missing evidence base, this project will benefit a range of scholars who research law and religion, family law and the sociology of religion. It will also benefit the religious courts themselves and a range of policy-makers and media representatives by bringing them together to discuss the findings at a symposium in month 11 of the project, to which members of two Cardiff-led Networks (the Law and Religion Scholars Network and the Interfaith Legal Advisers Network) will be invited. In addition to informing the general debate, it is also intended that this project will serve as a catalyst for further research into law and religion. \\n\\nThe proposed project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team of scholars based at Cardiff University. The Principal Investigator, Douglas, an expert on family law will be joined by Gilliat-Ray, an expert on the sociology of religion, as senior co-applicant. Given the project's strong link with law and religion, two experts in this field Doe and Sandberg, will also form part of the project team. . A Research Assistant will also be employed for the last ten months of the project for the equivalent of four days a week.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008896/1","grantId":"AH/H008896/1","fundValue":"79862","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our research has been used to inform public discussion of problems arising from the interface between civil and religious law, and in confidential discussions in government regarding unregistered religious marriages.
