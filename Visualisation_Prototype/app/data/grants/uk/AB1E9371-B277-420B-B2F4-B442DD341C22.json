Resubmission","abstractText":"Summary \\nThis workshop series aims to bring together practitioners and scholars that work in a particular field of contemporary experimental music-theatre: Composed Theatre. This refers to forms of theatre, where the theatrical means of expression (gesture, light, sound, movement, text etc.) are explicitly composed according to musical principles (repetition, variation, motif, rhythm etc.). This group will address four questions about Composed Theatre: what are its the key characteristics, how does its devising differ from conventional creation processes, what effects do its processes have on our notions of authorship, dramaturgy, composition and notation, and how does Composed Theatre change our understanding of the interplay of music and theatre.\\nComposed Theatre often results in performances that employ working processes that circumvent traditional hierarchies of collaboration and divisions of labour. While conventionally a librettist and composer create 'the work', which is then put on stage by stage-, costume-, light-designers and performers under the authoritative leadership of the conductor and the director, Composed Theatre often employs collective creativity and flat hierarchies.\\nThe workshops series seeks to address the processes that generate this kind of work - an area of music-theatrical performance that has been widely neglected by researchers so far. Given the experimental nature of the practices in question it is precisely the process and its conceptual, material and personnel decisions and the emerging interactions that hold the novelty of the resulting work and enable the interplay between the arts to be re-negotiated.\\nThe aim of the series is thus to investigate and compare different artistic processes and approaches to devising Composed Theatre and to stimulate an intensive discussion about the nature of these processes. The series will also reflect on these processes' relevance for specific performances in particular and music-theatre in general. All practitioners will be asked in turns to focus on a characteristic aspect of their artistic processes towards Composed Theatre and then exemplify and demonstrate their approach interactively. Conducting this exchange as a workshop series thus allows all participants to experience and observe the exemplified processes as processes and not finished papers or reports. These practical explorations will be audio-visually recorded. Interviews with each practitioner in front of an invited audience will embed the individual sessions within their wider practice. In addition, eminent practitioners and scholars will add theoretical and artistic perspective with a number of 'provocations' that will contextualize and frame the sessions further. The provocations may concern singular examples of collaborative experimental practice in music-theatre as well as methodological and analytical considerations. The sessions, interviews and provocations will be open to the public and will be advertised to specialist audiences.\\nIn the second of two three-day meetings the group will meet in forums, where they will consider and compare the various approaches and processes, address them in the light of the four research questions and discuss possibilities for future activities.\\nThe series is intended to allow all participants to develop and expose their current research and practice and we are confident they will spark or intensify further collaborative and interdisciplinary research as a consequence. The series will also stimulate and inform new work and will thus have a cultural impact. The sessions will be documented for a DVD and thus made accessible for future research purposes. A co-edited book will contain transcripts of the interviews and provocations as well as co-authored chapters that will evaluate the implications of the series and disseminate its findings in the widest possible way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G014418/1","grantId":"AH/G014418/1","fundValue":"10338","fundStart":"2009-03-02","fundEnd":"2009-09-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have directly influenced the teaching of my co-author, myself and other people both in Higher Education and in other contexts, such as theatre workshops etc.\nIt has directly informed the work of other scholars, PhD and MA students and has been used as a touchstone for a major application to the Swiss research funding organization (SNF).

They treat voice, gesture, movement, light, sound, image, design and other features of theatrical production according to musical principles and compositional techniques and apply musical thinking to performance as a whole. This idea is again flourishing among composers, directors and theatre collectives, as reflected in recent developments towards postdramatic forms that de-emphasise text, narrative and fictional characters, seeking alternative dramaturgies (visual, spatial, temporal, musical), and focusing on the sonic and visual materialities of the stage and the performativity of their material components. \n\nAt the same time, musical composition has increasingly expanded its range of &quot;instruments&quot; to include live video, lighting-design, live sound electronics, costumes, and spatial arrangements, and has paid closer attention to the theatricality of the musical performer. Thus the interests in the musicality of theatrical performance and the theatricality of musical performance have given rise to a wide range of forms of what we propose to call &quot;Composed Theatre&quot;. \n\nFollowing two symposia Matthias Rebstock and I organised in 2009 at Exeter and Hildesheim, to which we invited practitioners and scholars who work in this field, we seek to now establish the field of Composed Theatre in this book, providing terminological consideration and frameworks for analysis, all of which have not been widely used before and have not received in-depth academic attention. We have called on both scholars and practitioners, thereby providing a wide range of historical and theoretical perspectives as well as detailed case studies. It is one of the contentions of this book that Composed Theatre cannot be defined solely by its &quot;works&quot; or outcomes. It can, however, be grouped and approached - despite the diversity of its outcomes - according to specific characteristics of its various stages of becoming: its conceptual, devising, rehearsing and designing processes. In short, it is the process, not the performance, that distinguishes Composed Theatre from other forms and thus defines the field. \n\nOur book does not seek to define Composed Theatre ontologically or phenomenologically, but in the light of a genetic approach (see e.g. Feral 2008, Rebstock 2009, Roesner 2010), which aims to establish a set of shared criteria that are characteristic of most of its creation processes. These are particularly interesting not least because this kind of composing of theatrical media according to musical principles calls into question fundamental certainties about both musical composition and music-theatrical production. \n\nComposed Theatre is situated within and expands on a context of previous research into earlier examples of this practice, particularly in the USA and around the work of John Cage (e.g. Fetterman 1995; Kaye 1996; Sanio 1999; Deuffert 2001). However, work of this kind has proliferated in more recent European and particularly German developments due to a unique theatre system and a specific funding and festival culture, both of which facilitate this kind of experimental work. Our book explores this European strand. Here it is particularly Mauricio Kagel, another composer of the generation of the &quot;fathers&quot; (Tsangaris) of Composed Theatre, who has received detailed acedemic attention, to which this book is also indebted (see e.g. Schnebel 1970, Kl?ppelholz 1981, Kl?ppelholz/Prox 1985, Tadday 2004, Heile 2006, Rebstock 2007). Kagel's often cited notion that one can compose with &quot;sounding and non-sounding materials, actors, cups, tables, omnibuses and oboes&quot; (Kagel 1982: 121) is a point of departure and recurrent throughline in the research on Composed Theatre. Matthias Rebstock's chapter Composed Theatre - mapping the field (II.1.) explores the historical developments and lineages of Composed Theatre in greater detail and David Roesner's discourse analysis (II.2.) extends this towards an in-depth interrogation of the main themes, features, and characterizations of Composed Theatre today.\n\nComposed Theatre is consciously in dialogue with a number of neighbouring or overlapping discourses. With its focus on process for example, it aims to be a significant contribution to the current scholarship on artistic process (Bannermann 2006, F?ral 2008, Porombka et al. 2006, 2008). While not all Composed Theatre is music-theatre, there is certainly a strong relationship with the development and discussion within experimental music-theatre (Heilgendorff 2002, Mauser 2002, Danuser 2003, Reinighaus/Schneider 2004, Salzman/Desi 2008, Schl?der 2009). Beyond its immediate field of practices and by virtue of its continuous crossing of boundaries, Composed Theatre also explores questions of intermediality (Rajewsky 2002, Balme 2004, Chapple/Kattenbelt 2006, M?ller 2008), new dramaturgies (Turner/Behrndt 2007), materialities and sensory perceptions of the stage (Lechtermann, Wagner, Wenzel 2007), the performativity of music (Godlovitch 1998, Small 1998, Cook 2001, Auslander 2006), the aesthetics of devising (Heddon/Milling 2006, Mermikides/Smart 2009) and, last but not at least, aspects of the postdramatic (Lehmann 2006).\n\nThe book offers three main approaches that triangulate the aesthetics, processes and practices of Composed Theatre. First, Rebstock, Roesner, Quitt and Meyer introduce the historical developments and key characteristics of Composed Theatre and the methodological considerations (part II) arising from the topic, looking at aspects of interdisciplinarity, intermediality, materiality, processes of performance, signification and notation, as well as the discursive strategies that the creators of Composed Theatre employ in articulating the phenomenon. This is followed by a second approach, a series of case studies and reports from practitioners themselves (part III) exploring the unique creation processes of Composed Theatre in more depth and conceptualizing relationships between compositional thinking, creating performance, working with actors, dancers, musicians and materials, as well as negotiating new technologies. Complementing this are portraits and analyses of further key composer/directors whose works and processes define the current face and phase of Composed Theatre (part IV). \n\nIn its third approach, the book documents excerpts from a series of lively discussions between some major exponents of Composed Theatre, focusing on its main characteristics, processes and principles, which both tie together and open up some of the main throughlines and questions of this book. These are:\n\n\n\no What are the key characteristics of Composed Theatre? \n\no Why is it important to focus on its creation process in order to determine the field?\n\no What other terms are in circulation and how do they relate to the scope of this book? \n\no How do the different arts (music, theatre, literature, film) and media (actors, musicians, instruments, lighting, video etc.) interact and interrelate in the creation processes of Composed Theatre?\n\no How does a creation process which is guided by compositional thoughts and concepts affect the roles of the collaborators (composer, director, performer, designer, dramaturg, technician, programmer, etc.)?\n\no How does the transference or translation of compositional principles (such as polyphony, counterpoint, development of motifs, permutation etc.) to non-musical forms of theatrical expression (speech, movement, gesture, stage design, lighting etc.) impact on both (the principles and the stage vocabulary)?\n\no What role does improvisation play in the creation process and how is it influenced by forms of musical improvisation?\n\no What is the nature and the status of (musical) notation in the creation process in Composed Theatre?\n\no What are the institutional and educational frameworks for Composed Theatre and what is their impact on the creation process?\n\n\n\nComposed Theatre offers answers to these questions in a cummulative way - emerging through the assembly of the many puzzle pieces that the range of contributions offers - but it also embraces the variations and even contradictions that the range of views, examples, definitions and convictions will provide. We offer Composed Theatre as a starting point, the beginning of an engagement with an exciting range of theatre forms and creation processes, rather than a definitive and closing statement. Artists, Critics and theatre teachers in FE, HE and conservatoire will find the book helpful, interesting and engaging. Creative Economy,Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
