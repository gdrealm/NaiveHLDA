One such class of sensors is the family of two-component systems (TCSs). Two-component systems comprise a sensor protein on the bacterial surface that detects the presence of a particular signal and relays that signal to a protein (termed the ?response regulator?) inside the bacteria. The response regulator then turns a variety of genes on or off, enabling the bacteria to respond to the original signal. These TCSs can switch on diverse genes that are necessary for the bacteria to cause disease. In some cases, bacteria which lack a particular TCS cannot cause disease at all, and can be used as a vaccine. This study will investigate the TCSs within a group of bacteria called Burkholderia. These bacteria are resistant to almost every available antibiotic and are capable of causing serious disease of humans, animals and plants. Two particular species within the Burkholderia group can be used as warfare agents. In stark contrast, other Burkholderia are harmless bacteria residing in soil where they can boost crop production, resulting in calls for their environmental application. How Burkholderia organisms control this remarkable diversity is unknown. From available genome sequences, it is apparent that Burkholderia organisms possess an unusually high number of TCSs. Preliminary studies show that the TCSs within Burkholderia behave very differently from equivalent systems within other bacterial species. The proposed research will investigate these novel Burkholderia TCSs, and identify those which are particularly important for causing disease. Having identified these key TCSs, studies will be performed that will reveal which genes are being turned on or off by these systems. Different Burkholderia species vary considerably in their ability to cause disease. Genome sequences of Burkholderia that can and cannot cause disease will be compared to see if these differing abilities might be explained by the presence or absence of particular TCSs and their associated genes. Finally, TCS inhibitors will be tested against Burkholderia to determine whether such inhibitors may be used as novel antibiotics. In conclusion, this research will identify Burkholderia systems that are essential for causing disease, thus identifying novel ways to treat and prevent Burkholderia infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800169","grantId":"G0800169","fundValue":"348233","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Reid Brown","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
