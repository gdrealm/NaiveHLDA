Urban governance interventions in the future, we envisage, will be transformed by the existence of well-founded large panel studies that permit probabilistic statements about the impacts of policies and changes to urban configuration and design, on individual agents (individuals, households, firms).</p>\n\n<p>This approach is tested by adding innovative measures describing the built environment around the homes of approximately 500,000 members of the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study. These are used to calibrate models capable of detecting the individual health effects of alternative urban configurations and designs (density, land-use mix, green infrastructure, street network connectivity, slope and so on). We also test the impact of these urban planning variables on individual wealth, indicated by property price; and explore health-wealth associations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003201/1","grantId":"ES/L003201/1","fundValue":"198297","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"C J  Webster","coPersons":["S  Orford","Elisabete A.
