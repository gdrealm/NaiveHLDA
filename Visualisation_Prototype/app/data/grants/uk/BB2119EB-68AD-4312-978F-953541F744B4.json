These are very aggressive and invasive brain tumours for which conventional treatment techniques offer little benefit for the patients.A number of centres around the World have performed clinical studies which have shown that even in its present sub-optimised form, BNCT has similar efficacy to conventional treatments (surgery plus radiotherapy), and from studies in Sweden and Finland, some evidence of improved efficacy is beginning to emerge.There are significant developments which are in progress on methods for delivery of the most popular boron compound (BPA). These should offer the possibility for improved outcomes for the future. One important piece of evidence which holds great promise for the future comes from studies on animals. These have shown that fractionated BNCT is one of only two treatment modalities which have been seen to offer a possibility for cure in the F98 glioma tumour model.There is also evidence from human trials in Finland and Japan that the role for BNCT in the management of recurrent head and neck cancer is becoming established, and exciting evidence from Italy showing the possibility for substantial life extension in patients with cancer which had spread to liver. All of these factors suggest that there is a very promising future for BNCT research, both laboratory-based and clinicalThe Birmingham project seeks to make progress on BNCT radiobiology with the aim to greatly improve the understanding of this very complex process. We intend to gain significant under-pinning knowledge which would enhance the prospects for successful BNCT Worldwide. Specifically we will try to pursue frontiers in radiobiological modelling / treatment planning, and experimental alpha-particle radiobiology. One specific aim is to develop a protocol which is reasonable and practical to use in the commissioning of neutron beams for BNCT, so that meaningful data can be obtained to inform the clinical studies on those beams, without the need for extensive (and expensive) animal irradiation","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D051592/1","grantId":"EP/D051592/1","fundValue":"360915","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Green","coPersons":["Bleddyn  Jones","Andy  Mill"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
