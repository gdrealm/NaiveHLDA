{"id":"50B0221D-EAC6-4CE7-9753-B470CFF7BBDC","title":"Working Beyond the Border: European Union Trade Agreements and International Labour Standards","abstractText":"Recent high profile incidents such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza Building in Bangladesh demonstrate the need for workers' rights to be better protected and enhanced across the globe. Sustainable development clauses in international trade agreements provide one important mechanism by which major trading blocs, such as the European Union, are attempting to do this.\n\nThis project investigates this commitment of the EU to improve labour standards beyond its borders. It focuses on the EU pledge &quot;to put more of its commercial weight behind efforts to promote social standards and decent work in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations&quot;, which has been trumpeted in the labour standards provisions contained in &quot;new generation&quot; free trade agreements (FTAs) as a key policy mechanism for promoting labour standards in third countries. This project investigates the impact of these new FTAs on workers in third countries.\n\nSince the 2011 free trade agreement with South Korea, all new EU FTAs contain a specific chapter on 'Trade and Sustainable Development', with commitments to respect core labour standards (freedom of association, eliminating forced labour and abolishing child labour). They also contain institutional mechanisms to monitor and review compliance with those standards including a joint committee of representatives of the two parties to the agreement, an independent body of experts to handle complaints, and a civil society review mechanism. \n\nThis model is novel and innovative. It is not a 'hard law' mechanism where sanctions are used to force compliance. Nor is it a 'soft' law mechanism (like Fair Trade) because states are making commitments to take action, and their performance is monitored and reviewed. Consequently, research into existing mechanisms for protecting labour standards is not helpful in understanding how effective the EU's new model is. There is also no existing research which directly investigates what the impact of this new model is on workers in countries that have signed a 'new generation' FTA with the EU; an absence noted by international agencies. This research project therefore fills this important gap.\n\nWe will examine three countries that have recently signed such agreements with the EU (South Korea, Moldova and Guyana), to investigate: \n(1) the negotiating process for each agreement, and whether these processes have helped domestic coalitions in each country to push for better protection of labour standards; \n(2) what is happening in the institutional mechanisms created by the trade agreements and the extent to which key labour standards issues are raised and dealt with; \n(3) key export sectors in each country (automobiles, clothing and sugar respectively) to examine what the impact of the negotiating processes and institutional mechanisms in the trade agreements are in the factories and fields of third countries; \n\nVitally important to this project is the recognition that labour standards provisions in FTAs may have very different effects on workers' lives in third countries depending on a number of factors, including:\n(1) How powerful each trading partner is and how this effects the EU's ability to influence its policies and practices;\n(2) The geo-political context in which each agreement is implemented (a free standing trade agreement (South Korea), part of a wider economic partnership agreement (Guyana), or as part of much deeper economic integration (Moldova); and\n(3) How different economic sectors are affected, hence our research will look at three different industries; capital-intensive manufacturing (automobiles); labour-intensive manufacturing (clothing) and agricultural production and processing (sugar).\n\nEvaluation of this 'new generation' model will be a vital source of evidence to inform the work of international organisations such as the European Commission, the ILO, and trade union/NGO groups over FTA implementation and negotiations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M009343/1","grantId":"ES/M009343/1","fundValue":"400950","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Smith","coPersons":["James Nicholas Harrison","Liam  Campling","Benjamin John Richardson"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
