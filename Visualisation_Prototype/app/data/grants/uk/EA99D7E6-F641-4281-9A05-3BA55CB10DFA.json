Advocates of decriminalisation argue that such a policy would allow society to redirect resources from the investigation, prosecution, and punishment, of drug offenders, towards more productive uses. Opponents of legalization often argue that users of cannabis are more likely to consume other dangerous drugs for example. This research aims to shed light on these issues by estimating the social consequences of a unique social policy experiment. On July 1st 2001 the police force in the London Borough of Lambeth unilaterally instigated a policy of not arresting those found with small quantities of the drug, instead merely confiscating it and giving the offender a warning. This research evaluates the social consequences of this policy on a range of outcomes. In particular the authors explore the effects of the decriminalisation on crime rates, the incidence of road accidents, and the educational attainment of students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2182","grantId":"RES-000-22-2182","fundValue":"62528","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Imran  Rasul","coPersons":["Jerome  Adda"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
