RT, which has been co-innovated by academics, practitioners and parents of children with complex needs, is a way of working with disadvantaged children and young people that offers a framework for helping them bounce back. RT involves both developing the resilience research base and offering its lessons to practitioners, parents and young people.

New research collaborations created, international conference hosted, Resilient Therapy (RT) Learning Programme profiled at 22 UK and international summits and conferences since project start. 2. Leading international child and family resilience expert joins us in successful AHRC Connected Communities proposal to 'Develop community university partnership resilience' starting 2012. 3. East Sussex Public Health commission two RT Communities of Practice (2011 and 2012) while researchers chart the impact of the mechanism for embedding a resilient approach in work with vulnerable young people. Etienne Wenger, co-founder of the communities of practice approach, commits to working with us further. 4. Resilience expert Professor Brigid Daniel, University of Stirling, and Dr Elias Kourkoutas with colleagues in the Department of Primary Education, University of Crete eager to test RT Community of Practice approach with us and ESRC proposal to establish RT based CoPs in England, Scotland and Crete, submitted. 5. Jointly written chapter for forthcoming book offers an understanding of inputs, generated value and benefits of community university partnership working and knowledge exchange. 6. Four doctoral students focus on resilience theory and practice, offering a substantial contribution to the resilience knowledge base. 7. Working links with large Australian charity, using a science of implementation approach to apply resilience across their entire organisational structure and service delivery programme, developed and resources shared. 8. Work cited in the Director of Public Health Annual Report, NHS Brighton and Hove, and our work with young people included in ESRC short film as part of their 2011 Festival of Social Sciences.\n\n\n\nConsistent positive feedback from front-line practitioners and parent carers indicates that their day-to-day work has been directly influenced by the provision of opportunities to learn about resilience theory and the RT approach. Evaluations demonstrate RT has increased their confidence and feelings of effectiveness. Collaborative relationships between university and community partners are being sustained through social enterprise activities coordinated by a new Community Interest Company and a dedicated website www.boingboing.org.uk, has increased access to resilience based information and resources. National policy teams, senior civil servants and ministers, a leading national charity, community organisations, local authorities, academics, front line staff and parent carers have increased their understanding of resilience and Resilient Therapy, integrating the learning into their respective policy, teaching, research, workplace and home based settings. The mental health and skills (in training, writing and policy work) of young people with complex health difficulties has been enhanced and an RT toolkit for parents made available for free download. Statutory and third sector agencies have embedded RT in their organisations, with staff teams reporting the benefits of a 'shared language' and strengths based strategic approach in their work with children and families. RT is more securely rooted in the School of Nursing and Midwifery and related teaching curricula. Students report favourably on the inclusion of resilience concepts in their mentoring workshops and provide enthusiastic feedback about the positive benefits to community practitioners and parents teaching on university courses. 1. Resilient Therapy (RT) Learning Programme suitable for diverse audiences has been tested, refined and now operational. The suite of information and training sessions reached 3230 individuals. 2. Community Interest Company created and managed jointly by academic and community partners. Dedicated website www.boingboing.org.uk received 18,000 hits since launch in June 2010, which is growing exponentially as our work develops. 3. Meetings with policy leads at DoH and DfE led to: o Work cited (1:3 UK practice examples) in internal ministers briefing paper in relation to the implementation of the Coalition Government's white paper 'Healthy Lives, Healthy People' DH 2010 o Resilience evidence base included in DfE internal briefing paper for mental health leads on children's emotional wellbeing and mental health for the Secretary of State for Education o Briefing paper produced and widely circulated to Children, Families and Maternity division within DH, responsible for development of the Health Visitor Implementation Plan 2011, making a case for resilient practice amongst socially disadvantaged families. 4.
