Little is known about how the institution of police in Scotland evolved, despite growing interest in the machinery of law enforcement in other parts of the British Isles. This research project will address this by examining the origins and development of police in urban Scotland in the first half of the nineteenth century. It has the following aims and objectives. Firstly, it will analyse the demographic, social, commercial and intellectual pressures behind reform. Secondly, it will examine the impact of elected police commissions on municipal governance. Finally, it will assess the challenge the Scottish experience poses for theoretical models of police history. These aims will be carried out by conducting research on a wide range of primary source materials stored in archives throughout Scotland. </p> \n<p>The project will address a major gap in criminal justice history, broaden and deepen understanding of police reform in the United Kingdom and add an important and fresh dimension to police historiography. It will also make a significant contribution to social, urban and intellectual history by providing a fascinating insight into how Scottish burghs responded to a period of unprecedented social dislocation and demographic change.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1758","grantId":"RES-000-22-1758","fundValue":"57885","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David George  Barrie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
