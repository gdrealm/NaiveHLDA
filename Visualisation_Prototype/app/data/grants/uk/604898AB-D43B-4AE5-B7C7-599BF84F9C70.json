In particular it assesses the degree to which three drivers of rural transition - governmental policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, alternative/counter-cultural visions and practices, and environmental changes associated with climate change - might present quite contrasting futures for rural communities, and how rural communities might variously engage with, adapt to and drive forward particular futures. </p>\n\n<p>The project seeks to facilitate engagements between experts on these three drivers of rural change and to develop rural climate change mitigation and adaptation scenarios. These scenarios will then be examined with respect to three rural communities, with visual representations of potential futures being created and then presented to and discussed with residents in these communities. The degree of engagement, resistance and transformation of the scenarios will be examined by the research team, who will also present their findings on community responses to the expert steering committee. </p>\n\n<p>The project will involve interdisciplinary research and creative knowledge transfer that connects hitherto disconnected knowledge communities and examines the processes of engagement and learning between them.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H037306/1","grantId":"ES/H037306/1","fundValue":"161361","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As outlined in the Key Findings section, data from the project has also been submitted to the UK Data Archive, where it can be access by other researchers.

A detailed investigation of four rural communities in England revealed that contemporary rural lifestyles are highly dependent of carbon fuels, a key contributor to humanly induced climate change. Whilst residents of these communities were generally concerned about both climate change and the long term sustainability of carbon-based energy sources, it was clear that for many people climate change was only a 'back-of-the mind' concern, whilst energy often appeared as a 'front-of-the-mind' issue principally in terms of price and security of supplies. The study also highlighted the presence of uncertainty over the causes of climate change and the value of mitigation activities, including the development of renewable energy sources. Such uncertainty is an important contributor to a gap between levels of expressed concern and behaviour that were also clearly revealed in the study. The project argued that these disjunctures between expressed concern and action did not necessarily signifying some deficit in knowledge or motivation but needed to be understood in the context of a range of pre-existing concerns, interpretations and social relations. The study suggests that people are well aware of the existence of disjunctures between their understandings and actions, but create stories or narratives to themselves to explain these their participation or non-engagement with mitigation and adaptation activities. Five distinct narratives of non-transition and three narratives of transition are identified as being of significance in the four rural villages examined in this research. The research also explores how such narratives might be impacted by 3-d visualisations four different scenarios of the future. A key aspect of this project was to facilitate communication between four groups, namely: academics, governmental experts on climate change mitigation and adaptation, experts on alternative low-impact development, and residents in rural communities. The interaction of these groups was facilitated by the establishment of a steering group and through dissemination of its findings through articles in academic and policy related journals, a working paper series, and a written project summary report. Data from the project has also been submitted to the UK Data Archive, where it can be access by other researchers. We have also supplied data from the project to a meta-analysis on predictors of climate change belief being conducted by the University of Queenland.
