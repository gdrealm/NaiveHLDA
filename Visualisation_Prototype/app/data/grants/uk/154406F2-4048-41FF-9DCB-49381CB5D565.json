{"id":"154406F2-4048-41FF-9DCB-49381CB5D565","title":"Sexualisation, nuisance and safety: Sexual Entertainment Venues and the management of risk","abstractText":"<p>In the last decade, around 300 dedicated clubs have opened in England and Wales where the live display of nudity is regularly offered. Such venues have been accused of offering exploitative and degrading forms of entertainment which compromise the safety not just of female performers, but all women who live and work around such venues. However, there is no existing academic research documenting this. This research accordingly aims to collect such evidence, performing a grounded analysis of the impacts of such venues on surrounding businesses and residents. This will be achieved through an examination of the impacts of venues in a small town, a large town, a small city and a regional capital, chosen to represent the diversity of club styles and settings. The research will combine analysis of objections to club licensing, guided walks in the vicinity of clubs and an extensive survey of local residents.</p>\n\n<p>This project is grounded in social science literatures on the sexualisation of society, fear of crime and the regulation of the night-time economy. The findings will be of interest to stakeholders in licensing, town centre management and community safety, as well as audiences in sociology, criminology and geography.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J002755/1","grantId":"ES/J002755/1","fundValue":"94271","fundStart":"2011-12-31","fundEnd":"2012-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This research has been cited and informed the licensing of Sexual Entertainment Venues in England and Wales, and has also informed the drafting of legislation to enable control to be exercised over similar venues in Scotland.

These objections mainly suggest clubs will have a negative impact on their locality, ‘lowering the tone’, attracting ‘unsavoury’ characters, and encouraging anti-sociality.\n\n\n\nThese general – and possibly unrepresentative – objections contrasted with the more representative results of our survey completed in four British towns/cities. Only around 3% of 941 respondents felt that an SEV was a source of particular nuisance, and the majority claimed that town or city centres were appropriate locations for lap dancing clubs. However, 83% of people think SEVs are unsuitable near Schools or Nurseries, and 65% near religious facilities. Only 3% think SEVs are suitable in residential areas. Around one in ten claim there are no suitable locations for SEVs. This group is most likely to regard SEVs as promoting sexism, and least likely to regard it as harmless entertainment. This group is most likely to report avoiding walking past SEVs at night, and to say there were too many SEVs in their town. Women were significantly over-represented in this group, suggesting the presence of SEVs in the night-time city has gendered effects. \n\n\n\nThis was explored in our guided walks, which suggested women were significantly more likely to note, and comment on, the presence of SEVs in their local towns than men. Here, unease about SEVs appeared more related to questions of class, morality and disgust than fear, with SEV’s contribution to antisocial behavior and criminality deemed marginal, and in some cases insignificant, compared with other venues. The extent to which lap dance clubs provoke comment and unease appears strongly related to their external appearance and the extent to which they obviously advertise the sexual nature of the entertainment occurring within. Here, concerns centred on the idea that seeing such clubs would normalise particular ideas about the consumption of women's sexuality among young people (a concern most likely to be expressed by women).\n\n\n\nThe implication is that SEVs are not regarded a significant source of nuisance by the majority, but that a minority feel such clubs are inappropriate principally because they promote sexism. Perceptions of SEVs therefore appear to be strongly shaped by gender: religion and ethnicity made no significant difference to attitudes to SEVs. Far from dismissing gendered concerns about the presence of lap dancing clubs in British cities, our research underlines that their visibility and location is something that can raise anxieties that appear most strongly felt by women. These results are of consequence for managers and owners of clubs which are subject to Sexual Entertainment Venue (SEV) licensing in Britain, as well as the local authorities charged with administering the licensing system introduced to regulate such clubs. They are also of import for communities and groups opposed to lap dancing clubs on grounds of community safety, morality and/or gendered equality. As such, they will be cited in public, media and political debates, and may be used/exploited by legal experts in licensing applications and judicial review. This use is likely to be limited to the UK, though the data collected in this study will no doubt be cited internationally given the lack of studies of the impact of sex premises on communities. These findings are of relevance in the context of wider debates about the sexualisation of society, and will be cited in fields including sociology, women's studies and criminology. Beyond the results of the survey and guided walk activities, this project has shed new light on the role of licensing in shaping the 'moral' landscape of British cities. \n\n\n\nWhile there is little obvious potential for commercial exploitation, the results will be of value in enriching the public and political debates surrounding the putative sexualisation of our cities. For particular stakeholders concerned with the management or regulation of lap dancing clubs, these results will be of considerable importance (see below).
