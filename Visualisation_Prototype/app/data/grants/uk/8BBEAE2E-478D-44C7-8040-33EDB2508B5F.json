In such circumstances, sedation may be given to induce a coma until death occurs. This practice is known as 'continuous deep sedation until death' or as 'palliative' or 'terminal' sedation. Although the practice is a standard procedure there are many debates about its definition, what drugs should be used or what criteria should guide its application. </p>\n\n<p>There is little knowledge about the decision making process at the bedside, or how the treatment relates to other issues of end of life decision making. In this study, a team of social scientists and clinicians seek to undertake a study in two parts. Part one involves firstly, a review of two bodies of literature: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>clinical research and practice;</li>\n\n <li>ethical, social science and philosophical.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Secondly, a secondary analysis of an existing data set comprising surveys completed by UK medical practitioners. </p>\n\n<p>Part 2 will involve a series of 30 case studies using qualitative methods to interview staff and relatives most closely involved in the care of decedents who received continuous sedation until death at home, in hospital or in hospices. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H002642/1","grantId":"ES/H002642/1","fundValue":"267350","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Through the presentations and publications our research is having an impact upon the international and interdisciplinary community of researchers and academics engaged in palliative and end of life care research across bioethics, medicine, social sciences and nursing. These include those involved with the The project has had societal impact in the following areas: 1. Raising awareness among practising clinicians in Europe of the variability associated with sedation in end of life care and enabling debate about the applicability of current guidelines and the constraints operating in different care settings that militate against their use. 2. Developing understanding among practicising clinicians of pertinent ethical issues involved in making end of life care decisions related to sedation, particularly where patients lack capacity. 3) Providing insights for practitioners and national policy makers into use of the Liverpool Care Pathway and evidence relating to outcomes of using integrated care pathways in end of life care, informing a national review of the Liverpool Care Pathway and resultant recommendations for national policy and practice. 4) Enabling national and European policy makers' understanding of key issues in end of life decision-making for people who lack capacity and for whom sedation for symptom control at the end of life is required. 5) Raising awareness of the gap in policy surrounding nursing practice in anticipatory prescriptions in end of life care and the need to undertake applied research informing interventions to improve community palliative care practice.

In such circumstances, continuous sedation may be used to decrease consciousness until death occurs. In this study we: \no Explored the history of the practice of continuous sedation until death and the ethical challenges reported in the literature, since 1945. \no Interviewed 17 doctors and 25 nurses, in the context of 22 patient case studies, to understand how they make decisions to use sedation in end of life care and how they experience their practice. \no Interviewed 8 bereaved relatives to understand their experience of end of life care. \no Compared our data with parallel studies in Belgium and the Netherlands and undertook a secondary analysis of survey data in the three countries. \n\nSedation in end of life care is associated with intense ethical conjecture. In spite of a move towards guidelines, the practice is defined in different ways, with international variation in implementation. Clinicians in the UK describe sedation as a 'side effect' of their intent to control symptoms, are concerned not to hasten death and seek to build consensus about the best path of action when managing suffering. UK nurses have significant responsibility for deciding when to commence medications prescribed in advance of symptoms and need education about the ethical dimensions of their practice. Bereaved relatives perceive adequate symptom control as an essential aspect of protecting the person's dignity. There are some similarities as well as important differences between UK, Dutch and Belgian practice. The project is making significant contributions to empirical understanding in interdisciplinary end-of-life care research across the disciplines of sociology, medicine, bioethics and nursing. It can enable cross cultural understanding, since it was undertaken in parallel with studies in Belgium and the Netherlands, building on an ESRC exchange fellowship in 2003. We have demonstrated systematic variation in end of life care sedation practice and its conceptualization in the UK, Belgium and the Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
