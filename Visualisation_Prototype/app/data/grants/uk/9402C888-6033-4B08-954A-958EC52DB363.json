{"id":"9402C888-6033-4B08-954A-958EC52DB363","title":"The contractarian account of company law: does it fit the UK?","abstractText":"For more than three decades, much of the literature exploring the nature of the company, and of company law, has been dominated by 'contractarian' analysis. This, essentially, sees the company as a 'nexus' of contracts between those various parties who are involved in a company's affairs. Similarly, it also seeks to explain company law in contractual terms. The law, it is argued, can best be undestood as a set of 'standard terms' which may be excluded by corporate actors (shareholders, directors, creditors, and so forth) who prefer to regulate their affairs by rules different from those offered by company law. Moreover, the content of these standard (but excludable) rules proffered by the law should be fashioned by the criterion of 'efficiency' - meaning, typically, that they should be designed to maximise the aggregate wealth of the parties. \\n\\nThe contractarian theory has, however, built up over many years, with contributions from a variety of authors offering subtly nuanced versions of the theory. One task of the research, then, is to identify clearly the current contours of this theory, including the sources of conflict and disagreement between its various proponents. Moreover, we must distinguish between a contractarian theory of the company itself, and a theory of company law. The research will aim to examine the logical relationship which proponents of contractarian thinking draw between these two separate phenomena. \\n\\nHaving done that, the research will then ask whether this theory 'fits' UK company law well: does it provide a compelling explanation of that law? This question is particularly timely, for UK company law has recently been subject to a major reform and restatement, following the UK Government's 'Modern Company Law Review', which culminated in the massive Companies Act 2006. Improving efficiency, cutting red-tape, and increasing flexibility were all offered as objectives of that review, and of the legislation to which it gave rise. All this seems, at first sight at least, to be grist to the mill of contractarians. The project will attempt a more considered judgement whether this legislation, and the general body of UK company law, can indeed now be explained in these contractarian terms. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G003114/1","grantId":"AH/G003114/1","fundValue":"20129","fundStart":"2009-01-19","fundEnd":"2009-04-18","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Andrew Riley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
