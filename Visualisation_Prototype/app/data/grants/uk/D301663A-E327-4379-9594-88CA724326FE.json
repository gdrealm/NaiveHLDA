The UK ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC) in 1990, but while there have been some legislative developments in other parts of the UK in relation to children’s rights, in Northern Ireland this has not been the case. The project is a knowledge exchange and impact generating activity which seeks to build upon recent research carried out by Queen’s University Belfast on behalf of NICCY (Byrne and Lundy 2011) which identified significant barriers to effective delivery for children in Northern Ireland. The objectives of the project are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Develop a policy briefing and facilitate stakeholder engagement on legislative mechanisms for implementing children’s rights in Northern Ireland</li>\n\n <li>Inform policy and practice with respect to the implementation of children’s rights in Northern Ireland.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In particular, the project will help to inform the development of children’s rights legislation in Northern Ireland through stakeholder engagement, workshops and critical analysis of the existing evidence base around the implementation of the CRC in domestic law. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020532/1","grantId":"ES/J020532/1","fundValue":"43527","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bronagh  Byrne","coPersons":["L  Lundy"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
