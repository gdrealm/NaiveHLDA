Its genome has been fully sequenced, and basic biological mechanisms operating in C.elegans frequently parallel those in man, and thus results obtained from C.elegans have been instrumental in providing a detailed insight into human biology and physiology. As any other living organism, C.elegans obtains essential nutrients from the environment whilst avoiding being poisoned by noxious compounds. However, some elements are essential at low concentrations, but toxic at elevated levels. The heavy metal zinc, for example, is indispensable to virtually all biological processes, and zinc deficiency has been documented to have deleterious effects on reproduction, growth, and development. Similarly, copper, although usually present in biological systems at lower amounts than zinc, is equally essential to many biological processes, such as energy production and the formation of cartilage and connective tissue. Both heavy metals underlie a stringent control as excess amounts are highly toxic. A promising player in the control of available levels of essential metals is the family of Metallothioneins (MTs), small metal-binding proteins that are present in all higher life forms (plants, fungi and animals). However, even after a five decade spanning time period since its discovery, the precise biological role(s) of mammalian MTs remain enigmatic. One persisting hurdle is the presence of over 20 different genes within the human genome, and at least four in the genome of the mouse. In consequence, it has been very difficult to pin down an isoform specific function for each MT. In contrast, the fully sequenced C.elegans genome has only two isoforms. In previous work by one of the applicants, it was shown that both genes (individually or together) decrease the susceptibility towards heavy metal poisoning. In addition, cadmium, copper and zinc trigger the expression of both mtl-1 and mtl-2 in the cells of the worm's gut. However, mtl-1 is notably expressed at all times in the pharynx suggesting a role as a metal (possibly zinc) sensor. A particular point of interest is the difference between the two genes and the corresponding proteins, namely mtl-1's 15 additional residues in its C-terminus, three of which are capable of binding metal ions. We propose to use cutting-edge molecular biology, genetic and whole animal life-cycle parameters to study the differential functions of the two proteins with particular focus on the 15 C-terminal residues. In parallel, we will exhaustively characterise the metal binding properties of both proteins, and also determine their 3-dimensional structures, as we believe that biomolecules and their function can only be understood with a detailed knowledge of their structure and the molecular mechanisms of their action. The two labs are experts in either of the two areas, and we are convinced that through our interaction we will achieve a level of knowledge and understanding that would otherwise be impossible to obtain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E025099/1","grantId":"BB/E025099/1","fundValue":"269049","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Sturzenbaum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
