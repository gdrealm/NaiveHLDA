{"id":"A1836C3C-738F-4B4C-BE5B-CDF63E9FBF64","title":"Pedestrian Interaction with Lively Low-Frequency Structures","abstractText":"The expectation for high-quality infrastructure and improved quality of life is at its highest point in contemporary society. At the same time the world is experiencing fast urbanisation, pressure on natural resources and ambitious requirements to provide a sustainable built environment. Structural engineers are responding by utilising high-strength materials and designing more efficient and lighter structures. Coupled with innovations in structural forms and aesthetics, all these factors lead towards lighter and therefore 'livelier' (i.e. more vibration prone) structures. Examples of known (lively) footbridges, building floors and staircases affected by excessive vibrations and unfit for the intended purpose are numerous, despite the tendency to keep the problematic cases far from the public eye due to damaging commercial reputations to those involved.\n\nIt is generally accepted now that vibration serviceability requirements are governing the design and determining the cost of these structures, many of which are exposed and suffer from the dynamic excitation induced by human walking. Publicity of the infamous excessive sway of the Millennium Bridge, London, under crowd loading ten years ago, and subsequent expensive retrofitting, demonstrated an urgent need to develop fundamental understanding of pedestrian behaviour on lively low-frequency structures. While research into pedestrian interaction with laterally swaying bridges has since intensified, the interaction with a more frequent class of structures that are prone to excessive vibrations in the vertical direction has been progressed little.\n\nThe aim of this project is to characterise the interaction between pedestrians and low-frequency structures that are lively in the vertical direction. The interaction occurs because humans are highly sophisticated and sensitive dynamic systems who react to and adapt to the surrounding (vibrating) environment. Current understanding of this phenomenon is limited and consequently it is ignored in design guidelines. However, it is this understanding that is necessary for achieving high-quality infrastructure fit for intended use. This project will make significant contribution in this direction through two novel developments:\n\nI) A unique experimental facility consisting of a low-frequency structure and equipment for monitoring both human locomotion and the structural vibration will be developed. This will overcome the current lack of suitable facilities of this kind and it will enable the collection of a comprehensive set of data that characterises human behaviour on lively structures.\n\nII) Based on experimental observations, a numerical model of the interaction between humans and the structure will be developed. \n\nThe outputs of this project will significantly enhance understanding of structural vibration performance in operating conditions leading to more efficient and controllable design.\n\nAlthough this two-year project will be focussed on studying the human-structure interaction, the facility to be developed will represent an essential experimental platform for future multidisciplinary research collaborations. This will extend the legacy of this project beyond the date of its completion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I03839X/1","grantId":"EP/I03839X/1","fundValue":"90239","fundStart":"2011-10-20","fundEnd":"2014-04-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Warwick Bridge structure is an essential part of collaborative research with other research organisations, as specified in the Collaborations and Partnerships section. \nThe scientific findings are expected to have impact after completion of the publishing cycle, currently under way.

A unique experimental facility for studying how people interact with lively bridge structures was developed. A 20m long laboratory bridge (the Warwick Bridge) was built and instrumented so that motion of both human and structure could be monitored.\n\n2. Experiments with test subjects walking on the lively bridge were perfomed and results were compared against benchmark experiments perfomed on a rigid surface, to chracterise human-structure interaction. Temporal and spatial parameters of human locomotion were statistically modelled.\n\n3. A numerical model of human walking locomotion on vibrating bridge decks was developed. The research outcomes can be used to inform future design guidelines for footbridge and floor structures. The research will form fundation for further development of reliable pedestrian loading models for slender structures.\n\nIn addition, the Warwick Bridge will be or is already being used for teaching structural dynamics, and additional collaborative studies on human interaction with structures, vibration control, vibration perception, structural monitoring and as a benchmark structure for verification of numerical models for force/system identification.
