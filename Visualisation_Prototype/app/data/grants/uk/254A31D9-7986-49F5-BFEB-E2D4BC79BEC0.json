Global demand for natural resources and the decreasing area of arable land are driving up the costs of energy and food. Therefore, it is of great importance to increase current crop production in a sustainable manner. Minimizing agricultural losses from pathogens will substantially increase crop yield and decrease the cost of food production. \nDuring the last decades the field of plant-microbe interactions has made impressive progress revealing the basic architecture of the immune system. We now know that through evolution, plants have developed resistance (R) genes encoding immune receptors that recognize pathogen-derived elicitor molecules to activate immunity. Currently our main strategy to combat diseases in field conditions is the deployment of resistance (R) genes in crops. This resistance is often rapidly overcome in agriculture by evolving pathogen populations. However, our understanding of R genes mediated plant immunity is still in its infancy, and many important questions remain open. There is very little known about host immune mechanisms beyond pathogen recognition by R proteins. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are one group of enzymes activated by R proteins. In eukaryotes, MAPKs exist in cascades that are necessary for functional immunity. R proteins can initiate activation of MAPKs cascades but the molecular mechanisms controlling this activation are completely unknown. Understanding the molecular mechanisms bridging the gap between activated R proteins and downstream MAPKs will be a vital step into engineering plants with durable resistance. \nIn work leading to this proposal we identified MAPKs as part of an R protein complex in tomato. This is the first time that MAPKs have been shown to be part of a resistance complex and gives us a clear picture of a molecular mechanism bridging the gap between activated R proteins and downstream signaling in a crop plant. This proposal aims to use this tomato R protein complex as a model for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating MAPKs activation within the resistance complexes. We will use this knowledge to investigate the existence of a similar mechanism in other R protein complexes initially in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in future work in crop plants","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L019345/1","grantId":"BB/L019345/1","fundValue":"366275","fundStart":"2014-10-28","fundEnd":"2017-10-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project started last month so we did not have the opportunity to use any of the findings yet.
