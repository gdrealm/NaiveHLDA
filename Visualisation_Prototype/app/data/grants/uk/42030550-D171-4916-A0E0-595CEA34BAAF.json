These&nbsp;enabled a rapid expansion of industrial production in 1934-6, improvement in the very low living standards and the partial recovery of agriculture. But in 1937-9 the mass repressions, and intensive rearmament in face of the German and Japanese threat, resulted in a decline in the rate of economic growth and a further period of deprivation for the population.</p> \n<p>The project will examine the mutual impact of Soviet state economic policy, development and structure in these years, using recently declassified archival material, newspapers and other publications. Case studies will be combined with a survey of economic development during the period in order to show the limitations and strengths of dictatorial state management of the economy.</p> \n<p>The data and findings will be of interest to general historians of communism and of developing economies, and for courses in twentieth century history.</p> \n<p>They will be presented in <em>Terror, Growth and the Threat of War</em> – the sixth and final volume of Davies’ series on Soviet industrialisation, to be written jointly with Dr Oleg Khlevnyuk (Moscow) and Professor Stephen Wheatcroft (Melbourne).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1443","grantId":"RES-000-22-1443","fundValue":"36457","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"R  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
