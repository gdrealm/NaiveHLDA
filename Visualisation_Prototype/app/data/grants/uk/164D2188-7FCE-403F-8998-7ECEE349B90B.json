{"id":"164D2188-7FCE-403F-8998-7ECEE349B90B","title":"Derivation of clinical grade embryonic stem cell lines in Manchester","abstractText":"During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment many eggs and embryos fail to develop normally and are unsuitable for clinical use and routinely discarded at an early stage. Other embryos are frozen for future use. The purpose of this research is to use these eggs and embryos, with appropriate patient consent, to make human embryonic stem cells. Embryo stem cells are special cells that appear to be able to develop into all cells found in the body. As such they can be used to study early embryo development, how specialized cells form or deteriorate, to test drugs for toxicity, or for therapeutic use in the treatment of degenerative disease or tissue damage. Although many human embryonic stem cell ?lines? exist throughout the world, these are all research grade and are unlikely to be suitable for treatment of diseases. The aim of the proposed research is therefore to make new embryonic stem cells under highly regulated and clinically clean conditions, suitable for transplantation. We have new IVF and stem cell laboratories built and run to these standards and the current proposal requests funding to maintain and run these facilities in order to maximise the production of clinical grade embryonic stem cells. These new cell lines will be deposited in the UK Stem Cell Bank and any clinical treatments and commercial exploitation organised by Central Manchester NHS Trust and the University of Manchester together with the Medical Research Council.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801057","grantId":"G0801057","fundValue":"1251280","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel R Brison","coPersons":["Susan Jane Kimber"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
