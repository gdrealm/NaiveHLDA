It has long been known that viruses containing genomes which have been significantly deleted can interfere with the replication of fully infectious virus. We have generated a specific interfering virus using molecular cloning techniques. Studies in mice have shown that exposure to this interfering virus does not generate disease but confers protection against a range of different influenza viruses. We intend to characterise the nature of the interfering virus genome and investigate the mechanism by which the interfering virus works. We will also study some fundamental characteristics of the interfering virus to determine the optimal method of production and stability. The interfering virus is a new approach to generating antiinfluenza drugs and, if successful, this would offer protection against a wide range of different strains, potentially including avian influenza virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600832","grantId":"G0600832","fundValue":"614257","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Easton","coPersons":["Anthony Colin Marriott","Nigel John Dimmock"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
