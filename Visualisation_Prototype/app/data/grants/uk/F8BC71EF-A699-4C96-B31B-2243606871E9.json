However as yet there is not equivalent of a breathalyser for narcotics. The team at the University of Birmingham (UoB) have developed a prototype system that enables such tests to be carried out by the roadside. This project aims to develop the UoB into a commercially viable system by incorporating a novel dye based technology developed by Sirigen Ltd. The unique chemistry behind these dyes will allow the UoB system to increase the number of narcotics that can be detected in each test to match market need.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I502025/1","grantId":"EP/I502025/1","fundValue":"104736","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To develop a new biological assay format that provides a flexible solution to detecting specific targets (e.g. pathogens, explosives etc).
