By 1965, over 100 industrial chaplains operated throughout industrial Scotland across a range of industries from heavy engineering and shipbuilding to biscuit making and whisky distilling. Many of these Industrial Chaplains were perfectly placed to bear witness to Scotland’s traumatic and painful process of deindustrialisation, as the country’s old staple industries faltered in the face of changing markets and foreign competition. This deindustrialisation process, combined with a break up of traditional industry-linked working-class areas, added another dynamic to the complexities of a changing society.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>To gain an understanding of&nbsp; the scope, dynamics and changing nature of the Church’s industrial mission&nbsp; this research will combine an extensive assessment of a broad range of written sources – including the papers of the Home Mission Board from 1940-79; Reports to the General Assembly; Reports of the Home Board (Church and Industry); Church and Nation Committee; Youth Committee and the Commission on Communism – with the interviewing of several Industrial Chaplains, together with employers and workers who had experience of the industrial mission.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2203","grantId":"RES-000-22-2203","fundValue":"53858","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronald James Johnston","coPersons":["Elaine Wilson McFarland"],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
