{"id":"3302EA14-2F47-4853-84BA-16EC5C349184","title":"Associate Scientist for the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre","abstractText":"The XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC) was established to ensure that the scientific potential of observations using the European Space Agency's cornerstone XMM-Newton X-ray observatory can be exploited fully by the broad scientific community. The SSC is a European UK-led activity that is developing software for users and for the initial processing of all data from the XMM-Newton satellite, is undertaking that initial processing, is creating comprehensive X-ray source catalogues, and is undertaking a follow-up identification programme using ground-based optical telescopes to facilitate the science that can be obtained from large samples of X-ray sources. The SSC is thus vital to the success of the mission. Professor Worrall is a member of the XMM-Newton SSC team in the capacity of Associate Scientist. This application requests the necessary resources for her to fulfil her responsibilities, which include providing independent advice to the development team concering the data products and X-ray identification activities. The travel and subsistence requested will allow her to interact with team members through participation in the semi-annual meetings of the Science Advisory Group and X-ray Identification Working Group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001610/1","grantId":"PP/E001610/1","fundValue":"7410","fundStart":"2007-09-20","fundEnd":"2010-12-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Already by the end of the grant period the 2XMM catalogue had resulted in 13 refereed papers (based on NASA ADS abstract search for keyword 2XMM) with 130 citations. There are very many more since. XMM-Newton is ongoing, and is one of the most highly cited space observatories ever.

The XMM software is publicly available, and routines and methods could be adapted for future missions. The catalogues can be used broadly, for example to correlate X-ray properties of the astronomical sources with properties in other wavebands.
