{"id":"448667F2-AD34-45B9-BBAA-8A7090D30290","title":"Live cell imaging for infectious disease research","abstractText":"In the past, the analysis of the cellular events and molecular interactions of pathogens with their hosts was limited by the availability of suitable antibodies to detect particular proteins, or by inference from biochemical studies. These approaches, however, represent experimental 'autopsies' in which dynamic cellular processes must be deduced from a fixed sample. Developments in the imaging of molecular events in live cells, however, now mean that it is possible to follow, in real time, the location, movement and interactions of molecules within cells, and the interactions between cells- for example when a virus or bacterium infects cells of the body. These developments have been made possible by the engineering and expression within cells of proteins fused to naturally fluorescent proteins and by improvements in microscope technology. In particular, current confocal microscope systems enable both conventional high resolution positioning of proteins within fixed samples and the detection of fluorescent proteins in live samples under conditions that limit the cell damage that results from fluorescence illumination. The application of live cell imaging technology is particularly powerful for analysis of the interactions of a pathogen with its host, or host cell. Recently, it has become technically possible to engineer infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites to express one or more proteins conjugated to a fluorescent protein. When combined with existing technology for the expression of distinct fluorescent proteins within a mammalian host cell, it is possible to track molecular interactions between the pathogen and host, or track the infection pathway as a pathogen moves through distinct host cellular compartments, for example. These technologies have very wide ranging applications in infectious disease research, with researchers comprising this application being interested in such diverse processes as: - The complete interactions of viral proteins with other viral proteins and the proteins of the host cell. - The use of fluorescently labelled viruses to track the infection process in host cells and tissues. - The presentation of antigens by antibody producing cells to the immune system and the signalling events and protein interactions of immune effector and regulatory cells. - The infection process, developmental biology and evolutionary strategies of protozoan pathogens such as Leishmania, trypanosomes and malaria. The advantage of this technology- the ability to image live pathogens and their interactions with host cells- also presents a limitation- the need for safe containment of the pathogen. In consequence facilities available routinely in University departments are not available for use with infectious agents. This application proposes to establish a live cell imaging facility for infectious agents housed under suitable conditions for effective and safe containment. The equipment requested, a Leica TMC-SP5, has the capability for high resolution imaging of fixed and live samples and of high-speed capture, at excellent resolution, of dynamic cellular events. The equipment will be available to a large group of researchers contained within the Centre for Infectious Diseases at the University of Edinburgh, and provide a high-end facility with the potential to encourage resource, technology and knowledge sharing among a far wider group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012442/1","grantId":"BB/E012442/1","fundValue":"242416","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant funded a general user facility for confocal imaging of pathogens and other cells in the Institute for Immunology and Infection Research, University of Edinburgh.\nThe facility description is as follows:\n\nThe scanhead (SP5C) is equipped with three photo multiplier tubes (Hamamatsu R 9624).
