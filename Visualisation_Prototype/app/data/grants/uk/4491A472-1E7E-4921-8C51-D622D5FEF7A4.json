The regulatory response, ensuring aviation safety, depends on dispersion models. The accuracy of the dispersion predictions depend on the intensity of the eruption, on the model representation of the plume dynamics and the physical properties of the ash and gases in the plume. Better characterisation of these processes and properties will require detailed observations and modelling of the near-source plume region. This project will bring to bear observations and modelling in order to achieve more accurate and validated dispersion predictions. The investigation will seek to integrate the volcanological and atmospheric science methods in order to initiate a complete system model of atmospheric processes. This study will integrate new modelling and insights into the dynamics of the volcanic plume and its gravitational equilibration in the stratified atmosphere, effects of meteorological conditions, physical and chemical behaviour of ash particles and gases, physical and chemical in situ measurements, ground-based remote sensing and satellite remote sensing of the plume with very high resolution numerical computational modelling. When integrated with characterisations of the emissions themselves, the research will lead to enhanced predictive capability. The Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull eruption is ongoing despite the pause in magma extrusion.. Furthermore, all three historical eruptions of Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull were followed by eruptions of the much larger Katla volcano. At least two other volcanic systems in Iceland are 'primed' ready to erupt. This project will ensure that the science and organisational lessons learned from the April/May 2010 response to Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull are translated fully into preparedness for a further eruption of any other volcano over the next 18 months. Overall, the project will (a) complete the analysis of atmospheric data from the l/May eruption, (b) prepare for future observations and forecasting if there is another eruption before the end of 2011 and (c) make additional observations if there is another eruption.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I015477/1","grantId":"NE/I015477/1","fundValue":"229955","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Small low cost electrochemical sensors have been developed to detect SO2 from volcanic sources from the ground and UAVs.
