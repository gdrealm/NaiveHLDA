{"id":"CF6A1F23-F477-4FF3-9ADA-C3F77BF4277D","title":"Technical development of a novel vaccine vehicle for cattle pathogens","abstractText":"Trypanosoma theileri is a ubiquitous single celled organism present in cattle herds worldwide. Using knowledge of gene expression and protein trafficking in other trypanosomatid organisms, we have successfully developed T. theileri as a delivery system for vaccine antigens and therapeutics. Following recommendations from several Animal Health companies, we now aim to develop and demonstrate the potential of T. theileri as an effective and practical vaccine-vehicle, providing a clear route to commercialisation.\n\nIn a two-step development path, Phase 1 will focus on technical refinements and analysis of the viability of the vaccine-vehicle during storage and distribution. The flexibility of the system to express antigens from a range of pathogens will also be established. Phase 2 will entail confirmation of the in vivo efficacy of the refinements developed in Phase 1.\n\nCombined the experiments will address key hurdles to the commercial development of this patented vaccine system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L02442X/1","grantId":"BB/L02442X/1","fundValue":"305156","fundStart":"2014-10-27","fundEnd":"2016-10-26","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith Roland Matthews","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" This project has just started as of October 2014 and so there are no outputs to date Our research programme aims to evaluate and develop a novel system for the sustained delivery of an unlimited range of pathogen antigens specific to cattle. Being defined and characterised in terms of their immunogenicity, vaccinated and diseased animals are able to be identified and distinguished. Moreover, the technology proposed has economic advantages over the existing expensive and labour-intensive production of attenuated vaccines. This offers clear advantages to the agricultural and animal healthcare industry at large.\n\n The proposal will develop early-stage work, with substantial commitment from an Industrial Partner, to demonstrate utility and provide the required scientific validation to stimulate further development in an industrial setting with the partner company.\n\nThe proposal fulfils the strategic remit of the animal sciences panel with respect to: \n \nThe 'control of infectious diseases', (priority area) comprising 'identification of protective antigens', 'vaccinology' and 'improved antigen delivery systems'. Strategic plan objectives for 'Sustainable Agriculture' comprise 'host/pathogen interactions', 'animal welfare' and the 'control of animal diseases'.
