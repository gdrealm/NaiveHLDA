Close consideration will be given to the relationship between the semantic fields used in such metaphors and Franco-Italian relations during the period, and to Estienne's role in the development of linguistic purism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112814/1","grantId":"112814/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Cowling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
