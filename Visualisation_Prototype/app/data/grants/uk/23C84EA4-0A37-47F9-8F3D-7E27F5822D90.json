Indeed, the most relevant research in this area dates back to the 1970s. Particularly lacking is research on the contribution of cultural consumption to the promotion of elements of culture such as traditional music, dance, literature, performance and visual arts. Nor has there been significant research on the role of such events in sustaining minority languages. \n\nThe research will focus on two Eisteddfodau, which hold many contrasts in terms of the cultural values they hold. The National Eisteddfod of Wales (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru) welcomes around 160,000 visitors each year and was first held in its current format in 1861 (although the tradition itself can be traced back to 1176). The National Eisteddfod runs annually each August, usually for eight days, and comprises a vast number of events and competitions. Indeed, the audience is very broad, with many cultural forms included. This Eisteddfod moves around Wales, alternating between the north and the south of the country, thereby impacting on different local communities each time. Its aims are to promote culture, linguistics and citizenship in conjunction with local economic stimulation (http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk). In contrast, the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod (Eisteddfod Gerddorol Ryngwladol Llangollen) has approximately 120,000 visitors per year, taking place always in Llangollen for six days in July. These visitors come from all over the world. Established in 1947, with participants from over 50 nations taking part, the International Eisteddfod aims to promote culture and world peace (http://international-eisteddfod.co.uk/). \n\nThe proposed research will be innovative in two major respects. First, the project seeks to reconceptualise the way in which cultural values are understood. Rather than to view cultural values as a reflection of the 'worth' of the cultural activity to the economy, the approach adopted seeks to determine the worth of the cultural activity more broadly in terms of peoples' individual and national identities, social capital formation and use, cultural diversity and understanding, and the promotion of cultural forms such as those practiced at Eisteddfodau (including the use of the Welsh language). As such, the project speaks to three components of value: (1) reflective individuals and engaged society, (2) urban regeneration and community dynamics and (3) understanding the context of international relationships. \n\nSecondly, the project will evaluate such values empirically using two Eisteddfodau that have contrasting purposes, formats, participants and audiences. Comparison of these two Eisteddfodau will help gain a better understanding of how people define their identity, their role in society and their sense of belonging in a community through their cultural consumption. For example, the International Eisteddfod is held every year at Llangollen, yet the National Eisteddfod is hosted in different locations around the country. The participant/visitor effects on local communities are likely to be different as a result. Both Eisteddfodau also have 'qualifying' heats in the regions of Wales in the case of the National Eisteddfod, or different nations in the case of the International Eisteddfod. With regard to understanding how cultural is promoted to national and international audiences, the use of two Eisteddfodau are also likely to be very different. Indeed, the two Eisteddfodau have markedly different audiences, with the International Eisteddfod having a worldwide audience and participation emphasis, while the National Eisteddfod has a mainly Welsh focus. This allows the effects of participation and consumption to be compared and contrasted at the two different levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L00495X/1","grantId":"AH/L00495X/1","fundValue":"32135","fundStart":"2013-07-10","fundEnd":"2014-02-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  A one-day symposium was held in January 2014 to showcase the results of this research in conjunction with three other cultural value researchers .

Thus far, three research outputs have been generated. In addition, a one-day symposium and a poster presentation have all showcased the research. It is planned that more will be generated. \n\nThe findings in this report contribute to the debate about cultural value in three main ways. Firstly, the project exemplifies the merits of a flexible, non-price approach to measuring cultural value. Secondly, the approach adopted in this research allows for a complex, multi-layered understanding of consumption types and associated values. Thirdly, the research moves to further develop understanding of cultural capital, as seen through the effects of the event on individuals and the transmission of these values to wider society. Fourthly, the research demonstrates that culture has value: even if the events do not make a financial gain or significant economic impact, they make a considerable difference to people’s lives and well-being in non-monetary terms.\n\nThe approach taken in this research was a mixed methods one. While this approach has been championed in areas such as marketing, few prior studies in the area of value have operationalised the approach. Indeed, until recently many adopted a quantitative approach using a single measurement item (that being monetary units). By using a five dimensional value construct this project has been able to make a further analysis of the meaning of cultural value: what it is and why it is important. Approaches that use contingent valuation or similar single measures of value are not able to provide this depth of analysis. \n\nBy including measures that allow participants to self-report why they are at the event, the research has been able to analyse how values differ among different types of attendee. The findings indicate that participants, their family, general audience members, staff and ‘others’ express significantly different levels of value. Not only this, the make-up of their value is also different between the various groups. Hence, this research has been able to show that different attendee groups value the cultural experience differently. This is in sharp contrast to previous studies that have attempted to achieve a aggregate view of value. The present research suggests that this is not applicable and that value is best studied at disaggregated level. \n\nA further benefit of the flexible approach used in this study is that it enables the researcher to analyse how value is transmitted to other people in society; those who do not attend such cultural events. This study has focused on both traditional word-of-mouth and electronic word-of-mouth (or ‘word of mouse’ as it is sometimes called). As a result of the design, the research has been able to show how different consumers of culture, based on their nationality and attendance type, value and spread the word about the eisteddfodau differently. Again, this finding suggests that disaggregation of attendees to such events is warranted. One of the main academic contributions of this project relates the measurement scales used. A number of sets of scales were selected from the previous literature on the identification and measurement of culture value on the basis of their validity and reliability. They were then reallocated into thematic groups and duplicates (exact or effective) were removed. In this way, the project developed a synthesis of tried-and-tested measurement scales – the pick of the best – and applied them to the case of two major eisteddfodau.\n\nThe project also employed a mixed method approach, which enabled a process of ‘triangulation’ to take place between the various components of analysis which, in turn, helps to ensure the validity and reliability of the research. Thus, for example, the quantitative findings were verified through the interviews which, in turn, were supported through researcher observation at the events. \n\nOverall, the research indicates that cultural events play a significant role in a number of areas of society, and that the values derived from them and transmitted by participants in them plays a significant role and is valuable to society. \n\nThe research demonstrates significant differences with regards to value between consumption groups (why people attend), the event attended (international/National) and nationality. The disaggregated analysis on the basis of five value dimensions contributes a better understanding of where, and perhaps, why perceived cultural value is different between these groups. The way that value is transmitted, and its effect on a person’s identity, national cultural understanding and understanding of Wales, are also analysed at the level. Again, this enables the differences in overall value to be decomposed and analysed at a smaller level, allowing for greater depth of understanding. The significant differences between these groups in terms in cultural value, and its relationships with the other constructs measured, provides powerful insights for academia and practitioners, including not just the organisers of the eisteddfodau but those in charge of other cultural events.
