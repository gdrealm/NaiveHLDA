The ADLS worked closely with government departments, the Information Commissioner's Office and academic researchers.\n\nThe ADLS produced a number of key resources and services to help meet its objectives including:\n\n1. A dedicated website providing comprehensive information on administrative data across the UK (www.adls.ac.uk).\n\n2. Produced a series of guides and publications on the laws as it applies to administrative data based research.\n\n3. Produced and delivered a Safe Researcher training course providing researchers with the basic skills to use administrative data in a responsible manner. The course was endorsed by a wide variety of government departments and accredited for access to NHS Scotland and Scottish Government administrative data. Over 400 researchers were trained.\n\n4. Provided a helpdesk to respond to queries from both the academic community and data controllers.\n\n5. Developed a user database of over 5000 people interested in the use of administrative data in the UK. \n\n6. Produced libraries for UK administrative data publications and methods, models and codes used in administrative data research.\n\nMuch of the work of the Administrative Data Liaison Service will now be incorporated into the ESRC's Administrative Data Research Network.

The service also promoted the potential use of administrative data for research within the academic community. The ADLS worked closely with government departments to help them understand the importance of the sharing and use of their administrative data for research.\n\nThe service provided researcher training, conferences, metadata catalogues, disclosure risk analysis and produced a wide variety of administrative data related guidance and publications.\n\nMoving forward the ADLS played a key role in the Administrative Data Taskforce, formed in December 2011 by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome Trust, and chaired by Sir Alan Langlands, which recommended the formation of a Administrative Data Research Network. The ADLS provided the ADT with working papers, surveys, adhoc information and a set of potential infrastructure designs. Much of the work of the Administrative Data Liaison Service will now be incorporated into the ESRC's Administrative Data Research Network. This includes training course materials, administrative data catalogues / metadata and legal guidance. Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
