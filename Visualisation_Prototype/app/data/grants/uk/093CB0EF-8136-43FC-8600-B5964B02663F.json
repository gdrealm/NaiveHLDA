The award has allowed transfer of in vitro digestion models developed through BBSRC funding to the Indian researchers. Knowledge on the impact of chapatti formulation on in vitro glycaemic response has been established and provides new approaches to developing chapatti formulations with reduced glycaemic response which may have application for use in the UK.\n &amp;gt; The conclusions of the partnership following a workshop involving UK-based and Indian researchers held in Pune, December 2013 were that there was value in comparing the burden of chronic disease in UK S Asians and S Asians living in India. Lessons can be learned by Indian researchers from the UK situation where changes in diet and sourcing of food ingredients are resulting in health-related inequalities in the S Asian population in the UK relative to the rest of the UK population. A manuscript is being drafted for publication in the peer reviewed literature entitled &amp;quot;Food and nutrition and health inequalities in relation to chronic disease - the Asian Enigma&amp;quot; led by Dr Vanessa Garcia Larssen (Imperial College). Co-authors include Indian and UK based researchers and covers \n&amp;gt; Diet-related chronic diseases affecting S Asians\n&amp;gt; Changing diets and nutrition in relation to health inequalities\n&amp;gt; The role of food production and processing and in diet preventing food-related chronic disease\n&amp;gt; Food processing and bioaccessiblity of nutrients (1) Through the project partnership a workshop was held on 20th September 2011 at the Neasden Hindu Temple, London attended by IPA partners from the UK (UNIMAN, Imperial College), Hindu clerics, and UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) to consider matters relating to the safety of Pan (covered in the UK by the FSA, and the issues relating to the production of milk from cloned cows (a novel food) which had been recently approved in 2011.

This informed the Indian nutrition community about the emergence of food allergies in the UK, a food-related public health problem that might emerge in future in India. She was also invited to give a talk at the Indian Toxicology Institute about food allergy studies and assessing allergenic risk in novel foods, such as GMOs. This is being taken forward through a successful application to the British Council UK-India seminar on &amp;quot;Protein nutrition and novel protein ingredients in the 21st century - tackling the &quot;protein problem&quot;&amp;quot; . This funding will allow five Indian researchers, from the network formed through the BBSRC IPA to come to the UK in January 2015 with a view to developing synergistic projects in the UK and India to tackle this important topic.
