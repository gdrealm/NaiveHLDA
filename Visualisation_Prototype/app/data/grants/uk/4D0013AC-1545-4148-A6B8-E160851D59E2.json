The entire project:\n- Create an exciting new piece of immersive, interactive theatre\n- Develop innovative new pieces of science communication across STEM subjects relating to water and climate change, which can be re-used by collaborators after the show.\n- Develop an associated outreach project for local schools\n- Develop a teacher's pack, downloadable from Times Educational Supplement website, with all collaborators aimed at Key Stages 3/4. \n- Make a series of short films of each STEM section of the show to reach further audiences after the show. \n- Encourage excitement in STEM areas relating to water and climate change in all ages, particularly in audiences new to science communication - a target of 50% of all audiences is set for each production.\n- Create a greater understanding of climate change, and how societies can work together to prepare or prevent it, through bringing a number of STEM fields together in this innovative theatrical environment.\n\n\n2. The funding from STFC, all of the above, plus:\n- Create a section of the show about satellite technology and the study of Earth's atmosphere.\n- Collaborate with RAL Space and others for this piece of science communication and include scientists and engineers in this section of the show.\n- Work with scientists and engineers from RAL Space to assist their science communication skills, and how to reach new audiences, particularly in relation to working with the arts.\n- Bring new audiences, including schools, to the work of STFC funded organizations and projects.\n\nSTFC has funded, and continues to fund a great amount of research into Earth's atmosphere, particularly in attempting to understand Climate Change. We want to being this important and topical work to an audience that would not normally interact with science communication.\n\nImpacts:\n\nOur shows have achieved a number of impacts, these would be relevant to this new project:\n\n1. Help scientists and engineers create pieces of science communication, opening new methods and highlighting the benefits of science/theatre collaborations\n2. Give the audience a big picture understanding of Climate Change and Water related issues. By combining a number of science institutions and fields the audience will be given a cross-section of possibilities in the science and engineering realm, and how they feed off each other.\n3. Endeavour to change behaviours around personal water usage, by reaching schools and families with the digital technology and genuine science, delivered by passionate experts.\n4. Using theatre to communicate the work of RAL Space engineers, satellite technology and Earth's atmosphere, with an ambition to develop audiences' interests in related STEM subjects, especially students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002608/1","grantId":"ST/M002608/1","fundValue":"9922","fundStart":"2014-08-18","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andy  Franzkowiak","coPersons":["Alwyn Hugh  Mortimer"],"organisation":"LAStheatre C.I.C.","findingsText":" The work being carried out by RAL Space in relation to monitoring Climate Change.\n\nA collaborative approach to creating innovative science communication, using immersive theatre.\n\nThe use of Arts as a means to engage the public in scientific ideas, developments and methodology.
