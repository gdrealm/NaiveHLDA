The future is inherently uncertain because of climate, socio-economic and regulatory changes. Our research involved the integration of a cascade of uncertainty on water resource planning including: climate uncertainty, climate post-processing uncertainty, hydrological uncertainty, water resource model uncertainty and demand uncertainty. The research was applied to a water resource zone in Sussex in collaboration with Southern Water and Atkins. We found that post-processing uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty until the 2030s, but by the 2050s demand and socio-economic uncertainty becomes the dominant uncertainty. Despite the large climate post-processing uncertainty, the main hotspots of water deficits remains similar across the climate products and are driven by network bottlenecks and the continually high dependence of the system on water sources around the Hardham area. The research also indicates that inter-regional transfers might not be as reliable as assumed. The findings and research methods need to be digested, embraced and adjusted by water regulators (e.g., the Environment Agency and Ofwat) and other stakeholders (water companies, consultancies, etc.). These types of methods need to be applied more widely (e.g., in other sectors) to assess their wider utility for long-term planning under deep uncertainty. Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
