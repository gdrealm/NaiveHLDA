A variety of policies, services, programmes and guidelines are forwarded to this end. Public health law is potentially the most powerful of these tools and the project examines the efficacy of such legislative interventions.</p>\n\n<p>The research will provide a substantial empirical study on the effectiveness of health legislation, e.g.:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>prohibition of behaviour (eg smoking bans);</li>\n\n <li>required behaviour (motor cycle helmets);</li>\n\n <li>youth access restrictions (alcohol);</li>\n\n <li>and standard setting (health and safety regulation).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The evidence on the efficacy of such interventions is mixed, in both method and quality, and pulling it together requires both guile and rigour. Consequently, the project also contains a methodological element, using this case study to test out the effectiveness of a particular method of research review known as 'realist synthesis'. NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) will be the project partner.</p>\n\n<p>The review will be co-produced with and cross-examined by agency staff. The project will not carry any formal implications for NICE's future recommendations in this area. However, its independence from the standard procedures will contribute to the further development of the strategies used to develop evidence-based guidance</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0007","grantId":"RES-189-25-0007","fundValue":"95881","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Raymond Donald Pawson","coPersons":["Lesley  Owen","Geoffrey Richard Wong"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
