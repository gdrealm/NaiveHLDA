These activities will provide an inter-disciplinary forum for the discussion and showcasing of research skills amongst survey analysts across Scotland. The network will co-ordinate and facilitate methodological training for researchers. It will also provide opportunities for survey researchers in Scotland to meet, to deliver presentations and to engage in discussion. We envisage that these activities will greatly enhance the research infrastructure in the area of the analysis of social surveys. Research will be conducted through two avenues. Firstly, there will be ten seminars. We actively encourage researchers within the network to volunteer to present their work at meetings. The geographical organisation that we have in mind is one in which venues move around to increase participation. Therefore we also encourage researchers to offer their own institutions as venues for meetings. In addition to the seminars a series of master classes have been funded on the following topics â€“ Categorical Data Analysis; The Contribution of Multilevel Modelling; Structural Equation Modelling; Econometric Data Analysis; Correspondence Analysis; Missing Data. These master classes will be led my international experts in these methodological fields.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006248/1","grantId":"ES/E006248/1","fundValue":"32774","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Vernon  Gayle","coPersons":["Paul Stuart Lambert"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
