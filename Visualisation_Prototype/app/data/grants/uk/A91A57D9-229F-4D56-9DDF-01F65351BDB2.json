The fully calibrated pipelined products from the VDFS have been used across a broad range of astronomical research projects. Fully calibrated processed images and object catalogues form the basis of much observational astronomical research. As such they are widely used by the astronomical community to fully exploit their data. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other","dataset":"gtr"}
