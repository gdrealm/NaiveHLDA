{"id":"E5EEC02A-8844-4656-AA35-3DC3A0705B82","title":"Global - The Bristol Global Engagement Network","abstractText":"The University of Bristol is an international powerhouse of learning, discovery and enterprise. Its vision is of a university whose excellence is acknowledged locally, nationally and globally. International collaboration is key to realising our institutional mission, as outlined in our &quot;Vision and Strategy 2009-2016&quot;; to pursue and share knowledge and understanding, both for their own sake and to help individuals and society fulfil their potential. Our strategy for international research collaborations is founded upon the following guiding principles:\n\n1) Excellence: developing the range of expert perspectives available;\n2) Extent: increasing the reach and impact of the research undertaken;\n3) Efficiency: the spreading of cost and the building of capacity for the collaborative partners; \n4) Effectiveness: the ability to move more quickly and respond to new challenges.\n\nThe four-pronged Bristol Global Engagement Network outlined in this proposal will transform the way in which our scientists engage with global partners and will form the foundations upon which to capitalise on the practical benefits that accrue from vigorous international links: the tackling of global problems requiring global solutions; attracting world-leading international scientists and engineers to work in the UK; the benchmarking and raising of national UK standards that such collaborations implicitly define; adding value to the UK tax payer and funding bodies through the increased efficiency of pooling resources and the recruitment of the best young graduate students to become the next generation of leaders.\nThe proposed activity will more deeply embed a sustainable culture of global engagement into the University by encouraging our scientists and engineers to initiate and build upon international collaborations throughout all stages of their academic career. This will resonate particularly strongly with our junior researchers, including EPSRC-funded PhD students and research assistants, who will continue to engage with internationally excellent research groups throughout their time in research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004581/1","grantId":"EP/K004581/1","fundValue":"495596","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Guy  Orpen","coPersons":["Nishan  Canagarajah","Jon  Keating","Terence James McMaster"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" The Building Global Engagements in Research (BGER) grant exceeded original expectations, delivering an impressive range of collaborative outcomes and advancements. Four pathways helped to foster international research and the development of Bristol's global links and relationships:\n\n\n\nBuilding on the institutional framework with Kyoto University \n\nBGER supported the 1st Bristol-Kyoto symposium, a major event that hosted 90 Kyoto delegates. Continuing partnerships with Kyoto's Disaster Prevention Research Institute has developed several large projects. Collaborations in other areas of Bristol's EPSRC remit include the development of a global network, wider institutional links, broadening and cementing of researcher engagement.\n\n\n\nDeveloping existing bilateral partnerships\n\nThere was a unique high impact trip by Centre of Quantum Photonics to Boston, MIT and Harvard. A major 5 year grant between Bristol, Tsinghua and Zhejiang Universities around photonics has been awarded whilst access to Bristol's PhD training programmes by Electronic and Information Science and Engineering students from Zhejiang is under consideration. A delegation by NSQI to Japan has led to Bristol hosting the prestigious 7th Annual Nanobiotechnology Symposium later this year.\n\n\n\nPromoting nascent partnerships by supporting projects through a competitive internal fund\n\n28 projects across Bristol's EPSRC research portfolio demonstrated the advantages of embedding researchers in overseas labs and the benefits of global interactions to young researchers.\n\n\n\nDeveloping multilateral networks in key University of Bristol research areas\n\nThe Energy Aware Computing Network attended by 36 academic and industry participants opened up opportunities for future collaboration, including staff and student exchange and a widening scope of the network across the EU community\n\n\n\nOverall Benefits \n\nThe grant led to significant collaborative partnerships across the EPSRC remit, enabling Bristol researchers to advance their work. It also provided rare opportunities for young researchers and students to engage with international experts, increasing their skills, techniques and understanding. \n\n\n\nA universally reported theme was how the international engagements provided essential resources and access to leading labs, and reciprocally offered opportunities for the profile and expertise of Bristol researchers to be exploited on a global stage. \n\n\n\nAmong the sustainable pathways for ongoing collaboration are student exchange, Skype, conferences, workshops, projects and grant applications. Unexpected collaborations were reported as well as the strengthening of existing links. For some, international engagement either enabled or precipitated multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research.\n\n\n\nBGER in numbers\n\no 54 principal investigators were supported, many more through formal or informal networking.\n\no 18 early career researchers and 33 PhD students were directly involved in the projects. \n\no 4 grants awarded, 8 submitted and 22 in development\n\no 19: the number of future visits confirmed and personnel exchange programmes being developed\n\no 28 papers in preparation with 19 either published or submitted already\n\no 87 external partners from 16 countries were involved in the activities\n\no 6 departments, 5 schools and 8 centres or institutes were engaged in the projects\n\no 1st Bristol-Kyoto symposium involved over 90 delegates from Kyoto with more than 150 Bristol personnel engaged in 13 parallel workshops.
