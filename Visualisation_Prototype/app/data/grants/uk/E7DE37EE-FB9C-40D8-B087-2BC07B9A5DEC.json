Previous research has suggested that a disproportionately high number of the referrals made to the General Medical Council (GMC) by public bodies concerned doctors who qualified outside the UK. This project will investigate organisational attitudes towards these doctors as a possible contributing factor in determining how organisations deal with fitness to practise issues and the influences that lead to referral to the GMC.</p>\n\n<p>The project will develop methods to assess workplace discrimination, prejudice and attitudes towards diversity in healthcare organisations. It will be an exploratory study whose purpose is to develop an understanding of how racism might impact on the handling of medical performance issues in NHS organisations. The project will develop and pilot measures of organisational attitudes and practices that might be used to understand why there is an excess of referrals to the GMC from public bodies. Between two and three NHS trusts will be selected for the pilot study. </p>\n\n<p>The outcome will be a set of UK-adapted measures for the assessment of workplace discrimination, prejudice and attitudes towards diversity in healthcare organisations.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F039751/1","grantId":"ES/F039751/1","fundValue":"53986","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Aneez  Esmail","coPersons":["Debbie A Cohen","Caroline  Humphrey","Charlotte  Humphrey"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
