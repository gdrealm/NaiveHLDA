The aim was to examine the development of clarification strategies used by children in adverse communicative conditions. \nIn a first phase, extensive acoustic-phonetic analyses of the speech produced in the easy and difficult communicative conditions were carried out. Children's conversational speech tended to be more hyperarticulated than in adults, with a larger vowel space, slower articulation rate, higher intensity, higher pitch mean and range, potentially limiting further hyperarticulation in clear speaking styles. Child speakers made acoustic-phonetic adaptations to their speech in difficult communicative conditions but the extent of adaptations was not as great as that seen in adults, and, in the vocoder condition, children made use of certain strategies (increasing pitch range) unlikely to be helpful to counter the speech degradation, while adults used strategies that were more appropriate. The age effect was seen in terms of increasing hypoarticulation in the easy-listening condition rather than increased adaptations when communication was more difficult. \nThe impact of the lesser degree of acoustic-phonetic differentiation between conversational and clear speech in children was seen in the perceptual experiments, where listeners were asked to judge the clarity of speech excerpt on a 7 point scale: the difference in clarity scores across speech conditions was significantly lower for children's than adults' speech.\nThe interactions were also analysed in terms of the repair strategies used by children when a communication breakdown occurred. Older children were more effective at resolving communication breakdowns, as a greater proportion of miscommunications were resolved by a single repair. However, minimal age effects were found in the type of clarification requests used and in repair strategies. \nIn another phase of the study, we examined phonetic category structure for two phonetic contrasts to establish whether phonetic categories produced by children within this age range were more internally-variable than adults'. The same child participants produced multiple repetitions of a set of keywords in a picture naming task. Children produced farther yet also much more dispersed categories than adults with increasing discriminability with age, such that by age 13, children's categories were no less discriminable than those of adults.\nOverall, this study provides evidence for ongoing developments in certain aspects of speech communication until late teenage years. \n\nPlans for future research\nAn ESRC project on speech communication in older adults has been funded (ES/L007002/1). It will expand our exploration of communication in adverse conditions and will use some of the procedures used in the recently completed project. \n\nA grant proposal is in preparation with Prof. Melissa Redford (University of Oregon, USA) on ongoing developments in later adolescence. \n\nA collaboration is being planned with Prof. Martine Grice (University of Cologne, Germany), involving Prof Michael Tomasello(University of Leipzig, Germany), to investigate speaker/listener interaction in high-functioning autistic adults using the diapix technique used in the current project. Academic users\nOur kidLUCID corpus of fully-transcribed and annotated spontaneous speech dialogues between pairs of child speakers is a rich source of information for researchers investigating other aspects of speech and language development. This corpus is now fully available online. \n\n\nNon-academic users\nA better understanding that the process of speech and language acquisition is still ongoing in teenage years is relevant for Speech and Language Therapists: our kidLUCID corpus and findings provide rare data on spontaneous speech produced in communicative conditions in older typically-developing children. This is an important baseline against which to compare communicative difficulties experienced by youngsters with hearing or language impairments. \n\nThe understanding that communication in challenging conditions has a greater impact on youngsters than on adults is also relevant to educational settings, both in terms of communication in noisy in reverberant environments and communication with peers who may have hearing or language difficulties.
