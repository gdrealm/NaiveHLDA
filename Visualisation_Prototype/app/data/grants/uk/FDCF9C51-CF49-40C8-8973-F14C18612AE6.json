Pathogenesis and management of M. ulcerans disease, Buruli ulcer","abstractText":"Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans (Mu) which is common in rural parts of West African countries including Ghana. It causes large, disfiguring skin ulcers mainly in children aged 5 to 15 years although any age can be affected. Access to treatment in rural areas is limited and many cases present late because of fear, suspicion about conventional medicine and the economic consequences for poor families. The disease is highly focal and in Ghana, where these investigations will be carried out, it is not seen at all in the North, most cases occurring in particular parts of the Ashanti Region. The mode of transmission remains unknown but there have been major advances in understanding the mechanism of disease since the establishment of the WHO Buruli ulcer initiative in 1998 together with improved diagnosis and management. The aim of the proposed studies is to identify markers predictive of a rapid response to antibiotic treatment and to investigate the pathogenesis of paradoxical reactions and oedematous lesions in Mu disease.\nWhen someone is infected with Mu, the first sign is a nodule under the skin which gradually enlarges and breaks down in the centre to form an ulcer. This is because Mu produces a toxin that spreads outwards and damages subcutaneous tissue. In about 15% of cases the skin around the ulcer is swollen with oedema, that is fluid in the tissue, and in this situation the ulcer enlarges more rapidly so that it may involve a whole limb for example.\nIn recent years it has been found that instead of removing ulcers by extensive surgery it is possible to heal them by antibiotic treatment for 8 weeks with daily tablets and intramuscular injections. This is unpleasant, particularly for children, and it would be better if the treatment could be limited to a shorter time. Our previous studies suggest that it may be possible to do investigations at the beginning of treatment that distinguish people who need only 4 weeks antibiotic treatment. A wide range of tests will be investigated in detail to identify markers for people in whom the infection is at an early stage with low numbers of the Mu bacteria and low levels of the toxin in the skin. During antibiotic treatment the rate of healing will be measured carefully to find out which markers are most reliable and practical for use in countries where Buruli ulcer is endemic.\nAfter antibiotic treatment some patients develop new areas of inflammation or a sudden increase in the size of a healing ulcer, giving the impression that the infection is still active. It is not known what causes these paradoxical reactions but it is thought that there is an increasing immune response to residual dead Mu organisms in the tissue. In the proposed studies the immune response to Mu will be investigated serially during antibiotic treatment and when patients develop a paradoxical reaction. \nOedematous disease is the most severe form of Buruli ulcer. The cause of it is not known but a likely explanation is that larger than normal amounts of the Mu toxin mycolactone are produced and diffuse away from the initial site of infection. This will be investigated by measuring mycolactone in the skin of patients and studying mycolactone production by the strain of Mu cultured from patients with this form of the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J01477X/1","grantId":"MR/J01477X/1","fundValue":"454042","fundStart":"2013-01-02","fundEnd":"2018-01-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Harding Wansbrough-Jones","coPersons":["Richard Odame Phillips"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
