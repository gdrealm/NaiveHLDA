{"id":"EC94F751-2749-4FD2-BB59-7B73E94D1D23","title":"Action and interaction in the social brain","abstractText":"<p>This project examines how the brain operates during basic social interactions. Recent research has uncovered a network of brain regions called the 'mirror neuron system' which responds when people see and do actions. The current project aims to dissect the mirror neuron system and understand the difference between two non-verbal social behaviours: emulation and mimicry. Emulation occurs when one person interprets the intentions behind another's action; it is important for learning new skills and for understanding intentions. Mimicry occurs when one person unconsciously copies the gestures or facial expressions of another person. It is important for building social affiliations and cooperation between people, but the tendency to mimic is reduced in children with autism.</p>\n\n<p>This project will test the hypothesis that emulation and mimicry depend on different brain systems. Volunteers will watch videos of simple actions while they lie in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner which records brain activity. Analysis of the brain responses will reveal if different parts of the mirror neuron system are active during emulation and mimicry. Overall, the project will lead to new developments in our scientific understanding of learning by imitation, the development of collaborations and the failure of social skills in autism.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F001649/1","grantId":"ES/F001649/1","fundValue":"275500","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antonia  Hamilton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
