However sometimes infection or other unwanted stimuli also trigger the same pathways. We think that these signals start a mechanism that makes the oxytocin neurones more sensitive and respond too early by producing more oxytocin, which then by contracting the womb has the extra effect of causing more unwanted stimuli, resulting in birth happening too early. \nWe will study the oxytocin neurones using an anaesthised rat model of pregnancy and preterm labour to measure the adaptations of the special neurone activity patterns during late pregnancy and the brain chemicals that mediate this, and the susceptibility of the neurones to unwanted premature signals. \nThis will contribute to understanding of preterm labour mechanisms and may allow greater precision in prediction and prevention of preterm birth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700176","grantId":"G0700176","fundValue":"373620","fundStart":"2007-12-14","fundEnd":"2010-12-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Jane Douglas","coPersons":["Mike  Ludwig"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
