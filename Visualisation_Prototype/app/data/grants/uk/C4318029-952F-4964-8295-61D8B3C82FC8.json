In sub-Saharan Africa every year 179 000 women and over one million babies die around the time of childbirth. Maternal mortality ratios are high at 500 per 100 000 livebirths and newborn mortality at 30 per 1000: in Tanzania for every 200 babies born, one woman dies in childbirth and six babies do not survive the first four weeks of life. The most common cause of maternal death is severe bleeding, which can happen quickly just after the baby is born. Other common causes of death are related to hypertension and infection, including sepsis, malaria, HIV and anaemia. Many babies die because childbirth care is poor or because the mother has an infection in pregnancy which means the baby is premature, which means born too soon. \n\nSimple, low-cost ways to tackle these issues are available, and most are affordable even in low-resource settings. However, many women and children simply do not get the interventions they need, particularly during labour, childbirth, and the first few hours of the baby's life. For example, a woman with a life-threatening complication might not find a skilled health care worker to deliver the baby because trained health staff are either absent or busy with other work. Vital equipment might have broken down and be unrepaired, and drugs and supplies may be out of stock. There may be no mechanism to ensure that equipment, drugs and supplies are always available and weak leadership might lead to a culture of frustration or resignation among health staff. \n\nMaternal and perinatal deaths reviews have helped to reduce maternal deaths in the United Kingdom. Death reviews and other quality improvement approaches can stimulate changes in management and support structures so that equipment, supplies and drugs together with skilled professionals are always available for women in need. For more than a decade, the World Health Organization has promoted the use of death reviews to reduce maternal mortality. In Tanzania, however, death reviews are not done systematically or at scale. They are often based on deaths in hospital, while most maternal deaths occur in the community. And reviews often conclude that the woman herself was to blame rather than identifying areas for improvement under the control of the health staff which can be followed up to see whether the change results in improvement. In order to improve quality of care, a review system needs skills including mentoring, communication, analysis and intersectoral collaboration. The new WHO approach of &quot;maternal death surveillance and response&quot; aims to address these weaknesses and emphasizes 1) death surveillance at the community level, 2) analysis of trends, causes, risk factors and underlying causes of deaths and 3) the use of data to adapt local and national strategies. Careful adaptation and a link to mentoring is needed to develop a sustainable surveillance and response approach in Tanzania that is both embedded in the health system and designed for subsequent implementation on a national scale. \n\nWe will support the Tanzanian government in preparing, supporting and piloting an adapted and scalable maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response approach based on mentoring and measurement. Our work will include synthesising evidence on direct causes and underlying factors for maternal and newborn deaths, and developing a way to find out about, and act on, all maternal and newborn deaths.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/N003985/1","grantId":"MR/N003985/1","fundValue":"99382","fundStart":"2015-07-13","fundEnd":"2016-04-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Schellenberg","coPersons":["Fatuma  Manzi"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
