{"id":"68EB3BBF-C0CC-45C7-8B57-DBFA2D96BA34","title":"Genetic dissection of immunity and inflammation using ENU mutagenesis","abstractText":"Our ability to fight infection is a result of a complex system of defences. In many cases we fail to fight an infection adequately and in specific cases this can be due to defects in genes we require for this process. We propose to identify genes that have hitherto eluded identification but are important in fighting infections or causing allergic responses such as asthma. We propose to use a system that will enable us to find variant mice that are unable to respond normally to infection. We do not intend to infect the mice with live bacteria or viruses but will instead use chemicals that stimulate important aspects of white blood cell functions in immunity, allergy and inflammation. The benefit to human health is that by identifying the genes that control some of our immediate responses to invading organisms, we will be able to develop therapies that will assist patients who lack those responses or reacts inappropriately to exogenous stimuli.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600727","grantId":"G0600727","fundValue":"824980","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Siamon  Gordon","coPersons":["David  Greaves","Andreas  Russ","Terence Neil Dear"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
