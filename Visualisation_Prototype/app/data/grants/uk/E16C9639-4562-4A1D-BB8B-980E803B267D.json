It identifies the way these interactions vary across UK regions and within those regions. Knowledge exchange includes the full range of ways in which the business community and the higher education sector interact and which may affect business and regional economic development. These interactions include educational and training activities, research publications and patenting, conferences, contracting and consulting activity, internships, joint research and development and licensing and new business formation. The research considers the objectives for taking part in these interactions and the evaluation of their success from both a business (or 'demand' side) perspective and from the academic (or 'supply' side) perspective. The research uses detailed case studies of knowledge exchange activities in selected sectors and regions and the statistical analysis of data gathered by two unique national surveys specially designed for the project. The research will be used to draw implications for public policy in the area of knowledge exchange and regional development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017304/1","grantId":"ES/E017304/1","fundValue":"499438","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Kitson","coPersons":["Alan  Hughes"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
