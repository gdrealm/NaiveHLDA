{"id":"D8C3FD31-EDB2-44DD-8CA9-18294A942502","title":"Understanding the chemistry of ceramic materials under irradiation","abstractText":"The safe disposal of radioactive waste is a problem that must be solved . First, there is the existing legacy of waste in the UK (about 3.4 million cubicmetres of which 1,100 cubic metres is high level waste - not counting the 1500 tonnes of Pu left over from the Cold War). Second, any future development of nuclear power requires a publically acceptable method of disposing of nuclear waste. The CoRWM (Committee on Radioactive Waste Management) recommendation that high level waste should be disposed of in a repository with geological barriers has been accepted by the Government. (In the UK co-disposal of long-lived intermediate level waste and high level waste together with spent fuel is the preferred option). The radioactive elements themselves must be trapped in a matrix that will not disintegrate during prolonged heavy particle bombardment at moderately high temperatures. This matrix must be able to accommodate high concentrations of radioactive species, resist radiation damage and not release the radioactive species to the environment for many thousands of years. Also, it must be easy to make and shape. We need information on how radioactive elements are incorporated into possible hosts, and how these hosts change when they are damaged. In particular, we need to understand how the effects of radiation affects whether they will dissolve in water. Understanding this basic chemistry is essential if suitable hosts are to be found. This proposal will provide new insights into the problem of immobilising radioactive waste in suitable hosts using a combination of computer simulation techniques. We will develop methods to evaluate the level and type of damage, link this to escape of radioactive species from the host and dissolution of the host itself. This will enable us to evaluate possible hosts for immobilising radioactive waste.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H013814/1","grantId":"EP/H013814/1","fundValue":"330814","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Adaptive Kinetic Monte Carlo code is under active development by the Computational Science and Engineering Group at Daresbury (DL_AKMC) and a version has already been released to the simulation community under the aegis of CCP5.

An important part of this is to incorporate the radioactive atoms into host materials that are artificial minerals. Inevitably, the atomic structure of these minerals will be disrupted by the radioactive decay of the atoms. The purpose of this work was to find new methods of describing this disruption and using these to investigate materials that can heal themselves after the disruption has occurred. We developed ways of describing this disruption based on local ordering and local topology that demonstrated that, despite the initial gross disorder of the damage cascade, the mineral does retain a memory of its original local order and self-healing occurs to a considerable extent. The new methods show that the initial highly disordered state is not molten (as has often been asserted). \n\nAfter the initial damage and healing, longer-term healing can take place by defects in the solids moving and annihilating each other. We have therefore developed a computer code (using an Adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method) that can describe this longer-term healing. Unravelling the healing mechanisms has highlighted important differences between possible host materials, some of which will heal effectively and others less well. Such a code can also treat diffusion problems at much longer timescales than conventional simulations using molecular dynamics and is therefore of wide potential utility for simulations in ceramics. The new methods of defect analysis can be used to describe radiation damage in all materials, whether ceramics or metals and will be particularly useful in characterising defect populations in the presence of high concentrations of defects where they cannot be considered as isolated species and where conventional methods defining defects in terms of the displacement of atoms from their original sites give misleading results. \n\nThe adative kinetic Monte Carlo code is appropriate for a wide range of problems in the simulation of ceramics where it is necessary to simulate slow processes. This includes problems of sintering, creep, surface diffusion (as in catalysis).
