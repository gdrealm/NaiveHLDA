'Migrant mothers caring for the future' brings together a range of international, national, methodological and multidisciplinary perspectives, including contributions from the disciplines of sociology, migration studies, cultural studies, cultural geography and the creative arts, to explore how migrant mothers realise and problematise their role in bringing up future citizens in modern Western societies, which are increasingly characterised ethnic, racial, religious, cultural and social diversity. In the UK context cultural, social and policy debates identify that the challenge for the future is to form a culturally diverse, yet socially cohesive, citizenry, through sustainable multicultural modes of conviviality (Erel 2011). The network stimulates critical thinking and knowledge exchange on the processes that shape migrant mothers' cultural and caring work in enabling their children to become future citizens. Specifically, the network considers the temporal and spatial changes informing migrant mothers' and children's citizenry by examining how institutions such as the family involved in making new citizens sustain social trust, cohesion and solidarity across differences over time and space. By drawing together a range of international and multidisciplinary perspectives the network contributes to developing a shared research agenda on the role of migrant mothers in promoting social cohesion among ethnic and cultural diverse children/young people in the face of increasing social cleavages. This is an issue that came to public prominence in the aftermath of the August 2011 riots. \n\nThe network promotes shared conversations and knowledge exchange (between academic researchers, arts practitioners and policymakers) concerning migrant mothers' creative interventions in future citizenry. This is achieved through two sets of activities \n\nActivity 1 Seminar series and final conference\nThe international seminars and conference bring together leading research and cutting edge practice, consolidating a novel field of research, which is currently dispersed across different disciplines and national contexts, drawing on emerging scholars as well as international key thinkers in the field. \nSeminar 1: Citizenship, Migration and Mothering, focusing on theorizing migrant mothers' citizenship and its policy implications. \nSeminar 2: Building Resources for citizenship: mothers' cultural intervention, focusing on migrant mothers' cultural interventions into citizenship and creative research methods, including reflections on participatory theatre by workshop participants (cf. activity2).\nFinal Conference: Migrant mothers caring for the future: creative interventions in making new citizens. The conference brings together perspectives from cultural studies, postcolonial studies, cultural geography, family studies, law, migration studies and arts practitioners, in particular a performance of the participatory theatre piece (cf. activity2). Confirmed keynote speakers: Patricia Hill Collins (University of Maryland, US), Ayalet Shachar (University of Toronto, Canada), Nira Yuval-Davis (University of East London), Hiroshi Motomura Hirokazu Yoshikawa (Harvard University, US), Ann Phoenix (Institute of Education, UK)\n\nActivity 2 - Participatory Theatre\nThe participatory theatre comprises 8 workshop sessions working with a group of 8 migrant mothers. In the workshops participants construct dramatic scenes on the topic of migration and mothering. Community theatre methods explore visceral, temporal, and corporeal aspects of realities and the social interactions within them. Through these creative articulations, the network co-produces theoretical and empirical knowledge with the migrant mothers, developing action-based methodologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00591X/1","grantId":"AH/K00591X/1","fundValue":"32517","fundStart":"2013-05-02","fundEnd":"2015-03-07","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been disseminated at our final conference in September 2014. We had participants from a wide range of academic institutions, as well as practitioners from the field of migration and family support. In their feedback, in particular volunteers and workers of RENAISI, an NGO providing bilingual support to migrant parents in their children's schools reported that the findings of mothers' important contribution to citizenship will be informing their work, in particular their new awareness of migrant mothers' ability to contribute to citizenship and social cohesion. In addition a healthcare worker who is also ethnicity and diversity lead, will feedback findings from our conference to her colleagues in an allocated training session and suggest the use of therapeutic gardens, in her mother and baby unit for mothers with postnatal depression, based on findings from Prof. Hondagneu-Sotelo's conference presentation. \nAn editor for an academic publishing house (Ashgate) reported in her feedback form that she will more actively seek out publications on migrant mothers' contribution to citizenship.

Yet, this important contribution of migrant mothers is not recognized in policy on integration and social cohesion. Integration continues to be measured through participation in the labour market. \nSecondly, in bringing up their children migrant mothers engage with the wider community and build bridges with British and other ethnic minority communities â€“ playgroups and schoolyards are important meeting grounds not just for children but also for mothers of different backgrounds. Migrant mothers build social cohesion across ethnic group boundaries, but their contribution tends to be overlooked. \nFinally, the mothers in this study showed that a commitment to the language and culture of the home country need not stand in the way of active engagement with life in Britain. They all saw their future and that of their children as being part of the UK. Being interested in and engaging in their home countries and beyond, was not seen as turning their backs on the UK, but rather as an active engagement with the world. \n\nThe networking project also showed that these questions are of great relevance in a range of national contexts, from Canada, to the US, to Czech Republic, Norway, Belgium and other European countries. The project employed participatory theatre methods, working with a group of migrant mothers to produce a short play about their experiences. This was showcased at the international conference on 'MIgrant Mothers Caring for the Future'. The play engaged conference attendees who felt that participatory theatre methods are extremely useful in a range of contexts, such as teaching of diversity issues to health professional students, for multicultural school settings as well as academic settings. The combination of embodied (through participatory theatre) and academic knowledges is a powerfull research tool for migration studies, mothering and citizenship studies, capable of creating new insights or practitioners and academics. The findings can be used to open up a new research field combining migration, mothering and citizenship studies. This will be fostered through the publication of a SI in a refereed journal. In addition our networking activity has already encouraged bringing interdisciplinary, international knowledges together under the heading of migrant mothers' citizenship interventions, as many early careers researchers have contributed high quality papers to the seminar series and conference. The development of ECR's and other academics' work into a new research field is one way in which our findings will be taken forward. Our website presents a range of cutting edge research papers to a wide audience. \n\nOur methodological innovation of using particpatory theatre methods to explore migrant mothers' citizenship will also be taken further by other researchers, for purposes of research, teaching and dissemination. The website is showcasing this method effectively and can therefore be exploited by researchers worldwide. \nNGOs working with migrant families, schools, parents, health and social services can use the website and the findings to enhance their inclusivity and the impact of their work. Members of a range of NGO who participated in the networking activities are already reporting that our findings have inspired them to appreciate more the value of migrant mothers' contributions to wider society and citizenship.
