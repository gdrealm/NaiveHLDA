{"id":"ADC17DE5-8CEC-44F7-95CE-86F5375C6CB7","title":"Embedded Broadband Ultrasonic Sensing for Robust and Scalable Positioning","abstractText":"Important applications spanning the fields of ubiquitous computing and sensor networking require the spontaneous provision of reliable, accurate, and up-to-date location information in unprepared environments. Examples include simultaneous localisation and mapping of new environments using resource-constrained devices; impromptu location-aware collaborative work and data sharing between proximate users; and emergency search and rescue and live coordination of personnel in disaster sites. Embedded, ad hoc positioning systems are a crucial ingredient for such applications. In such systems, wireless and battery-powered sensing devices can be deployed in a matter of minutes to collaboratively measure and estimate their locations, and supply the required information.While solutions for minimal deployment and ad hoc positioning have been put forth for ubiquitous computing and sensor networks, none of the systems to date have been able to provide the high-fidelity information the above applications require. Due to their interactive and real-time nature, they tend to require location readings which are robust (consistently delivered accuracy of a few tens of centimetres or better) and up-to-date for all participating nodes (several location readings per second for each locatable device). The aim of this project is to develop broadband ultrasonic signalling and processing methods for ad hoc, embedded positioning systems. This will allow them to (1) produce robust estimates (through noise-resistant coding and measurement of multiple physical quantities such as range, bearing, and velocity) even when only a small number of devices are present; and (2) maintain high location update rates (through multiple access signalling) when a large number of devices are present. Our approach is to couple broadband ultrasonics (piezopolymer transducers) with real-time signal processing implemented using reconfigurable fabrics (field programmable gate arrays).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G008523/1","grantId":"EP/G008523/1","fundValue":"183286","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  After studying the problem space, we identified two core aspects on which to focus project efforts: (1) real-time, Doppler-tolerant tracking of moving tags using broadband ultrasound; and (2) efficient hardware architectures for implementation of all DSP components. Broadband ultrasound in air brought new challenges to the algorithms and processing, and the two aspects were previously unexplored for this medium (airborne acoustics between 30 and 80 kHz). The core contributions are well-covered in Dr Alloulah's PhD dissertation; the algorithms and computational processing architectures are described and evaluated in detail. Forthcoming journal articles will make these available to a wider audience in the ultrasonics and mobile computing research communities.

(1) We created the first-ever array for broadband ultrasonic positioning in indoor environments: it is an eight-element array of broadband piezopolymer transducers, and it interfaces with an FPGA development board (based around a Xilinx Virtex-4) for real-time processing. (2) Other high-fidelity, indoor tracking methods were investigated and published, including: pedestrian positioning using inertial sensors and ultrasonic beacons; and accurate identification and positioning of indoor sounds (such as speech or footsteps) using microphones on distributed sensor nodes. (3) The project's funding for a PhD student (Janine Morley) initiated a new multidisciplinary collaboration in the area of sustainability in everyday life. Dr Hazas is involved as co-investigator in the recently-announced End Use Energy Demand Centre at Lancaster (Prof Elizabeth Shove PI; ?3.9 million). Dr Alloulah's work informs real-time tracking for broadband ultrasonic signalling (indoor positioning applications). Work on everyday practice and energy (e.g. that conducted with Dr Morley) is of interest to policy makers and technologists working on smart meters.
