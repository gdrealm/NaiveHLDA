The main goal of the Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics is to use non-mammalian species to model human disease processes in a whole organism context. Our approach is based on discoveries made in the past two decades that have revealed that organisms as simple as a tropical fish, fruit fly or even a worm share many cellular functions and have many genes in common with humans. By manipulating these organisms’ versions of human disease associated genes, we can establish models for a variety of debilitating diseases and exploit these to discover new therapeutic agents. In addition, we can generate pathological conditions – such as the blockage of arteries – in these simple organisms and use these to discover novel genes that underlie the corresponding human pathology. Through these approaches we aim to expand our knowledge of the molecular basis of a range of human diseases, including cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative, giving new insights into their causes and providing new leads for their diagnosis, management and cure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700091","grantId":"G0700091","fundValue":"2370730","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marysia  PlaczekPhilip W Ingham","coPersons":["R  Boucher"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
