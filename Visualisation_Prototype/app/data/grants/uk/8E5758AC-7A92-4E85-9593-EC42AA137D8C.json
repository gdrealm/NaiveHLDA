{"id":"8E5758AC-7A92-4E85-9593-EC42AA137D8C","title":"2-Photon Imaging: From Polymeric Materials to Engineered Tissues","abstractText":"Two-photon microscopy is a leading-edge imaging technology and a powerful research tool that combines long wavelength excitation and laser scanning microscopy. Of importance to our work it can enable capture of high resolution three dimensional images of living cells within 3D constructs as well as in-depth penetration of specimens tagged with very specific fluorophores. This technology is now becoming a method of choice for the dynamic imaging of biological and polymeric systems, not otherwise possible by other optical approaches and therefore will underpin a broad number of research programmes in biomaterials and tissue engineering.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012981/1","grantId":"BB/E012981/1","fundValue":"241038","fundStart":"2008-01-31","fundEnd":"2009-01-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John William Haycock","coPersons":["Stephen  Rimmer","Sheila  MacNeil","Julia A.
