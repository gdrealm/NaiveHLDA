{"id":"DBD8BAC2-0A45-4E93-A37D-9D657ECA04FA","title":"The Development of the British Equity Market, 1825-1870","abstractText":"The stock indices currently available for 1825-1870 period are based on a small sample of equity stocks.&nbsp; Indeed, the best index, that of Gayer \n<i>et al, </i>only covers the period up to 1850. &nbsp; The aim of this project is to construct a comprehensive dataset of British equity prices for the 1825-70 period, using share price data from \n<i>The</i> \n<i>Course of the Exchange</i> and \n<i>The Railway Times</i>.&nbsp; As well as estimating total market capitalisation for the period 1825-70, we will calculate sectoral indices.&nbsp; We also plan to analyse the usage, risk and value of uncalled capital.&nbsp; The development of these indices and datasets will enable us to address three important research questions.&nbsp; Firstly, we will be able to measure the growth of the market for equity, and analyse which sectors contributed to this growth.&nbsp; Secondly, using our data we will also be able to shed some light on the extent to which uncalled capital was used, and we will be able to determine the riskiness and value of uncalled capital. &nbsp; Thirdly, we will be able to assess the impact of the liberalisation of company law on the development of the equity market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1391","grantId":"RES-000-22-1391","fundValue":"40622","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2008-05-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Turner","coPersons":["Charles Robert  Hickson"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
