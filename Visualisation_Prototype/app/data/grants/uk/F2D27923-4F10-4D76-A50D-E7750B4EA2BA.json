This book will demonstrate firstly that the premises on which this statement has been made are flawed, involving the anachronistic search for, and failure to find medieval anthropomorphic diabolical images in late antiquity. Secondly, it will explore how Christians imagined the Devil in their own terms, considering art and literature alongside each other as evidence for a complex and subtle early Christian diabolical imagination. It will examine how diabolical presence is implied and required, if not depicted and embodied, in scriptural scenes of exorcism and temptation, and how it is typologically suggested in depictions of particular animals and beasts which were either explicitly linked to the Devil in the Old Testament, or had been linked to the Devil by early Christian exegesis. It will contain chapters on the following themes: early Christian theological and philosophical presentations of the reason for the existence of and appearances of diabolical and demonic beings; early Christian views on the relationship between the Devil, demons and the pagan gods, daimones and idols; the ways in which Christians imagined the Devil in bestial (animal) and monstrous (unnatural, hybrid) forms; the appearance of the Devil in accounts of the harrowing of hell; and early Christian literary and visual re-tellings of scriptural and contemporary exorcisms.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H005951/1","grantId":"AH/H005951/1","fundValue":"23744","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie Jane  Lunn-Rockliffe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
