{"id":"977F1E0D-093D-461B-864C-3EEBEDC71003","title":"NANA: Novel Assessment of Nutrition and Ageing","abstractText":"<p>Nutritional status impacts upon the health and physical function of older people, who face a high risk of nutrient deficiencies and malnutrition. Poor nutritional status is particularly related to loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, ie sarcopenia, which increases both the risk of adverse health outcomes in older people and the burden of other diseases. </p>\n\n<p>A number of factors affect nutritional status in older people although the specific relationships are not well understood. Physical factors, such as problems with chewing and impaired mobility contribute towards nutritional decline. Mental health status is another contributing factor, particularly the presence of depression, which has been proposed as the most common cause of weight loss in the ageing population. However, it is commonly under diagnosed and under treated among older people. There is also growing evidence of associations between diet and cognitive function. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of the NANA project is to develop a comprehensive assessment toolkit using advanced technology to facilitate collection of detailed information from older people on their nutritional status, mental health, physical function and cognition. The outcome will be a single integrated toolkit for use by practitioners and researchers concerned with the health and well-being of older people.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-354-25-0003","grantId":"RES-354-25-0003","fundValue":"745984","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Arlene  Astell","coPersons":["Timothy  Adlam","Faustina  Hwang","Elizabeth  Williams"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
