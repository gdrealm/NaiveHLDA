These, as yet unanswered, questions being:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What exactly are the generic skills in question?&nbsp;<br /></li> \n <li>What has been learnt about how they work in the development of sustainable communities?<br /></li> \n <li>How does this shift the knowledge-base?<br /></li> \n <li>How can this, in turn, be used as a platform to raise the social competencies required for the development of sustainable communities?&nbsp; </li>\n</ul> \n<p>This research aims to answer these questions by putting&nbsp; learning very much at the centre of the actions taken to close the gap (between subject-specific and generic skills), shift the knowledge-base (from the former to the latter) and use this as a platform to raise the social competencies required for the development of sustainable communities.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E023770/1","grantId":"ES/E023770/1","fundValue":"64566","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Deakin","coPersons":["James  Powell","S  Allwinkle","Stephen Rowland Curwell"],"organisation":"Edinburgh Napier University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
