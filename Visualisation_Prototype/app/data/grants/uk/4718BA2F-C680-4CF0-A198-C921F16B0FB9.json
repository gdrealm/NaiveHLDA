Research aiming at a better understanding of the world around us, improving the impact of our research, and ultimately benefitting the quality of life, relies on precise data. The contact-free, in-situ measurement of temperature to be developed in this project using a temperature-dependent scintillation characteristic is targeting precisely this - improving the monitoring of temperature of a protein sample holder assembly for macromolecular crystallography on the I23 beamline at the Diamond Light Source. For this purpose, a technique developed for research into the dark matter of the universe is being adapted for use at a synchrotron beamline. It involves modifications to the designs of already demonstrated equipment, fabrication of a specialized version of this equipment, systems integration and implementation at the beamline of the synchrotron. The demonstration of feasibility and quality will allow a better assessment of the wider potential of the technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002929/1","grantId":"ST/K002929/1","fundValue":"8503","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The unique technique of temperature monitoring for experiments where this parameter is impossible to measure otherwise has been developed. If the temperature is not controlled it may seriously compromise the quality of the experiment or even endanger the integrity of the object under study - a protein crystal. The results of the measurements of temperature dependence of scintillation decay constant for different scintillators are summarised as look-up tables. These data will be used to derive the value of temperature during the measurements. Furthermore, the studies of luminescence properties of crystals over wide temperature range complemented measurements of scintillation characteristics. This gave a getting better insight into the nature of the processes of relaxation of high energy excitations in solids.

The electronic, hardware and software has been fully developed, assembled and tested on the bench. The final test requires integration of the equipment into the experimental end station which is currently in the commissioning stage. The technique is ready for wider applications at Diamond Light Source and also at other synchrotrons and institutions where non-contact in situ temperature monitoring is required Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
