{"id":"32F1669F-CBDC-479B-AFBB-1374FBD2CBFA","title":"Effect of macrolides on asthma control, airway inflammation and bacterial colonisation in smokers with asthma","abstractText":"Asthma is a common disease in Westernised societies, affecting up to 10% of the population. Steroids are the most effective treatment for asthma but not all patients obtain benefit. A major cause of steroid insensitivity in asthma is cigarette smoking. New drugs are needed for smokers with asthma who are unable to stop smoking. \n\nRecent cellular and animal research as well as clinical studies in non-smokers with asthma has shown that a group of antibiotics called macrolides may improve asthma control in smokers with asthma by reducing airway inflammation, by restoring steroid sensitivity and/or by anti-bacterial effects. \n\nWe plan a ?proof of concept? study to determine the benificial effects of macrolides in smokers with asthma. The study will be a 12-week controlled clinical trial comparing the oral macrolide, azithromycin with a matched placebo. A total of 80 smokers with asthma will be recruited. We will study the effects of azithromycin on lung function, symptoms,airway inflammation and number of bacterial in sputum. \n\nThis study will determine the benefits of macrolides as a new therapy for smokers with asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701626","grantId":"G0701626","fundValue":"416270","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil Campbell Thomson","coPersons":["Frances  Mair","Tom  Evans","Charles  McSharry","Christopher  Weir","Rekha  Chaudhuri"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
