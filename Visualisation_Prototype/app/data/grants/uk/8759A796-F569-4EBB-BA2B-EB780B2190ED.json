{"id":"8759A796-F569-4EBB-BA2B-EB780B2190ED","title":"RNA interference as a therapeutic agent for neuromuscular disease","abstractText":"In many dominant genetic diseases the mutant gene that gives rise to the disease co-exists with a normal copy of the gene, frequently only differing from the normal copy by a single letter (nucleotide base) in its genetic code. Any method that was reliably able to discriminate the mutant copy of the gene from the normal copy (i.e. that was sensitive enough to discriminate as little as a single base difference), and destroy it, thereby leaving only normal copies of the gene present, would have great potential as a novel treatment strategy. Such a method now exists based on a powerful new technology called RNA interference (RNAi). We have studied dominant mutations in the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) gene (that codes for an important neurotransmitter receptor essential for normal functioning of the nerve-muscle junction) that cause a disease called slow channel myasthenic syndrome. In this work we have demonstrated proof-of-concept for using RNAi to selectively silence expression of the mutant AChR genes. We now wish to develop further this very promising approach by; studying and optimizing the RNAi sequence and chemical structure for mutant gene silencing; testing these in muscle cell lines derived from patients with this disorder; investigating the parameters for effective and safe delivery of RNAi molecules to the nerve-muscle junction; and finally undertaking trials of this therapy in animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500822","grantId":"G0500822","fundValue":"204932","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew John Wood","coPersons":["David  Beeson"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
