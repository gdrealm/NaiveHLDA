This research involves simulating how these beams will behave in the accelerator and understanding how they interact with accelerator components and detectors in the beam-line. This includes background estimates and also key performance specifications of beam instrumentation, including Laser-wire beam profile monitors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E002501/1","grantId":"PP/E002501/1","fundValue":"257521","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Grahame  Blair","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
