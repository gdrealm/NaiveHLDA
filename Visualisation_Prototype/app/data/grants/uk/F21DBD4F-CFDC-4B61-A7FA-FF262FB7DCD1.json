Success in the clinical trial proposed here with an HIV-1 vaccine will establish a critical proof of concept, opening the way to general application of our new approach. Vaccination is one of the most important achievements of medicine. Injection of modified germs, or materials from them, induces protective immunity against the infections which they cause. Smallpox has been eradicated from the planet, polio is almost gone. Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis have been essentially eliminated from developed countries and, had it not been for the mendacious campaign against MMR vaccine, measles could also have been greatly reduced. Successful immunisation induces a protective immune response against particular component(s) of the target germ, the so-called immunogen(s). For some diseases the immunogens are not known and for others they are difficult and expensive to produce, transport and administer, for example influenza vaccine must be produced in millions of chicken eggs. A very attractive potential solution is to inject the DNA gene encoding the immunogen rather than the immunogen itself. In this process, known as DNA vaccination, the DNA enters cells, predominantly at the site of injection, and causes them to produce the immunogen locally within the body. DNA vaccination works well and stimulates excellent protective immunity against a variety of different infections, and even some cancers, in mice, horses, dogs, rabbits and pigs. But in humans and other primates, and in cows and sheep, the immune response to DNA vaccination is very feeble. Despite enormous academic and pharmaceutical industry efforts, the reasons for this failure have not been understood or overcome. We previously discovered, in work funded by the MRC, that a protein in human blood, known as serum amyloid P component (SAP), is the only normal blood protein which binds strongly to DNA. We have now found that, in each of the animal species in which DNA vaccination is effective, this protein is either absent or, if it is present, it binds only weakly to DNA. In contrast, non-human primates, cows and sheep share with humans the presence of SAP proteins which strongly bind to DNA. We believe that binding of DNA by SAP may be responsible for blocking induction of immune responses by DNA and that removal of SAP may overcome this inhibition. SAP contributes to important human diseases, amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease, and, in MRC funded work towards treatment for these conditions, we have previously developed a drug, CPHPC, which safely removes almost all SAP from the blood in humans. Another laboratory has recently reported that the presence of human SAP inhibits DNA vaccination in mice and that this effect is reversed by our drug, CPHPC. These observations confirm our hypothesis. We now propose to undertake the first human clinical study of DNA vaccination after SAP depletion. We will measure the immune responses to HIV-1 in normal adult men, comparing a group in whom SAP has been completely depleted at the time of DNA vaccination and a control group vaccinated without SAP depletion. We predict that SAP depletion at the time of vaccination will enhance the immune response. The DNA vaccine to be tested is a promising new vaccine against HIV-AIDS, developed and manufactured with previous MRC awards. A positive result, consistent with improved protective immunity against HIV-1, will be very encouraging. Furthermore, proof of the concept that SAP depletion can enhance immune responses to DNA vaccination in humans will open up this approach for the many other diseases for which effective vaccination does not yet exist and in which it could have therapeutic as well as prophylactic applications. The potential worldwide health and economic benefits are therefore very great.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J008605/1","grantId":"MR/J008605/1","fundValue":"1260170","fundStart":"2013-06-05","fundEnd":"2016-09-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Brian Pepys","coPersons":["Julian David  Gillmore","Philip Nigel Hawkins","Tomas  Hanke"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
