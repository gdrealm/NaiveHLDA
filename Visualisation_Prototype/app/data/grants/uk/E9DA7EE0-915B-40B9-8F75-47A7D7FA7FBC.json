{"id":"E9DA7EE0-915B-40B9-8F75-47A7D7FA7FBC","title":"Edinburgh Genome Foundry","abstractText":"Our vision is to establish a Genome Foundry at the University of Edinburgh that will provide end-to-end design, construction and validation of large gene constructs (up to 1Mbp) for academic and industrial applications. The Foundry will also provide a valuable test bed for novel processes and systems so we can realise a vision of full automation of the DNA synthesis process for next generation of synthetic biology.\n\nOur vision is that the design, construction and testing of up to chromosomal size synthetic constructs will become a routine part of lab life and will be available at a similar low cost to that of DNA sequencing today. However, there is much to be done to realise that goal as we need to find ways to reduce the labour-intensive and error-prone nature of the current synthetic process and better automate the workflow. \n\nThe synthetic biology community needs the ability to assemble very large strands of DNA enabling the interrogation at a fundamental level of how biology works and has evolved, expression of large complex engineered genetic circuits and metabolic pathways. \nThe Genome Foundry at Edinburgh will address these challenges:\n\n1) It will provide a core national capability to design, build and validate large DNA constructs, generated using current state-of-the-art technologies, to support the next phase of synthetic biology.\n\n2) It will act as a test bed for the development of new processes and systems, generated internally and externally, to facilitate the transformation of DNA synthesis to a fully automated process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00029X/1","grantId":"BB/M00029X/1","fundValue":"2000300","fundStart":"2014-09-16","fundEnd":"2015-09-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Jane Rosser","coPersons":["Yizhi  Cai"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
