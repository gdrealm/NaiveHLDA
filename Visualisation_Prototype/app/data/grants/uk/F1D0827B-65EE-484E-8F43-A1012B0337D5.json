My study works with the notion of transformation and, emphasising context as well as textual analysis, explores differences between, for example, adaptations of well known and unknown sources; children's fiction and 'adult' dramas; blockbusters and classics; the written text and it performance. It seeks to extend the range of adaptations normally studied and places particular emphasis on their own transformation of space, place and the body through which screen adaptations create their own narrative and visual pleasure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112618/1","grantId":"112618/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Geraghty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
