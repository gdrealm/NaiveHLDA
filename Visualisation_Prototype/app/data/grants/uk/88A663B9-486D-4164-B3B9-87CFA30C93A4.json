Although frogs would seem to be very different from humans, many of the processes and proteins involved in the development of their embryos are very similar. We use Xenopus frog embryos to study early development because they lay many hundreds of eggs which can easily be fertilized in a Petri dish. The large number of eggs produced is important because they provide lots of material for our experiments and chemical purifications. Furthermore, the embryos develop very rapidly and reach the swimming tadpole stage in just three days. The embryos are quite large (1 mm diameter) which means they can be injected with chemicals that either activate or inhibit the function of particular protein or gene involved in development. We are interested in a group of proteins known as the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGFs are found in all animals and play an important role in allowing cells within the embryo and adult to communicate with each other. Such signals passing from one cell to another are important in development because they are involved in the process by which individual cells decide what they will form in the adult. FGFs are particularly important in the decision of whether a particular group of cells will form tissues such as muscle, bone, kidney or the nervous system. The FGFs tell a cell which genes to turn on and because each gene codes for a protein, this ultimately tells a cell which proteins to make. For example, FGFs can tell cells in the embryo to become muscle. In this situation the FGF signal tells a cell to turn on genes which allow the production of proteins needed for a muscle to contract. We already know some of the genes that FGF signals will activate but we would like to know them all. Recent advances in technology mean that we can now attempt to identify all those genes which are turned on by FGF signals. The experiments that we plan are very simple. We will take samples of very early frog embryos and stimulate FGF signalling in these samples. We will then compare which genes are activated in these samples versus samples in which we have not stimulated FGF signalling. This should for the first time give a large scale view of the genes that are activated by FGF signals in the developing embryo. Our work will be of interest to people studying the early development of animals and people interested in how the bodies of adults maintain and repair themselves. This is because the FGFs are involved in many processes in the adult as well as the embryo. Once we have identified the FGF target genes, which in itself is very useful information, we will begin to investigate the nature of the proteins made from these genes. We will also attempt to discover what these proteins do during development by over activating or inhibiting their production in the early frog embryo. We also plan to use the large amounts of information gained from these experiments to make computer based models of how all these genes interact with each other during development. Ultimately these models will allow us to understand better the decisions that cells need to make during the development of all animals including humans. They might also allow us to predict the consequences of inhibiting or activating a particular gene involved in development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010039/1","grantId":"BB/D010039/1","fundValue":"411086","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  1)I regularly present the background and findings of my research with small groups of 6th form students (upto 8 groups of 4 students per year) who visit the University of York Biology Department in the Autumn and Spring Terms. These are an opportunity to stimulate the interest of the students in the research ongoing at the the University of York and is part of our programme to attract new undergraduate students to York Biology.\n\n2) In the spring of 2009 I organised a mini-symposium for a group of visiting overseas undergraduate students (Colgate University, Hamilton, New York). The objective of this meeting was to demonstrate the quality and breadth of research being undertaken at the University of York in the area stem cell biology and development. This session involved presentations at an appropriate level by 4 York PIs, including myself, on their current research and findings. Each presentation was followed by an extensive roundtable Q and A session relating to the ethics and implications of our work. This mini-symposium was highly successful and is likely to be annual event in the future. We also plan to use this as a model for future outreach events aimed at promoting interest and understanding in stem cell and developmental biology.

We use Xenopus frog embryos to study early development because they lay many hundreds of eggs which can easily be fertilized in a Petri dish. \nWe are interested in a group of proteins known as the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGFs are found in all animals and play an important role in allowing cells within the embryo and adult to communicate with each other. Such signals, passing from one cell to another, are important in development because they are involved in the process by which individual cells decide what they will form in the adult. \nThe experiments undertaken in essence were very simple. We took samples of very early frog embryos and either stimulated or inhibited FGF signalling in these embryos. We then compared which genes were activated or inhibited in these samples versus normally developing embryos. Using these approaches we have for the first time achieved a global view of which genes are activated by FGF signals in the developing embryo. \nSome of the FGF target genes that we have identified have proved to be very interesting. For example, we have identified a novel FGF target gene (DUSP5) which itself functions as a negative regulator of FGF signaling and acts to limit the amount of FGF signalling in the developing embryo. We have also identified another FGF target gene (Lin28) which also modifies signaling in the embryo and which is of considerable interest because it has been shown elsewhere to regulate the properties of stem cells. These findings support our long term hope that studies investigating signaling and gene regulation in early frog development will yield useful information regarding signaling and gene regulation during stem cell culture and differentiation. \nWe have also begun to investigate the function of a number of other FGF target genes. The data obtained thus far are exciting and convince us that these FGF target genes are of interest, and warrant further investigation \nIn conclusion, our work will be of interest to people studying the early development of animals and people interested in how the bodies of adults maintain and repair themselves. This is because the FGFs are involved in many processes in the adult as well as the embryo. No industrial collaborations have resulted from this work so far. However, the data from this project has been very fruitful at sparking a number of new collaborations with other labs which are presently ongoing.\n\n1) We identified the P2Y5 gene as a target of FGF signalling. We were aware that the lab of Dr Leslie Dale (UCL, Anatomy)was already working on the function of this family of G-protein coupled receptors and we decided to share our data with him prior to publication A collaboration was established to investigate P2Y5 function in relation to FGF signalling in the early embryo. This collaboration has proved very fruitful and a publication resulted \n\n2) We shared the early developmental time course data with Dr Betsy Pownall (Biology, York) prior to publication. These data have been very valuable to the Pownall lab for the refining of target gene selection from other microarray based analyses. These data have enhanced the accuracy of identification of putative MyoD and Myf5 target genes and this led to a joint publication. Given the common interests of our labs in specification and patterning of the mesoderm, we also collaborated on the initial analysis of FGF target gene expression during early gastrula stages. \n\n3) The data from this project have directly stimulated an ongoing collaboration with Dr Paul Genever (Biology, York). This has resulted in our joint supervision of a BBSRC funded studentship which is aimed at investigating if there are similarities between FGF regulated targets in the early embryo and human stem cell populations. The led to a joint publication.\n\n4) Our observation that the Lin28 gene is regulated by FGF signalling has prompted other collaborations at the University of York. In collaboration with Dr Mark Coles (Hull York Medical School) and Dr Fred Antson (Chemistry, York) funds were obatined from the University of York Pump Priming Fund to carry out the crystallization of a Lin28 miRNA complex in preparation for a full structural analysis. In addition, in collaboration with Mark Coles and Paul Genever funds were obtained from the York Biology Research Committee which will allow the identification of common Lin28 targets in early development and human stem cell populations.\n\nIn this regard it is also important to note that our characterization of the function of the Lin28 FGF target gene in early development provided preliminary data for a project grant application to the BBSRC Committee D which was funded.
