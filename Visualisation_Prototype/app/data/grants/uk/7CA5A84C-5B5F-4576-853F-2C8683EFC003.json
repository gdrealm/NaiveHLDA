These provide a unique and powerful research resource for a diverse range of academic disciplines as can be seen from our list of outputs. They also form a powerful source of research evidence for policy-makers, practitioners and third sector bodies.\n\nCALLS Hub exists to help users and potential users find the information and resources they need in a straightforward way, and promote the work and impact of the RSU's to a wider audience.\n\nOur website and helpdesk form a one-stop portal for researchers interested in using the Longitudinal Studies for their analyses. By bringing together the three studies, we can also highlight the potential benefits and opportunities of using more than one LS for research, either to provide a comparison of regional differences, or to expand the study population to ensure that results can be generalised to the whole country.
