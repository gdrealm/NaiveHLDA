{"id":"9615945D-9BE4-4803-81BE-2A07DE0AFC81","title":"Sexuality, Citizenship and Migration: the Irish Queer Diaspora in London","abstractText":"<p>This research project examines the experiences of Irish lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people living in London. There is a long history of Irish migration to the UK, particularly London. This has coincided historically with many Irish LGBT people feeling compelled to emigrate in search of a more supportive social climate. The appeal of global cities to LGBT people has long been acknowledged. Metropolitan centres are associated with tolerance of sexual diversity and established queer communities. This study will explore Irish queer migrants' reasons for moving to London and experiences there. The research questions will focus on notions of home, identity, belonging, familial relationships and subjectivity. By exploring the relationship between sexuality, ethnicity and diaspora, the study will uncover the ways in which contemporary sexual citizenship, migration and queer imaginaries of the metropolis are mutually implicated in complex ways. A qualitative dataset will be produced based on interviews with 40 Irish LGBT participants who have been living in London for at least five years. In addition to generating new theoretical work on sexuality and migration, the research findings will be used to inform policy and debate regarding processes of social exclusion.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F029977/1","grantId":"ES/F029977/1","fundValue":"76847","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roisin  Ryan-Flood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
