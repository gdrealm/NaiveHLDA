{"id":"BAC09376-2309-497B-BDF2-3F5B725B1B50","title":"Comparing dialects using statistical measures of rhythm.","abstractText":"When we say that &quot;music, poetry and language all have rhythms&quot;, what is meant by &quot;rhythm&quot;?&nbsp; What accounts for the rhythmic differences between languages or dialects?&nbsp; Within the last decade, techniques for quantitative measurements of rhythm have begun to appear. So far, these rhythm measures require much careful manual marking of the speech, and they are highly dependent on the choice of words. So, they have been limited to carefully designed laboratory experiments.\n<br />\n<br />The aim of our project is to systematically test and improve these rhythm measurements to be more reliable, easier, and robust enough to use outside the laboratory. This process will give us clues as to which sounds of speech contribute most to rhythm and ultimately allow us a better understanding of what we mean by the term &quot;rhythm&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; We aim to build tools that will open part of linguistics to quantitative measurements. They will allow researchers to work with more natural speech and perhaps allow medical uses.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, we will use our optimised measures to produce the first survey of the rhythm of British English dialects. We will investigate how different the British dialects are, compared to the differences between English and other languages.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1323","grantId":"RES-062-23-1323","fundValue":"284099","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Greg Peter Kochanski","coPersons":["Elinor Lynwen Keane"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
