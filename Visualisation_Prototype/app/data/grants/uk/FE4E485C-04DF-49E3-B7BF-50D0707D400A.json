It also aims to reduce their lifecycle cost. Air transport demand is predicted to double in the next 10 - 15 years and triple in 20 years time. In order to enable sustained growth, whilst limiting the environmental impact of air transport in the future, the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) has set challenging targets for emission levels from gas turbines. Improvements in efficiency and increased operating temperature capability are required to address these issues. The reduction in fuel burn anticipated from the project can be converted to a reduction of 836 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per aircraft per year. To achieve this large reduction a multifaceted approach is necessary. Hence, the project is split into a number of work packages (WP) covering cooling, aerodynamics, aeromechanical interaction and materials. The latter facilitates a wider design space for the former packages and hence all packages are interlinked. The project forms part of the larger SAMULET programme. The cross-disciplinary approach being taken, in this programme, is expected to deliver greater technical capability when compared to previous more narrowly defined research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G035369/1","grantId":"EP/G035369/1","fundValue":"957486","fundStart":"2009-06-26","fundEnd":"2013-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Low K thermal barrier coatings are now specified for the Trent 1000 family of Rolls Royce engines.

Cranfield university's involvement in this TSB project was in the development of new high temperature coating systems (WP 1.1) and in the understanding of ice accretion on the fan blades (WP: 1.9).\n\n\n\nIn WP 1.1, two new high temperature coating systems have been developed, life performance assessed and transferred into Rolls Royces supply chain as a route to commercial manufacture. These are 1. a new bondcoat for a thermal barrier coating system and 2. a corrosion protection coating system. Both coating systems achieved the aim of increasing blade lifetime by at least a factor of x2.\n\nFurther, the aim was to develop methods to assess the durability of high temperature coating systems under cyclic oxidation, hot corrosion and corrosion-fatigue conditions. Probablistic life models, capable of predicting the 'risk of failure', have been developed for aerofoil component geometries, thus extending further Cranfield's research into high temperature probablistic lifetime modelling.\n\n\n\nIn WP 1.9, the behaviour of ice at different temperatures has been studied; how this affects the ice's properties, its accretion and shedding behaviour. This icing behaviour has been modelled and CFD and FE analysis have been used to validate these ice shedding models. The major success of this SAMULET programme may be measured by the 'take-up' of the technologies by Rolls Royce and its supply chain. This has specifically been addressed by the exploitation report produced by Rolls Royce for the TSB. Extracting from this report, the coating benefits of this work, when fully commercialised, would be worth ?100M over a 10 year base for engines of the Trent family. While the better understanding of icing mechanics, would allow new system designs saving ?1M on new engines to be built.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this SAMULET programme has seen a transfer of young talented engineers and experienced research staff into industry, support the aero-engine market sector. The primary route to expoitation is through Rolls Royce plc and its supply chain. \n\nThe new, improved bondcoat technology, increases current blade life by a factor of x2. This benefit, if implimented, would allow Rolls Royce to increase turbine entry temperature, whilst achieving the same projected engine life,thus increasing the available power and reducing emissions such as CO2, due to an increase in thermal efficiency and the associated savings on fuel burn.\n\nUnderstanding ice build up and shedding, will allow systems to be developed with Rolls Royce that limit ice accretion, mitigating the potential damage to fan blades and the compressor due to ballistic impact as a result of ice shedding.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the exploitation of academic outputs, the PI and both CoI's have been asked to present keynote papers in their specialist research areas. Research papers have been published in peer reviewed journals and as a result of such communications new research proposals have been developed and funded.
