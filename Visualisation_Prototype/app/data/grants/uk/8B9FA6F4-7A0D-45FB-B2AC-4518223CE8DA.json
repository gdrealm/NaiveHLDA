Lessons from Medell&iacute;n, Colombia\nSummary\nThis two-year research project set out to examine critically the experience of Medell&iacute;n, Colombia's second largest city (population 3.5 million), in seeking to reduce poverty and integrate into the urban fabric large marginalised areas, marked by years of severe poverty and violence. The research focused particularly on the impact of the novel use of two aerial cable-car lines connecting high-density hilly neighbourhoods with the rest of the city, and an associated urban upgrading programme. Though costly for local residents, the cable-cars lines provide a speedy and convenient system with low levels of environmental impact. The research found that the city's investment in a comprehensive programme of upgrading of the areas served by the cable-car lines involving social housing, increased public space, new libraries and schools designed by top architects, and economic support to local residents (training and employment in public works) had an even wider impact on residents' quality of life than the highly visible new mode of public transport. \nIt contrasted Medell&iacute;n's successful experience with Soacha (population 450,000), a municipality adjacent to Bogot&aacute;, where an aerial cable-car line has been proposed by the national government. The contrast between a well-resourced, well-managed municipality like Medell&iacute;n with a homogenously poor and institutionally weak municipality like Soacha offers valuable lessons to other cities in Latin America and elsewhere. Findings show that, to succeed, a new aerial cable-car line would have to be complemented with a broader set of urban upgrading interventions of the kind seen in Medellin, managed by well-resourced institutions with strong political support. \nThe research was led by UCL and involved both established and junior researchers, and research assistants in three Colombian institutions (Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad de los Andes; Universidad Del Rosario). \n\nSCIENTIFIC IMPACT\nSummarise scientific impact\nThe main scientific impact of the research arises from the fact that it is the first independent evaluation of Medellin's Metrocables, the world's first urban aerial cable-car mass transport system targeted at a low-income area. The impact of transport systems is usually measured in terms of variables such as modal choice, time and cost. This research sought to gather and process such data using quantitative methods (discrete choice models) from users and non-users of the aerial cable-car systems in the neighbourhoods where they were built. It complemented this with qualitative data gathered through observation, focus group discussions and detailed interviews, as well as through secondary statistical information and a process of institutional mapping. The combination of methods provided a local scientific impact in that it made possible a fruitful exchange between transport engineers and social scientists that is still relatively rare in the Colombian context.\n\nOutline findings and outputs from your project\nA better understanding of the relative importance of isolated transport infrastructure such as Metrocables compared to wider urban interventions in a middle-income country. Municipal investment in a comprehensive programme of upgrading had an even wider impact on residents' quality of life than the new form of public transport. Impact arises from a research design to evaluate the efficiency and reach of a transport system within a broader set of urban interventions and institutional framework. Cf. D&aacute;vila (2012 &amp; 2013), Brand &amp; D&aacute;vila (2011), D&aacute;vila &amp; Daste (2011).\nAnother finding relates to the nature and impact of the aerial cable-cars. Medell&iacute;n was the first city in the world to use ski lift technology to connect some of the poorest neighbourhoods with the city's mass-transit system. Residents' views about Metrocables vary: some benefit from lower travel costs and time savings, others complain about the long queues at peak hours. Transport costs have fallen for those making multi-modal trips (cable-Metro-feeder bus), and this compensates for the waiting time during peak hours. Gendered perceptions of modal safety affect the modal choice of bus over Metrocable by women. Similarly, while a gender perspective is not explicitly mainstreamed in these interventions, the way spaces have been upgraded and developed make them safer and more secure. See Arango et al. (2011), Agudelo et al. (2011), D&aacute;vila (2012 &amp; 2013), Levy (2013), D&aacute;vila &amp; Daste (2012).\nThe research has inspired new research (PhD theses at UCL &amp; Berkeley, MSc theses in Brazil, US &amp; Colombia), research on transport and land-use in Medellin (funded by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy), and on poor areas of Bogota and Soacha on community participation. Findings and the strong institutional linkages built during the research spurred additional academic activities involving staff not involved in the research and students at UCL and Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013 and 2014.\nOutline how these impacts were achieved\nBuilt-in to the research were a national (e.g. Colombia-based) and an international workshop in Colombia with over 200 participants from 20 countries to reflect upon the case of Medell&iacute;n. This outlined the main findings and provided an opportunity for representatives from aid agencies, national governments, municipalities, local communities, academics, students and international experts to share views on the effectiveness of the municipal interventions and assess the potential of applying this model in other cities. The discussion gave rise to an international network of policy makers and professionals in urban development to exchange best practices on urban mobility, and led to a major book (D&aacute;vila, 2012 &amp; 2013) on the subject aimed at policymakers and practitioners in the Global South.\nTeam members have delivered over 30 lectures and conference papers in eight countries including some on the methodological lessons arising from this multi-disciplinary research project.\nThe case study on Medellin has been incorporated into international policy-making guides for pro-poor urban upgrading. For instance, it was included in the UN-Habitat Guides and launched at Rio+20 in 2012, and in the International Resource Panel report, a clear recognition that urban sustainability requires cities to provide a greater diversity of energy-efficient, low-emission transport with low environmental impact to reduce inequalities.\nOutline who the findings and outputs had an impact upon\n• Members of the academic community and university students in Medellin, especially in the fields of urban development, urban planning, transport engineering, housing, social development.\n• Junior researchers in the partner institutions in London, Medellin and Bogota.\n• UCL academics and international students who have built on the strong institutional linkages between the research partners in London and Medellin.\n• Academics internationally wishing to have a better grasp of a specific example of the links between urban mobility and poverty, and more particularly how a municipal government intervention can affect these; this includes a growing number of PhD research projects and MSc theses by aspiring academics in different countries, including Latin America, US and Europe.\n\nECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL IMPACT\nSummarise impact(s)\nThe societal impact of the research arises partly from the fact that it rigorously documented the nature and effects of a very specific set of interventions in a city that is fast becoming an almost paradigmatic 'best practice' case among medium-sized cities of the Global South. The research has attracted widespread international interest from academics as well as from policy makers, with officials in a range of Latin American cities and national governments requesting copies of the research reports, copies of the book (D&aacute;vila, 2012 &amp; 2013), or both. As municipal and national concern with the growing problems of urban poverty and inequality as well as interest in short-term transport solutions such as aerial cable-cars multiply around the world, growing demand of the findings from this research demonstrates an eagerness to understand the potential economic, social and transport impacts of such systems.\nThe research has helped promote a heightened international discussion amongst policy-makers, planners and professional practitioners on the linkages between urban mobility and poverty, and its findings have been reflected in increased international media attention and high-level workshop events. In Medellin the research helped raise the profile of low-income communities among local politicians and the public at large, and contributed to a greater sense of ownership of the new urban infrastructure and pride among residents. In Soacha it highlighted the considerable institutional weaknesses and technical difficulties that a proposed new system might encounter. The research also impacted positively on local capacity building by engaging young researchers in in-depth, rigorous academic research; it gave both established and young researchers an outlet for rigorous research on an important issue they would otherwise not have explored with the same depth. \nOutline findings and outputs\nThe research rigorously examined Medell&iacute;n as a case study of municipally-led interventions across successive administrations seeking to redress deep and long-standing social and spatial imbalances, working with communities whilst strengthening the city's municipal revenue base and maintaining public ownership of key assets. In a context of neoliberal urbanisation where the market is often seen as the main contributor to 'modern' urban development, under some conditions local government can provide crucial leadership. Central to this are a strong and stable revenue base and a small number of institutions within Medell&iacute;n, e.g. the Metro Company, and the municipally-owned public utilities company (EPM) which in 2010-12 injected ca. US$1,350 million in surplus to the municipality. By contrast, Soacha lacks the capacity to administer a similar project, and only the intervention of powerful institutions such as the government of Bogot&aacute; or even the country would offer any chance of success. See Brand &amp; D&aacute;vila (2011); D&aacute;vila (2012 &amp; 2013); D&aacute;vila &amp; Brand (2013), Bahl (2012), Acevedo (2013).\nIn Medellin, the research - including both the process of gathering and processing data and its dissemination through a range of means including the two workshops - helped raise the profile of low-income communities in hilly areas, and contributed to a greater sense of ownership of the new urban infrastructure and pride among residents. In Soacha the research highlighted the considerable institutional weaknesses and technical difficulties that a proposed new system might encounter if built.\nAnother finding relates to the scale of interest that a project of this kind generates among academics and practitioners in urban planning and transport engineering, as well as policy-makers and municipal officials in Colombia and around the world. \nOutline how these impacts were achieved\nThe main output of the research is a book (D&aacute;vila, 2012 &amp; 2013) bringing together findings from Medellin and Soacha and case studies in cities which have already or are seeking to implement similar projects: Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, La Paz and Cali. 500 copies of the Spanish version were distributed widely in Colombia and Latin America, with the free online version accessed 4,264 times between 14/12/12 and 8/11/13. The English version, launched in October 2013 in London, will be the focus of a special event at the World Urban Forum in Medellin in April 2014. Several scientific publications were also produced, largely for an academic audience. Team members have delivered over 30 lectures and conference papers in eight countries and have participated in discussions and interviews with policy makers and other decision makers at local, national (Colombia), and international levels.\n\nFindings have attracted attention of policy-makers nationally and internationally. The Medell&iacute;n research team was approached by Bogot&aacute;'s government in 2012 interested in designing cable-car systems. The Bogot&aacute; team was approached by the national government for advice on Soacha. The CEO of the Medell&iacute;n Metro Company, a commercial enterprise owned jointly by the Municipality and the Province of Antioquia, requested copies of the book for all members of the Executive Board.\n\nMunicipal and national officials in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Cuba have also requested copies of the book. The research has had coverage in the popular media. For example, Prof. D&aacute;vila has been interviewed about the findings for TV and radio in Colombia and for internet radio in Mexico.\nOutline who the findings and outputs had an impact upon\n• Practitioners and policy-makers in the fields of urban planning and transport in Medellin.\n• The organised low-income communities in the affected areas of Medellin.\n• The residents of the low-income areas of Soacha where an aerial cable-car system is planned.\n• Officials in Medellin's local government institutions, most notably the Metro Company and the Municipality.\n• Policy-makers and technical staff at national government level in Colombia and other Latin American countries (and elsewhere) with a responsibility for designing transport systems and urban upgrading programmes that benefit the urban poor.\n\nUNEXPECTED IMPACTS\nInterest in the results of this research and on the range of innovative urban management and planning interventions in Medellin is constantly growing, with universities especially in the US and Europe, practitioners, and policy-makers seeking to learn from them. Visits to Medellin by doctoral researchers and post-graduate student groups are on the increase, with local researchers and students often benefitting from exchanges. In the case of UCL, a group of academics and their students has built on the strong institutional linkages arising from the project. It is expected that the detailed findings from this research, not simply its detailed description and analysis of Medellin itself, but especially the deliberate contrast with Soacha, will continue informing such academic exercises. Perhaps more importantly, it is expected that they will inform policy-makers (e.g. mayors, ministers) and specialised professionals in making decisions about the intersection of mass transit systems and the relative isolation of many low-income areas by drawing on some of the lessons from the comparison between Medellin and Soacha. \n\nPOTENTIAL FUTURE IMPACTS \nMedellin's experience will receive a major boost to its image and unprecedented exposure to its interventions of the kind described in the research when it host the UN-Habitat's World Urban Forum in April 2014. This biennial event is the largest concentration of human settlement specialists in the world and the 2014 version will offer an important contribution to the discussion on the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, more particularly on how cities and urban residents are to be considered in a common set of goals for governments and development agencies. As said earlier, the two language versions of the book will be the subject of a special event at the Forum, in the hope of calling attention to the specific nexus between poverty and urban mobility. \n\nIMPACT LIMITATIONS (SOCIETAL &amp; ECONOMIC)\nThere are limitations in disseminating research outputs, particularly to (low-income) communities and policy makers outside Medellin. To overcome this, the Spanish version of the book was made available as a freely downloadable online publication, with printed copies distributed among community leaders and key local and national stakeholders.\nAnother limitation of the impact of the research relates to the frequent political changes at local government which means that often policy lessons are forgotten. Medellin has benefitted from political continuity over the past decade or so, but most other cities (e.g. Soacha) do not. By showing how mobility is directly related to poverty both nationally and internationally, the research has given visibility to a rapidly growing urban problem for which a range of solutions is available.

Medell?n was the first city in the world to use conventional ski lift technology to connect some of the poorest neighbourhoods (where daily lives had marked by high levels of deprivation and violence) with the city's mass-transit overground train.

Municipal investment in a comprehensive programme of upgrading had an even wider impact on residents' quality of life than the new form of public transport. New public facilities are designed by top architects using high-quality materials, a deliberate reversal of the conventional approach of providing low-quality services for the poor. While a gender perspective is not explicitly mainstreamed in these interventions, the way spaces have been upgraded and developed make them safer and more secure. See D?vila (2012 &amp;amp; 2013), Brand &amp;amp; D?vila (2011), Levy (2013), D?vila &amp;amp; Daste (2011).\n\nA fourth finding relates to the scale of interest that a project of this kind arises among specialists and municipal officials around the world. This was shown in the high number of hits received by the project website (close to 5,000 online reads of the Spanish-version book between mid-December 2012 and mid-November 2013). The main output of the research (D?vila 2012 &amp;amp; 2013) brings together for the first time selected case studies in cities which have or are seeking to implement similar projects: Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, La Paz and Cali. Access to affordable and efficient transport is an essential need of poor residents in fast-growing urban areas of the Global South. The research examined the role of Medellin, a progressive local government in Colombia, in providing improved access to transport infrastructure for excluded low-income populations. It contrasted this with Soacha, a poorly run municipality adjacent to Bogota. Its scientific impact lies in being the first independent evaluation of the world's first urban aerial cable-car mass transport system targeted at a low-income area. This involved multi-disciplinary work combining quantitative and qualitative methods to understand the transport-engineering dimensions of the new transport system, measure the societal impacts of a range of municipal interventions in low-income areas marked for years by problems of severe poverty, violence, and inadequate access to services, and map the institutional environment that made these possible. \n\n\n\nThe societal impact of the research arises partly from documenting the nature and effects of a very specific set of interventions in a city that is fast becoming an almost paradigmatic 'best practice' case among medium-sized cities of the Global South. Thus, the research has attracted widespread international interest from policy makers as well as academics, with officials in a range of Latin American cities and national governments requesting copies of the research reports, copies of the book (D?vila, 2013), or both. The case study has been incorporated into international policy-making guides for pro-poor urban upgrading. For instance, it was included in the UN-Habitat Guides and launched at Rio+20 in 2012, and in the International Resource Panel report, a clear recognition that urban sustainability requires cities to provide a greater diversity of energy-efficient, low-emission transport with low environmental impact to reduce inequalities.\n\n\n\nThe lessons from studying the use and impact of simple ski-lift technology go beyond those for transport, urban development and poverty specialists, and can be of use to those interested in low-energy, low-emissions transport systems particularly in the context of climate change and high carbon footprint of mega-projects.
