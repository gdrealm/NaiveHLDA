{"id":"8A74A179-E3FB-4284-B3F6-891C96CA461A","title":"Next Generation Sequencing High Throughput Epigenomics","abstractText":"Recent evidence suggests that an adult individual?s health and susceptibility to common diseases can sometimes be traced back to environmental and nutritional effects experienced by their mothers or grandmothers during pregnancy. The ?experiences? of the foetus during development in its mother?s womb appears to alter the way that an individuals genome is interpreted in later life leading to, in some cases, increase susceptibility to certain diseases. This altered genome interpretation can in some cases be passed passed on to the next generation as well, even in the absence of the original conditions. Though we have the sequence of the entire human genome, we know little about how it works, and how it is interpreted by cells. In this project we will take advantage of recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing technologies that will permit us to collect hugely increased amounts of data from the genomes of cells before, during and after development. In addition to revealing important information about the workings of the genome these results will provide important insights into the fetal origins of adult disease and potentially lead to new strategies for prevention and new medicines or therapies for treatment of conditions that affect the quality of life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801156","grantId":"G0801156","fundValue":"777701","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolf  Reik","coPersons":["Gavin Derek Kelsey","Peter  Fraser","Patrick  Varga-Weisz","Anne  Ferguson-Smith"],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
