Current technology produces artefacts which are prone to failure by shear during implantation and subsequent performance. This is very costly to the NHS and very distressing to patients who have to undergo revision surgery. In this project we are testing a new procedure which will generate an interlocked coating-substrate topography. This novel coating procedure will be optimised and the shear strength at the coating-substrate interface will be measured and compared with that of specimens produced by current technology. The aim is to commercialise the new technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007342/1","grantId":"EP/H007342/1","fundValue":"127310","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our invention has attracted the attention of Orthopaedic Research (UK) who have funded several PhD and research fello positions to further this work. Very important, it has attracted the attention of British industry who further funded an IMPACT PhD studentship and this has led to further funding to commercially exploit our finding via THe Royal Society (Brian Mercer Innovation feasibility award 2013) and EPSRC grant EP/L024225/1 which started 01 November 2014.
