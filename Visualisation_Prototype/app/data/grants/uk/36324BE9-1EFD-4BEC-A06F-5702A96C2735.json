{"id":"36324BE9-1EFD-4BEC-A06F-5702A96C2735","title":"KitBoost: Enabling Early Career Researchers with Small Equipment","abstractText":"Heriot-Watt University has made significant achievements in supporting its Early Career Researchers (ECRs). In 2010, we were amongst the first UK institutions to have been awarded the European Commission 'HR Excellence in Research' accreditation for our implementation of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their Recruitment. More recently in September 2012 we have been shortlisted in two categories of the Times Higher Education (THE) 2012 Awards - 'Outstanding Contribution to Leadership Development' and 'Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers'.\n\nThis recognition has been predominantly through the quality of development activities at institutional level available to ECRs and the creation of opportunities to establish cross-disciplinary networks and connections to enhance their research capacity and impact. These always complement School-level initiatives which support ECRs including for example access to dedicated funds for travel and conference/training event attendance, access to Scholarships to assist new lecturers find their first research students.\n\nKitBoost will take these initiatives further by establishing a boost to the start-up facilities that ECRs require in establishing their research careers. The areas of research to supported are varied and include the National Capabilities Themes of Catalysis, Quantum optics, Water Engineering, Microsystems and many others. Cutting across these most of the research programmes also contribute to Challenge Themes, especially 'Manufacturing the Future', 'Energy', 'Digital Economy' and 'Healthcasre Technologies'.\n\nIn preparing the proposal, we encouraged as many Early Career Researchers working in areas within EPSRC's remit as possible to explicitly identify specific items of equipment (under &pound;10,000 including VAT) that would make a valuable contribution to their research programmes. We identified nearly 40 academic ECRs in working in research groups with many associated EPSRC-fundedResearch Associates research students. These in turn identified over 30 research programmes that the additional of a number of items of small equipment items would enable them to overcome current limitations; a list of over 120 separate equipment items and with repetitions this amounted to nearly 250 individual pieces. Within the requested budget of &pound;625,000 (fEC) we would be able to fund just over half of these. We note EPSRC are potentially willing to extend the overall budget for the call after for and therefore have prioritised the list and individuals so that we could respond to funding at a the requested level very rapidly but could also respond positively and quickly to funding at a higher level without detriment to the timescale of delivery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031643/1","grantId":"EP/K031643/1","fundValue":"500000","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This award provided small pieces (under ?10k) for over 50 ECRs across the University (hence a project-specific email not possible), a selection of developments follows:\n\nA: The CPS devices and the underlying framework (UBilts) provide a variety of ways in configuring body-area networks. Thus it can be easily integrated to/for any domains and application front ends and made pervasive. Safety critical activities can be monitored in a real environment rather than soley lab-based. Particulalry, CPS technologies is new to the construction industry, enabling them to reduce the time and costs of saftey training while at the same time conducting human factors research at operational level (i.e., on site). \n\nB: Better understanding of thermal spray splat morphologies will improve bonding characteristics of thin film coatings. This leads to thinner more uniform coat and better coating properties.\n\nC: The research findings suggest that an environmentally friendly system for reducing CO2 emission is possible using enzymes and synthetic catalysts. This has direct impact on energy, the environment and chemicals sector. Further the products from these CO2 processing can become building blocks for pharmaceutical products.

Increase research capability to delivery specialist CPU-GPU HPC training on numerical skills to research students to pioneer the use of meshless methods in modelling ferro-magnetic fluids \n\nC: The equipment (spectrometer + CCD camera) has allowed us to expand the remit of our research interests. This equipment was initially acquired to support a collaboration between theory and experimental groups in the area of quantum coherence in biological systems (e.g. photo-synthesis). A grant application was also submitted to EPSRC but was not funded. However, the collaboration is still proceeding, now on different topic, i.e. generation of triplet photon states. The equipment has also been used to perform studies on artificial black holes created in the lab using lasers. A number of routes have been explored, many of them promising but not good enough to reproduce all of the physics we are looking for. This has therefore allowed us to home-in and fine tune our system and we are steadily perfecting our artificial black holes to the point that we believe that soon we will have excellent results.\n\nD: The Parr Reactor and GC have been used for a CO2 conversion project. So far we have developed a new catalytic system combining bio- and heterogeneous(synthetic) catalysts for CO2 conversion to methanol.\n\nE: The equipment has been used in a quantum optics lab. The equipment was invaluable for the collection of the data for two publications. This award provided small pieces (&amp;amp;amp;gt;?10k) for over 50 ECRs across the University (hence a project-specific email not possible), a selection of potential future developments follows:\n\nA: The UBilts framework has recently been used to develop brain-controlled interfaces (BCI) and serious games. The current CPS technology coupled with physics-based human dynamic modelling will be taken forwards in human factors research in an upcoming KTP project in the domain of Oil and Gas.\n\nB: Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
