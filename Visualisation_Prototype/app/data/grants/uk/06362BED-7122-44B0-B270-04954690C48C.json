Sometimes the immune system goes wrong and this can cause serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Our research aims to understand at a molecular level how the cells of the immune system are able to recognise microbes and the ways in which these cells respond to cause the familiar symptoms of an infection such as fever and tiredness, and to generate specific antibodies that fight the invading microbes. In this project we will study the way in which immune system cells respond to a powerful toxins, such as endotoxin or LPS, released by certain types of bacteria during an infection. Although normal responses to endotoxin are an important part of the fight against infection, it can cause a highly dangerous condition called endotoxic shock in patients with severe septicaemia and this pathological response frequently causes organ failure and death. In fact endotoxin shock is responsible for about 135000 deaths every year in Europe alone. The proposed studies should shed light on why endotoxin can produce a beneficial reaction in some conditions and a damaging response in others.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G002797/1","grantId":"BB/G002797/1","fundValue":"779419","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Gay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
