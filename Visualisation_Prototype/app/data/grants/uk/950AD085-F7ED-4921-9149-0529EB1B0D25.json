Themed 'Voters in Context', the study has been designed to aid understanding of how the changing political, economic and social context impact on British electoral behaviour. It will include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>a high quality address-based random probability sample face-to-face post-election survey</li>\n\n <li>an inter-election internet panel across eight waves, including a daily rolling thunder campaign study of voters during the election campaign</li>\n\n <li>a 'Comparative Study of Electoral Systemsâ€™ module in the post-election survey. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Innovations include the harvesting of twitter data in the campaign, the use of interactive technologies to map the personal social contexts of respondents, and the use of experimental methodology to enable comparison across the BES series. The study will develop an integrated data infrastructure for the study of elections through a program of data linkage and training.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005294/1","grantId":"ES/K005294/1","fundValue":"1422210","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings from BESIP wave 1 and wave 2 data have been used in blog posts publicised on the BES website addressing a wide variety of issues in British politics (e.g. which political parties UKIP are picking support from, individuals vote intention in the European Parliament elections, the impact of political party conferences and the North-South divide in Britain's electoral support), Consultations (PSA media briefing on the European Parliament election in London May 2014, EPOP Conference in Edinburgh September 2014) the press (The Telegraph, The Daily Express, The Financial Times, The Huffington Post and online at BBC News May 2014) and tv and radio (BBC Vote 2014 on Local and European Elections with David Dimbleby May 2014, BBC News Channel, BBC Radio 5 Live on Local by-elections in Heywood &amp;amp; Middleton &amp;amp; Clacton).\n\nFindings from the BES have been used in the media and publishing (journalists have used BES data either in print form or findings have been publicised in tv/radio by members of the scientific leadership team), teaching and education (BES data used in presentations to students as part of ESRC festival of Social Science), marketing, advertising and PR (BES Impact Film has been commissioned and will be available on the BES website and via the University of Manchester YouTube channel).

As project is only 1/4 of way through and data has only recently been released it is too early to chart this. However we have begun to demonstrate via our own analysis on www.britishelectionstudy.com/ various interesting political developments including factors behind the rise of UKIP (e.g that UKIP draws most of its support from ex-conservative voters) . We are very confident that the data will be widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we are putting into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage (eg.the BES data Playground) Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
