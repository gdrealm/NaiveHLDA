The seminars will build on knowledge and capacity already generated by including local position papers indicating what impact the project has had to date, and identifying future strategic actions, and an implementation plan, in relation to the findings. </p>\n\n<p>This project will also extend and develop its website&nbsp;as a central resource for information about higher education in Africa with a view to maximising impact on practice and sharing examples of good practice. Further publications will be produced on the research findings from the 100 Equity Scorecards and the interviews with 200 students and 200 staff and policymakers. </p>\n\n<p>The project will contribute to capacity-building and to the internationalisation of widening participation research in higher education by drawing on important sources of qualitative and quantitative data from sub-Saharan Africa.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H034749/1","grantId":"ES/H034749/1","fundValue":"81237","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2011-01-11","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Morley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
