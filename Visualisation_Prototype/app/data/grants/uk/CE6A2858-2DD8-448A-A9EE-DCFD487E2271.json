{"id":"CE6A2858-2DD8-448A-A9EE-DCFD487E2271","title":"Pain rehabilitation: E/Motion-based automated coaching","abstractText":"Almost 1 in 7 UK citizens suffer from chronic pain, much of which is mechanical lower back pain with no treatable pathology. Pain management rehabilitative programs suffer from two shortcomings: (a) there are too few resources in the health care system to treat all patients face-to-face; (b) current approaches fail to integrate treatment of interrelated physiological and psychological factors. Combining expertise from engineering, clinical health sciences, and industry through a multidisciplinary team of investigators and advisors, this proposal seeks to address both shortcomings by (a) developing a set of methods for automatically recognising audiovisual cues associated with pain, behavioural patterns typical of pain, and affective states influencing pain and activity, and (b) integrating these methods into an interactive computer system that will provide appropriate feedback and prompts to the patient based on his/her behaviour measured during self-directed exercise and fitness-building sessions. This intelligent system will enable and motivate patients to continue their progress in extending activity inside (and in the longer term, outside) the clinical environment and thus will facilitate their reintegration into social and working life.In doing so, the project aims to make major contributions in a number of research areas. First, the project will significantly expand the state of the art in the field of emotion recognition by extending current methods in affective body gesture recognition, facial expression recognition and affective vocalisation recognition to deal with naturalistic rather than acted emotional expressions. This entails theoretical and practical contributions to important challenges such as detection and tracking of human behavioural cues in real world unconstrained environments, spatiotemporal analysis of complex dynamic stimuli such as non-linguistic vocalisations, facial expressions, and body movements, and spatiotemporal fusion of multimodal data streams in which constraints of synchronisation are relaxed. Second, the project will advance our understanding of how affect and pain-related moods such as fear, depression, and frustration in particular, interact with motor behaviour to not only modify pain expressions, but also to produce guarded movements that can exacerbate pain or worsen disability. This, in turn, will contribute to the body of work on cognitive behavioural models of pain to improve the diagnosis and management of pain behaviours. Finally, the project will contribute a novel user-centred approach to developing patients' understanding of their body movement during self-directed therapy; it will also identify what type of feedback best promotes engagement and encourages persistence, and offsets the negative effects of pain-related anxiety, frustration, and low-mood. Patients, clinicians and members of the advisory team will be periodically involved in the design of the interface and the testing of the system through design workshops. The system will eventually be made available for long term testing to the Pain Management Centre of the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, London.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H017178/1","grantId":"EP/H017178/1","fundValue":"1154530","fundStart":"2010-05-04","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nadia Luisa Berthouze","coPersons":["Amanda Clare Williams"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" 1) A multifacted first of a kind dataset has been aquired and compiled that is needed to underpin the design much needed affect aware rehabilitaiton systems for chronic lower back pain. This corpus will be made available to the research community soon after the end of the project. New algorithms based in the multi task learning paradigm has contributed to the issue of person specfic effects a for datasets containing data from various subjects. \n\n2) An extended set of qualitative studies with people with chronic pain and physiotherapists has led to a better understanding of people's needs and strategies to facilitate physical activity despite pain. These findings have led to propose mechanisms for personalized sonification mechanisms as a way to increase patients' awareness of movement and related processes (rather than movement correction), confidence and self-efficacy. Informed by extended qualitative studies at the Pain Centre at National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN) and in the homes of people with chronic pain, and by control studies with people with chronic pain, we have proposed that, whereas in acute pain and induced pain, technology is being used to provide fun and facilitate attention away from pain, in chronic pain, auditory feedback can provide a pleasurable yet information-rich stimulus to facilitates attention to movement as a non-threat activity. Through body movement and sound, patients can design an aural space within which they can exercise and explore their body. Results showed increase awareness and confidence in movement and increased perceived self-efficacy. \n\n3) We have currently designed 3 platforms \n\n(a) full-body sensing (motion capture) platform for an in-depth study of movement in pain;\n(b) a Kinect-based application (in collaboration with the University of Genoa) for a more coarse detection of body movement; and \n(c) finally a wearable smartphone-based device with a minimal number of sensors (Sing et al., 2014; Digital Health Prize 2nd prize (judged as the most innovative app - the 1st price went to ready to deploy apps). \n\nAll three platforms integrate movement and breathing sensors (designed by my team) with the first two also including EMG sensors. A key aim of the smartphone-based device is to bring physical rehabilitation away from mere physical activity sessions toward daily life functioning by facilitating awareness and management of body physical and emotional resources.
