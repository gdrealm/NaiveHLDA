An fMRI study of derivational processes in English","abstractText":"<p>Most of the words we use are complex, consisting of meaningful and structural subparts (eg, dis-agree-ment). The system of rules that govern the internal structure of words is called morphology. Inflectional morphology marks grammatical information such as number and tense to produce new forms of the same root form without change in meaning (eg hear to hearing). </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, derivational morphology produces new words in which the basic meaning of the root and the syntactic class may change; for example, the noun creeper is quite distant in meaning from the verb creep. </p>\n\n<p>The productive power of morphological processes is clearly shown in English which has approximately one hundred derivational affixes (eg, -ist, -ism, -er) to create new words. </p>\n\n<p>Evidence is accumulating that complex words are stored in the mental lexicon in a morphologically decomposed form. However, even models of morphological decomposition argue that the relationship between roots and affixes is determined by relationships in either meaning or sound form. In contrast, we argue that morphological principals govern both the representations and processing of complex words. </p>\n\n<p>This research will generate new experimental fMRI and behavioural evidence for morphologically governed word representations and word recognition processes. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4222","grantId":"RES-000-22-4222","fundValue":"77831","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linda  Wheeldon","coPersons":["Peter Christopher Hansen","Aditi  Lahiri"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
