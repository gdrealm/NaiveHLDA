{"id":"DDCCEC05-3A2C-4453-8B33-B6DBB17A9ABE","title":"Diverse Teachers for Diverse Learners: Research and Perspectives","abstractText":"<p>Across the UK and in the other countries participating in this series (Canada, Iceland, Norway and Australia) there is increasing ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity due to a range of political and economic factors. This diversity is reflected in learner populations in schools. Yet in the countries under consideration the teaching profession is predominantly white, female and Anglophone.&nbsp;Ethnic, cultural and&nbsp; linguistic diversity is not reflected in the teaching profession and where teachers diversifying from this 'norm' are employed they have often experienced discrimination and there are high rates of attrition.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>It is essential that the linguistic and cultural needs of all pupils are met.&nbsp;Many teachers from backgrounds other than&nbsp; the dominant one, bring&nbsp; the potential of linguistic and cultural capital to enhance the profession and students' learning. This series will involve employers, academics, teachers and learners and aims to encourage jurisdictions to view diverse teachers as a resource rather than a deficit and to be able to capitalise on the particular skill sets brought to the profession by diverse teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The series will seek to explore the nature of the existing diversity in the teaching profession and to consider diversity in the life cycle of teachers as professionals.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002561/1","grantId":"ES/I002561/1","fundValue":"18384","fundStart":"2011-02-21","fundEnd":"2013-02-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  A direct result of the funding of the seminar series was enabling a successful bid to NordForsk to fund a 3 year Diverse teachers for Diverse Learners research network (from October 2011) which held its final conference at the home institution of the series: University of Strathclyde in May 2014. Further we were successful in a bid for recognition as an International Research Network by the World Education Research Association (WERA_IRN). This network officially launched in Toronto at the end of April 2014 and has already expanded the reach and potential impact of the original group.\nFinal Impact report accepted July 2014 - no further impact to report since that date.

We also were usefully able to begin an exploration of the intersectionality of other aspects of social identities such as gender and social class which can act together with ethnicity and language to result in structural and institutional discrimination.
