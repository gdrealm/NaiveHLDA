We shall also be examining how technology design can be combined with the design of sustainable business models in parallel design activities, and developing new sustainable business models for rural co-operatives.The software and business systems will be designed as a collaboration between UK researchers and local software and business development organisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E026052/1","grantId":"EP/E026052/1","fundValue":"93886","fundStart":"2006-09-28","fundEnd":"2009-06-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiaolan  Fu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
