Significant volumes of oil may be found in this region, however the prediction of the distribution of this oil and its recovery, using reservoir simulation and centrifuge measurements of capillary pressure, is known to be problematic. Tidal influences on sub-surface fluid pressures have been observed for over a hundred years. Although the amplitude and the frequency of this forcing on reservoir pressure is small it is nonethless possible that over long periods of time it may enhance gravitational sgregation between oil and water. Not only may this improve the prediction of oil reserves in new discoveries, it may alter predictions of aquifer discharge and contaminant redistribution with aquifers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D075424/1","grantId":"EP/D075424/1","fundValue":"54440","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann  Muggeridge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
