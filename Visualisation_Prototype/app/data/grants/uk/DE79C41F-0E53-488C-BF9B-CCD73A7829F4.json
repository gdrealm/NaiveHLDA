Taken together, these surveys will generate a unique body of information about political representation within Europe's developing polity.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The research also extends a valuable time-series of surveys of MEPs; generates a new dataset which is likely to be widely used by students and researchers of EU and EP politics; and provides valuable insights into the campaigning behaviour of MEPs and what influences their behaviour inside the European Parliament.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1983","grantId":"RES-062-23-1983","fundValue":"100175","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Jeremy Hix","coPersons":["David  Farrell","Roger Michael Scully"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
