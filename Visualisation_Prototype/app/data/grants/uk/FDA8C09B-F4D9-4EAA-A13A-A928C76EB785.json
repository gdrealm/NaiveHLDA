Probably the most significant achievement has been mapping the cosmological distribution of matter in a range of wavebands, as well as inferring the distribution of dark matter. Thus we can visualise how dark matter pulls together gas and measure the quantity of star formation that results. All important results from these grants form part of the academic research literature, and will be elaborated further by interested specialists.
