Seven major survey data sources (five with a UK/English focus and two international) will be analysed, complemented by a rigorous framework analysis of two qualitative datasets using specialist qualitative software. The findings will provide a complete view of financial well-being among older people.<br /><br />A further key objective is to effectively disseminate the research findings and methodology to the academic community, policy makers and practitioners. This will be achieved by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>producing a comprehensive research report</li>\n\n <li>submitting three articles to policy-relevant peer-reviewed journals</li>\n\n <li>hosting a research symposium</li>\n\n <li>a range of seminars and methodological presentations</li>\n\n <li>presenting our work at three conferences.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004263/1","grantId":"ES/K004263/1","fundValue":"140527","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-03-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharon  Collard","coPersons":["Dylan  Kneale","David  Sinclair","David Andrew Hayes","Andrea Dawn Finney"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
