Through questionnaires and in-depth interviews the study has explored the nature and extent of family and social networks both within and external to the Chinese community in the UK, and the nature and extent of any connections with families or communities in Hong Kong. Members of these family and social networks in Hong Kong have been interviewed to establish a full picture of the links between the Chinese community in the UK, and the Chinese living in Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>This study&nbsp; has resulted in an improved understanding of the nature and inter-connectedness of informal relationships between the Chinese community in Hong Kong and the UK, and how these relationships impact upon the use of health and social care. This understanding, developed in partnership with the community, has been shared with the Chinese community to assist NGOs within the UK Chinese community to respond to the challenges of migration and transnationalism.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3656","grantId":"RES-000-22-3656","fundValue":"79627","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven M Shardlow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
