{"id":"2EAE3A4A-BDE7-4842-926B-C0489DEB5CCC","title":"Re-thinking Ryle","abstractText":"Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Man was published over 50 years ago to wide acclaim but his legacy is tempered because of important misconceptions about a) the relevance of this book today; b) his antipathy towards Behaviourism; and c) his conception of the task of philosophy (itself involving a misconception about Ryle's understanding of meaning). Re-thinking Ryle will be a collection of around 10 essays bringing Ryle's arguments up to date by showing their relevance to contemporary doctrines in the philosophy of mind against the back ground of his lesser known article, thereby arguing for a new appreciation of the importance of Ryle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112745/1","grantId":"112745/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Tanney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
