Adhesion is needed for holding the body together and for keeping cells in the right place. During the course of many diseases, adhesion is used by cells to move abnormally throughout the body. Consequently, drugs that control adhesion might be useful for treating cardiovascular diseases, asthma, cancer, bacterial infections and ulcers. The work proposed in this application uses a combination of techniques to solve the structure of some important adhesive proteins. If successful, the work will help us to understand more about how the molecules involved in adhesion work. It might also suggest ways to design drugs to control adhesion or to engineer tissues.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D008719/1","grantId":"BB/D008719/1","fundValue":"231622","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Through published papers and providing preliminary data for follow-up experiments.

The work in this project used a combination of techniques to solve the structure of some important adhesive proteins. Limited progress was made towards this ambitious aim, but we do now have a better understanding of how the molecules work. New recombinant versions of integrin- and syndecan-binding domains of human fibronectin have been generated. These\nconstructs have a series of affinity tags for purification.
