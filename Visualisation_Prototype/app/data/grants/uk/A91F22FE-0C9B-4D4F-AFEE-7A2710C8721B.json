There are several drugs that can help, and psychological support is also effective. There is an opportunity to evaluate a drug (Tabex) that has been in use in Eastern Europe for many years, is generic and cheap to manufacture ? so much so that it costs less than one fifth of current medications. This would be of considerable benefit to UK smokers, the NHS and perhaps more importantly to low income smokers overseas. The proposed rigorous trial would be conducted in Poland and would represent exceptional value for money.\n\nThe findings will be taken forward through discussion with the MHRA and other relevant regulatory bodies to establish a basis for licensing. The results will also be dissemintated through appropriate press offices once a paper has been punlished in an appropriate peer review journal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501300","grantId":"G0501300","fundValue":"223432","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Jeremy West","coPersons":["Paul  Aveyard","Magda  Cedzynska","John  Stapleton","Witold  Zatonski"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
