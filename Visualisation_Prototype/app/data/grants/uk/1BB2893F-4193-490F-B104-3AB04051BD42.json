In humans, dysfunction of the clock not only generates temporal disorientation and sleep problems, but is also involved in pathologies such as obesity, mental illness, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism for the study of circadian rhythms because the clock mechanism shares the same design and molecular components with mammals. The clock is an endogenous and self-sustained process driven by the interplay of many proteins. Among these there are molecules whose function is to receive and integrate environmental cues, and pass on this information to other clock proteins. The blue-light photopigment CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) is one such molecule, but in some cells, CRY also performs as a core clock protein independent from light. We have been working with CRY for several years and recently have discovered that another protein, we (ironically) call DAY, is able to interact with CRY, but only at night. DAY contains four PDZ domains, which are regions involved in protein-protein interactions. PDZ proteins can bring together membrane bound and cytosolic components to promote certain signalling pathways. Our preliminary work has shown that day mRNA cycles and is present in the lateral brain, most likely in a subset of circadian neurons where CRY functions exclusively as a photopigment. We did not detect the expression of day in the dorsal brain, nor in peripheral cells such as the eyes or the Malpighian tubules, where CRY also provides core clock function, suggesting that DAY may inhibit this role. In this proposal we aim to test this hypothesis as follows. We will characterise the expression of DAY and extend our work on day mRNA. We will provide additional evidence for the interaction between DAY and CRY. We will investigate the molecular, cellular and behavioural phenotypes arising from several combinations of up- and down-regulation of day and cry in central clock neurons and in peripheral tissues. These studies will elucidate the role played by this novel protein involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and will contribute to the understanding of the mode of action of CRY. Moreover, we believe that our work will add some mechanistic information to the catalogue of discrepancies reported for the different classes of central clock neurons.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F008988/1","grantId":"BB/F008988/1","fundValue":"434279","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We led the development of an international consortium INsecTIME, which has applied for a Marie Curie Initial Training Network.

Although the current molecular model portrays the clock as cell autonomous, evidence has shown that cross-talk among neurons is an essential part of its functioning. However, our understanding of the functional organisation of the neuronal network is still limited. For many years we have been studying the blue-light detecting protein CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), whose function is to receive light information and pass it on to other clock proteins. The starting point of this work has been the discovery of a novel protein, DAY, seemingly able to interact with CRY. DAY contains four PDZ domains, regions involved in protein-protein interactions that are found in proteins promoting signalling pathways. Our first findings suggested that DAY might be present in the Lateral Neurons but not in peripheral clock cells. The former are clock cells were CRY has only light-dependent activities, in the latter CRY seems able to operate also independently from light. Our hypothesis was that DAY might be responsible for the different functions that CRY exerts in different cell types. During this project we realised that DAY is not found in the canonical Lateral Neurons, although it is present in cells very close by. After many experiments we obtained evidence that DAY is not directly involved in the circadian clock, but modulates sleep homeostasis. Likewise, CRY, which we have confirmed interacts with DAY in vivo, is involved in the regulation of sleep. We have also shown that misregulation of DAY increases sexual arousal. Males start courting females earlier and are more effective than controls. Potentially this might be caused by two mechanisms. 1. A generalised increased in arousal, as evinced by sleep reduction. 2. DAY is expressed in olfactory glomeruli involved in detection of male pheromone, which acts as a courtship inhibitor. \n\nDuring our studies we came across a puzzling result. We obtained a mild increase in the length of the period of locomotor activity by driving mis-expression of DAY in th Lateral Neurons. Instead, applying the same manipulation to all clock neurons did not result in any period change. This suggested that different clock neurons might have opposing roles in the circadian network, which goes against the current cell-autonomous model of the clock. To test this hypothesis, we turned to CRY_, a form of CRY with a 20 amino acid deletion in its C_terminus, which we had previously shown to produce robust changes in the period of locomotor activity. Using this and other manipulations we were able to confirm our findings and to draw a functional map connecting the neurons of the circadian network.\n\nIn conclusion, although we have proven our original predictions wrong, this work led to some exciting and unexpected results. We have identified a new synaptic role for CRY, we have drawn a map of the functional connections among clock neurons and we have clarified the role of DAY as a protein involved in arousal and likely localised in central synapses. Exploiting Drosophila for finding out how the circadian system works can have implication for human and animal health and wellbeing. Restricting our interest to the peculiarities of insects might have applications in agriculture and pest control. We had presented two ideas to the Enterprise and Business Development Office of the University of Leicester for patent application. These ideas did not seem viable in their original form. We are now in the process (March 2012) of applying for a Follow-on-Funding Pathfinder stemming from our work Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
