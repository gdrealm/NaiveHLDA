Through its website, the Commission encourages contributors to submit evidence and to engage in a two-way dialogue with Commissioners about their deliberations. Coming at a crucial time for the global trade regime and the World Trade Organization, the Commission will publish its report at the WTO in December 2007.</p>\n\n<p>In maximising the impact of its report, the Commission will develop a debate between the business and trade policy communities about its recommendations, a central element of which will be a joint conference with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in London in January 2008. The Commission will also communicate its findings to UK and overseas business communities, which have a major interest in the health of the global trade regime, through a series of workshops and by developing a communications package, including broadcast standard videos and a content-rich website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0055","grantId":"RES-172-25-0055","fundValue":"50050","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Andrew Higgott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
