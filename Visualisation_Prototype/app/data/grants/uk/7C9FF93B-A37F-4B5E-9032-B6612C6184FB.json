One of the most important yet most intractable problems is to understand how the magma reservoir beneath ridges generates the lower crust, especially at fast spreading rates. Gabbroic rocks from the lower crust are normally inaccessible, but are exposed tectonically on the flanks of the Hess Deep rift in the Pacific Ocean. IODP Expedition 345 aims to provide a unique suite of lower oceanic crustal samples from this locality that will yield insights into magmatic and tectonic processes involved in seafloor spreading. As part of this endeavour, palaeomagnetic data will be collected from recovered core pieces and will be critical to understanding the evolution of the lower crust at this site. These data will provide valuable information on the direction and strength of magnetization locked into the gabbroic rocks we expect to encounter, providing a marker that can be used to infer the amount of tectonic rotation that has affected the site and insights into the contribution that lower crustal rocks make to marine magnetic anomalies. In addition, we intend to use a combination of palaeomagnetic data and geophysical images of the inside of borehole walls to reorient some of the core pieces recovered by drilling, thereby allowing other directional properties (e.g. structural data) to be restored to the correct geographical reference frame.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K011057/1","grantId":"NE/K011057/1","fundValue":"25455","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Antony  Morris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
