One of the principal sources of AABW has its roots in the production of cold, dense water that results from wintertime sea-ice production over the continental shelf of the southwestern Weddell Sea. However, there remains great uncertainty about the processes controlling the initial import of the source waters onto the continental shelf, and the export of the dense waters from the shelf regime. The uncertainty results from the extremely challenging sea ice conditions existing in the southern Weddell Sea, especially during winter. Conditions in the area of interest during winter are exceptionally difficult for any ship-based work, and instruments deployed in the ocean during the rather less difficult summer months, and which are left to monitor the water properties over the Winter period, are vulnerable to dredging by passing icebergs. We will tackle the problem using a technology that has recently come of age. We propose to attach conductivity-temperature-deph (CTD) tags, miniaturised oceanographic instruments, to Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The tags have a satellite transmitter that relays the oceanographic data collected during the seals' dives, together with the dive location. The tag is glued harmlessly to the animal's fur using standard marine two-component epoxy and comes off again during the annual moult about eleven months later. A pilot study undertaken by the British Antarctic Survey involved the tagging of four seals, three of which supplied over-winter datasets. Although the coverage was impressive from only three tags, emphatically confirming the practicality of the technique, the region of interest is nearly 500,000 km^2 in area and a comprehensive dataset requires substantially more tagged animals. We will tag 20 Weddell seals at the eastern end of the shelfbreak north of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf during the late Austral summer of 2010/2011. The resulting dataset resulting from the animals' dives during the winter will give the most comprehensive picture to date of the ocean conditions over the southern Weddell Sea continental shelf. By mapping the temperature of the water near the sea floor we will determine the locations where dense waters leave the shelf, and the processes involved: either a direct flow down the slope under gravity, or initially mixing at the shelf edge with waters from off the shelf before descending down the slope. We will also be able to determine where the source waters come on to the shelf. Weddell seals are very accomplished divers, diving repeatedly for long periods and to depths regularly reaching the on-shelf seafloor. Among Antarctic seals, Weddell seals also inhabit the southernmost waters, and remain within the pack-ice in winter when the ice expands northward. These characteristics make Weddell seals ideally suited for the proposed study. Although primarily an oceanographic project, the movements and diving behaviour of Weddell seals is of great interest to seal biologists who wish to understand differing behaviours in different parts of Antarctica. These variations were ably demonstrated by the extraordinarily diverse behaviour of the animals tagged during the pilot, and by comparisons with previous tracking of this species in other parts of the Antarctic. The long-ranging movements displayed by some of the seals tracked during the pilot study are untypical for the species, at least at other Antarctic locations, and may be related to the local oceanographic conditions. It is widely recognised that multidisciplinary studies such as proposed here will provide us with the tools to better predict how the distribution, behaviour and ultimately population status may be affected by changing ocean and climate conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G014833/1","grantId":"NE/G014833/1","fundValue":"64558","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Data from the deployment from this project were broadcast on the GTS in near real time.

This project set the foundations for understanding the shelfbreak processes in the Weddell Sea thought to be instrumental in controlling the flushing of the continental shelf, and the export of dense shelf waters that contribute to the production of Antarctic Bottom Water. As a serendipitous result, we learned much about the distribution and behaviour of seals deep in the Weddell Sea and observed them breaking records for diving in some of the World's coldest water. The animals dive into supercooled water less than -2 degrees Centigrade, which emerges from under the Filchner ice shelf at depths of 500 m, which allows the relatively fresh to remain liquid well below its freezing point. The use of the approach of using animals as platforms for ocean observation has grown dramatically over the decade since we first developed it for the NERC SEaOS project. http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/seaos/. Animals have provided over 380000 ocean profiles to date. This expansion is set to continue, particularly for polar ocean observations, where animal data already contributes well over half the data collected over all time.\n\nSMRU Instrumentation's CTD-SRDLs are the only instruments available that have the capability of collecting oceanographic-quality temperature/salinity depth profiles and the chain of NERC and other funding has been critical in both their development and acceptence Electronics,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
