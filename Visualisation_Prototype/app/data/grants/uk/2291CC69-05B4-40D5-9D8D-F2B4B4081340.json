However, men and women around the world would use more advanced methods if they were available. Because the world population overgrowth is a major threat of mankind, new contraceptive methods are desperately needed. In developed countries, respectively, male contraception is an important gender equality issue. The lack of novel male methods is thus a real missed opportunity. The currently tested methods are based on use of the male sex hormone, testosterone, in somewhat similar fashion as female sex hormones in the female pill. They suppress testicular testosterone production, thereby blocking sperm formation. The drawback of these methods is that only 2 out of 3 men become infertile. New concepts to improve the efficacy are therefore needed, which is the goal of the proposed research. New principles must first be tested in experimental animals. We will test therefore in normal and genetically modified mice how to enhance the contraceptive efficacy by suppressing intratesticular hormone levels more profoundly than with testosterone, inhibiting the function of a key testicular enzyme involved in testosterone production. If the mouse experiments are successful, the same principle can be tested in men.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600002","grantId":"G0600002","fundValue":"539354","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2010-01-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ilpo T Huhtaniemi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
