In small groups, students will investigate one hazard through guided internet and library searches, with the aim of preparing arguments to justify allocating public resources for further study of that particular hazard. These arguments will be presented before the full assembly as a poster and an oral presentation. The full assembly will vote on which hazard is most deserving of public resources and further scientific effort.</p>\n\n<p>Prizes will be awarded for the team producing the best poster and for the team presenting the most successful argument. Group topics will be chosen from wildfires, volcanic eruptions, sea-level change, meteorites, cyclones, flooding and demographic pressures that increase vulnerability to natural disasters</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0044","grantId":"RES-168-26-0044","fundValue":"999","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Siwan Manon Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
