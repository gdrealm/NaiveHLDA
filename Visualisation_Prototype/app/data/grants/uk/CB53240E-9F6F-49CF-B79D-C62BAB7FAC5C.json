This is a very important question because large numbers of cancer patients die each day worldwide because tumour cells leave the original site of disease to spread throughout their body. This spreading makes it difficult to provide a cure by surgery alone if the cancer is discovered late.\nOur work focuses on breast cancer since these tumour cells often move faster when they meet a protein called epidermal growth factor or EGF. Once this happens, proteins inside the tumour, act in a series of steps to make the cells move. We have previously shown that one of these steps involves a protein called PI3K-C2b. At the moment we know little about how PI3K-C2b acts inside cells to increase their speed.\nWe will grow human breast cancer cells in the lab and record how they move after EGF treatment over many hours using a microscope and video camera. We will then see what happens to cancer cells that make more PI3K-C2b protein or we block its production. This will show us if PI3K-C2b can be used as a target for new medicines against cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500936","grantId":"G0500936","fundValue":"226575","fundStart":"2006-10-25","fundEnd":"2009-10-24","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jan  Domin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
