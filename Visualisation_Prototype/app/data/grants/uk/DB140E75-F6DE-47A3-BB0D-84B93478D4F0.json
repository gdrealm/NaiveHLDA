Intimate partner violence (IPV) has significant health, social and economic consequences, and yet there is limited evidence about how to effectively respond.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>This study uses population data to understand the strategies women use in response to violence. Three datasets will be merged to explore micro and macro-level effects through multilevel analysis. This will help us understand which factors influence women's response to IPV at the individual and contextual level. </p>\n\n<p>The study includes two Brazilian sites:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;The city of Sao Paulo</li>\n\n <li>Zona da Mata Pernambucana. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The two settings represent diverse regions in Brazil, with very different social and economic characteristics. This can provide insights about differences in patterns of response and network availability in urban and rural areas. Based on the results of the analysis, a review of the theoretical framework for responses of women to IPV will be carried out. </p>\n\n<p>The collaboration between the gender violence and health research groups from Brazil and UK, and the dissemination activities will draw upon each groups extensive networks of contacts in Brazil, the UK, and internationally. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-238-25-0017","grantId":"RES-238-25-0017","fundValue":"94655","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Helen Watts","coPersons":["Lilia  Schraiber","Ana Flavia  D'Oliveira"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
