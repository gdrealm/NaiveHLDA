Discourses of German Wartime Suffering' (2005-2008). In that project, the complex interaction of narratives of victimhood and perpetration from the end of WWII into the 21st century was established: tropes associated with the Holocaust were found to have been instrumentalised within German accounts of what they had endured as the victims of Allied bombing, mass rapes, and expulsion, even as German complicity in Jewish suffering and Jewish suffering itself were marginalised. We also discovered, however, that more nuanced narratives have emerged since the mid-1990s. These aim for an inclusive juxtaposition of the complexities, and ambiguities, of the experiences of individual Germans and Jews while remaining mindful of how such a juxtaposition might appear to relativise German responsibility or Jewish suffering. Such narratives raise productive questions within today's globalisation of Holocaust memory as a model for coming-to-terms with injustices far removed from the concentration camps.\n\nSpecifically, recent German fiction, film and memorials raise questions relating to 1) the possibility of empathy with 'ordinary' Germans; 2) the balance between recognising the ordinary German's 'absolute' victimhood (e.g. that he or she was bombed) and the need to set this suffering in the context of how Germans benefited from the racial state's exploitation and elimination of others; and (3) how opposing perspectives might be sensitively juxtaposed and so be able to generate inclusivity and dialogue without a blurring of historical accountability.\n\nThese questions resonate in the post-apartheid South African context. Working with The SA Holocaust and Genocide Foundation (SAHGF), we aim to adapt our research findings to intervene productively in SA's efforts to confront the legacy of apartheid and, specifically, to contribute to the SAHGF's educational outreach with SA schools. The primary outcome will be a travelling exhibition for the SAHGF centres in Cape Town, Jo'burg and Durban documenting Germany's coming-to-terms with its past and prompting visiting school groups (and the public) to rethink their SA context, i.e. how can we square historical justice with reconciliation; how are the experiences of all groups to be narrated without relativisation? Our research on Germany suggests that posing these questions within agreed parameters (i.e. accountability remains vital) can in itself open up a difficult past to democratic debate.\n\nWe will also stage public events in both SA and the UK. In Cape Town, we will organise workshops at the SAHGF for pupils and the general public to mark the launch of the exhibition and to prompt wider discussion of its contemporary relevance. The UK High Commission in SA and the British Council will also be involved. In the UK, we will work with the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre (Notts) to set the exhibition into a new context; we will launch the UK exhibition, with SAHGF and Beth Shalom staff, at events to mark Holocaust Memorial Day 2015 and Beth Shalom's 20th anniversary. In addition, we will collaborate with Leeds City Council and a Leeds theatre company on a three-month drama workshop for young people, based on the exhibition. At 3 performances and after-show discussions, we will engage city residents, with SAHGF and Beth Shalom staff, on 'global traumas' and their local significance. \n\nFinally, we will work with Beth Shalom to create teaching resources designed to deepen pupils' grasp of traumatic pasts and today's debates on historical accountability, racism and social exclusion. These materials, downloadable from the project website, will benefit pupils across a range of disciplines, in the UK and globally. We will also offer CPD opportunities for a postdoc and staff at our partner institutions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L006766/1","grantId":"AH/L006766/1","fundValue":"79786","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is not yet complete. The exhibition will launch in January 20915, and the drama and teaching materials linked to the exhibition will also be ready by then. However, over the course of the last nine months we have engaged with various partners:\n\n- Knowledge Exchange with Staff at the Cape Town Holocaust and Genocide Centre\n- Knowledge exchange with Curriculum Advisors for the South African National Schools’ Curriculum.\n- A knowledge exchange workshop at the Cape Town Holocaust Centre involving members of the South African heritage sector, representatives of Cape Town museums, academics and postgraduate students.\n- Workshops with pupils from local schools at the Cape Town Holocaust Centre, based on the Anne Frank Exhibition, that drew on our research on empathy and confronting difficult pasts.\n- A public event at the University of the Free State with the Afrikaans novelist Etienne van Heerden, with a roundtable discussion of the parallels – and differences – between the German and South African experiences of confronting the past.\n- A workshop for students at the Women’s Memorial in Bloemfontein, South Africa, with clinical psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela of the University of the Free State.\n\nThrough these engagement activities we have been able to positively influence the way the Holocaust is taught in SA schools in relation to the legacy of apartheid and Human Rights issues in the present day (curriculum advisors) as well to impact positively on the way groups of young people (pupils and university students) from diverse communities have engaged with their different, but interconnecting pasts and also the way they talk to one another in the present.
