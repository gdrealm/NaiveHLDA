{"id":"FEED6310-56B5-47A1-A0C8-AA34604E1D8F","title":"ortho-Quinone Methides in Natural Product Synthesis","abstractText":"Some years ago, the predominant view of benzynes, carbenes and radicals was that they were uncontrollably reactive and so could not be used in the construction of complex natural products. This perception has of course changed and such species are now routinely employed in synthesis. It can be argued that such a view is still held of ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs). These species have long been documented and much is known about how Nature utilises their high reactivity. For example, they are released as a means of defence by plants and insects whereas oxidation of vitamin E and dimerisation of the resultant ortho-quinone methides is used by the body as a storage mechanism. Also, the therapeutic benefit of a number of important chemotherapy drugs is based upon their ability to form an ortho-quinone methide in vivo. Despite this widespread use in biological systems, the application of ortho-quinone methides in total synthesis is extremely limited. The current program of research will look to develop the chemistry of ortho-quinone methides such that they can then be applied in the total synthesis of some biologically important molecules. The research will contribute to our fundamental knowledge of the chemistry of ortho-quinone methides and will promote the benefits of these highly useful species in all branches of synthetic chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G041431/1","grantId":"EP/G041431/1","fundValue":"232826","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The main findings from our work are yet to be published.  ","person":"Christopher D.

The first compound was synthesised by groups in the USA and Germany prior to the researchers on this grant commencing. We examined alternative routes to those that had already been published but ultimately we could not better their approach. The second natural product we have partially synthesised. We have validated our original hypothesis for the approach to this compound and we have made a number of analogues. This methodology will be useful to a number of groups and may yet prove the best strategy to take with these compounds. Spirocycles are an emerging area of interest in medicinal chemistry and the methodology we have developed will be useful in accessing such structures in a highly succinct and efficient manner.
