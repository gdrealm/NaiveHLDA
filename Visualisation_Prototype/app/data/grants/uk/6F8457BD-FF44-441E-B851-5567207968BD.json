The possibilities for climate change mitigation through the adoption of low carbon technologies have been widely discussed for several years and there are many realistic possibilities which are now well known, technologically proven and economically costed. </p> \n<p>The primary issue now is not ‘how much do low carbon technologies cost?’, but ‘how is the massive investment of the next decade to be directed towards low carbon technologies?’ Such investment will be necessary in buildings, transport, industrial processes and energy systems and new thinking will be needed to ensure such investment flows freely in ways that will stimulate innovation and reduce costs, while at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0005","grantId":"RES-172-25-0005","fundValue":"13000","fundStart":"2007-01-02","fundEnd":"2007-05-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Asher  Minns","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
