Following on from the first phase of Law and the End of Empire, which examined the period from c. AD 500 to 800, the main objective of the research project is to write the history of Roman law from Charlemagne to the juristic revival of the twelfth century, serving scholars of legal history, institutional and social history, and ecclesiastical (canon) law.\\n\\nThe project aims (1) to offer a new and better analysis of a crucial period in the early history of European legal culture; (2) to provide a stimulus to further research, not only through the provision of an up-to-date analytical account in print, but also (i) an on-line database documenting the source material and the complexity of its transmission, (ii) a web-portal and guide to the various electronic resources already available, and (iii) on-line textual material of our own creation, such as editions and/or translations where they are not already easily accessible (see www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra for the current portal and interrogable databases); (3) to engage a wider audience in thinking about shared aspects of the European past: the first phase of the project has been very successful in bringing together research in different national and intellectual traditions.\\n\\nGetting the early history of Roman law in Europe right is important in the present intellectual and political context: just as Hart, drawing on the English common law, produced in The Concept of Law a framework for understanding the nature of Roman law, so Birks in English Private Law used the categories of Roman law to organise English material. The enhancement of such intellectual interchange is clearly central to the contemporary development of European law.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I003207/1","grantId":"AH/I003207/1","fundValue":"638926","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Data has been used to test TEI-encoding by external groups; data has been used to improve Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England online database Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software) Cultural","person":"Richard William Salway","coPersons":["Michael Hewson Crawford"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
