A series of 9 scoping studies will be commissioned to provide a state of the art survey of social scientific research in crucial areas of EU activity. A second strand of work will involve liaison with researchers and research teams engaged in work on the EU with the aim of encouraging an interchange between teams or individuals working on related questions. Finally, the coordinator will help academics to achieve greater impact for their research through numerous activities intended to promote interaction and the exchange of ideas between academics, policy makers and other stakeholders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M000796/1","grantId":"ES/M000796/1","fundValue":"1167180","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anand  Menon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
