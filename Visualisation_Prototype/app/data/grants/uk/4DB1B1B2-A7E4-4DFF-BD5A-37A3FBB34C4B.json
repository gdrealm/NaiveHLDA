Many other countries world-wide are also in the process of developing comprehensive marine spatial planning regimes for the first time. As this new area of planning responsibility develops it is evident that new and enhanced forms of international partnership working will be needed to underpin effective planning of the sea. </p>\n\n<p>The Irish Sea is one area where there is already widespread recognition of the potential value of enhanced transnational collaboration between the 6 national jurisdictions (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Ireland and the Isle of Man). </p>\n\n<p>This ESRC supported project is a joint initiative by the University of Liverpool, the National Oceonography Centre, Natural England, the North West Coastal Forum, the Marine Management Organisation and others. It involves hosting two events that will bring stakeholders from across the Irish Sea region together to learn from other regional sea areas such as the Baltic and discuss how existing transnational partnership working arrangements can be built upon to support the new national level marine planning regimes that are now being put in place.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H044485/1","grantId":"ES/H044485/1","fundValue":"9076","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The Irish Sea Maritime Forum (ISMF) was launched in Belfast in June 2012. http://www.irishseamaritimeforum.org/ The Forum was established in response to the series of stakeholder workshops held in Liverpool and Dublin in 2011 which were funded through the ESRC KE award. The objectives of the forum are drawn directly from the ESRC funded stakeholder workshops. These are:\n• To provide a broad based forum for all Irish Sea users and provide an opportunity for voices to be heard\n• To facilitate marine planning knowledge exchange and capacity building across all administrative areas and sectors \n• To facilitate sharing of data and information\n• To encourage and maintain political support for transnational partnership working in support of marine planning, with the aim of promoting sustainable development in the Irish Sea region.\n•To facilitate a more coordinated, efficient planning process for transnational issues/projects and good working relationships among Irish Sea partners\n\nThe ISMF is guided by a Steering Group, which includes representatives from marine planning teams and relevant marine and coastal fora, such as the Scottish Coastal Forum, as well as other stakeholder interests from all six Irish Sea jurisdictions. It has received pump priming financial support from a range of organisations including: Department of Environment, Northern Ireland, The Isle of Man Government, the Marine Management Organisation, Marine Scotland and Liverpool Vision. Secretarial support is provided by the University of Liverpool (Sue Kidd - the award holder) and the North West Coastal Forum. \n\nIn 2014 the Forum established the position of chair which is an annual appointment that circulates around the 6 jurisdictions in the Irish Sea. The first chair is Flo Clucas a longstanding Liverpool councillor who has played a major part in developing the European Commission's Atlantic Action Plan. In 2015 Cllr Stewart Anderson from Conwy Borough Council will take of the chair position and nominations are currently being sought for an Irish chair for 2016.\n\nA key focal point for ISMF activities is an annual conference. So far three conferences have been held in Belfast, Glasgow and Liverpool. The fourth annual conference is being planned at the present time. This will be in Conwy. Each of the events so far have attracted 70 + delegates from across the Irish Sea region including representatives from a wide range of range of maritime sectors and interests. Speakers have included government Ministers, EU officials, local politicians and coastal partnership chairs, port operators, renewable energy companies, fishermen and NGOs. Facilitation of events has involved academics from Universities around the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Forum is also developing the practice of producing a series of thematic reports and of arranging associated stakeholder workshops. So far an Irish Sea Issues and Opportunities Report has been produced and work is underway on an Irish Sea Blue Growth Report which was the focus of the Annual Conference in Liverpool in 2014. This event was associated with the International Festival of Business that was held in the city in the summer of 2014. It is envisaged that the focus of the next report will be Irish Sea Adaption for the 21st century which will be the theme of the 2015 annual conference which will include reflection on the 20 year anniversary of the Towyn coastal flood.\n\nAn interesting development in the pipeline is possible affiliation to the EU's Conference of Peripheral and Maritime Regions. CPMR brings together some 160 Regions from 28 States from the European Union and beyond. Representing almost 200 million people, the CPMR campaigns in favour of a more balanced development of the European territory. It operates both as a think tank and as a lobby for Regions. It currently has very limited engagement of partners in the Irish Sea region. A final decision on ISMF affiliation will be taken early in 2015 and if it is awarded it should enhance both the standing of the Forum and also the range of services that the Forum can offer Irish Sea stakeholders.\n\nIn addition to the direct impact of the ESRC KE award a number of indirect impacts have ensued reflecting the enhanced expertise and profile of the maritime spatial planning research group at the University of Liverpool that the award helped to develop. These include:\n- The appointment of Sue Kidd as Chair of the Irish Sea Conservation Zones Project funded by DEFRA, Natural England and the JNCC (2010- 2012). This project was the first time that a stakeholder led process has been used in the UK to help identify and recommend marine areas for protection. http://www.irishseaconservation.org.uk/\n\n- award of a DG Mare contract (Led by the University of Liverpool) related to Transboundary Planning in the European Atlantic (TPEA) with partners including DoE Northern Ireland and the Spanish and Portuguese governments\n\n- involvement in the Celtic Seas partnership LIFE funded project in association with WWF, Dublin Regional Authority and Seaweb which is developing stakeholder engagement in work associated with the marine Strategy Framework Directive http://celticseaspartnership.eu/\n\n- award of the ESPON funded contract (with the University of Liverpool as lead partner) exploring the territorial development opportunity and risks associated with the six European Seas.\nhttp://www.espon.eu/main/Menu_Projects/Menu_AppliedResearch/ESaTDOR.html Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Transport Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Sue  Kidd","coPersons":["Michael John Howarth"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" The project revealed widespread support for the development of new transnational partnership working arrangements in support of integrated marine spatial planning in the Irish Sea. \n\n\n\nAt the first event stakeholders concluded that transnational partnership working could support marine spatial planning in the Irish Sea in a number of ways.These included knowledge exchange, improved dialogue, shared understanding, and capacity building, as well as opportunities to develop collaborative approaches to information and data sharing, international obligations and major cross-boundary development issues. Improving efficiency, avoiding duplication of effort and costs, and opening up access to new funding opportunities were identified as important drivers. Developing a better appreciation of the shared Celtic maritime heritage, culture and perspective and providing a forum to strengthen regional sea, national and local maritime governance and identity were also considered to be important.\n\n\n\nStakeholder discussions indicated that the Irish Sea was regarded as a natural unit for partnership working, but needed to nest within wider spheres of action, for example at the Celtic Seas and Atlantic Arc scales. Extension of the activities of the British Irish Council was proposed to stimulate high level collaboration between administrations on marine spatial planning matters. In addition a new Irish Sea Forum was recommended to facilitate wider collaborative activity and purposeful engagement of a broad spectrum of Irish Sea stakeholders.\n\n\n\nStakeholder discussions at the second event revealed a strong degree of agreement about the following objectives for future transnational partnership working in the Irish Sea:\n\n\n\n• To provide a broad based forum for all Irish Sea users and provide an opportunity for voices to be heard\n\n• To facilitate knowledge exchange and capacity building across all administrations and sectors about marine planning\n\n• To facilitate sharing of data and information\n\n• To encourage and maintain political support for transnational partnership working in support of marine planning in the Irish Sea\n\n•To facilitate a more coordinated, efficient planning process for transnational issues/projects and good working relationships among Irish Sea partners.\n\n\n\nKey short term actions identified included: definition of the terms of reference of the new grouping; development of a communications strategy designed to raise awareness of marine planning issues and developments and facilitate information exchange and networking among Irish Sea partners; development of an Irish Sea website / information portal; creation of an Irish Sea stakeholder data base; and organisation and facilitation of an Irish Sea Forum to allow sharing of information and dissemination of progress. \n\n\n\nLonger term priorities for action included: the creation of a signpost to available data, information and existing initiatives across all administrations with a harmonised approach to standards and compatibility; provision of training sessions related to marine licensing, planning etc; and development of communication and networking opportunities offered by different social media.\n\n\n\nAn overview report detailing the outputs of the two events is available on the ESRC website. The findings of the project are informing the development of a new Irish Sea Forum and other associated activities by Irish Sea stakeholders. For example they have been used to inform a bid to the European LIFE programme related to Marine Strategy Framework Directive Capacity Buiding in the Celtic Seas.\n\n\n\nThe findings are also considered to be helpful to other regional sea areas that are assessing the focus of existing transnational partnerships or are considering establishing new arrangements to support the rapid development of marine spatial planning in many parts of the world. The findings of the project have informed the construction of a ladder of transnational partnership working in support of marine spatial planning which stakeholders have suggested they would find useful.They are also informing an assessment of the adequacy of existing transnational partnership working structures to support the integration ambitions inherent in the new era of marine spatial planning.\n\n\n\nIn addition it is felt that the results of the stakeholder discussions provide a useful empirical resource that others interested in transnational partnership working might find useful.
