{"id":"4B216CDE-42D0-452D-BDB5-69E4D87E2E96","title":"The cultural politics of the Greek crisis","abstractText":"Reflecting on the Greek crisis some artists and writers (most recently the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch at Thessaloniki International Film Festival) have argued that culture is invigorated and transformed during periods of crisis, while identities and self-perceptions are questioned. Defining culture as artistic production and a way of life, both of which condition and shape national identity, the proposed research will explore the impact of the Greek economic crisis by looking at literary, visual arts and performance-based production, as well as the wider cultural developments in Greece since the fall of the junta in 1974, with special emphasis on the last five years (2008-2013). \n\nMany people are experiencing the Greek crisis in economic terms and the media has tended to concentrate on this aspect, but it is important to recognize its cultural repercussions taking into account both the prospective view (i.e. as it unfolds) and the retrospective (i.e. tracing its roots). To arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the current Greek crisis presupposes reviewing the cultural developments and identity controversies experienced in Greece since 1974 in order to assess the deeper social and cultural changes the country has undergone. During this period issues of identity and social cohesion have increasingly come to the fore as a result of EU membership, the gradual multicultural transformation of Greek society due to migration and reconsideration of Greece's Balkan and Ottoman legacies. Thus the starting point for this project is that the Greek crisis cannot be understood unless we take the above developments into account and reassess their cultural and sociopolitical impact. \n\nThe proposed network will go on to address the impact of the crisis on Greek attitudes to Europe, cultural institutions and the national imaginary. It will also explore literary, artistic and visual representations of the crisis and how perceptions of the past are challenged by the current crisis. The connection between cultural and identity politics will be highlighted through an interrogation of the cultural ideology of the Golden Dawn party and its promotion of notions of ethnic and cultural purity. \n\nBy placing the Greek crisis in a wider transnational context, this project will invite comparisons with other economic crises in southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. Like Greece both countries emerged from dictatorships and joined the EU at much the same time. There are comparative economic data for these countries but there is little on cultural attitudes and increasing scepticism regarding closer European integration. \n\nThe project will be multi-institutional, involving colleagues from different disciplinary areas and three continents (Europe, America and Australia), who are conducting research on Greece but are also familiar with other crises in Europe and elsewhere. It will create a forum for exchanging ideas and will engage scholars, journalists, artists, students and interested members of the community in assessing the scale and broader cultural impact of the crisis. Participants will be invited to give talks, take part in workshops or contribute short pieces to a website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L01498X/1","grantId":"AH/L01498X/1","fundValue":"24791","fundStart":"2014-09-15","fundEnd":"2016-09-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Dimitris  Tziovas","coPersons":["Dimitris  Papanikolaou"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
