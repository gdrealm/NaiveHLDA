{"id":"F965050F-1FA1-45CA-AA61-6744F3959799","title":"Square Kilometre Array Project","abstractText":"This grant is in support of the detailed design work for the SKA to be undertaken at the University of Cambridge. The SKA has now entered the detailed design phase. The Office of the SKA Organisation published a request for proposals in 2013. Cambridge responded to this request as the lead of the Science Data Processor consortium to undertake the work package of the same name and a major part of the Low-frequency Aperture Array and Mi-frequency aperture array consortia work packages led by ASTRON. All responses to the RfP were evaluated and scrutinised by the SKAO and Board of the SKA Organisation. After negotiation with the SKA Organisation all of the consortia in which Cambridge lead or or involved were successful and awarded the work by the SKA Organisation. This application is for the funding to undertake this work as awarded by the SKA Organisation.\n\nCambridge leads the Science Data Processor Consortium and associated work package. This work package will deliver the design for the complete software and computing processing system excluding the real-time control. As lead organisation Cambridge will manage the delivery across the entire consortium and critically provide the project manager, project engineer and project scientist. Key elements of the design that will be delivered directly from Cambridge include (but are not limited to) the overall architecture, system design, the prototyping of the software and hardware systems including the management of the open architecture lab, all management documentation, and the full documentation sets for preliminary and critical design reviews. In addition Cambridge manages the industrial contracts which form a critical element of the delivery.\n\nCambridge also has a major role in the Low-frequency Aperture array and Mid-frequency Aperture Array work packages and associated consortia. Here we provide the system engineer in both cases and have responsibility for the overall system design and design of the low-frequency aperture-array element itself, SKALA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001393/1","grantId":"ST/M001393/1","fundValue":"6938970","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This grant supports detailed design for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Radio Telescope.

The SKA is widely regarded as an iconic Big Data Project for the next decade. The data analysis is not only complex but also of very large volume - near real time analysis of data arriving at over 14 TBytes per second is required. Final data volumes reach of order 300 PBytes per year which must be delivered to regional Science Centres for further analysis. The delivery from this work is a detailed analysis and design of this system which will meet these challenges.\n\nFor the Low-Frequency aperture Array the main design of is a state-of-the-art antenna element, associated electronics and overall system design for the element.\n\nThe main output from this research, when completed in 2017, will be a detailed design documentation. This is essential input to the next stage of the SKA project which will be the construction and implementation phase. \n\nA major intermediate milestone deliverable has been the documentation set for the rebaselining process including a preliminary architecture, performance analysis and cost estimates.\n\nGiven the nature of the Big Data challenge for the SKA there is considerable overlap with other areas and the approaches to the analysis of large data volumes will have significant broad impact and applicability.
