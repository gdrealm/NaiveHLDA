In the longer term the research will radically alter our understanding of the Universe, including information on the nature of neutron stars and black holes, and through opportunities for precision cosmology. This will benefit the widest astronomy/astrophysics community, internationally.\n As cosmology and astrophysics are always forefront areas for public outreach, there will be considerable impact resulting from the discovery of gravitational waves and the burgeoning science that will inevitably result. To have a major focus for this new science in the UK should help revitalise public interest at a time when economic pressures could potentially fight against the growth of science in our community. There is no doubt that a discovery of gravitational waves would galvanise public interest at all levels from school pupils up. An improved understanding of cosmology and compact-object astrophysics, of the most impressive and even violent nature, is bound to catch the public imagination, and produce demand for creative works such as television programmes. A concrete example of direct benefit of Advanced LIGO UK to the popular culture exists in the Science Museum, London, where pre-prototype test mass and the metal structural components of an Advanced LIGO test-mass suspension, both made available by the collaboration, are on display.\n The Advanced LIGO UK construction project brought direct benefit to several areas of UK industry both through the placement of over &pound;3M of contracts, but also by pushing manufacturing techniques to reach higher standards of quality and precision required for our work. Examples include: optics, precision mechanics and electronics. In some cases these companies have subsequently been able to market the resulting technology, nationally and internationally.

It is expected that these detectors will produce gravitational wave signals soon after they are fully commissioned.\n\nAs a direct result of our contribution to the project, UK groups are in a position to exploit the rich science data that will be produced over the coming decade. This has created a unique opportunity to ensure that UK scientists maintain leadership in gravitational wave science.\n\nIt is envisaged that the UK equipment which has been designed to meet all long-term project goals, will remain in place even following such upgrades, and continued UK technical support will help to ensure that is the case.\n\nThe UK groups are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and as such have access to Advanced LIGO data and are able to take part in their exploitation to discover gravitational wave signals from sources such as compact-object inspirals, pulsars, and possibly supernovae. Our work resulted in the development and construction of main-mirror suspensions for the Advanced LIGO interferometric gravitational wave detectors, associated control electronics, sensors actuators and optics. This work led directly to installation, commissioning and (in particular, from 2015) data analysis efforts funded by grant ST/J000019/1 at Glasgow and other UK awards for the Operation of Advanced LIGO. Exploitation of the experimental data will follow.
