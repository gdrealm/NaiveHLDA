It is important that the correct medicines are prescribed to ensure effective pain management. For some people, changing the medicines they take might improve their pain management. We believe that regular review of medication could be beneficial for patients with chronic pain. \n\nPharmacists have the knowledge and training to review patientsâ€™ medicines and identify changes that could lead to better pain control. Until recently, changes to prescriptions recommended by a pharmacist had to be made by a doctor. However many pharmacists are now registered to write prescriptions. \n\nWe want to assess the benefits of pharmacist review of pain medicines and prescribing. We will compare three types of care: 1) pharmacist medicine review (using patient notes) and pharmacist prescribing, with face-to-face patient consultations; 2) pharmacist medicine review (using patient notes) with recommendations to GP; 3) standard care. \n\nPatients with chronic pain from six GP practices will be identified and divided into three groups. Practice pharmacists will review pain medication for groups 1) and 2) and compare this with best practice, recommending changes if necessary. Afterwards we will compare the groups for any differences in the way people feel their pain is affecting them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701769","grantId":"G0701769","fundValue":"333686","fundStart":"2009-02-02","fundEnd":"2011-02-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Bond","coPersons":["Paul  McNamee","Richard  Holland","David  Wright","Blair Hamilton Smith","Margaret Camilla Watson","Alison Margaret Elliott","Amanda Jane Lee","Philip  Hannaford"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
