Yet contemporary western societies now collectively spend over ninety per cent of their time indoors. It is with this contradiction in mind that it is worth reconsidering how easily personal wellbeing and environmental experiences are able to combine within the actual lifestyles of different groups today.</p>\n\n<p>This project pursued this argument with a sample of professional office workers in London as representatives of one of the fastest growing types of occupation in this country. Building on theories of practice, it analysed the everyday pressures associated with a sample of these workers, the social expectations they cope with and how they handled the changing outdoor conditions presented by one calendar year. Through these means it sought to develop new techniques for investigating urban nature experience, examine how routine outdoor practices are established, maintained and potentially redirected, and use the institutionalised behaviours of an important, under-researched and sizeable group of workers to inform debate about how to foster more sustainable city futures.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2129-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-2129-A","fundValue":"52667","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Russell  Hitchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
