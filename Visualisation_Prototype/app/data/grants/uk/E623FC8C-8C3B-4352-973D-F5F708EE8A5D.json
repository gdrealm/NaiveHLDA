However there is evidence to suggest that the diet of women during pregnancy and while breastfeeding is particularly important as it has major long-term implications for the health of her baby. It has been shown that individuals with a low birth weight are not only less likely to survive delivery but are also at substantially increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease in adulthood and are more likely to die at a younger age. The underlying causes of the relationship between early growth and adult disease are not known, but it is thought that the quality of the diet of women during pregnancy and breastfeeding is critically important. Studies in animal models can be very useful in helping to decipher mechanisms of human diseases. We have shown that if pregnant and lactating rats have too little protein in their diet their offspring are small at birth and later develop diabetes. We have studied fat tissue and have identified key proteins that are much less abundant both in young men who had a low birth weight and in offspring of protein restricted rat mothers. The central dogma of biology is that the genetic material DNA is copied to an intermediary molecule RNA that is then translated into proteins. Our recent results suggest that the second step of this process is permanently altered (or 'programmed') in the offspring of animals or humans that had a sub-optimal diet. In our project we will study RNA from rat and human fat cells to identify new genes that are programmed to be expressed at different levels as a result of poor early life nutrition. We will also determine why it is that their RNA is not translated properly to make the corresponding proteins. Understanding these processes will enable us to identify individuals at risk and to develop intervention strategies to improve the health of pregnant and breast-feeding women and their offspring.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015364/1","grantId":"BB/F015364/1","fundValue":"349838","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Ozanne","coPersons":["Kenneth  Siddle"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" It is widely accepted by the scientific community and the general public that nutrition (both quality and quantity) has profound effects on health and well being through out life, and ultimately on lifespan. Less well known is that a woman's diet (and other environmental influences) during pregnancy and while she is breast-feeding, can have profound and lasting effects on the health of her offspring during their life. In particular, the fetal and early postnatal environment influences susceptibility to metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is believed that suboptimal nutrition during fetal and very early postnatal life, while tissues and organs are still developing, may permanently alter their structure and function. This &quot;programming&quot; may be beneficial to survival in continued conditions of poor postnatal nutrition. However if childhood and adult nutrition is plentiful and especially if it is excessive, there is conflict with the earlier programming and disease can ensue. This has been called the 'developmental origins of health and disease' hypothesis. Despite extensive studies in both humans and animal models strongly supporting this hypothesis, the underlying mechanisms by which it is mediated remain poorly defined. Our recent work has given novel insight into what appears to be an important mechanism underlying the developmental programming of metabolism by early life nutrition. We have shown in fat cells from both laboratory animals and humans who had a low birth weight that the levels of some molecules called microRNAs are altered by early growth and nutrition during fetal and early postnatal life. These effects are permanent and do not change even if we are fed a healthy diet after weaning. These microRNAs control the amounts of key proteins, which in turn set the overall metabolism and function of the fat cells. In particular we believe that some of these microRNAs influence how well a person is able to store fat, especially when they eat an unhealthy high fat diet as an adult. Our results suggest that if we have inappropriate levels of a specific microRNA called miR483 because of exposure to a suboptimal diet in very early life we are less able to store fat in our adipose tissue. The excess fat that we eat therefore gets stored in our liver and muscle where it is very toxic and impairs the function of these important tissues and makes us much more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. We believe that regulation of microRNA levels by nutrition in early life could have widespread significance as a mechanism of programming. If we understood these processes better we might be able to devise tests to predict who is at risk, devise ways of counteracting the programming, and best of all, advise people on how to avoid the problem in the first place.
