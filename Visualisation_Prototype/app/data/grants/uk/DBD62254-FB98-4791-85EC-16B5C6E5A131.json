The principal aim of the symposia is to progress the momentum established at the inaugural and second symposia held in April 2005 and 2006 respectively. The establishment of a UK series of KDD symposium is seen as a new initiative whose objective is to bring together the various practitioners and research groups in the UK working both commercially or academically within the discipline of KDD and its related enterprises. The symposium seeks to act as a show case for the current state of the art of UK KDD work, and to identify opportunities and establish partnerships to maintain the UK's standing within the international KDD community. Many of the leading UK experts on KDD will be presenting a collation of views and reports on current KDD topics.One of the final report assessors for the EPSRC support received for the 2005 symposium (which received an overall rating of outstanding ) commented that: The UK has successfully begun to develop a core research competence in [KDD] and the UK KDD Smposium has helped to strengthen this community. KDD is esswential not only for improving business practioce but also in undertsrtanding the large quantities of data being collected in medicine, biology, astronomy and most other sciences .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E051162/1","grantId":"EP/E051162/1","fundValue":"2633","fundStart":"2007-05-26","fundEnd":"2007-06-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frans  Coenen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
