Nearly half of humankind lives in these countries, and they increasingly help to set international agendas.This important trend has been largely overlooked.</p>\n\n<p>This project analyses what has happened, why it was possible, and how these governments accomplished it. Our 18-member team focuses on the political and policy processes which have been at work - first, in each of the four countries individually, and then comparatively. The political reasoning which led senior politicians in the four countries to introduce this change varies from case to case, as do the types of new initiatives introduced in the four countries, and their outcomes. All of these things will be examined. Close attention will be paid to the hypothesis, supported by abundant evidence, that tackling poverty and inequality enhances the popularity and legitimacy of governments. If that is confirmed, it may persuade other leaders to follow suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012629/1","grantId":"ES/J012629/1","fundValue":"289344","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Gilmore Manor","coPersons":["Louise Marie Tillin","Jude  Howell","Jane  Duckett","Anthony  Pereira"],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
