The Emergence of Agricultural Labour Regulation on a Global Scale, 1930-1960.","abstractText":"<p>The project explores the history of labour regulation in agriculture by European and non-European governments, and international and non-governmental organisations in the Great Depression and the Cold War. </p>\n\n<p>The project's aim is to examine the shifting and contested meanings of labour regulation in the context of increasingly global debates about how to protect agricultural workers from exploitation and poverty, while at the same time 'modernising' agricultural production, issues which became progressively politicised under the impact of economic depression and war. </p>\n\n<p>The study will shed light on the profile, function and output of international agencies and transnational networks dealing with labour questions in a crucial period of change. The historical perspective on these networks will provide an opportunity to investigate issues that have hitherto received little attention in the existing literature including the modernisation of agricultural production, rural development and the work of women and children in agriculture. </p>\n\n<p>These topics have been treated to a limited extent in national contexts but the originality of the project lies in its determination to position agricultural labour in the vitally relevant global context. As a result, if offers the first ever historical assessment of the realities of agricultural labour in a period of intense global interaction and conflict. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3516","grantId":"RES-000-22-3516","fundValue":"74562","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amalia  Ribi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
