{"id":"9EF119F1-DAC0-4D86-854F-64474A6C378F","title":"Spatially and spectrally resolved plasmonic fluorescence enhancement","abstractText":"Silver and gold particles with dimensions less than 100 nanometres (1/10000th of a millimetre), which is about 1/5th of the wave-length of green light, exhibit very different optical properties from larger pieces of these metals. In particular, these nanoparticles can absorb and scatter light very efficiently at specific wavelengths in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which depend on the size, shape and material of the nanoparticle. This occurs as a result of the resonant excitation of an oscillation of the electrons in the metal, called a localised surface plasmon, which results in very intense electromagnetic field around the nanoparticle. The ability in recent years to fabricate metal nanoparticles of well-defined shape and size has spawned the burgeoning area of plasmonics, which exploits the novel optical properties of these materials.In modern biology and biomedicine it has now become standard practice to use fluorescent tags (or 'fluorophores') which are used as labels for particular biological molecules, or to flag the occurrence of specific processes. These tags are molecules or nanoparticles which emit light of a well-defined colour when illuminated and are employed extensively in imaging, from the level of whole organisms down to individual cells and molecules, in DNA sequencing, in drug discovery and in biosensors. This project is concerned with a study of the ways in which the emission from fluorophores is modified significantly, when a fluorophore is in close proximity (less than 100 nm) to a silver or gold nanoparticle. The main effects observed are an enhancement of the fluorescence intensity and an enhancement in the quantum efficiency of a fluorophore (i.e. the ratio of the number of photons it emits, to the number it absorbs). Such effects have potential for high sensitivity fluorescence detection, enabling detection to much lower molecular concentrations. However, to inform exploitation for new technological applications, we need to first understand the basic physics of what happening! In particular, we will perform measurements over a wide range of excitation and emission wavelengths, to tie in changes in behaviour with the localised surface plasmon resonance spectrum of the metal nanoparticles. We will also investigate in detail the dependence of fluorescence emission on the nanometric separation of the metal nanoparticle and the fluorophore. To do this, we will combine advance optical microscopy techniques with scanning probe microscopy (in which a sharp needle maps out a surface) to provide full positioning information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G029806/1","grantId":"EP/G029806/1","fundValue":"447447","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Richards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" Silver and gold nanoparticles can alter dramatically the optical properties of locally situated fluorescent molecules: strong optical field enhancement in the vicinity of a nanoparticle leads to an enhanced excitation rate when tuned to the absorption band of a fluorophore, while the Purcell effect results in a modification of the radiative decay rate for a molecule, which can result in an enhancement in the quantum efficiency and greater photostability by reducing the excited state lifetime. The non-radiative decay rate may also be modified, leading to quenching of fluorescence, and the balance between these different effects depends on a range of parameters such as the separation of fluorophore and nanoparticle, fluorophore quantum efficiency and the alignment of excitation and emission wavelengths with the localised surface plasmon spectrum of the metal nanoparticle.\n\nWe have explored the spectral dependence of fluorescence enhancement, and in particular the associated lifetime modification, from fluorescent molecules coupled to single gold nanoparticles. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and single-particle dark-field spectroscopy have been combined to correlate the dependence of fluorescence lifetime reduction on the spectral overlap between the fluorescence emission and the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of individual gold nanoparticles. A maximum lifetime reduction is observed when the fluorescence and LSPR peaks coincide, with good agreement provided by finite element simulations.\n\nUsing fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of fluorescently labelled beads deposited on both uniform gold surfaces and thin films of Ag nanostructures, we have quantified the reduction in fluorescence lifetime as a function of separation of fluorophores from the metal films. In the case of a nanostructured silver film (NSF) we find these modifications are dominated by radiative rather than non-radiative processes: within 50 nm of the NSF we observe a two-fold reduction in radiative lifetime, with a commensurate enhancement in fluorescence intensity. From this it is possible to determine changes in the axial position of a fluorophore with a sensitivity of ~3nm.\n\nWe have applied these findings for the demonstration of a novel imaging technique, which employs a nanoplasmonic substrate in combination with conventional confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy, to deliver an axial position sensitivity of order 10 nm in whole cell imaging. The technique exploits the Purcell effect experienced by fluorescent molecules in the vicinity of noble metal nanoparticles, leading to a reduction of the radiative lifetime and a commensurate increase in fluorescence intensity. We have employed this technique to map the topography of the cellular membrane, by imaging the fluorescent protein eGFP labeled to the receptor CXCR4, and further investigate receptor-mediated endocytosis in carcinoma cells. The development of high content screening has revolutionized its use as an analytical tool, particularly in the pharmaceitical industry, providing a fast quantitative assessment of differences in cellular phenotype using assays to monitor protein cellular localization. The technique we have developed provides super-resolution information, in particular for the study of membrane receptors, which is compatible with live-cell high content screening.\n\n\n\nImprovements in the performance of fluorescence emission through control and optimisation of the Purcell effect using plasmonic nanostructures, have wide-range application from biosensors, for the healthcare and biotechnology sectors, to improved LEDs for lighting and display applications. Fluorescence microscopy has become established as a powerful tool to study the dynamics of molecules over small distances, especially in a biological context, thanks to its exquisite sensitivity down to the single molecule level, its ability to be performed in situ, and the high specificity of genetically encoded fluorescent labels. Although a number of techniques have emerged in recent years which are able to provide nanoscale spatial resolution in three dimensions, generally they do not retain compatibility with live cell imaging, while there are inevitable compromises on imaging speed and area. There is therefore a great need to develop live-cell compatible optical microscopy tools that can provide super-resolution information on biomolecules, in particular for the study of membrane receptors in biological cells. Our research has lead to the development of a new approach in biological cell imaging, using bespoke plasmonic nanostructures to provide axial super-resolution sensitivity, while retaining compatibility with conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques.\n\n\n\nMore broadly, plasmonic nanostructures provide the opportunity to improve the performance of fluorophores through the effects investigated here, with applications ranging from plasmon-enhanced bioassays to novel optoelectronic devices.
