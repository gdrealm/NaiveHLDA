The lower background achieved through the development of new photomultiplier tubes and the addition of an active scintillator veto surrounding the WIMP target will be translated into improved sensitivity. This will allow us to probe even deeper into the parameter space that WIMPs are predicted to inhabit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000070/1","grantId":"ST/I000070/1","fundValue":"74204","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Murphy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
