It will include Biblical and historical epic, westerns, war films, disaster films and contemporary blockbusters in the prestige and action-adventure traditions, all of them linked by their emphasis on spectacle and by their status as special events. The completed project will form my half of a co-authored (with Steve Neale) book entitles SPECTICLES, EPIC AND BLOCKBUSTERS, to be written in a clear and accessible manner, aimed at the widest possible audience, and to be published by Wayne State University Press.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113193/1","grantId":"113193/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sheldon Tait Hall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
