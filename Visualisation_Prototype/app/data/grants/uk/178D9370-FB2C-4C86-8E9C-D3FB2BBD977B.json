It is one of several Grid projects in the UK's major E-science initiative. It is also one of three major Virtual Observatory projects worldwide (along with the US NVO project and the European AVO project), all working in cooperation to deliver grid-based infrastructure and desktop applications which will allow an astronomer to carry out analytical research on any number and combination of world-wide astronomical datasets from optical, X-ray, radio and other wavelength observations. Astrogrid-1 and Astrogrid-2 will be the first of these projects to deliver working applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/C000722/1","grantId":"PP/C000722/1","fundValue":"438435","fundStart":"2005-01-18","fundEnd":"2009-01-17","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Project had no findings per se, but all activities were properly documented.
