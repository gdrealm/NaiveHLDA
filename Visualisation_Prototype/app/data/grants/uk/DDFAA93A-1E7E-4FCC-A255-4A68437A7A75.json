The ability to act in a planned and purposeful way to achieve our goals is vital in everyday life, and is thought to rely particularly on the frontal lobes of the brain. This idea has significant implications: The frontal lobes are the part of the brain that is slowest to develop as we pass through childhood and adolescence, fastest to decline as we age, and is among the most affected regions by psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. All of these groups struggle to some degree in situations requiring cognitive control: learning new skills, coping with many simultaneous demands on attention ('multi-tasking'), and ignoring distractions. Understanding the psychology of cognitive control and the neuroscience of the frontal lobes therefore promises to have important implications for education, treatment in psychiatry, and understanding the challenges of an aging population. Our research specifically investigates how people predict and learn from the consequences of their actions. To do this, we study how people perform carefully designed cognitive laboratory tasks, and in some experiments measure their brain activity as they do so, to answer the following questions: 1) Does focusing on the desired outcome of a task help us to perform the task better? Our hypothesis is that people should be better able to ignore distractions when the goal of their task is clear and understandable. Using neuroimaging, we expect to see brain activity relating to task goals even before those goals are reached, and from this activity we should be able to predict how well people will perform a task. 2) How do positive outcomes, such as financial rewards, help us to learn? We are testing the idea that, when rewards are earned, this reactivates brain regions that were involved in performing the task that led to the reward, strengthening their involvement and therefore improving task performance in future. By answering these questions, our research should help us to understand a central feature of human behaviour: our ability to direct our thoughts and activities toward achieving our goals. Our findings will not only increase scientific understanding of this basic human trait, but should also lead to new ideas about how to improve practice in the classroom, clinic, and beyond. For example, recent research has shown that focused training in cognitive control tasks can result in improvements in educational outcomes in schoolchildren, and can reduce some of the cognitive difficulties experienced by patients with schizophrenia. Better understanding of the brain systems responsible for cognitive control, and improved methods for measuring these abilities, should in the future lead to improvements in these applications of scientific research on cognitive control and the functions of the frontal lobes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019847/1","grantId":"BB/I019847/1","fundValue":"332711","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project is now coming to fruition, with one publication currently in press and two others under review or under revision.
