They are similar in some ways to electrons but they don't have any electric charge. It was recently found that neutrinos are not massless but have a very small mass. Super-NEMO is one of several planned future experiments to investigate the nature of the neutrino and in particular whether a neutrino is the same as its antiparticle or not.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000037/1","grantId":"PP/E000037/1","fundValue":"175130","fundStart":"2007-01-15","fundEnd":"2009-07-14","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Julia  Sedgbeer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
