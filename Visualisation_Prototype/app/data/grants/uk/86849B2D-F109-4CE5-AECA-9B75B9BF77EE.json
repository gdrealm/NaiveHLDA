{"id":"86849B2D-F109-4CE5-AECA-9B75B9BF77EE","title":"Novel Catalytic Membranes for CO2 Removal and Recovery","abstractText":"Catalytic membrane systems offer the possibility of highly selective removal of CO2 from a mixed feed gas (e.g., from a fossil fuel power station or hydrogen production plant) into an aqueous phase, and recovery of pure CO2 from the aqueous phase, for subsequent storage or re-use. We propose to explore the potential of composite membranes composed of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) as matrix or sub-layer, together with a synthetic catalyst which acts as a carbonic anhydrase mimic (catalysing either CO2 hydration or bicarbonate dehydration depending on pH). In addition to seeking to heterogenize a known carbonic anhydrase mimic (a Zn(II) cyclen complex), we shall investigate the potential of two novel heterogeneous catalyst systems which have not previously been studied for this type of application: nanoporous Zn pthalocyanine polymer networks and Zn phthalocyanine cubic crystals. We shall also explore possibilities for optimizing a membrane for either CO2 removal or CO2 recovery, through control of local pH within the membrane or through use of catalysts with different pKa values, and hence to develop a unique and highly efficient double membrane system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F060858/1","grantId":"EP/F060858/1","fundValue":"149042","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Martin Budd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
