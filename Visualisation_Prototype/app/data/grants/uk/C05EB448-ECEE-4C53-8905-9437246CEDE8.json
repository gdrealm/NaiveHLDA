{"id":"C05EB448-ECEE-4C53-8905-9437246CEDE8","title":"Structural and Practical Proteomics Course","abstractText":"This proposal is to develop and deliver two short courses in structural proteomics. Proteomics is a term used to describe all the proteins which make up a cell and determine how it functions. We propose to develop and deliver short courses which will train life science researchers in using the web-based tools and databases describing the structure of proteins in the cell. Skills in using this type of software to interpret genomic information will allow scientists to better understand the wealth of information available and design new experiments. We also intend to explain some of the techniques which are used in the laboratory to determine the identity of an individual protein isolated from a complex mixture such as a tissue extract, and understand the impact of experimental variations on the resulting data.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D007186/1","grantId":"BB/D007186/1","fundValue":"41976","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This award was for a training course and has no research outputs.  ","person":"David  Jones","coPersons":["David  Moss"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" This funding resulted in series of lectures on protein sequence and structure analysis, and use of GRID-enabled computing for protein science. This included developing both both slides and audio material. Accompanying sets of online practical exercises which reinforced concepts covered in the lectures were also produced. All course material was hosted in a flexible user-friendly virtual learning environment. The grant was awarded to deliver a graduate-level training course for researchers in the area of protein sequence and structure analysis. The tools developed to deliver the course included use of a virtual learning environment and software tutorial viewlets. The use of such tools for postgraduate-level training was demonstrated to other staff at UCL through the Teaching and Learning conference and network meetings.
