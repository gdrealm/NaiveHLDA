I explore the idea from Shakespeare's day to the present, relating the history of its invention from origins in early modern life-writing to its establishment as a critical given in the later nineteenth century and demonstrating the ways in which it fundamentally misrepresents early modern theatrical authorship and thus Shakespeare's late plays themselves.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112826/1","grantId":"112826/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon Alexander McMullan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
