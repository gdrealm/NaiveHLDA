In what ways has the term\\n 'technological sublime' been deployed to explore these kinds of landscapes?\\n\\nii) Critical responses to spaces of industrial decline and abandonment:\\n How have processes if industrial decline affected the meaning and interpretation\\n of urban and industrial?\\n\\niii) The use of the term pastoral in relation to the contemporary city:\\n How can we use the term 'urban pastoral' to conceptualize the return of nature in \\n post-industrial city both as a focus of artistic practice and also as a pivotal element in\\n new urban ecologies and approaches to planning and design?\\n\\niv) The emergence of critical debates surrounding the cinematic sublime:\\n How have urban technological networks been presented in cinematic depictions of \\n the city?
