Specifically, we consider the structural transformation from manufacturing to services, due to faster technological progress in manufacturing, and the marketisation of home production, due to technological improvements in the market provision of such services. Both developments are &quot;women-friendly&quot; because women are more likely to work in services and they are the main providers of home services. Marketisation frees women's time from the home and structural transformation creates the jobs that women can do in the market. </p>\n\n<p>The empirical analysis uses the US Current Population Survey to decompose the change in female employment into a within-industry component, due to changes in gender shares within sectors, and a between-industry component, due to structural transformation. It also uses the American Time Use Survey to match the fall in housework to the rise in female employment in the corresponding market sectors. In order to explain observed trends, the project proposes a dynamic model of labour supply with three sectors (manufacturing, services and home production) and two genders. The model is then used to quantify the contribution of structural transformation and marketisation to the rise in female market hours of work. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4114","grantId":"RES-000-22-4114","fundValue":"73769","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Liwa Rachel Ngai","coPersons":["Barbara  Petrongolo"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
