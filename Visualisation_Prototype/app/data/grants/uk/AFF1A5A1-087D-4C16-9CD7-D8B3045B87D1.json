It is caused by cells dying in the part of the brain that helps control movement. At the moment we do not have a treatment that can be used to slow down or treat the cause of the disease, and so an important aim of scientific research into Parkinson's is to develop new drugs. Over the past decade we have learned a lot about the processes in the brain that lead to cells dying in Parkinson's disease by looking at rare cases where the disease is inherited in families. By identifying mutations in the genes that cause Parkinson's in these families we can study the changes in the brain that can lead to disease. This proposal looks at one of these genes, called LRRK2 (pronounced lurk2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's, responsible for about 6000 cases in the UK. We now know that subtle changes in LRRK2 (not as potent as mutations) can increase the risk of developing the more common, sporadic type of Parkinson's. This makes LRRK2 a very interesting gene as a potential new drug target. What makes it even more attractive as a drug target is that it has two pockets, called enzyme domains, which can be occupied by small chemical compounds (drugs) to change how it functions. This project focuses on one aspect of what LRRK2 does - looking at how it might be involved in a process called autophagy (pronounced ort-oh-fay-gee). Autophagy is one of the ways in which cells in the body get rid of waste, and we already know that when there are problems with autophagy rubbish builds up and can cause cells to die - a process that is very important in brain diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Work from my laboratory shows that when you use a drug to turn LRRK2 &quot;off&quot;, binding to one of those enzyme pockets, autophagy is switched on in human cells that we can grow in a dish. What we are looking at with this project is exactly how this happens, and what other genes are involved in the process. We are also going to look at what mutations in LRRK2 do to change autophagy. We think that mutations might slow down autophagy, which could lead to rubbish building up in the brain over the years and eventually causing enough brain cells to die to make the person with the mutation develop Parkinson's. Finding out what LRRK2 does, and how these mutations change its behavior, is going to be very important for the drug companies who are trying to develop new compounds to treat Parkinson's. It will give them ways in which to measure how active LRRK2 is in cells, which in turn can be used to judge how successful a new drug is at changing that activity, and might uncover new ways to target LRRK2 in the brain. All of this will be critical for developing new drugs for Parkinson's - something that is of huge importance to all of those people who already have the disease and those who will develop it in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010933/1","grantId":"MR/L010933/1","fundValue":"354214","fundStart":"2014-05-06","fundEnd":"2017-05-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick Alfryn Lewis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
