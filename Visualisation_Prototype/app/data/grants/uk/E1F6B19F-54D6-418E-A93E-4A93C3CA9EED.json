Treatment has also improved dramatically (40 years ago AML was invariably fatal, nowadays 40% of younger adults and 60% of children can be cured). This major improvement in outcome has generally been achieved by a series of small steps, not by dramatic breakthroughs. Many new treatments for AML have been proposed but only a minority of these will be better than standard therapy, so large randomised trials with adequate follow-up are needed to evaluate these new treatments in order to determine reliably whether there is a benefit. The reliable results produced by the MRC trials allow doctors and patients to make informed decisions about treatment that balance benefits against side-effects.\n\nAML is a variable disease. Patients with some subtypes now have a relatively favourable prognosis. Others still have a very poor outlook with conventional therapy (including stem cell transplant) and novel treatments are urgently needed for these patients. On the other hand, survival for the best prognosis subtype of AML (acute promyelocytic leukaemia, APL) has improved so much that we are now asking whether equally good outcome can be achieved with less intensive treatment that has fewer side-effects. Some treatments, such as bone marrow transplant from a sibling donor, have a high risk associated with them, but may still offer survival benefit in the long term if they are effective against the disease, so careful comparisons are needed to determine which types of patients, if any, benefit. New laboratory techniques are helping to identify relevant risk groups, but national coordination is needed to address these questions of prognosis in appropriately large cohorts.\n\nThe MRC AML trials have already provided definite information about the effects of certain treatments, which has now been incorporated into clinical decision making. This application seeks support to continue the follow-up of over 3000 surviving patients after the current trial funding expires. Included in this initiative is the modernisation of the IT support systems that will make data collection for future trials more efficient. Continuous statistical analysis is needed to compare treatments within the trials, to correlate laboratory research findings derived from material in the tissue bank with outcome, and to inform the design of new trials which we have traditionally based on the long-term findings of previous trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300133","grantId":"G0300133","fundValue":"664667","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Wheatley","coPersons":["Alan Kenneth  Burnett","Robert  Hills"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
