Importantly, abnormal gene expression has been linked to devastating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases such as myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and dementias. Yet another example of potentially dire consequences caused by defective genes is provided by a range of hereditary disorders affecting multiple tissues and organs. Many of these conditions are associated with considerable patient suffering and mortality and constitute a serious burden for the national health system.\n\nExpression of our genes proceeds as a succession of distinct molecular steps that include transcription, processing of primary transcripts into messengers, and ultimately translation of the messengers into proteins. Several control mechanisms operating at each of these steps ensure that protein products of our genes appear in the right place and at the right time. One such control called nonsense-mediated decay, or NMD, eliminates messengers with defective protein-coding capacity thus allowing the cell to cope with deleterious mutations and occasional errors in primary transcript processing. Surprisingly, recent studies suggest that this mechanism is also used to regulate gene expression under normal circumstances. In this case, corresponding primary transcripts can be processed to generate two or more alternative messenger variants, with some variants encoding proteins and the others degraded by NMD. Several genes indispensible for our nerve cells appear to be regulated in this manner and additional research in this field promises further exciting discoveries.\n\nHere we propose to uncover novel genes that are controlled by alternative processing/NMD during brain development and to begin understanding their functional significance. We will advance our research by combining molecular, cellular and developmental biology techniques with advanced bioinformatics approaches. Our work will have important biomedical implications. Indeed, at least one novel gene, Hps1, identified in our preliminary experiments has been directly linked to a hereditary disease called Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome and understanding regulation of this gene will likely provide important insights into this and a large group of other metabolic disorders associated with similar molecular defects. Wider medical relevance of our study will be guaranteed by its general relevance to neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases associated with aberrant regulation of genes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M007103/1","grantId":"BB/M007103/1","fundValue":"355641","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eugene  Makeyev","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
