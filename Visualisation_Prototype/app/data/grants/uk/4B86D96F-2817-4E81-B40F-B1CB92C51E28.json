The carbon output of large flood basalt eruptions is poorly constrained. We propose a proof-of-concept study of gas release from lava flows, tephra and sills of the Siberian Traps. We will use a novel microanalytical study of melt inclusions and fluid bubbles to constrain the volatile budget associated with the magmatism, incorporating gas release not only from lava and unerupted magma but also building on new studies that have indicated a role for a contribution of volatiles from contaminating sediments. These gas fluxes will form key inputs for future improved models of climatic and biotic impact associated with flood basalt events. We anticipate this work will lead to a larger study that will examine the importance of large igneous provinces and modern magmatic volatile budgets in environmental change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H012648/1","grantId":"NE/H012648/1","fundValue":"32336","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The results led to some important papers. I have a studentship now extending our initial findings from this work which we hope will lead to a large grant proposal in 2015. The key results are that we now believe that the volatile budget for the Siberian traps was over estimated and gas emissions were probably much lower than estimated previsouly, and volatile incorporation from surrounding shales and evaporites played an important role.

We have used examples from both the British Tertiary igneous province, in Skye, and the Siberian Traps, Russia. We have shown, through both bulk analysis of sediments and magmas, and microanalysis of melt inclusions, that sulfur and halogens are assimilated from country rocks to a significant degree. There are important implications of this process for the total mass of volatiles outgassed during volcanism and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and climate. journals, conferences.
