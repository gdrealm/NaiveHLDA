For example, delays in the treatment of patients with suspected encephalitis can have a devastating impact, including severe cognitive disability. Hence, it is not surprising that in most medical disciplines research focuses on identifying biomarkers and risk factors, some of them measured over time, to correctly predict patient outcomes. We propose to develop a novel statistical methodology that allows us to identify patients at higher risk of developing a particular disease or condition sooner than is currently achieved, with subsequent benefits for patients, clinicians and for health care system costs.\n\nDelay in the detection of a disease is directly linked to economic burdens of the National Health Service and communities. When mechanisms are put in place to achieve early detection, they however may be economically demanding. Patients with diabetes, for instance, are screened annually for diabetic retinopathy at a considerable cost to the NHS. Bearing in mind that less than 4% of patients with diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy within a year, there is a great interest in being able to identify patients with a higher risk in order to tailor the screening intervals. In other words, while patients with higher risk should be screened more often than once per year, the low risk group (involving 96% of the study population) could be screened less often than annually, reducing significantly both NHS costs and burden on patients and clinicians. Considering that in the UK alone there will be about 4 million people with diabetes by 2025, individualised screening is vital and it is expected to reduce annual costs to the NHS by more than &pound;100 million without reducing medical screening efficacy. \n\nIn addition to the importance of early diagnosis, being able to identify early that someone is likey to show a poor prognosis is also essential to improve clinical management and optimise resources. For example, approximately one third of patients with epilepsy do not achieve remission from seizures following drug therapy. Early identification of this patient group would allow clinicians to focus on alternative treatments (e.g., surgery) as early as possible. \n\nWe aim to develop a novel time-dependent approach for discriminant analyss that (a) depends directly on both the individual baseline covariate information and the longitudinal data to achieve a more precise classification, (b) allows us to detect the earliest time point at which successful classification can be achieved (with a predefined error), and (c) can be applied to classify individuals into two or more groups, with unequal variance-covariance matrices among groups and incorporation of costs. Our objectives are divided into 3 main parts: development, implementation and clinical applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010909/1","grantId":"MR/L010909/1","fundValue":"334170","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marta Inmaculada  Garcia-Finana (van Der Hoek)","coPersons":["Trevor Frederick Cox","Gabriela  Czanner","Anthony Guy Marson","Simon  Harding","Laura Jayne Bonnett"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
