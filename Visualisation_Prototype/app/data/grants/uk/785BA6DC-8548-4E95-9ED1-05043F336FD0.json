Impairment in this balance has been shown to be related to many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy, autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. This project will address the fundamental question regarding the balance and interaction between neural excitation and inhibition in the intact brain. It will also investigate the dynamic relationship between changes in neural excitation and inhibition, and the ensuing changes in haemodynamic variables such as blood flow, volume and oxygenation. Importantly, by separating components of neural excitation and inhibition, we will investigate how haemodynamic variables change as the balance between these two neural components is shifted. This marks a significant departure from the conventional approach which treats the measured neural signal from Electroencephalography (EEG) or micro-electrodes as representative of 'neural activity'. Preliminary work by us [1] has shown that it is possible to decompose the measured neural signal from extracellular recordings into components of excitation and inhibition.\nBased on our preliminary work, the proposed research will (1) investigate to what extent the extracellular field potentials measured by a micro-electrode and non-invasive scalp EEG can be used to identify underlying neural excitatory and inhibitory components; and (2) investigate how the haemodynamic changes typically used by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques are related to neural excitation and inhibition.\nIn order to achieve the stated objectives, we will combine mathematical modelling approaches with carefully designed physiological experiments which measure, concurrently, neural and haemodynamic responses in vivo from the somato-sensory cortex of the anaesthetised rodent. The advantage of using concurrent measurements is the reduction in the number of animals required to complete the study. Data from these experiments will not only inform the structure of the mathematical model but also validate the model predictions.\nAchieving the first objective will have a direct impact on the interpretation of EEG signals and its potential applications. Specifically, if scalp EEG can be used to monitor the balance between neural excitation and inhibition of cortical neural population(s), it will become a powerful tool for the earlier diagnosis of various disorders in which the balance between neural excitation and inhibition is interrupted.\nThe achievement of the second objective will lead to enhanced interpretation of haemodynamic signals measured by optical imaging techniques and fMRI, the latter being widely used in human subjects for understanding the neural correlates of various cognitive processes. By linking the haemodynamic response to neural excitation and inhibition, which underpin its generation, we hope to establish a coherent explanation for the neural correlates of the haemodynamic signal. Thus the outcome of this research will directly inform the interpretation of fMRI signals.\n\n1. Y Zheng, J. J. Luo, S. Harris, A. Kennerley, J. Berwick, S. Billings, J. Mayhew.

Using bicuculline injection to reduce or eliminate inhibitory synaptic activity, we demonstrated that the temporal dynamics of the LFP within this initial time window is dependent solely on the excitatory synaptic activity of the local pyramidal neural population. This finding will have significant implication on the interpretation of human EEG recordings, specifically it suggests that the onset and slope of the first positive peak P1 observed in sensory evoked potentials may represent neural excitation, while the amplitude and latency of P1 may reflect the onset of the inhibitory synaptic activity. This result provides a window within which we could untangle excitation and inhibition. The findings can be used by all researchers using EEG and LFP as part of their research tool to study neural activity. Potentially it can be used to estimate the balance, or lack of it, between neural excitation and inhibition, hence has potential to be used as part of diagnostic tools for neurological diseases by medical workers. We will be contacting EEG manufacturers to seek collaboration to incorporate the finding into standard EEG software packages Education,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
