{"id":"7C3E8E1D-0880-4AB4-8A75-803946A63070","title":"Point of Care Blood Cell Analysis","abstractText":"The project will develop a new micro-technology for label-free point of care (PoC) cell analysis, paying particular attention to accurate determination of low abundance cell populations for a five-part differential for full blood count (FBC). The FBC is the single most common clinical measurement used to provide information on a patient's health in almost every single disease, indicating the large commercial impact of the work proposed here. The project will also develop new low pressure, low power microfluidics, minimally invasive sample extraction and low-volume processing and new integrated electronics. We will also develop methods for meaningful information delivery to patient and doctor. The end-results will be solutions and know-how for implementation of a handheld PoC Full Blood Count (FBC) system, based on high speed single cell impedance spectroscopy in a microfluidic format. This project will provide breakthroughs in functionality, minaturisation and consumer acceptability to realise a true PoC FBC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G001405/1","grantId":"TS/G001405/1","fundValue":"754304","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project was jointly with Philips.

It also developed a range of related complementary follow up devices and technologies. This system uses single cell impedance spectroscopy implemented in a microfluidic format. Three themes were pursued: \n\ni) Translation from lab R&amp;D to patient testing, with a focus on a reliable label-free identification method for low abundance cell populations, particularly monocytes, basophils and eosinophils. This project was a partnership between University of Southampton and Philips. There is consdierable use for a technology that can enumerate and identify cells outside the academic field. As oultined above, one key area is in developing improved methods for monitoring the wellbeing of cancer patients on chemotherapy. Other areas include tests requiring platelet counts and/or platelet activation assays. There are also potential uses for a low-cost blood analysis system for use in remoe location Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
