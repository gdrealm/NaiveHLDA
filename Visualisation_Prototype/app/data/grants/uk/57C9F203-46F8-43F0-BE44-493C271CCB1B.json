{"id":"57C9F203-46F8-43F0-BE44-493C271CCB1B","title":"Genome wide analysis of auxin-cytokinin interaction","abstractText":"Plants are able to co-ordinate their growth and development throughout the plant body, so that root and shoot growth balance, and the vascular system carrying nutrients up and down between the root and shoot is maintained at an appropriate size for these growing systems. In addition, growth of the shoot system, root system and vascular system is balanced in accordance with environmental conditions, so that for example root growth is favoured over shoot growth when nutrients are limitting. This complex co-ordination of growth is acheived through the action of a network of growth-regulating hormones that move through the plant and interact to regulate growth. This project is aimed at understanding how two key players in this network, auxin and cytokinin, function together to acheive balanced growth across the plant body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E024750/1","grantId":"BB/E024750/1","fundValue":"350333","fundStart":"2007-08-31","fundEnd":"2010-08-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ottoline  Leyser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
