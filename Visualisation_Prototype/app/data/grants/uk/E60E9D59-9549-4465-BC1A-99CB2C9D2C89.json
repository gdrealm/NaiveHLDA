Morphine produces it profound behavioural effects (analgesia, respiratory depression and euphoria) by activating specific proteins (receptors) located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Prolonged activation of these receptors results in them being switched off (desensitized) and this desensitization may be a major component of tolerance. We have recently provided evidence that when activated by morphine, the mechanism of receptor desensitization involves a protein called protein kinase C, which switches off morphine signalling by a process called phosphorylation. However, we do not at present understand how phosphorylation by protein kinase C triggers this switching off in response to morphine. In this application, we propose to determine exactly how protein kinase C phosphorylation switches off morphine signalling in nerve cells. In particular, we will determine in the nerve cells whether or not it is protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor itself or another protein which mediates the desensitization. To do this we will express morphine receptors in nerve cells that have been altered to remove potential sites on the receptor that are phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Given that protein kinase C phosphorylation appears to be a crucial component of tolerance to morphine and related drugs, it is very important that we now determine the exact mechanism involved. In this project we aim to achieve this so that in the future new approaches can be developed to overcome the problems associated with morphine use and abuse.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600943","grantId":"G0600943","fundValue":"390504","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eamonn  Kelly","coPersons":["Christopher Philip Bailey","Graeme  Henderson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
