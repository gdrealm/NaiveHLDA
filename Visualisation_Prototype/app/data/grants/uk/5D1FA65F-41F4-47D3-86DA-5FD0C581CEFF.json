{"id":"5D1FA65F-41F4-47D3-86DA-5FD0C581CEFF","title":"2010 Grant Balance - Swansea University","abstractText":"This bid is focussed on the strategic support of a number of EPSRC focussed research areas within the College of Engineering. This is as a result of an invitation by EPSRC to utilise the unspent balances on EPSRC grants in support of strategic research areas within the University. Four areas have been identified :\n\n(1). Bridging support for High Performance Computing in the context of Computational Engineering;\n \n(2). Bridging Funds in Computational Rheology;\n\n(3) Bridging XL30 Tungsten Source Scanning Electron Microscope - Service Contract: and\n \n(4) INCA to Aztec EDX Software and Systems upgrade to include the Energy 350 capability.\n\nThe first component supports the transition of the powerful computational engineering research groups from the existing cluster based systems to the new IBM HPC systems recently procured by the University and impacts upon all aspects of finite element based computational research at Swansea including Aerospace, Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Medical, Water, Nano and Advanced Materials. The second, relates to bridging support of a key researcher in the Computational Rheology group. The third to Bridging the service contract on the XL30 Scanning Electron Microscope and the fourth to updating the advanced instrumental facilities for sophisticated materials charaterisation in both the Materials and Nano research areas. This equipment is used for Particle Detection, Analysis and Classification, Steel Inclusion Analysis, and the Measurement of composition and thickness of thin films.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J02144X/1","grantId":"EP/J02144X/1","fundValue":"70900","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian David  Cluckie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
