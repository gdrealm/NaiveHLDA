These findings have led to concerns that more should be done to identify and treat young people who self-harm, but the clinical significance of community presenting self-harm is unclear. One quarter of self-harm episodes are carried out with expressed suicidal intent; whilst such episodes are a risk marker for later suicide attempts and suicide, most cases never reach medical attention and later health and social outcomes amongst adolescents who self-harm are uncertain. \n\nTo date, most studies of self-harm in adolescence have been based on small clinical samples - these are highly select groups, already known to medical services. The few population-based studies have generally measured risk factors and self-harm at one point in time, with few follow-up studies. The investigations that have been carried out are generally limited by small sample sizes and tend to have studied suicide attempts, rather than inter-relationships between self-harm with and without suicidal intent. Examining these latter relationships is important both to determine the clinical significance of non-suicidal self-harm in adolescence and to guide prevention and treatment strategies. Furthermore, knowing the health and social outcomes amongst adolescents whose self-harm does not come to medical attention will help determine the need for interventions in this group of people. \n\nThe proposed research is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a long term study of over 13,000 children born in Bristol and the surrounding area in 1991-1992 who have been followed up since birth with regular questionnaires to parents, teachers and, more recently, the participants themselves. Study members have also been attending clinics every 1-2 years since the age of 7 years. They have provided information on suicidal thoughts and self-harm with and without suicidal intent at ages 11 and 16. The lifetime risk of self-harm was 1.6% at age 11, this had risen to 19% 16 years of age. \n\nOur research will investigate whether there are differences in the characteristics and medium term outcomes between children who self-harm with and without suicidal intent in adolescence and in those who do and do not come to medical attention. Findings will be used to determine the clinical relevance of adolescent self-harm and whether there are sub-groups of self-harming adolescents who warrant particular attention. The principle outcomes we will investigate are a) mental health (assessed using the Clinical Interview Scale-Revised (CIS-R) at age 18) b) alcohol and cannabis abuse; c) educational performance (age 14: SATS; age16: GCSEs and age 18: A-levels and d) early employment record. \n\nTwo important issues when studying self-harm in ALSPAC are that it is possible that self-harm is under-reported by participants and that its prevalence (and risk factors) may differ between survey responders and non-responders. We will use recently established linkages between ALSPAC and national Hospital Episode Statistics data (all participants with relevant permissions) and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) (5% of participants) to investigate these issues and assess their impact on the analyses in our proposed research and their implications for future research. \n\nWe have identified no other prospective studies that are in a position to answer these research questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J012661/1","grantId":"MR/J012661/1","fundValue":"162894","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Gunnell","coPersons":["Kate  Tilling","Jon  Heron","George  DaveySmith","John  Macleod","Catherine  Crane","Glyn  Lewis","Keith  Hawton"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
