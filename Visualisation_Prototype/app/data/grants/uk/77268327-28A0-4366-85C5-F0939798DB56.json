It consists of an analysis of the experiences, social interactions and meaning making of disruptive pupils in mainstream education. This qualitative study is based on ethnographic participatory observation of young people attending Learning Support Units in mainstream schools, followed by in-depth interviews with 50 pupils, their parents and teachers. The main aims of the study are: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>To explore the links between culture, meaning and social action, focusing on conflictual social relations in the specific context of the school classroom.</li> \n <li>To generate integrated knowledge about the everyday lives and understandings of disruptive pupils by exploring how they, their teachers and parents make sense of their behaviour and experiences.</li> \n <li>To contribute to debates on young people and disaffection, social exclusion and education policy, by drawing out policy and practice implications. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>The study seeks to encompass a wide range of experiences and social groups and is situated in diverse inner city areas. Fieldnotes and interview transcripts will be subject to a detailed interpretative analysis and findings disseminated across a variety of professional and academic networks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E000649/1","grantId":"ES/E000649/1","fundValue":"341536","fundStart":"2007-01-05","fundEnd":"2010-05-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Val  Gillies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
