Many of these change continuously and in order to survive the organism must respond appropriately to each new set of circumstances. It is however difficult for scientists to study such complex perturbations and so typically researchers have focused on one stimulus at a time. Whilst this has yielded major biological insights, to make further progress we need to develop approaches to studying combinations of several simultaneous perturbations. This cannot be done using conventional experimental techniques alone. These need to be supplemented by mathematical and computational modelling methods, which can integrate data from different experiments, reveal hidden patterns, explain apparently contradictory results and suggest new biological hypotheses. This type of interdisciplinary research is called Systems Biology. Recently a number of centres have been established in the UK to champion Integrative Systems Biology. This project involves one of these centres (CISBIC) at Imperial College London, whose focus is on the interaction between pathogens and their hosts. CISBIC will be partnered by Aberdeen University, thereby extending the range of pathogens studied at CISBIC, strengthening the two institutions existing collaborations and helping to integrate the rapidly growing systems biology group at Aberdeen into the UK and European community. We intend to apply Integrative Systems Biology techniques to understanding how pathogenic fungi respond to the combinations of different stresses they encounter when they invade a human host. We shall focus on the major fungal pathogens of humans, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. They cause frequent oral and vaginal infections (thrush) and cause life-threatening infections of the bloodstream and internal organs in transplant and cancer patients. When such pathogens invade a patient, the immune system normally responds with a variety of counter-measures designed to kill the pathogen. For the microbe these counter-measures are essentially equivalent to environmental stresses, and hence it activates strategies to minimize the damage done by these stresses. The success of the pathogen depends on how well it counteracts these stresses to defeat the host's defences. We will study how these pathogenic Candida species respond to the combinations of stresses they experience in their human host. We will start by investigating each of three stresses in isolation and then use a mixture of experiments and models to explore how these responses differ when two different stresses are applied together. We will then use this information to predict and then validate what happens when the three stresses are encountered simultaneously. Finally, we will evaluate the extent to which our understanding of stress responses in these two pathogenic species can be used to predict the responses of related species for which less experimental information is available. This is an important biological question / this project will provide invaluable information about how biological systems in general respond to combinations of environmental signals as well as increasing our understanding of how pathogenic microbes interact with humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F00513X/1","grantId":"BB/F00513X/1","fundValue":"2515170","fundStart":"2008-06-02","fundEnd":"2014-02-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The CRISP (Combinatorial Responses in Stress Pathways) project has had significant impacts upon the academic community.\n- It has opened the eyes of researchers to the non-additive impacts of combinatorial environmental inputs upon fungal pathogens. While we have focussed on combinatorial stresses of relevance to host niches, other groups have started to examine the impacts of other combinations of physiologically relevant inputs, that include ambient temperature, ambient pH, other stresses, nutrients, quorum sensing. \n- Our team was one of the first in the medical mycology field to use integrative systems biology approaches. Our presentations have encouraged other medical mycologists to exploit systems approaches (e.g. Elaine Bignell, at Imperial College, now Manchester University; Carol Kumamoto, Boston University). \n- We have encouraged established mathematical modellers working on established model systems to use their expertise to study fungal pathogens (e.g. Edda Klipp, Humboldt University, Berlin)\n- We have trained a generation of medical mycologists with expertise in integrative systems biology approaches. Most of these researchers have now gained positions at prestigious institutions, and two have gained systems biology positions in industry.\n- Our CRISP PIs have spread systems biology expertise from the initial Systems Biology Centre involved in this collaboration (CISBIC) to two other institutions (the Universities of Aberdeen and Exeter). CRISP PIs also established the Institute for Complex Systems and Mathematical Biology at Aberdeen University.

We also revealed major differences between these pathogens and the &quot;model yeast&quot; Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This indicated that cross-species comparisons between benign model yeats and fungal pathogens are dangerous. We also highlighted common points of system fragility relating to combinatorial cationic and oxidative stress responses.\n- Our work has shown that existing data and models from S. cerevisiae have limited utility in understanding the responses of pathogenic fungi to host defences.\n- Some of our generic tools are applicable to other biological systems. Also, our dynamic models provide a platform for the modelling of combinatorial stress responses in other species. However, our models will have to be modified to address the significant evolutionary differences between these systems.\n- We have provided our CRISP researchers with a strong multidisciplinary training in Integrative Systems Biology, and many of them are now using this training to advance their careers at excellent institutions.
