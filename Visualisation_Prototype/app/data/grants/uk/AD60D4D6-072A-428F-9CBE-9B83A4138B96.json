One of the most prominent examples is the circadian rhythm which displays an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. Chronotherapy is a form of personalized therapy where treatments are administered according to a schedule that corresponds to a person's rhythms in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects of the therapy. There is now large evidence both in experimental models and in patients that the Circadian Timing System (CTS) of patients is affecting treatment tolerability and efficacy of anticancer drugs while the progression of the disease and treatment with anticancer drugs have disruptive effect on the CTS. Our projects focuses on the development of statistical methods that address the modeling of such time varying effects. An important aim is to develop a real-time prediction system of a patient's CTS state in order to achieve an improved personalized chronotherapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M013170/1","grantId":"MR/M013170/1","fundValue":"334072","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bärbel Frieda Finkenstädt","coPersons":["Francis Albert Levi","David Alan Rand"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
