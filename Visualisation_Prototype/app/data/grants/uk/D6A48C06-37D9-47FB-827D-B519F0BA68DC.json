{"id":"D6A48C06-37D9-47FB-827D-B519F0BA68DC","title":"Semiparametric Methods in Spatial Econometrics","abstractText":"<p>The project will develop methods for analysing “spatially” dependent data. Each observation has a particular location, and dependence between observations is believed to depend on their distance. This might be defined geographically, or geographically and temporally, but also, more generally, in terms of closeness of certain observable economic attributes. Statistical methods that incorrectly assume independence are typically invalid, and can thereby produce misleading conclusions. Thus it is useful to develop methods that allow for dependence, and also estimate the extent of the dependence, as well as testing for spatial independence. The focus will be on methods for analysing economic data, but it is hoped that some of the methods will also find use in such areas of the social sciences as geography and sociology. Generally, statistical models that are “semiparametric” will be studied: the joint distribution of the observations reflects a limited degree of prior knowledge. This strategy acknowledges the partial nature of economic theory, as well as the potential for drawing reliable conclusions in reasonably large, but not enormous, data sets. The models to be studied all have a spatial aspect, and the main effort will be directed towards solving the consequent, distinctive theoretical problems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D002524/1","grantId":"ES/D002524/1","fundValue":"179195","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Michael Robinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
