{"id":"8790E01A-DA92-45A2-9F2B-177215458049","title":"Merleau-Ponty and the Body-Subject","abstractText":"Merleau-Ponty is one of the greatest twentieth-century philosophers, whose work addresses a number of topics that are of contemporary interest - eg self-consciousness, embodiment, intentionality, non-conceptual content. Despite the growing interest in his philosophy, comparatively little has been written about it. Central to his work is his account of the body as conscious and invested with unique forms of knowledge, understanding, and intentionality, which makes possible full-blown consciousness. His notion of the body as subject grows out of his analysis of perception and action. I intend to elucidate and defend some fundamental aspects of it, showing how his ideas can contribute to current philosophical discussion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112659/1","grantId":"112659/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-28","fundEnd":"2006-05-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Komarine  Romdenh Romluc","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
