We will review evidence of the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions that can be implemented in routine practice; we will estimate the occurrence of chronic diseases, associated health outcomes and resource use from a large population of subjects in primary care. In order to compare interventions against each other for the same or different end-points, modelling will be used to estimate costs and benefits from lifestyle interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900845","grantId":"G0900845","fundValue":"407999","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin C Gulliford","coPersons":["Alison  Wright","Cristina  Hernandez Quevedo","Mark  Ashworth","Tjeerd-Pieter  Van Staa","Andrew Peter  Grieve","Alistair James Mcguire","Andre Michael Toschke","Caroline  Rudisill"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
