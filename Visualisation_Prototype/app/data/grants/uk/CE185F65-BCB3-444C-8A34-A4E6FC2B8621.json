{"id":"CE185F65-BCB3-444C-8A34-A4E6FC2B8621","title":"Enabling Sustainable Communities: Supporting effective skills development for current and future core built environment professionals","abstractText":"The public consultation process is considered key to delivering sustainable communities, bringing together both built environment professionals and local stakeholders to determine the future of the lived environment. This emphasis places a new pressure on both parties to possess the relevant skill-set needed for effective engagement. Whilst previous research has identified the particular skills needed to deliver sustainable communities,&nbsp; the extent to which those skills are currently present and effective in practice, has not been addressed.\n<br />\n<br />This research aims to test the adequacy of the generic and specific skills developed within the educational process of the core built environment professions, producing recommendations that will enable effective skills development for current and future professionals.The multi-method approach taken will include literature reviews, focus groups, face-to-face interviews and five case-studies,&nbsp; engaging with a range of stakeholder groups including academics, national professional and policy organisations, practitioners, local councillors, and resident associations.\n<br />\n<br />It is hoped the successful completion of the work will benefit all key stakeholder groups, increasing current levels of local community participation in the consultation process and aiding professsional bodies and High Education Institutions to create the most appropriately skilled graduates equipped to deliver on the sustainble development agenda.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E023983/1","grantId":"ES/E023983/1","fundValue":"70311","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Sayce","coPersons":["Judith  Farren Bradley","Louise  Ellison","Charlotte Louise Harris","Munir  Morad","Amanda  Lewis"],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
