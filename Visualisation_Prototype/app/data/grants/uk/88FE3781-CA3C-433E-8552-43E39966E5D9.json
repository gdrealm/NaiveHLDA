The ability to generate new adult brain cells is very important for normal healthy brain function. A reduced ability to form new neurones is associated with the common and debilitating brain disorders, dementia and depression.\nThis research will use state-of-the-art tools, established by engineers, that will allow us to look at brain cells in far greater detail than previously possible. The application of these nano-scale tools to neuroscience will provide invaluable information on the precise structure and function of brain cells over time. Ultimately, this novel approach will characterise the mechanism of new brain cell generation leading to new targets for the treatment of dementia and depression.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902250","grantId":"G0902250","fundValue":"98036","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeffrey Stephens Davies","coPersons":["Huw  Summers"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
