The proposed research investigates, specifically, the modulation of intuitive and reflective processes by individual differences in working-memory capacity, intelligence, and disposition towards engaging in effortful thinking.</p>\n\n<p>The research programme seeks to advance dual-process theories of human reasoning by better understanding the mechanisms involved in the control of mental processes during reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>A further objective is to understand the neurological processes that are responsible for mediating individual differences in reasoning performance. Combined neuropsychological methods will allow the neural correlates of human reasoning to be investigated. Beyond this, the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation will allow causal links to be drawn between neural events and reasoning performance. This will inform theoretical accounts of human reasoning and decision making.</p>\n\n<p>A final objective is to clarify further the contributions made by particular brain regions, including frontal cortical areas, to high-level cognition.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research will broaden the range of behavioural paradigms within which these mechanisms have been investigated, allowing for a richer understanding of their role in guiding cognition and behaviour.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I037644/1","grantId":"ES/I037644/1","fundValue":"302904","fundStart":"2012-08-13","fundEnd":"2015-12-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Edward Roser","coPersons":["Giorgio  Fuggetta","Jonathan  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
