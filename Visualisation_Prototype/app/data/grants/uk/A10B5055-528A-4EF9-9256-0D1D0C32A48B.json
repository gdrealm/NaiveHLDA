In the parliamentary election it is examining how far voters’ behaviour is consistent with the hope that the introduction of Scottish Parliament elections would ensure:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>That the government of Scotland is accountable to the public of Scotland and </li> \n <li>That the country’s political representatives reflect the contours of public opinion. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>It is thus examining how far voters’ choices reflect their evaluations of how well the Scottish Executive has performed, and their attitudes towards devolved issues. In the local elections, being held for the first time under the Single Transferable Vote, the project is assessing how far voters determine their preferences on the basis of their evaluations of individual candidates, and how far they are simply reflecting their partisan preferences.</p> \n<p>These aims are being pursued by placing a module of 60 questions on the 2007 Scottish Social Attitudes survey. The project is co-funded by the Leverhulme Trust and is being conducted in tandem with additional work commissioned by the ESRC on public attitudes and behaviour at the time of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0513","grantId":"RES-062-23-0513","fundValue":"86335","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Kevin Curtice","coPersons":["Michael  Marsh","David  McCrone"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
