Cells are autonomous units capable of growing, dividing, and responding to external and internal stimuli. To achieve these complex tasks they have to tightly coordinate the production and degradation of thousands of proteins, the entirety of which is referred to as the proteome. Protein synthesis starts with the processes of transcribing a &quot;blueprint&quot; - the information in our genes - into an intermediary molecule called messenger-RNA (mRNA). mRNA stores information as a sequence of nucleotide triplets called codons. This information is then translated into a protein. Transfer-RNA (tRNA) molecules play a central role in this process. Different tRNA molecules can recognize different type of codons and translate them into the appropriate amino acids - the building blocks of proteins. The main mechanism by which cells can control the amount of proteins synthesized at any given time, relies on changing the abundance of the corresponding mRNAs. \n Interestingly, we recently acquired data pointing to the existence of another, novel mechanism by which cells can control the composition of their proteomes. Namely, we have observed that the efficiency with which tRNA molecules can translate a subset of codons, changes in response to changes in the growth conditions a cell is exposed to. We now propose follow up experiments that will shed light on the mechanisms responsible for regulating the efficiency of codon recognition by tRNA in response to changes in the environment. Furthermore, by assessing which part of the proteome is differentially translated as a consequence of the altered tRNA translation efficiency, the proposed experiments will put our initial observation in a functional context. Ultimately, we expect that the experiments we propose will significantly further our knowledge of a truly fundamental biological process and prove / disprove our hypothesis that modulation of tRNA efficiency is a novel regulatory mechanism for controlling proteome composition.\n Miss-regulation of a proteome composition and activity state is intimately connected to the majority of all known human diseases. It is therefore easy to see why gaining an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms used to control protein translation is of such cardinal importance. If our hypothesis proves correct, it would, in the long term, provide an entirely new angle and set of putative targets for drug development. On the other hand, it should also be stressed that deficiencies in the tRNA modifications we propose to study have also been associated, amongst others, with neurological diseases, and decreased tolerance to oxidative stress. Finally, it is interesting to note that one of the modified tRNA molecules we propose to study, and not the unmodified version of this tRNA, is essential for HIV infection. In conclusion, we expect that our research will not only shed light on one of the fundamental processes inside cells, but also contribute to improving the quality of life, wellbeing, and health of our society in the medium term future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L008874/1","grantId":"BB/L008874/1","fundValue":"325784","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2017-03-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dario Renato AlessiPatrick  Pedrioli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
