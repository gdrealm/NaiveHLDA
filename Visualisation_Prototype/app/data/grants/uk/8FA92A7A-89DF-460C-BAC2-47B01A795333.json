{"id":"8FA92A7A-89DF-460C-BAC2-47B01A795333","title":"UK Involvement in Direct Dark Matter Searches","abstractText":"Future direct dark matter searches will require instruments with improved sensitivity and complementary targets and techniques in order to claim a discovery, and then move to more detailed studies of the particle properties and astrophysical parameters. UK researchers are in an excellent position to participate in the world leading experiments, with significant progress in sensitivity achieved by ZEPLIN-III (liquid xenon target) and EDELWEISS-II (cryogenic germanium), experiments with established UK participation, and with a recent recruitment to the UK bringing a new involvement in DEAP/CLEAN (liquid argon). We anticipate a leading UK role in scale up to a tonne fiducial mass and beyond, probing the majority of the parameter space favoured by the most credible WIMP dark matter models. This proposal focuses on the technical development work necessary to design the EURECA and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiments, to mitigate technical risks and improving sensitivity. Meeting these goals will also facilitate the positioning of the UK teams for leadership roles in the construction, operation and exploitation of EURECA and LZ.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K006428/1","grantId":"ST/K006428/1","fundValue":"179034","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  By scientific community and the media.
