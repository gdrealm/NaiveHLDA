However, some people without general perceptual or intellectual impairments find face recognition extremely difficult.

Some of them also have problems with face detection or with recognising emotional facial expressions, while others do not, suggesting that different aspects of face processing depend on different brain mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>To investigate this, EEG (Electroencephalograph) measurements will be taken from individuals with and without face processing problems to obtain event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that are reliable markers of different stages of face processing. Individuals with a specific profile of face processing difficulties should show a distinct atypical pattern of brain responses to faces. This would demonstrate that different face processing problems are linked to distinct stages, which will also be important for our understanding of normal face perception.</p>\n\n<p>This project will expand our knowledge of why some people have severe deficits in face recognition, which can have an enormous impact on their social lives.

Many of these people with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) have no major problems with object recognition, but show severe deficits in the processing of facial identity. We employed behavioural and electrophysiological measures to study which aspects of face processing are damaged in DP. Our results show that early visual-perceptual stages of face processing are a major cause for the face recognition problems in DP. People with intact face perception process upright faces in a &quot;configural&quot; fashion, whereas the processing of inverted faces is &quot;part-based&quot;. People with DP do not show typical processing differences between upright and inverted faces, indicating that their ability to process upright faces in a configural/holistic fashion did not develop typically. We have also shown that in some instances where DPs fail to recognize famous faces, stored visual face memories are still activated, suggesting that face recognition problems can be due to impaired links between visual and semantic face memory. \n Identifying face processing impairments in DPs aids our understanding of normal face perception, and is important to determine the roots of individual face recognition difficulties, which can have enormous socio-emotional effects. Many DPs have difficulty maintaining friendships due to perceived 'snubs' and experience severe recognition-related difficulties at their workplace.
