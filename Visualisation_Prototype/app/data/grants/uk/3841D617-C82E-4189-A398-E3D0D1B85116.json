This study will examine these effects by careful functional and aesthetic analysis of the pilgrims' institutions of the Ethiopians, Armenians, Hungarians and Germans south of Old St. Peter's and their impact on the arts. The research's aim is a book, with a CD-Rom in which these institutions will be virtually reconstructed in 3D based on documentary and visual sources. The study will investigate building types and decoration, rituals and organization, comparing this pilgrims' centre with similar centres such as Jerusalem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119313/1","grantId":"119313/1","fundValue":"128746","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah Janet Howard","coPersons":["Francois  Penz","Wendy  Pullan"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
