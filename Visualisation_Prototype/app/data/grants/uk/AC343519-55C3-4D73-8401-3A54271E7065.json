While some sport psychologists consider perfectionism to be a characteristic that makes Olympic champions, others see perfectionism as a cause of low performance and failure in competitive situations. </p>\n\n<p>However, when regarding perfectionism, it is important to distinguish between two forms of perfectionism: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Adaptive perfectionism (perfectionistic strivings)<br /></li>\n\n <li>Maladaptive perfectionism (perfectionistic concerns). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding non-athletes, studies have shown that adaptive perfectionism is related to higher performance (and unrelated to distress), whereas maladaptive perfectionism is related to higher distress and lower performance. Regarding athletes, however, no study so far has investigated how adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism influence athletes' performance in competitive situations. </p>\n\n<p>Against this background, two studies are conducted investigating perfectionism, athletic performance and competitive success in triathletes. Study 1 investigates how adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism influence athletic performance and competitive success in a major triathlon tournament; and Study 2 investigates how they influence athletic development and performance over the course of a competitive season. It is expected that maladaptive perfectionism will lead to underperformance in tournaments and stagnation of athletic development, whereas adaptive perfectionism will help promote tournament performance and athletic development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2217","grantId":"RES-000-22-2217","fundValue":"57972","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of the present project were used to further the theoretical and practical understanding of the role perfectionism, achievement goals, and goal setting play in competitive sports. Education ","person":"Joachim  Stoeber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" The project's main results demonstrate that perfectionism has a positive influence on competitive performance in triathlon. However, this is the case only for personal standards perfectionism, but not for evaluative concerns perfectionism. Triathletes who have perfectionistic personal standards pursue performance approach goals (striving to do better than others) and set higher goals for the next race (faster times, higher ranks) and thus achieve a race performance that goes beyond what is predicted from their previous performance level. Moreover, athletes who have perfectionistic personal standards, achieve higher performance increments across a competitive season than athletes who do not have such high standards. Consequently, personal standards perfectionism should not be seen as an impediment to performance, but as a personality characteristic that leads to higher competitive performance. The findings of the present project are expected (a) to further the theoretical and practical understanding of the role perfectionism, achievement goals, and goal setting play in competitive sports and (b) to have an impact on how athletes and their coaches prepare for competitions.
