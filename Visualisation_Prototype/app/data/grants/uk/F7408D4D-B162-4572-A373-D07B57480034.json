Being able to allocate staff as required and making the best use of these resources is critical for the longevity of business.</p>\n\n<p>Within this research proposal, the use of historical data, as well as predictive modelling tools, are used to facilitate the best strategy to allocate and position staff based on the prescribed demand for Police Officers. This will require methods of facility location to be extended to deal with real time, variable and static positioning, in a changing and uncertain environment. The modelling tool to be generated will provide an automated mechanism to produce optimal Officer location positioning, with the ability to facilitate stationary and predictive patrol routes to maximise the ability to meet demand in the shortest amount of time, minimising the risk of failure to reach target arrival times and maximising the visibility to the public. This level of sophistication is not currently seen within the force. The potential impact on Crime is immense.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002392/1","grantId":"ES/K002392/1","fundValue":"252098","fundStart":"2013-07-29","fundEnd":"2016-07-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research in this grant is currently ongoing.

","person":"Lisa  Bartlett","coPersons":["Sarah  Dunnett"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":" So far within this research, whilst working with the police, it has been determined that the efficiency of recourses can be increased. One main area is the dispatch of police resources to respond to incidents. Means of selecting the most appropriate officer have been identified and a program which can help automate the selection process is being developed. The results have been proven by adding automation to the process through the development of an officer selection tool and simulation to test its effects. The officer selection tool is being developed to a standard were utilisation into a police force dispatch process could be possible. Development of the tool will also include suggest patrol routes based on crime hot spot areas. The latter is still ongoing in terms of research. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
