{"id":"FDAF912E-22C5-4409-99A2-18A60AB7D657","title":"Social Work and Health Inequalities Research","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this seminar series is to create the basis for establishing national and international collaborative programmes of social work research on health inequalities. The series builds upon the international Social Work and Health Inequalities Network established in 2004.Through a sequence of four seminars from early 2006 to summer 2007, invited United Kingdom and international participants will debate the contribution that social work research can make to understand the micro-politics of health inequalities. This will include examining the details of institutional policies and practices, the workings of health care and interlocking systems, and individual choices that are the transmission mechanisms between the underlying structures of social inequalities and health outcomes. It is intended to develop theoretical understandings, generate a research agenda, examine methodological issues, and identify and build capacity, including the development of post-graduate social work research. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4126","grantId":"RES-451-25-4126","fundValue":"15311","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bywaters","coPersons":["Eileen  McLeod","L  Napier","Mark  Drakeford","Jon  Glasby","David  Jones","Barbara Helen Fawcett","Michael Christopher Payne"],"organisation":"Coventry University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
