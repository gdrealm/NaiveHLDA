{"id":"186B814C-7BEE-4FCF-B0C8-50D97F37716C","title":"Temporal processing in the auditory system: Separating the message from the carrier","abstractText":"Professor Patterson has participated in the development of about 10 auditory warning systems which have provided the basis for national and international standards in aircraft, hospitals, and the railways. Four of the systems have been implemented and installed for use in civil helicopters, military helicopters, London?s fire stations and the safety handsets of railway maintenance staff. Prof. Patterson continues to give radio interviews on auditory warnings and he has served as the ?scientific authority? in videos prepared to promote acceptance of the new warning systems by railway maintenance crews and London?s fire crews. This year we are also hosting a special session on ?Size information in speech and animal calls? at a major international meeting to bring the implications of time-scale analysis to the attention of the larger scientific community. \nOur web site has become an increasingly important vehicle for contact with the wider community and for attracting students and staff. We provide a variety of educational materials including three software packages for auditory modeling. Over the past two years, the site has handled about 2500 successful requests per month.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500221","grantId":"G0500221","fundValue":"457130","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy Dunbar Patterson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
