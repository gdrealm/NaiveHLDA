The cross-cutting nature of the issues faced by the sector point to the importance of a holistic and wide-ranging social sciences approaches to addressing them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This award comprised a diverse range of interventions to build and capitalise upon expertise within higher education in this important but overlooked sector. In particular, over the lifetime of the award, over 20 CASE awards, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), Business Vouchers and Business Placements were deployed to address the needs of a range of public, private and third sector partners.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-187-24-0002","grantId":"RES-187-24-0002","fundValue":"639932","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This was a capacity building cluster award aimed at nurturing the next generation of doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in sport, leisure and tourism. The principal impact of the award has been the development of a group of researchers at varying stages in their academic careers, capable of conducting high quality social sciences research in response to, and partnership with, external end users in the areas of sport, leisure and tourism. 17 academics have supervised their first CASE awards, 16 postgraduates have benefitted from the training opportunities provided by the CBC, 4 of whom have been appointed to professional research postions on the basis of their training.

Each project generated its own individual findings, which are set out in the outcomes (below). Collectively, the most outstanding scientific achievement has been to push back of the frontiers of academic enquiry and critical policy research on sport, leisure and tourism in three thematic areas: the connectivities between tourism, recreation, well-being and the physical environment; tourism, sustainability and behaviour change; and the changing experiences of sport and physical activity among young people. During the period of the award, a total of 106 organisations had contacted the CBC with their knowledge needs; 38 organisations had forged collaborations, 23 of which have benefitted from the CBC funding; and there were 15 requests for policy briefings. Many of the resources produced by the CBC are produced for non-academic users, are written in an accessible style, and they offer new knowledge and detailed insights that are trnasferable across organizations and sectors.\n The principal impact Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
