The byproduct of this process, oxygen, is the foundation for Life on Earth. It is easy to appreciate the importance of photosynthesis on land when one views trees and forests. But, with water covering nearly 75% of the Earth surface, our existence depends equally upon the photosynthesis that occurs in the oceans and seas carried out by microscopic plants and photosynthetic bacteria, for example, algae and cyanobacteria, and also the larger plants like seaweeds. Photosynthetic microbes are increasingly been researched as sustainable sources of environmentally friendly fuels and energy sources. Coral reefs support a mega-diversity of species in the tropics which are an untapped resource for the discovery of new medicines. Corals consist of the calcium carbonate skeleton of many thousands of individual marine animals called polyps. The living tissues of interconnected polyps thinly cover the coral skeleton and, although each polyp may only be a few millimeters in diameter, a colony of polyps functioning as a single animal can produce skeletons that merge together forming reefs of many kilometers in size. The most extensive coral reef in the World is the Great Barrier Reef located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, which will be a focus for our studies. The success of reef-building corals is attributed to single-cell plants called algae living within the polyp tissues. Like plants, algae require sunlight to grow by photosynthesis. The clear waters of the tropics are very poor in nutrients, and yet these waters can sustain an amazing diversity of life. This is because sessile animals like corals have evolved a mutual benefit to live in a symbiotic association with algae, whereby the algae provides food to the coral from photosynthesis and the coral recycles waste products from this food to fertilize photosynthesis. As such, corals form the metabolic foundation that supports life on a reef. Any major disruption to the coral-algal relationship can cause coral death with subsequent loss of reef habitat. A breakdown in this relationship can occur when corals experience seawater temperatures as little as few degrees above the summer average while affected by strong sunlight. This symbiotic dysfunction, called coral bleaching (loss of algae from the coral tissues), can ultimately lead to death if the association is not re-established. In 1998, world-wide temperature anomalies resulted in a global bleaching event causing major coral mortality on 16% of the World's coral reefs. How the coral or algal partners adapt to thermal stress and other synergistic factors such as exposure to strong sunlight is largely unknown. It has been discovered, however, that natural sunscreens, referred to by the acronym MAAs, are produced by coral in defense against chronic exposure to sun-light. It has been suggested that the algal symbionts must make these compounds that invokes a plant biochemical pathway that animals lack. The biosynthetic enzymes responsible for the production of MAAs have never been isolated, nor have the genes encoding these enzymes been identified. Accordingly, we propose to undertake experiments that will reveal this important biosynthetic 'sunscreen' pathway both in coral symbiosis and in a cultured, free-living photosynthetic bacterium known also to produce UV-protective MAAs. In a collaboration that includes Australian and American partners, we aim to define the biochemical and genetic traits of both MAA pathways. This research will contribute vital knowledge for managing the conservation of reef biodiversity and provide new leads in biotechnology for agriculture and human healthcare applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H010009/2","grantId":"BB/H010009/2","fundValue":"322447","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Frederick Long","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
