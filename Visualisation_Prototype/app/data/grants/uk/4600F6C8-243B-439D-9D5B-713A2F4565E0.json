It culminated in a conference at the British Library in May 2010. The aims of the series were to: explore the intellectual and practical opportunities, problems and risks concerning the rise of digital and multimodal research theses and dissertations; provide a forum for practice in this area; and inform thinking, including that on regulations and guidance, regarding new formats for the postgraduate dissertation.</p>\n\n<p>Seminars took the form of papers and round-table discussions - usually of three speakers per seminar. There was participation internationally, particularly from the USA and Canada, and attendance per seminar grew from twenty at the first seminar to over 200 at the final conference.</p>\n\n<p>The series gave rise to an extensive handbook: The Sage Handbook of Digital Dissertations and Theses, edited by the series co-applicants and Myrrh Domingo of New York University and published in July 2012. The handbook runs to 27 chapters in five sections: institutional perspectives; student perspectives; ethical and intercultural issues; multimodality, including the representation and presentation of theses and dissertations; and archiving, storage and accessibility in the digital age.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0629","grantId":"RES-451-26-0629","fundValue":"16210","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Andrews","coPersons":["Jude  England","Stephen  Boyd Davis","Erik  Borg"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
