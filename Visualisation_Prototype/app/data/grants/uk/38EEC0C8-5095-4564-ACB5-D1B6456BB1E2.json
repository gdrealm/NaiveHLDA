The ability to degrade plant cell walls is an essential pre requisite for the their use as a feed stock for bioenergy production. The aim was to develop consortia for grant applications to a specific India/UK grant call in the area of bioenergy. The workshop resulted in the formation of two such consortia each of which prepared a grant application one of which was successfully funded. The workshop was partially instrumental in the preparation of a successful grant application between key UK and Indian research groups into the production of biofuels from agricultural residues and other renewable feed stocks. This started in 2013 and will progress research in this area. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
