While this disorder is relatively rare, affecting approximately 800 women per annum in the UK, 10-20% of all women will experience significant mood changes during pregnancy, such as anxiety and depression. While in most cases normal mood is restored, chronic depression and anxiety during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight while both pre and postnatal mood disorders are independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes for children. The biological relevance of these associations is unclear. Do maternal mood disorders contribute to low birth weight and poorer outcomes because these mothers adopt less optimal lifestyles? Are the unfavorable behavioural, emotional and cognitive outcomes for children a result of the programming of these disorders in utero or poor post natal care early in life? Or are these disorders all manifestations of one underlying biological problem? \n\nA key change that occurs during pregnancy is exposure to placental hormones. The placenta is a powerful endocrine organ pumping out vast quantities of hormones acting on the mother to induce changes in maternal physiology required to ensure a safe and successful pregnancy. In addition to securing nutrient transport to the fetus, these changes include the induction of mothering behaviours. Thus a placental defect involving aberrant hormonal signaling could result in both a low birth weight baby and abnormal maternal mood. \n\nRecent studies suggest a role for imprinted genes in maternal mood disorders. Imprinted genes regulate placental development and fetal growth. Our studies from experimental models suggest that imprinted genes may influence maternal behaviour by regulating the endocrine compartment of the placenta. Endocrine lineages manufacture placental lactogens which have been shown to induce mothering behaviours in rodents. We have pilot data to show that female mice carrying mutant placenta with a disrupted endocrine compartment, induced by genetic modification of an imprinted gene, show altered behaviour. In another pilot study, we found an association between prenatal depression and placental expression of an imprinted gene and human placental lactogen. This provides preliminary data to support the hypothesis that the epigenetic misprogramming of placental signals contributes to maternal mood disorders in human pregnancies.\n\nIn the proposed study we will obtain further evidence that the placenta can program maternal behaviour using our existing animal model. We will concurrently identify gene changes in the placenta from human pregnancies blighted by depression and anxiety. We will then bring these two elements together to ask whether the changes we observe in human placenta can drive altered behaviour in an animal model. Mice are not able to model all aspect of human disease, particularly with respect to complex cognitive behaviours, but we can determine causal relationships which will provide greater biological insight into the origins of abnormal maternal behaviour and may support the development of diagnostic tools predicting postnatal mood disorders for early intervention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M013960/1","grantId":"MR/M013960/1","fundValue":"719568","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rosalind M John","coPersons":["Ian  Jones","Anthony Roger Isles","Richard John Penketh"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
