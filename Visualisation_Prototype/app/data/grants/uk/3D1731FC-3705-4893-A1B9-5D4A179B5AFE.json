The project is focused on Zircon which is an important material for geological dating and immobilisation of actinides over geological time scales.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G030677/1","grantId":"EP/G030677/1","fundValue":"80029","fundStart":"2009-10-12","fundEnd":"2011-03-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Ojovan","coPersons":["Guenter  Moebus","Karl Patrick Travis"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
