The reason that galanin is found in these tissues and its function there is largely unknown, though it is known that the levels of galanin in the nerve increase by a least 100 fold after an injury or cut to the nervous system. To find out more about the galanin protein we have used the new techniques of genetic engineering to generate a mouse strain in which galanin has been removed from every cell in the body (a so called galanin knock-out mouse). We have shown that these knock-out mice are unable to feel pain and their ability to grow back nerves in their limbs following injury is severely impaired. Further, we also have evidence that some cells in the nervous system die after injury when galanin is not present. We now wish to further extend these studies by making further genetically engineered mice with more detailed and specific changes in the galanin levels of the limb nerves. That is to selectively increase and decrease galanin levels in nerves of interest leaving the galanin levels in other parts of the body unchanged. It is hoped that these further studies will greatly advance our understanding of the roles played by galanin in these tissues and may have important implications for the development of possible treatments for the painful nerve complications that result from traumatic injury (eg car accidents) and diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300028","grantId":"G0300028","fundValue":"856568","fundStart":"2003-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Wynick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
