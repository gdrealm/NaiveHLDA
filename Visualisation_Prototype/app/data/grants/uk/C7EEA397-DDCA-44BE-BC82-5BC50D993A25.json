{"id":"C7EEA397-DDCA-44BE-BC82-5BC50D993A25","title":"NeuroCloud: Developing a hybrid cloud architecture for neuroscience research","abstractText":"The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a flexible computational environment that can be configured to accommodate researchers' needs by optimising the use of institutionally held resources, while at the same time dynamically utilising commercially hosted resources in response to surges in demand. This project will provide leading engineering and technical solutions and, importantly, practical demonstrations of an efficient, economical and flexible environment for the delivery of computational (and data) resources within Higher Education (HE), and, between HE and commercial providers. We aim to develop an environment to better manage institutionally held research-computing resources by making them available to users as part of a hybrid Cloud, which can be accessed internally by researchers and also externally by collaborators. In addition to providing access to locally held resources, the environment will also serve as an interface to commercially available cloud computing resources, where computational power and storage can be access on demand, in return for payment. A key aim is to create a user experience so seamless that researchers may not be aware which resources - internal or external, CPU or GPU, are being used. This project will help institutions to manage their computational resources in a cost-effective way. This approach has an additional benefit in that it would use less electricity than conventional computational approaches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016856/1","grantId":"EP/I016856/1","fundValue":"202333","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Douglas Saddy","coPersons":["Slawomir Jaroslaw Nasuto","Peter  Grindrod","Mark Andrew Baker"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
