As accelerators become able to reach higher energies and create more and more collisions per second, the requirements for detectors to survive inside the experiments becomes highly challenging. At the moment, the best option for high speed, radiation hard position sensitive detectors is to use segmented silicon. For the volume of the experiment where charged tracks need to be reconstructed as they bend in a high magnetic field, large areas of detectors measuring the particle trajectories to hundredth of a millimeter precision are needed. While we know how to do this with silicon and the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS have silicon trackers of 60m2 and 200m2 area respectively, we do not know how to build arrays of these areas suitable for ten times the expected dose at the LHC. This is exactly the requirement of the Super-LHC which will operate with an average collision rate ten times that of the LHC. The proposal is a novel approach to building detectors affordably that can meet these demands. It builds on experience at Liverpool in making smaller detector systems able to cope with these very high doses and proposes to explore processing tricks developed for other radiation environments by e2v to come up with a robust method for making the large quantities of silicon microstrip detectors required for the SLHC. Please note: We have tried to put in a joint proposal specifying that e2v are the lead institute. However, since e2v will not input using the JeS system, this seems not to be accepted. This has been reported to JeS (RE: Possible technical difficulties with industry let join bids - HA207389) and they confirmed the system does not allow this. Therefore, we want to make sure STFC understand this is an e2v led bid despite the way this has to be input to JeS so that the electronic system will accept the application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F011571/1","grantId":"ST/F011571/1","fundValue":"261267","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Patrick Allport","coPersons":["Timothy  Greenshaw"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
