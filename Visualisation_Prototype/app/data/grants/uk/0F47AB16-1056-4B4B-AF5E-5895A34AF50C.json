Doctors see injured children daily where physical abuse is suspected. They have to decide whether these injuries are accidental or whether they have been inflicted intentionally. This is particularly challenging when it involves infants who are unable to give their own explanations for their injuries and who are at the highest risk of dying from abuse or sustaining life long disability or psychological scaring.\n\nThere is little published scientific evidence to help Doctors with their diagnosis or medical evidence in Care Hearings or the Criminal Courts. We urgently need quality research to protect children and to prevent parents from being wrongly accused of abusing their children. \n\nBruising is the commonest injury in physical abuse. The doctor is asked to say whether the pattern of bruises is consistent with an accident or child abuse, how the bruise was caused, whether the child may have a blood clotting problem, how old the bruise is and who caused it. \n\nWe will study four groups of children who have bruises from abuse, accidents, every day activities and blood-clotting problems. We will provide a scientific comparison of these groups.\n\nWe will develop three diagnostic tools to improve diagnostic accuracy.\n\n? A statistical calculation of the distribution, size and number of bruises. This will give a probability that bruising is abusive or not and will help health professionals to identify children where child abuse is likely or can be excluded.\n\n? Standardised digital photography to record the size, colour and shape of a bruise. are needed to provide an accurate record of the bruise for future discussion in the child protection or court process. We will develop techniques to measures size, shape and colour by counting the pixels in each bruise and monitor how this changes with time. We will determine whether this method will give the age of a bruise or answer questions about the cause of a bruise. \n\n? An analysis of DNA from skin swabs of children. We will investigate a group of children to identify the background distribution of DNA from carers and DNA overlying accidental bruises. This will determine background information for a future study that will identify whether an individual has caused a bruise and whether we can identify or eliminate a suspected abuser.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601638","grantId":"G0601638","fundValue":"1242560","fundStart":"2007-10-08","fundEnd":"2012-12-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Kemp","coPersons":["Frank David Dunstan","Guy Nathan Rutty","David Lawrence Fone","Sabine  Maguire"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
