These ?standard? whole body gamma cameras can normally only resolve objects bigger than 6mm which limits there diagnosis capabilities for many medical applications.\n\nOver the last few years we have been developing gamma cameras based on new technology that was originally developed for X-ray astronomy. Recently we have developed a new type of gamma camera that offers high spatial resolution imaging, enabling small objects around ~ 1 mm be clearly seen.\n\nDuring the last 10 years a number of applications have emerged using nuclear medicine in operating theatres and intensive care units. In particular, the concept of sentinel node biopsy has been developed to help determine the best treatment for cancer patients. Sentinel node imaging via lymphoscintigraphy has become an important technique for determining the stage of cancer and, in particular, whether the disease has spread from the primary tumour to the lymphatic system. Many UK hospitals are assessing the sensitivity of sentinel node mapping in a range of cancers. For this procedure to be successful it is necessary to identify the sentinel node pre-operatively. Our technology offers the potential for a low-cost, high-performance method of imaging the sentinel node. Our camera would also be useful for the imaging of small organs such as the thyroid and skeletal joints (knees, ankles, elbows).\nOur portable device will offer healthcare benefits by providing patients and medical teams with versatile, point-of-care technology. Such cameras would be clinically useful for radio-guided surgery, sentinel node detection and imaging small parts such as the eye and thyroid and would also find applications in gastroenterology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802647","grantId":"G0802647","fundValue":"82438","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John Ernest Lees","coPersons":["Alan Christopher Perkins"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
