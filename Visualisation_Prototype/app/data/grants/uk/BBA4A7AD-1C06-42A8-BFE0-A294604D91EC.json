{"id":"BBA4A7AD-1C06-42A8-BFE0-A294604D91EC","title":"Mapping Faith and Place: Exploring cultural values in the buildings of South Asian Faiths in Leicester","abstractText":"The city of Leicester is the most ethnically and religiously diverse in the UK outside London. In addition to established Christian and Jewish communities, successive migrations since the 1960s have resulted in the establishment of a range of faith communities , including Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Muslims and, to a lesser extent, Buddhists. There are several new constructions but places of worship for these faiths have been constructed mostly through the reuse of earlier buildings, often redundant places of worship for other faiths, but also reusing industrial and other buildings. In all, Leicester has about 50 mosques, 10 Sikh temples or gurdwaras, 15 Hindu temples or mandirs, a Buddhist hall, and Britain's only Jain temple. These places are increasingly recognised as an important cultural element in the urban townscape. \n\nThis project aims to identify the cultural values of these faith buildings in the 21st century. At one level they may be considered as 'sacred' architecture, but it is clear that they also fulfil other important roles in redefining the shape of the city, creating a sense of belonging (and potentially also alienation) and serving a range of practical functions for their members. \n\nClear objectives have been identified. A group of five buildings, drawn from all of the faith groups noted above, located in different types of neighbourhood , will form the key case studies. Using interviews and observation, members of faith communities, and also non-members, will be invited to share their understandings of the cultural values of these places; and plans and visualisations prepared with expert assistance will be used to chart the relative importance of different aspects of the internal and external spaces and features (Objective 1).\n \nThe project aims to disseminate the results through local groups and schools, and to the wider academic community, through local outreach, meetings and seminars (Objectives 2 and 3).\n \nA final objective involves the development of an existing simple data base to bring it up to date and link it in to a project being developed by Leicester City Council, which provides a platform for social and economic analysis of the city on a ward by ward basis, using census and police data as well as the information collected by the Council (Objective 4). \n\nThe idea has developed from some earlier work by the applicants in the city (see CVs), which has helped us to establish good networks and links with faith groups. The outputs from the project will reflect this dynamic research process. In addition to academic analysis, short guides and interpretive texts will form a concrete outcome from the case studies. Visualisations will be created, to serve as discursive tools. The developed database will serve as a significant new resource. \n\nThrough the analysis of this research, we plan to engage with the identification of cultural value from a range of perspectives. Traditionally, within both planning and cultural frameworks, buildings have been valued aesthetically as architecture; a recognised set of further criteria, including integrity, antiquity and uniqueness, as well as association with particular events or people can enhance their value. Judgements are most usually based on acknowledged expertise, which, in the case of these structures, usually foregrounds 'primary function' at the expense of 'secondary use' ; this is in itself potentially a serious limitation in the cultural appreciation of these buildings. Current theories about how culture is valued more broadly, such as the distinction often drawn between 'intrinsic', instrumental and institutional value, for example, likewise offer a rather flat and restrictive framework. As a starting point, we aim to extend understandings of value to include such things as emotion, experience and performance, which may prove more significant for the case studies; but we expect that further qualities will arise during the research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005875/1","grantId":"AH/L005875/1","fundValue":"33698","fundStart":"2013-08-30","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Deirdre Mary O'Sullivan","coPersons":["Ruth  Young"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
