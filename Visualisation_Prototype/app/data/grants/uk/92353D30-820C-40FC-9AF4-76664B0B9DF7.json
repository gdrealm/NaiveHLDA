Frequently, contemporary evolution is associated with human activities for example antibiotic resistance in bacteria, metal pollution tolerance in plants, pesticide and herbicide resistance, and changes in fish stocks in response to over-fishing. Understanding how populations adapt to rapid and sustained anthropogenic change is imperative for predicting limits to population persistence, and reducing species extinction rates.\n\nOur traditional view of evolution suggests that adaptation occurs through offspring inheriting genes from their parents that increase their survival and reproduction (fitness) in the current environment. Genetic variation is assumed to arise through random genetic mutations. But since most random mutations decrease an organism's fitness, and even random mutations that increase fitness initially only occur in a single individual, which might fail to breed just by chance, it is hard to see how random mutations alone can explain contemporary evolution in response to rapid anthropogenic change. \n\nIf populations are large enough, an advantageous mutation may already exist in the population that can 'rescue' it from extinction. However, an emerging alternative hypothesis that this study will focus on is that populations initially evolve through a process of non-genetic inheritance, in which novel phenotypes are generated by the transmission of factors other than DNA sequence. \n\n'Parental effects' arise when parents differentially allocate non-genetic materials to their offspring altering their behaviour, morphology, or physiology. For example, in many species females produce fewer larger offspring when they experience harsh conditions. Alternatively, 'Epigenetic inheritance' occurs when the epigenetic marks responsible for changing the way that DNA is folded in a cell is inherited from one generation to the next, changing the pattern of genes that are switched on or off at any given time. This is essentially the same mechanism that explains how distinct cell types in our bodies are maintained from one cell division to the next.\n\nCurrently we have little idea how important non-genetic inheritance is in enabling populations to evolve in response to rapid environmental change, or which mechanism(s) might be involved. This is because in sexually reproducing organisms each individual has its own unique set of genes making it difficult to separate genetic inheritance from non-genetic inheritance and secondly because studies of non-genetic inheritance must be conducted over at least 3 generations, something which is not feasible in many study systems. In this study we will overcome these problems by studying non-genetic inheritance in the water flea, Daphnia pulex; an organism that has a generation time of 10 days and reproduces clonally, meaning that all offspring are genetically identical to their mothers.\n\nWe will quantify the non-genetic inheritance generated by exposure to different common freshwater pollutants by comparing the growth, survival, reproduction and patterns of gene expression of genetically identical offspring from ancestors exposed to pollution or not. The relative importance of parental effects and epigenetic inheritance will be assessed by determining whether differences in offspring traits in exposed and non-exposed lineages are explained by differences in offspring provisioning or changes in the patterns of genes switched on or off and the epigenetic marks responsible for folding DNA molecules in the cell. Finally, we will assess the evolutionary implications of non-genetic inheritance by determining whether the exposure of ancestors to pollutants changes the outcome of competition experiments between replicated genetically identical populations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I024437/1","grantId":"NE/I024437/1","fundValue":"487679","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2015-08-13","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  We are already using our findings and the techniques to develop new projects in collaboration with industry (UNILEVER) that aim to modernise ecological risk assessment by linking molecular initiating events through to population levels consequences generated by pollutant exposure.

The nature of these effects varies according to the pollutant but also the genotype.\n\n(b) We have successfully collected data on the effect that exposure to different pollutants has on the patterns of gene expression of those exposed, but also that of their progeny over the next 3 generations when put back in an unpolluted environment (data still being analysed)\n\n(c) We have successfully used bisulphite sequencing to determine the effect that exposure to various pollutants has on the methylome of a single clone and then determined how long these effects persist for.\n\n(d) We have demonstrated that long-term exposure to a chemical called Glyphosate influences ecology by altering population dynamics. We are still analysing our data to investigate whether the non-genetic inheritance generated by long-term exposure to pollutant leads to differences in the evolutionary dynamics of populations.\n\ne) We have demonstrated that maternal age results in the transmission of non-genetic effects that greatly alter the lifespan and mortality rate of offspring (but this effects is clonally variable). Our data might lead to the development of ecotoxicological bioassays and has implications for ecological risk assessment. We are already beginning to collaborate with industry (UNILEVER) in this regard. More detailed understanding of epigenetic inheritance may be important in understanding how genes and the environment lead to phenotypic variation. This may be especially important for traits like complex diseases which cannot be understood based on DNA sequence alone. Our work may also provide a detailed example of how exposure to novel environments can lead to rapid evolution in populations.
