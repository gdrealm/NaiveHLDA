{"id":"F059CCBE-8184-4707-922B-5BDA9C76DFD7","title":"Epigenetic events in micronutrient programming during early development","abstractText":"Although the information content of the DNA is determined primarily by its nucleotide sequence, further modifications of the DNA itself or the proteins binding to it are important to determine which genes are turned on and off. These modifications are influenced by environmental factors. One of them, methylation of the DNA molecule is dependent on the supply and metabolism of several vitamins and trace elements, such as folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 and zinc. If pregnant mice are given food deficient in these factors, DNA methylation in the offspring is altered with resultant changes in gene regulation. A similar mechanism is possible in humans and could account for permanent consequences of micronutrient (that is, vitamin and trace element) deficiencies, however, data supporting this hyposthesis are lacking. Our aim is to study whether the micronutrient supply of the pregnant mother during early human embryonic development influences DNA methylation in the offspring. Of particular interest is the DNA methylation of genes which could potentially effect growth and development of the embryo and placenta. We will take advantage of an ongoing trial run by the MRC Keneba Field Station in the Gambia. This is a double blind, randomised control trial food supplementation containing multiple micronutrients given to women of childbearing age living in rural Gambia. The major endpoints of the study are fetal growth, placental development, weight, length and head circumference of the newborn infant. We will study DNA from children whose mothers received micronutrient supplementation and from those whose mothers received placebo only. Using this design we will study whether micronutrients supplementation has an effect on total methylation of the genome using a simple biochemical assay. We will also use methods that assess methylation at large numbers of specific points throughout the human DNA at the sametime in order to identify genes which are methylated in one group of subjects but not in the other group. The latter method includes the use of microarray (DNA chip) technology that allows for genome-wide methylation analysis in one experiment. We will also investigate DNA methylation of individual 'imprinted' genes. These are particularly interesting candidates for epigenetic modulation as any one of the two copies, either the maternal or the paternal switched on and this is mainly regulated by DNA methylation of sequences called 'imprinting centres'. We will investigate and compare DNA methylation of 9 imprinting centres controlling 8 groups of such imprinted genes. Many of these genes are thought to be important in the control of growth of the unborn child. We will, therefore, assess whether DNA methylation of these 'imprinting centres' is different in individuals with or without maternal micronutrient supplementation. If the trial shows that micronutrient supplementation does indeed improve the growth of the fetus, the weight of the placenta, the size of the newborn then our data could provide supportive evidence that this may be related to altered methylation of these imprinted genes. Evidence in humans that periconceptual variation in nutrients can result in permanent epigenetic changes would have profound effects on the direction of future human developmental biology. It would initiate follow up studies to investigate the consequence of such changes in terms of gene function and could open up new avenues for drug development. For health care professionals and the general public, it would lead to more detailed examination of the importance of maternal diet both before and during pregancy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F02293X/1","grantId":"BB/F02293X/1","fundValue":"540198","fundStart":"2009-01-02","fundEnd":"2012-07-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Nutritional exposures during the antenatal period is critical for fetal and newborn health, and there is accumulating evidence to suggest that the legacy of a poor intrauterine environment may be manifest many decades later as an increased susceptibility to some diseases- the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis. However there is little data describing the mechanisms through which antenatal nutrition can programme human physiology. The exposures that we focused on were 1) the role of micronutrients in very early pregnancy 2) maternal gestational diabetes mellitus 3) intrauterine growth restraint and their effect on DNA methylation. We analysed methylation at 12 differentially methylated regions (at 9 imprinted loci, which play important roles in allocation of maternal resources) and 27000 CpG loci across the genome.\nWe identified loci differentially methylated between Gambian individuals with and without peri-conceptional exposure to micronutrient supplementation. Differentially methylated loci were also observed between offspring of women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and between those with and without intrauterine growth restriction. Many of these loci were in common with those identified in the Gambian cohort of micronutrient supplementation furthermore replication studies in a group of infants with levels of maternal glucose exposure below that defined by GDM [the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study] also found common loci. \nInterestingly there was little overlap between males and females which may have implications for health differences between the sexes. These studies provide support for the concept that similar epigenetic modifications may underpin different prenatal exposures and potentially increase long-term risk for diseases such as type 2 diabetes. The loci that were replicated may form potential biomarkers of disease risk, and additionally could give molecular insights to the mechanisms of disease. \nBiomarkers could be evaluated following interventions designed to modulate periconceptional and antenatal care and monitoring of postnatal development to ameliorate risk. Ultimately this could have economic and societal impacts by increasing the effectiveness of public services and enhancing quality of life.\nWe have produced three research papers and one review article which were published in peer reviewed journals, additionally the results were publicised more widely through the University Research Highlights website and through a podcast .

Initially we targeted imprinted genes, which play important roles in allocation of maternal resources whilst being epigenetically regulated. We observed sex-specific effects of micronutrient supplementation, reducing methylation levels at two of the loci analysed, IGF2R in girls, and GTL2-2 in boys. \n\n\n\nThe subsequent genome wide array analysis of 14000 genes identified CpG loci with differential methylation between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups both in cord blood (14 loci in males and 21 in females) and in 9 month infants (108 loci in males and 106 in females) with little overlap between males and females. Seven loci in males and 8 in females were observed in both cord and infant samples, indicating that early supplementation is potentially associated with programming of gene activity at birth and maintained into infanthood. \n\n\n\nA major category of differentially methylated genes were those associated with defence against infection and immune response, a highly interesting finding given that rural Gambians born in nutritionally poor seasons have an increased mortality rate as young adults which may have an infectious etiology. Intrauterine exposures mediated by maternal diet may affect risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our analyses form the first study of human DNA methylation in the context of a randomised controlled trial and provide evidence that periconceptional maternal nutrition alters offspring methylation. Trials of peri-conceptional micronutrient supplementation have identified gender specific changes in both birth weight and cord blood hormone levels, and our identification of gender specific differential methylation at distinct CpG loci following micronutrient supplementation provides a possible mechanism for these immediate phenotypic changes and for the programming of subsequent disease risk. \n\nThese observations may be of particular importance in developing countries where micronutrient deficiencies are common, and additionally in Western populations where cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes are prevalent. Any loci that can be replicated in other cohorts could potentially be used as biomarkers of disease risk, and additionally could give molecular insights to the mechanisms of disease.
