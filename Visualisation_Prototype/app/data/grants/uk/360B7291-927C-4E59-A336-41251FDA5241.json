They form barriers consisting of cellular sheets that separate compartments of different composition, such as in the eye, the blood-retinal barrier. The development and functioning of these cellular sheets requires a careful timing of cell proliferation and differentiation. After an operation, during retinal wound healing, for example, epithelial cells need to divide to fill the gaps and then re-differentiate into the organ-specific cell type. Individual epithelial cells are connected to each other via specialised intercellular junctions that mediate cell-cell adhesion, regulate transepithelial permeability, and help to control epithelial proliferation and differentiation. One of these structures, the tight junction, regulates diffusion of solutes across epithelia. We have recently discovered two tight junction regulatory system that control cell proliferation and differentiation in a cell density-dependent manner. One of these systems is based on a transcription factor, a protein that controls expressionof genes in the nucleus. The other system is based on a regulator of actin and also controls gene expression and cell shape. Here we propose to elucidate how these regulatory systems turn on and off the cellular machinery required for retinal pigment epithelial cells to stop to divide, to differentiate and to form the blood-retinal epithelial barrier.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400678","grantId":"G0400678","fundValue":"309600","fundStart":"2005-05-16","fundEnd":"2008-05-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Susana Balda","coPersons":["John  Greenwood","Karl  Matter"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
