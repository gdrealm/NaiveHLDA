The availability of new technologies and intelligent frequency management is now leading to a re-evaluation and exploitation of the unique advantages in this part of the spectrum. The success of future HF systems rely on the ability to integrate within a multiple IP (Internet Protocol) based networks i.e. SATCOM, LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network) bearers and also able to support IP network diversity.An HFIP network can easily be integrated along with other networks such as SATCOM, V/UHF, land lines ,etc, to comprise a single WAN to support IP traffic where the latency and higher rates are not paramount, through using readily available commercial off the shelf (COTS) HF systems. These types of HFIP-WAN networks will also provide invaluable, cost effective support in humanitarian operations and disaster relief operations allowing field users to link with major networks.The nature of the HF sky-wave channel imposes a major challenge in developing high data rate reliable communicationsbut there is a greater economic demand for pursing HF communications due to usage of the ionosphere as a free repeater rather than the use of expensive satellite services.There is also a considerable interest in developing HFIP wireless WAN networks (HFIP-WAN)) and this opens up new potential in developing improved error control coding and modulation support for the HFIP-WAN architecture.The research proposed here will maintain the competitiveness of the HF band by improving the existing error control coding and modulation schemes used by HF systems to suite the new HFIP-WAN networks. This research also proposes investigating a self-forming, self-healing concept supported by coding within an HFIP WAN.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F044186/1","grantId":"EP/F044186/1","fundValue":"224260","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bahram  Honary","coPersons":["Leslie William Barclay"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
