The team comprises BT as lead partner, to provide advanced data analytics and visual software tools, plus access to a number of networked large-scale data sources. The academic research partner is the world-leading Oxford Internet Institute (OII), who will lead on novel graph and network visualisation analysis. The end user is Oxford City Council, who have expressed a keen interest in the project outputs; as the city faces a number of challenging constraints in the coming decade. Driven by economic growth, population increase, housing demand, and serious transport issues. The city must also balance intense demands from tourism, and social provision for its large student population. The project will aim to integrate a number of social, economic and transport related data streams in real-time to provide the city with a revolutionary geo-spatial viewpoint and perspective into its emerging challenges. This new capability will facilitate city planning, resource management, social-economic development, and reduced pollution/congestion from improved transport operations","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N00728X/1","grantId":"NE/N00728X/1","fundValue":"275264","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Bright","coPersons":["Scott  Hale"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
