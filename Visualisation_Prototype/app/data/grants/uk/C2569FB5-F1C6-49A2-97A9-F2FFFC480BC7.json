{"id":"C2569FB5-F1C6-49A2-97A9-F2FFFC480BC7","title":"Auxetic Textiles for Enhanced Healthcare","abstractText":"Engineers from Exeter University and surgeons from University College London Hospitals are collaborating on research into the benefits of auxetic textiles to improving healthcare and quality of life for patients. Auxetic materials get fatter when they are stretched, whereas most materials get thinner when you stretch them. Possible areas where auxetic materials will improve our lives include compression bandaging (to treat, for example, leg ulcers) and dental hygiene, and successes in these areas could easily translate into sports garments to improve performance or protection for athletes. Auxetic textiles have interesting energy properties and unusual drape and stretch qualities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902241","grantId":"G0902241","fundValue":"53312","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julian Roger Wright","coPersons":["Kenneth  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
