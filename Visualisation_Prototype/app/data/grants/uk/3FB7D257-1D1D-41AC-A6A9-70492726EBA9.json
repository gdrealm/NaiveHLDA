(ii) Can banks overcome contract enforcement problems in offering ROSCA-like financial products?\n\nThese questions are directly motivated by recent research on microfinance, which suggests that savings products may be more useful for poor communities than loan products. To understand how savings products can be improved for the poor, we need to understand several important issues: Why don't the poor save more? How does household behaviour change when the household is a debtor, rather than a creditor? Can better microfinance products be developed to facilitate saving? These are the issues that underlie our research questions in this project. We anticipate that our research results will therefore have direct relevance to both policymakers and microfinance providers. If our product proves viable, it could provide small enterprises with a mechanism to increase investment and employment - and, in turn, to drive growth.\n\nMETHODS AND DATA: We will use a Randomised Controlled Trial. We will use a 'cluster-randomized' design, treating in some locations but not in others. In treated locations, we will (i) randomly assign firms to different positions in a rotating credit structure (see the 'Case for Support' for detail on the product), and (ii) randomly vary the interest rate. In total, we anticipate assigning 800 microenterprises to the new product, 800 as controls in the treated locations, and 800 as controls in untreated locations. We will stratify clusters by average cluster characteristics (specifically, the total number of clients at the branch, the number of female clients at the branch, length of branch operation, and average loan size made at the branch). Within treated clusters, we will stratify microenterprises by gender, sector of operation and baseline profits. A baseline and three follow-up surveys of the targeted microenterprises will be conducted at three-month intervals in control and treated locations, to form a four-wave panel. These surveys will include behavioural games, designed to explore the effect of time preferences, risk preferences, social preferences and peer pressure on take-up of the intervention and repayment/saving. We will also collect high frequency data using short phone surveys, and we will augment this sample with data generated by the bank internally.\n\nDISSEMINATION: Most importantly, we will disseminate by close engagement with our partner bank, NRSP Microfinance Bank, who have expressed direct interest in our results. We will also run a workshop in Lahore at the end of our research to disseminate results to the local academic community and policy community. Finally, we will use CSAE's extensive dissemination network to share results with stakeholders in other contexts (for example, through the CSAE Briefing Paper series, designed to share policy-relevant results).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L012286/1","grantId":"ES/L012286/1","fundValue":"455711","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Quinn","coPersons":["Giovanna  D'Adda","Naved  Hamid","Marcel  Fafchamps"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
