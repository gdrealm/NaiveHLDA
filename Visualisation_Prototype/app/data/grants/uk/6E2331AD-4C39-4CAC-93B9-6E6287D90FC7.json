{"id":"6E2331AD-4C39-4CAC-93B9-6E6287D90FC7","title":"Vasopressin and the retina","abstractText":"All living beings are synchronized to the rhythmic light-dark changes that occur daily. These daily (circadian) rhythms are generated by internal biological 'clocks', and these clocks are co-ordinated by specialized neurons in one special region of the brain - the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The activity of the SCN is synchronized daily by environmental signals - mainly by information on light received by the retina, which is communicated by nerve fibers to the SCN.\n\nExactly how the retinal input entrains the rhythm of the SCN is unclear. Several mechanisms, including gene activation and local neuropeptide release, have been linked to the regulation of this 'clock'. Signaling of the neuropeptide vasopressin in the SCN plays a particularly important role - vasopressin is critical for re-setting of the clock after a change in the light-dark cycle, for example during transcontinental travelling or shift work. \n\nThe SCN contains a large population of vasopressin neurons, but we recently found that the retina also contains many vasopressin-expressing cells, and that, strikingly, these communicate exclusively with the SCN - they are involved only with regulating circadian rhythms, and not with normal vision. \n\nThus, these newly discovered vasopressin cells in the retina are a major, light-activated pathway that has a key role in regulating important circadian rhythms. The proposed research will define exactly how these cells influence the SCN, and will establish how modulation of the retina-SCN pathway contributes to changes in circadian rhythm regulation. \n\nThe experimental studies will all be on laboratory rats - and will include studying the effects of selectively destroying or activating these cells using very sophisticated genetic approaches. These approaches will involve inserting a gene into these retinal vasopressin cells to enable their activity to be controlled precisely in experiments that will be carried out in deeply anesthetized rats. The SCN is part of the hypothalamus of the brain; in evolutionary terms, this is an ancient structure that is present in all vertebrates. The SCN is organised in a very similar way in all mammalian species that have been studied, so findings from studies in the rat are likely to be &quot;translatable&quot; into understanding of how rhythms are regulated in people. \n\nIdentifying a specific population of cells in the retina that has a key and selective role in regulating body rhythms will open up new therapeutic possibilities for helping to restore altered circadian rhythms during jet lag or rotating shift work. Epidemiology shows that rotational shift work is accompanied by major health risks, including increased propensity for cancer, depression, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, decreased immune responses and even life span.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M022838/1","grantId":"MR/M022838/1","fundValue":"619609","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2018-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Ludwig","coPersons":["Gareth  Leng"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
