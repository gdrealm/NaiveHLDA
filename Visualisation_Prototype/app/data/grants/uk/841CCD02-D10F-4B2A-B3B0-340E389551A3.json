Recently there has been an increase in the use of hips made from metal articulating on metal since these hips enable younger recipients to continue to participate in active sports activities. These metal on metal hips however produce millions of very small (nanometre sized) metal particles with every step taken and these particles will travel around the body. The particles may have no effect whatsoever if the body can dispose of them through normal excretion. On the other hand, the particles have the potential to cause changes to cells in different parts of the body which may lead to diseases such as metal allergy or even cancer. The aims of this study are to investigate the biological consequences of exposure to these particles in a mouse model that can be translated into the human situation. This will enable scientists and clinicians to better understand what the consequences of the use of metal on metal hips might be. This will mean that clinicians and patients can make better informed descisions when choosing the type of hip replacement by balancing the benefits against the potential risks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701221","grantId":"G0701221","fundValue":"424997","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"E  Ingham","coPersons":["Joanne Lisbeth Tipper","Sophie  Williams","Patrick  Case","John  Fisher"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
