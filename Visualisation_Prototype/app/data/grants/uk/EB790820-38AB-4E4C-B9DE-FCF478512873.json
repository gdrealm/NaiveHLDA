{"id":"EB790820-38AB-4E4C-B9DE-FCF478512873","title":"Early emergence of ethnic differences in chronic disease risk: the contribution of diet and physical activity","abstractText":"British South Asians face increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease; British African-Caribbean adults face increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes and stroke in adult life. The reasons for these patterns are not fully understood. However, there is growing evidence that these ethnic differences in disease risk emerge early in life, offering opportunities for early prevention (particularly in these high risk ethnic groups) before the diseases are established. Diet and physical activity are both risk factors for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and could be important in explaining ?and preventing - these ethnic differences in disease risk. However, we know little about the extent of ethnic differences in diet and physical activity among British South Asians and African-Caribbeans, especially in children. We therefore propose to assess diet and physical activity patterns among 2000 British primary school children of South Asian, African-Caribbean and European origin during an ongoing health survey. The information which we will collect will allow us to examine the following questions:-\n-How much do diet and exercise patterns vary between 9-10 year-old children children of different ethnic groups?\n-How important are these differences in diet and exercise patterns in explaining emerging differences in risks of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease between children from different ethnic groups?\n-What are the factors (at individual, family, school and community levels) which affect the dietary and physical activity patterns of these children? Do these factors differ between ethnic groups?\n\nThe information collected will be used to inform strategies for early prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, particularly in these high-risk ethnic groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501295","grantId":"G0501295","fundValue":"273259","fundStart":"2006-01-23","fundEnd":"2009-07-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Whincup","coPersons":["Alison Mary Lennox","Derek Gordon Cook","Ulf  Ekelund"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
