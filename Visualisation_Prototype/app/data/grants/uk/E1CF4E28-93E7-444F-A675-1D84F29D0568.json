The information provided by these estimates are how one can control the hight and width of a solution, as well as where it is mainly concentrated, by the corresponding properties of the right hand side and/or the initial data of the equation. The specific applications concern estimates for the solutions of non-linear heat-type and wave-type equations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051368/1","grantId":"EP/H051368/1","fundValue":"98013","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolfgang  Staubach","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
