This is done by several experiments: ATLAS at the :LHC at CERN, due to start in 2007, will study proton-proton collisions at the highest energies yet, and is expected to reveal a wealth of new particles. BaBar at SLAC is measuring the difference between matter and antimatter. Dzero is at Fermilab, which is presently the highest energy collider till the LHC starts. SuperNemo will search for a type of nuclear beta decay which, if found, would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle. We also run an ongoing R and D programme for the detectors, electronics, accelerators and computers we use for our investigations into fundamental physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000495/1","grantId":"PP/E000495/1","fundValue":"6101870","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Brian Cox - he was a member of the group during this grant, which covers the period in which he developed as a populariser of science Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal","person":"Roger  Barlow","coPersons":["Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","George  Lafferty","Robin  Marshall","Frederick  Loebinger","Christian  Schwanenberger","Thorsten  Wengler","Terry  Wyatt","David Spencer Bailey","Stephen  Watts","Brian  Cox","Cinzia  Da Vi√°","Un-Ki  Yang"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Continued discoveries in particle physics, including CP violation in B decay Further developments in particle physics Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
