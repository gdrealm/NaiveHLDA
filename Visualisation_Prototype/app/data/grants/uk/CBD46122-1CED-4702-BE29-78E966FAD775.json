It will explore the subjective experience of identity, focusing on fathers and minority ethnic groups. </p> \n<p>It will case study two Children’s Centres in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, involving staff, parents and others carers, male and female, who are using the services, as well as those eligible to use the services but not doing so. It will use three main methods of qualitative data collection:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with all management and project staff from each Children's Centre. These will explore programme perceptions of the participation of minority groups and strategies employed to engage them. <br /><br /></li> \n <li>Observation will be carried out at each Children’s Centre, to allow the researchers to explore patterns of service use and to identify potential interviewees. <br /><br /></li> \n <li>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with ten frequent service users and ten occasional service users from each Children’s Centre, as well as ten people from each area who are eligible to use the services but do not do so. </li>\n</ul> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2172","grantId":"RES-000-22-2172","fundValue":"27273","fundStart":"2007-04-16","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Mary Parks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
