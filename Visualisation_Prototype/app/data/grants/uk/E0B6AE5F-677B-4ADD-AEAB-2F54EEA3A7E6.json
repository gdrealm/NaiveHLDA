Noxious gases like carbon monoxide or nitric oxide, produced in quantity by the internal combustion engine, would naturally revert to less toxic materials in the atmosphere given enough time, but only after causing significant respiratory problems at ground level on our city streets. Similarly, simply mixing nitrogen and hydrogen at high enough pressures would eventually yield the ammonia essential for agriculture, but impossibly slowly. In each case, and in many, many others, the role of the metal catalyst is to speed up and/or re-direct the reaction, preventing environmental pollution or making important high-value chemicals out of uninteresting low-value ones. It is little wonder that the often rare metals involved, from the transition region in the centre of the periodic table, are amongst the most valuable elements in the world, nor that efforts to understand and to optimise their effects are keenly pursued.In many cases, the chemical reactions important in catalysis happen at the surfaces of solid transition metal particles. Passing molecules settle and stick upon the surface (adsorb), move around on the surface (diffuse) and eventually detach from the surface and float away (desorb); in between these basic steps, the molecules may fall apart on the surface (dissociate) or join together to make new molecules (associate). The detailed chemical interactions between the molecules and the metal surface are crucial in determining the relative rates of these five elementary types of process, meaning that each different metal, and indeed each different exposed facet of a metal crystal, may have different catalytic properties. In our work, we make sophisticated measurements of these processes on extremely well-characterised surfaces under highly-controlled conditions. By comparing these with results from our state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, we are able to build up a complete picture of the surface chemistry, and hence to predict better catalysts for future industrial and environmental use. Increasing use of novel alloys and nanostructured surfaces will be a characteristic of our planned work in this direction.The potential for our kind of fundamental surface science to make a significant impact in real-life situations is reflected in the funding we have attracted from industrial sponsors. In recent years, we have been working with Toyota on iridium-gold catalysts for removal of nitric oxide from automobile exhausts, and we have just begun a collaboration with Johnson Matthey looking at the catalytic activation of methane in the same automotive context. Meanwhile, our planned work with BP Alternative Energy is looking towards optimising the production of hydrogen for fuel cell technology, and Shell Research have just committed to work with us towards new routes for ethylene epoxidation.Looking beyond the current applications of surface catalysis, however, we are also focussing a substantial effort in the direction of so-called asymmetric catalysis. The biological molecules found in living organisms are often characterised by the fact that they are chiral, which is to say that they can exist in two inequivalent mirror-image forms. These mirror-image molecules are indistinguishable from each other by most chemical means, but can have radically different behaviour within the body; in many pharmaceutical contexts, therefore, it is vital that drugs be prepared in a pure chiral state. Our research aims to provide an efficient means to achieve this through the use of intrinsically-chiral metal surfaces, which are cut from their parent crystal in such a way as to induce chirally-selective surface chemistry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E039782/1","grantId":"EP/E039782/1","fundValue":"2500900","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research undertaken as part of this project has been communicated to our industrial contacts at major companies including Johnson Matthey, BP, Shell, etc. We are told by these contacts that our discussions with them are valuable and contribute to the productivity of their own research and development teams. Our work is, however, of a fundamental nature, so precisely defining impact over a relatively short timeframe is a practical impossibility. We are confident that our work will have significant impact in the long term, both in terms of economic benefit and benefit to society through environmental protection, but cannot quantify this at present.

To achieve this goal, we employed state-of-the-art ultra-high vacuum experimental techniques and cutting-edge first-principles computational modelling. Specific targets for the work included finding the driving forces behind the formation of complex two-dimensional networks of biologically important molecules (amino acids) at copper surfaces, understanding the factors involved in several industrially important catalytic reactions on iron, cobalt and palladium surfaces, and breaking new ground in the study of catalysis over non-metallic compounds, starting with iron pyrite.\n\n\n\nTo give a flavour of our findings, we focus first upon our investigations of amino acids at copper surfaces. Here, we made use of scanning tunneling microscopy to obtain molecular-scale images of the structures formed by the amino acid overlayer on the surface, and reflection absorption infra-red spectroscopy to obtain information on the vibrations of these molecules. Together, these techniques allow a great insight into the structures formed, augmented by first-principles density functional theory modelling that reveals the chemical imperatives that dictate these structures.\n\n\n\nRegarding industrially important catalytic reactions, our work included studies by reflection absorption infra-red spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy on the ammonia synthesis reaction over iron (crucial for fertiliser manufacture), supersonic molecular beams studies on the combustion of methane over palladium (involved in car exhaust catalytic converters) and single-crystal adsorption calorimetry experiments relevant to the formation of alkanes from carbon monoxide over cobalt (for the potential generation of synthetic fuel from green biomass).\n\n\n\nOur high-risk experiments on iron pyrite have also proved to be a real highlight of the project, taking us from a position where very little was known about the surface chemistry of this abundant mineral, to a situation where we can see the first hints of possible reactivity for reactions such as ammonia synthesis. Several papers on this work are in an advanced state of preparation.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, we have continued to develop and improve upon our experimental and computational methodologies. We have, for instance, made strides towards the routine deployment of our unique fibre-optic based low-energy electron diffraction instrument, which allows us to study more fragile surface systems than ever before. With this approach, we have obtained detailed structural information about water overlayers on a copper surface, methanethiolate on a gold surface, and are now poised to utilise the same method on amino acid overlayers for the first time. We also upgraded our scanning probe microscope with the latest QPlus sensor technology, gaining thereby a truly world-class instrument capable of imaging at sub-molecular resolution and performing spectroscopic measurments on single molecules. On the computational side, we have developed a new methodology to carry out first-principles molecular dynamics simulations that provide an insight into the processes occurring in the split-second (one-millionth of one-millionth of a second) of bond-breaking and bond-making that encompasses a chemical reaction. Understanding and improving upon catalysts used in transport and industrial contexts can impact upon energy efficiency and sustainability, the economics of commodity chemical production, and environmental protection. Our work on the adsorption of biological molecules at metal surfaces has relevance to the production of fine chemicals, including potentially pharmaceuticals, and to medical applications such as biosensors and surface treatment of implants. The nanomagnetic and spintronic aspects of our work are relevant to electronic device technology. Results from our work have been disseminated to other academic scientists via publications in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations at scientific conferences. In addition, our contacts with industrial scientists at major companies such as BP, Shell and Johnson Matthey have ensured that this information is also available to help shape future technologies in the crucial areas of chemical manufacture, energy production, transport and environmental sustainability.
