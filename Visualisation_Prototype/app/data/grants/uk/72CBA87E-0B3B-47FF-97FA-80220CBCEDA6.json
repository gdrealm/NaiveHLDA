{"id":"72CBA87E-0B3B-47FF-97FA-80220CBCEDA6","title":"Lexical Integration: Properties, Predictors, and Consequences of a Core Language Skill","abstractText":"<p>Understanding language involves two core components of retrieval and integration. Individual word meanings are retrieved, they are integrated into phrases, and ultimately those phrases are combined into dialogues or texts. Prior research has revealed a great deal about the retrieval of word meanings, but in stark contrast, relatively little is known about how individual words like “circus” and “lion” are integrated into phrases like “circus lion”. </p>\n\n<p>This research utilises several experimental methods and administers a number of psychological measures to advance knowledge of how such lexical integration occurs, what cognitive resources it requires, and how it affects other cognitive skills. For example, this research will examine whether readers can voluntarily control lexical integration, whether individuals who are better at remembering and at controlling their attention also tend to be better at lexical integration, and whether lexical integration is related to other skills such as understanding analogies and comprehending text passages. Lexical integration is related to several psychological disorders, such as dyslexia and schizophrenia, and hence better knowledge of lexical integration may advance our understanding of these psychological conditions. Moreover, given the importance of lexical integration to language more generally, this research ultimately could improve the teaching of language skills too.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4162","grantId":"RES-000-22-4162","fundValue":"80968","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Zachary  Estes","coPersons":["Lara  Jones"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
