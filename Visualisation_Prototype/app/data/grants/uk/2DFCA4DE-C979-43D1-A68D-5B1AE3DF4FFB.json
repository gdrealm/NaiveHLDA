In those most fortunate the infection is restricted to the nasal passages. However, in a significant proportion of children less than one year of age, elderly patients, those with a deficient immune system and even healthy adults, respiratory infections kill. According to the World Health Organisation respiratory infections are the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide and yet vaccines do not exist for even the most prominent pathogens. Attempts to understand mechanisms of disease are vital for the rational development of new therapeutics. \n\nWe have previously reported that neutralization of inflammatory mediators or removal of specific cell subsets, prevent illness during respiratory infection. Inhibition of ?OX40? expressed by immune cells received wide publicity on television and radio stations and in news papers. We have also documented the impact that one lung infection has on subsequent unrelated pathogens at the same site. Remarkably, previous exposure to influenza virus modulates immunity to respiratory syncytial virus. Similarly, lung BCG infection prevents allergic responses to fungal pathogens. Public understanding of scientific advances is vital for the momentum that drives these ideas into the clinic. As science develops novel concepts evolve that need to be tested in biological systems. \n\nPreliminary data highlights several novel and exciting areas that have never been tested in the setting of respiratory infections. For example, cells that are stressed (by infection, trauma or oxygen starvation) produce a ?retaliatory metabolite?, adenosine that we believe plays a critical role in the outcome of respiratory infection. Additionally, the body senses the presence of an invader using receptors that recognize shapes or patterns on the virus or bacterial surface. The role of these ?pattern recognition receptors? in respiratory defense is not known but investigated in this application. Finally, humans are never free of previous or concurrent infections. Simultaneous lung infections are the norm rather than the exception and yet have received relatively little attention. Studies performed during influenza pandemics for example, show that the incidence of associated bacterial pneumonia ranged from 2-18% depending on the population studied. We will study the interaction between 4 common respiratory pathogens.\n\nThese studies will directly influence the development of future therapeutics or vaccines and therefore drastically improve the quality of life and how health care is delivered to those most affected. Such improvement in public health impacts on the distribution of resources within an already stretched national health service.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400795","grantId":"G0400795","fundValue":"410053","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tracy  Hussell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
