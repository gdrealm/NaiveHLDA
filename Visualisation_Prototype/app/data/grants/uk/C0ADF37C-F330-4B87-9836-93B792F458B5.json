Measures of environmental deprivation included will consist of both aspects of the environment that may hinder physical activity (for example air pollution) or support physical activity (access to greenspace). Contributing to the evidence base on the physical environment, health behaviours and health outcomes the project will ascertain whether use of a composite measure of environmental deprivation has benefits over and above the analysis of individual environmental features.</p>\n\n<p>The project will apply quantitative models using ecological measures of the physical environment and individual survey data of physical activity levels from the Health Survey for England.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H032029/1","grantId":"ES/H032029/1","fundValue":"77618","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Niamh Kelly Shortt","coPersons":["Richard James Mitchell","Jamie Robert Pearce"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
