Suddenly, a man in the crowd captures your eyes. Then, you realize that he looks very much like your friend in your current thoughts. This example shows that our attention can be automatically attracted by a stimulus matching the contents actively held in our working memory (WM). The proposed project builds up on my recent work where I have delineated for the first time (i) the factors that influence the effect of WM on the deployment of attention and (ii) the areas in the brain that may be critical. However, it remains to be established which particular brain regions are indeed crucial and necessary for attentional guidance from WM and what may be their specific functional contribution. The project is relevant with regard to attentional impairments following brain damage (i.e. after stroke). The proposed project will uncover these issues. I will use novel approaches that combine computerised visual attention tasks, brain imaging and brain stimulation techniques, in order to specify the brain circuits that are critical in guiding attention from the contents of WM. I will also apply the research into clinical settings. I aim to show that attentional impairments in neurological patients can be improved by training in WM capabilities. The outcome of the project will provide important insights to understand the brain circuits that support the guidance of attention by WM in the healthy brain, how they relate to impairments of attention and awareness in the injured brain and how these cognitive impairments can be influenced by WM training and the manipulation of the contents of WM. The project will pose interesting clinical applications to rehabilitate impairments of attention in a wide range of neurological patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802212","grantId":"G0802212","fundValue":"384130","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Soto","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
