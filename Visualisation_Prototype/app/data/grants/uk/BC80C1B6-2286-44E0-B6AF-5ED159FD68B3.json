At the same time, however, it's clear that raeders can dael wtih wodrs in wihch not all the leettrs are in thier corerct psotiions.</p>\n\n<p>For a long time most theories claimed that readers code letter position using mental representations of letters that are position-specific, eg, CAT would be coded by C-1, A-2, and T-3. Recent research has highlighted problems with this approach. Alternative theories of letter position coding address these problems in one of three broad ways. </p>\n\n<p>The present project will test these theories by using a masked priming methodology. Priming refers to the finding that identification is faster/easier when the same stimulus is presented a second time. The speed-up is observed even when the prime is presented very briefly and masked, so that it is not consciously seen. Testing whether a misspelt version of a word helps to prime that word allows one to test the perceptual similarity of two letter strings, and so to test the different predictions made by different theories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G031754/1","grantId":"ES/G031754/1","fundValue":"81103","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Davis","coPersons":["Stephen Jeffrey Lupker"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
