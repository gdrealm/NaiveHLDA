They provide surfaces on which exotic chemical reactions can take place, and they act as the condensation nuclei ('seeds') on which water condenses to form ice particles and cloud droplets. Particles may also reflect visible and UV sunlight back to space (cooling the earth), and absorb outgoing infra-red radiation (contributing to the 'greenhouse' effect). For thermodynamic reasons (decreasing entropy), it is actually quite difficult to form new particles in the atmosphere from gaseous constituents. This process is known as homogeneous nucleation: a few molecules condense together to form a stable cluster (about 1 nm in size), which then becomes the building block for further growth. This proposal will examine two examples of homogeneous nucleation that occur in very different regions of the atmosphere: iodine oxide particles, which form in the marine boundary layer from iodine species that are produced biogenically in the ocean; and meteoric smoke particles, which form in the middle atmosphere from the metals and silicon oxides that ablate from meteoroids. For both these systems, we want to follow the evolution of the particles from single molecules to particles containing about 1 million molecules (diameter about 50 nm), in order to understand what controls the rate of growth and the shapes of the particles. Preliminary work shows that the particles are fractal-like ('fluffy'), with large surface areas which often facilitate chemical reactions. For example, meteoric smoke particles may influence some of the chemistry controlling ozone in the stratosphere. We will also examine the properties of these particles as ice condensation nuclei. Iodine oxides have recently been observed at high concentrations over coastal Antarctica, and could be a source of ice nuclei near the surface. Meteoric smoke particles are most likely the nuclei for noctilucent clouds. These ice clouds, which form around 83 km at high latitudes during mid-summer, were first observed at the end of the 19th Century. This has led to speculation that they are an early indicator of climate change in the middle atmosphere. Finally, we will address the question of how meteoric smoke particles descend from around 80 km to the earth's surface. The particles have been detected both by capturing them with a rocket-borne instrument flying above 70 km (in this project we propose to analyze some of these captured particles), and by detecting cosmic iridium and platinum in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. We will use the Met Office's general circulation model to study the transport pathways during present-day conditions and during a glacial maximum, in order to interpret the ice core record over several hundred thousand years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E005659/1","grantId":"NE/E005659/1","fundValue":"594900","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The results have been used by atmospheric scientists.

The first objective was to resolve an important uncertainty regarding the photochemistry of the OIO radical. We showed that photon absorption (490 – 620 nm) causes photolysis to I + O2, which increases enormously the ozone-depleting potential of iodine.1 Photolysis at wavelengths below 487 nm produces IO + O, yielding the first accurate heat of formation for OIO.2 We then made direct observations, using laser photo-ionization coupled with Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry, of I2O2, I2O3 and I2O4. High-level quantum theory calculations were used to determine the thermal stabilities of these higher iodine oxides, which were shown to be the essential building blocks of IOPs.3 \nTwo complementary photochemical techniques were then used to explore the formation kinetics of small IxOy clusters, and their growth to large IOPs (diameters up to 50 nm). This work showed that spontaneous formation of IOPs always occurs once the higher iodine oxides form, but that the subsequent particle growth is inhibited at high relative humidity and temperature.4 We also demonstrated that the uptake of sulphuric acid vapour is extremely efficient, which is a key factor in accelerating the growth of IOPs in the atmosphere.4 Through a study of the temperature-dependent deliquescence/efflorescence of I2O5/HIO3 particles, we showed that IOPs should have glassy properties in the atmosphere.5 These experimental results were then used to develop an IOP atmospheric model for interpreting the results from recent field campaigns.6 \nMeteoric Smoke Particles. An important component of this part of the project was to develop the first model of silicon chemistry in the upper atmosphere. The kinetic studies on reactions of Si+, SiO+, Si and SiO showed that silicon, freshly ablated from meteoroids, is quickly converted to very stable silica molecules.7,8 Hence, SiO2 is a major building block of MSPs, along with Fe and Mg oxides. The formation kinetics of MSPs were then studied, starting with the magnetic-dipole driven growth of fractal Fe-containing particles.9 We also developed the first successful technique to generate olivine-type MSPs in the gas phase, where the Mg/Fe ratio can be precisely controlled. The ice-nucleating properties of Fe2O3 nano-particles were then studied in the AIDA chamber (Karlsruhe). We observed efficient nucleation on 15 nm particles at temperatures down to 180 K,10 which we believe are the smallest particles where ice nucleation has ever been observed. Fe-Mg-Silicate nanoparticles were also generated using sol-gel synthesis, and shown to react very efficiently with concentrated H2SO4 even at the low temperatures of the lower stratosphere.\nThe final part of the project was to study the transport of MSPs from the upper mesosphere down to the earth’s surface, using the Met Office Unified Model (HadAM 3). This work shows that MSPs remove significant amounts of H2SO4 in the stratosphere, before entering the troposphere where the greatest density of MSPs is deposited in Greenland (in accord with ice core measurements). The UM was also run to simulate under the conditions of the last Ice Age, revealing that the greatest deposition of cosmic material occurred over North America and Antarctica. The rate coefficients can be used in atmospheric models. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
