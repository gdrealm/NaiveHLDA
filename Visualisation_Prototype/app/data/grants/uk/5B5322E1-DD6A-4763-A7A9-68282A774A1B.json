Findings indicate that the competition acted as a powerful catalyst in galvanising cities to think more strategically about their cultural offer, identity and heritage within a national context and in comparison to other drivers. Connections between relevant communities of practice and interest are strengthened considerably; issues of responsibility and representation however appear to limit the extent to which different residential, cultural or social communities engage in the bidding process. Network members expressed an interest in forming a wider learning community that would help to consider and demonstrate the true cultural value of the cultural title, and have identified a number of learning outcomes and recommendations for the on-going UK City of Culture programme, and emerging research questions on dimensions of the 'cultural city' including issues of cultural entitlement, collaboration, place-making and leadership.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J50160X/1","grantId":"AH/J50160X/1","fundValue":"29811","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerry  Wilson","coPersons":["Ian  Grosvenor","David  O'Brien"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
