It was discovered that 98% of all RNAs in human cells do not encode a protein. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are now regarded as essential to regulate cell function. However, less attention is directed towards the mechanism of transcription of these RNAs itself, meaning that it is possible that the production of ncRNAs is a consequence of functional changes and not a cause. Chromatin is the name for the proteins that package the long DNA molecule within the nucleus of the cell and the way chromatin structure is organised controls access to specific genes. Differential chromatin organisation can be regarded as the basis of cell identity and failures in the establishment or maintenance of this organisation lead to serious developmental defects and cancer. We have identified an ncRNA that is induced after pro-inflammatory stimuli and we show that the transcription of this RNA is required to alter chromatin and to up-regulate the expression of a specific gene. In addition, we show for the first time that transcription is also required to remove a protein from chromatin (CTCF) that represses gene expression. The purpose of this proposal is to understand the exact molecular mechanism of how this happens. We believe that this observation provides a paradigm for events that occur at many places in the genome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G001391/1","grantId":"BB/G001391/1","fundValue":"369578","fundStart":"2009-02-23","fundEnd":"2012-02-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pascal  Lefevre","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
