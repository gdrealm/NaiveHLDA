The project revealed the considerable diversity of people living in Romano-British towns and resulted in national news coverage as well as a pioneering outreach project at the Yorkshire Museum. This follow-on project will enhance the value and impact of this research, and make these scientific findings available to a nationwide (and potentially international) audience of Key Stage 2/3 learners and teachers. This public engagement will be achieved through the creation of an interactive website and a teaching resource pact, in collaboration with the Runnymede Trust. \n\nUsing a range of scientific techniques, the AHRC-funded research project identified significant numbers of migrants in the burial record of Roman Britain, in particular at the important late Roman towns of York and Winchester. Osteological and forensic ancestry assessment was combined with oxygen &amp; strontium isotope analysis to assess geographic origins. Our results show that a significant number of individuals sampled (up to 33%) can be classed as non-local, with a smaller proportion coming from outside the UK. Contrary to popular perceptions, there are women and children amongst these migrants. \n\nResults were published in seven peer-reviewed journal papers and an edited volume. Our work was featured on the BBC 'The One Show' (3rd Nov 2009) and in The Times (26 February 2010) and we trialled outreach activities at the Yorkshire Museum (www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk). \n\nHaving completed both the academic research and the initial outreach project, it has become apparent that the results of this work are of enormous significance to the way in which the Roman period is taught in British Schools. 'The Romans' are a central part of the primary school history curriculum in Key Stage 2 (ages 7 -11). Currently, the available teaching materials portray Roman Britain as homogenous, and any immigrants essentially as Italian, white and 'like us'. This kind of approach is exemplified by websites such as http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/romans/ and children's books such as the 'Usborne Time Traveller: Rome and the Romans' (see visual evidence attached). Such depictions fail to take into account both the epigraphic evidence (inscriptions mentioning foreigners) which in many cases has been known for two hundred years and more recent scientific findings. Previous work by the Runnymede Trust strongly suggests that there is a strong demand for innovative educational materials about cultural diversity in the UK.\n\nThis project will address the gap between academic perceptions of mobility and migration in the Roman world and current primary (and secondary) school teaching by creating a website for children aged 7-14 and a teaching resource pack for teachers and community workers. To achieve this we will work with the Runnymede Trust, the UK's leading independent race equality think tank (http://www.runnymedetrust.org/), which has extensive previous experience of designing and promoting educational websites. This project will be of relevance to all primary schools in Britain as it will enable teachers, especially those working with children from diverse backgrounds, to portray images of the Roman world that are not only more relevant but reflect new academic research on the topic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005436/1","grantId":"AH/J005436/1","fundValue":"61944","fundStart":"2012-01-09","fundEnd":"2013-03-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hella  Eckardt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" Previous research at the University of Reading (2007-2009) has challenged popular perceptions of an essentially homogenous Roman population in Roman Britain, changing understanding and improving awareness of ethnic diversity in particular. The research demonstrated that later Romano-British populations were much more ethnically diverse than previously thought, with up to a third of individuals classified as non-local. Migrant populations were also shown to include women and children, in contrast to the popular perception that it was mainly adult males who moved across the Roman Empire.\n\nThis grant was employed to develop a website and teachers' resource pack, produced in collaboration with a children's author (Caroline Lawrence) and the Runnymede Trust, the UK's leading race-equality think tank. \n\n\n\nThe website and teaching resource (http://www.romansrevealed.com/) were launched on the 25th April 2013 and show how the concept of a diverse Britain is not new. As the introductory text explains, 'Links can be made between the way we understand modern multicultural British towns and cities and the very diverse groups of people who live in Romano-British towns such as York and Winchester. The resource offers young children the opportunity to engage with ideas about migration and diversity, as well as teaching them about the use of archaeological science in history. It thereby makes cross-curricular links between Key Stage 2 History, Geography and Science, while the activities and discussion materials, in particular, will help develop and consolidate English curricular skills'.\n\n\n\nThe website features stories arising from collaboration with the established children's author Caroline Lawrence (author of &quot;The Roman Mysteries&quot;, a major BBC series and Book series) and with a visual artist (Aaron Watson). Caroline Lawrence provided four short stories about specific individuals, using the scientific 'clues' provided by us, but adding a creative twist. In addition to the 'Ivory Bangle Lady' there is a girl from Winchester who has exotic grave goods but a local isotope signature, suggesting she is the child of migrants; a young man local both in terms of grave goods and isotopic signatures; and an older male from York who appears unremarkable in terms of grave goods but originates from a colder, continental part of Europe. This project was designed for a non-academic audience, inpartiuclar Keystage 2 learners, teachers and parents. \n\nThe website was only launched on 25th April 2013 but was trialled with ca. 200 children at primary schools in London and Reading. An initial assessment of its impact is encouraging as both children and teachers report an increased awareness of diversity not just in in terms of ethnicity, but also in terms of age and gender (Ottosdir 2013). We expect the website's reach to increase significantly through promotion at teachers' conferences and relevant websites and there are links through teaching resource sites such as: PrimaryResources, ThinkingHistory, Miminus Latin course, TES, History on the Net, MyLearning and the London Grid for Learning. \n\n\n\nOttosdir, G. 2013.
