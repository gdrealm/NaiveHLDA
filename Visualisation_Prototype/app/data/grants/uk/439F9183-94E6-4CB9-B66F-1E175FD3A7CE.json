{"id":"439F9183-94E6-4CB9-B66F-1E175FD3A7CE","title":"Full Volume: A New Acoustic for Scottish Poetry","abstractText":"This project has investigated the ways in which the' sound system' of Scottish poetry in English may learn from Scottish Latin poetry in Scottish Gaelic. In making the versions of the Scottish Latin poets George Buchanan and Arthur Johnson, I have sought to find adequate forms and registers, sometimes drawing on Renaissance Scots as well as on Latin examples. Some of the work has been published in the LRB and TLS; it has resulted in the Radio 3 programme, 'George Buchanan: not for burning' (to be broadcast in October 2006) and in my 200pp book 'Apollos of the North: selective poems of George Buchanan and Arthur Johnson' published by Polygon (in Latin and English) in July 2006; also in conference papers delivered in St Andrews Glasgow, and (later this year) Oxford. The Gaelic side of the project has involved investigating how patterns of internal rhyme in Gaelic poetry might inform the English-language ear and lead to the making of new poems. The results have been presented at the international 'Sound Effects' conference held at the University of St Andrews in July 2006 and are part of the completed typescript of poems 'Full Volume' delivered to Jonathan Cape in June 2006 for publication in 2008. A linked radio 3 programme has also been proposed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111723/1","grantId":"111723/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Crawford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
