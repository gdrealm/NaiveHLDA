{"id":"A1BE61DC-5B2A-47FE-983E-4D86A7C3EB65","title":"Biotelemetry/Bio-aerial-platforms for the Urban Boundary Layer","abstractText":"Attempts to improve the urban component in meteorology and numerical weather prediction models in recent years have been hampered by a paucity of meteorological data in the urban boundary layer (UBL), especially in the region above, but close to, building height. This region is precisely where local energy balances and drag combine with prevailing synoptic patterns to transmit fluid dynamical information up and down spatial scales, with implications for (i) urban weather prediction, (ii) event forecasting (e.g. heatwaves, climatic conditions during sporting events, releases of hazardous substances), and (iii) sustainable urban planning for high density liveable cities. However, capturing meteorological data in urban areas above the mean roof height is problematic using conventional techniques. \n\nWe propose Biotelemetry/bio-aerial-platforms as a novel and practicable solution to the data paucity above urban rooftops in the UBL, and to circumvent the regulatory issues related to use of unmanned aerial systems. We will develop a suite of low-cost Avian-Meteorology-Instrument Packages (AvMIPs) for ensemble deployment in Birmingham as a suitably large and heterogeneous test case. The AvMIPs will be tested rigorously to determine: (i) data biases and reliability; (ii) sensor response to temperature variations; (iii) effect of radiation; and (iv) effect of bird's body temperature and other 'platform effects'. After quality assurance and control of the packages have been determined to be adequate, the primary targets of the AvMIP deployment will be the thermal and moisture structures of the UBL at the city and neighbourhood scales. Favourable weather conditions for deployment will be identified via pre-deployment modelling using a mesoscale meteorological model (WRF, Weather Research and Forecasting). Subsequent analysis and interpretation of the AvMIP data and synthesis of the data together with Birmingham's canyon (3m) meteorological data will be assisted by post-deployment modelling for the measurement periods. Overall, this project will deliver a novel, and rigorously tested, technology for probing the UBL. A unique dataset for the UBL of a major European conurbation will be obtained, elucidating climate mitigation issues such as the cooling (or heating) capability/capacity of a large park (or a city centre) to a city's UBL, and scientific issues such as the magnitude of the 'blending height' at which the effect of urban surface heterogeneity is no longer detectable. Success of the project will be a necessary step towards deployment of chemical sensors, and lead to generation of unprecedented datasets of the urban atmosphere for both research and city-planning purposes.\n \nNovel field deployments of the kind we propose require strong partnerships with a wide variety of stakeholders. The Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA) provide critical support in terms of birds that will behave in well determined ways. The RPRA have experience of mounting payloads on pigeons and so can ensure that our payloads are appropriately in size, weight, etc., and that our pigeon deployments will deliver the data we seek. \n \nBirmingham City Council will support the project in three ways: \n1. As one of the principal end-users of our results (feeding into improved diagnosis and forecasting of urban climatology across the city through the joint city-university BUCCANEER project); \n2. In order to facilitate use of birds in open urban spaces such as parks; and \n3. In order to facilitate access to city buildings on which gulls are nesting. \n \nDr Stefan Bodnar, an ecological consultant, will support the project by acting as principal bird handler and as a consultant for public dissemination of our work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N003195/1","grantId":"NE/N003195/1","fundValue":"661185","fundStart":"2016-01-04","fundEnd":"2019-01-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Xiaoming  Cai","coPersons":["Andrew David Quinn","Jon  Sadler","A.
