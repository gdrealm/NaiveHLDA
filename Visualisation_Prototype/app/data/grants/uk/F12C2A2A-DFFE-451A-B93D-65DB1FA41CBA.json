Recent advances in the field have shifted the focus from individual genes to complex regulatory cascades that operate in diverse sub-cellular compartments, between cells and between tissues. This, in turn, requires the study of the distribution of gene products (proteins) and their biological effects at a very fine scale: the scale of individual cells and even within cells. Fortunately, this is facilitated by new types of microscope. The one being requested in this application is a confocal laser scanning microscope that, by illuminating only one tiny spot at a time within a specimen (but scanning the illuminating laser beam progressively across and through it), eliminates most of the glare and fuzz of conventional microscopes. Such instruments enable images from deep within tissues to be gathered and different colours that identify different proteins to be detected simultaneously. The department requesting this instrument does not have its own confocal microscope, and several members of the department currently have to go to remote sites to collect these crucial images. The provision of the requested instrument will thus result in greatly increased efficiency in using Research Council and other funds for project work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E01335X/1","grantId":"BB/E01335X/1","fundValue":"237505","fundStart":"2007-08-24","fundEnd":"2008-08-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This was a research equipment grant for a confocal microscope.
