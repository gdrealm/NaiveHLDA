I was the founding editor of the refereed journal, Management &amp; Organizational History (originally SAGE, now Taylor &amp; Francis). I have a longstanding interest in public memory, battlefield tourism, and in commemorative processes and artefacts; and have published articles on social remembering, on so-called 'dark tourism', and on official narratives and their counter-narratives. A manuscript on memorialisation and landscape is in preparation. I am also working with Kent Fedorowich on a longer term prosopographical study of the thousands of British migrants who returned from overseas in dominion armies to fight for King, Country and Empire between 1914 and 1919.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M504178/1","grantId":"AH/M504178/1","fundValue":"34604","fundStart":"2014-01-02","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Booth","coPersons":["Edward Kent Fedorowich"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
