{"id":"53C24368-F94F-4827-ADBD-8163C611CBED","title":"An investigation of the genetic basis of myopia in the 1958 British birth cohort","abstractText":"Myopia (short-sightedness) affects at least one in five of the population in the UK and similar countries. All affected individuals have difficulty seeing distant objects, impacting on a range of activities such as driving, sports and going to the cinema or theatre, and some are also unable to focus on near objects, unless they are held at very close range. Affected people are at considerably increased risk of retinal detachment and retinal scarring, both of which can cause blindness. Myopia is recognised to have an important impact on the lives of affected individuals and incurs high social and economic costs, for example the costs of optical treatment (glasses and/or contact lenses) in the USA alone in 1990 were estimated to be US $5 billion. There is good evidence that it is becoming more common in many populations. Despite long being an area of active scientific research, there has been little study of how genetic and other biological, environmental, socio-economic and life-style factors, from birth to adult life, combine to influence its occurrence or progression. \nWe propose to investigate the role of recently reported possible genetic factors in causing myopia in the members of the 1958 British birth cohort. This comprises all 17,000 people born in one week in 1958, who have been followed at intervals since that time by interview or examination. This genetic project will draw on, and run in parallel with, an epidemiological project already underway examining myopia both as an outcome and as a risk factor, combining information on general health, development and lifestyle. If we can confirm and refine these genetic factors in the 1958 cohort, this will improve our understanding of the genetic contribution to myopia and inform future work exploring the relationship between genetic and developmental, life-style and social factors in the development of myopia. In the longer term, we would hope that this knowledge would ultimately contribute to developing new methods of preventing or treating myopia, including those targeted at environmental risk factors in those predisposed genetically as well as gene therapy itself.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301069","grantId":"G0301069","fundValue":"288934","fundStart":"2005-06-27","fundEnd":"2008-12-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jugnoo Sangeeta Rahi","coPersons":["Andrew Royston Webster","Christopher John Hammond","Pak  Sham","Catherine  Peckham","Shomi  Bhattacharya"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
