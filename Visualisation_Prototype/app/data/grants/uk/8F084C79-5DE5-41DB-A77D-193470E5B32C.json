It is becoming apparent, however, that for a wide range of flow\nproblems current generation software packages used for aerodynamic design are not fit for purpose.\nSpecifically, for scenarios where flow is unsteady (highly separated flows, vortex dominated flows, acoustics problems etc.)\ncurrent generation software packages lack the required accuracy; since they are ubiquitously based on 'low-order' (first- or\nsecond-order) accurate numerical methods. To solve challenging unsteady flow problems, and remove the need for\nexpensive physical prototyping, newer software based on advanced 'high-order' accurate numerical methods is required.\nAdditionally, this software must be able to achieve high-order accuracy on so-called 'unstructured grids' - used to mesh\ncomplex engineering geometries, and it must be able to make effective use of next-generation 'many-core' computing\nhardware (such as Nvidia Tesla GPUs, Intel Xeon Phi Co-Processors, and AMD FirePro GPUs), which will likely underpin\nfuture HPC platforms.\nAdvanced high-order Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods, combined with many-core accelerators, could provide a `gamechanging'\ntechnology capable of performing currently intractable unsteady turbulent flow simulations within the vicinity of\ncomplex engineering geometries. However, various technical issues still need to be addressed before the above technology can be used `in anger' to solve real-world flow problems, which often involve `sliding planes' (situations when\ntwo computational meshes slide across one another in a non-conforming fashion). The key objectives (of the academic\ncomponent) of the proposal are to develop a treatment for sliding planes that works effectively with FR methods on manycore\naccelerators, and demonstrate the performance of FR methods on many-core accelerators for a range of industry led\ntest cases proposed by the financial (CFMS and Zenotech) and non-financial (Airbus, EADS, BAE, Rolls-Royce, ARA, UK\nAerodynamics Centre) project partners.\nThe academic component of the proposal will be lead by Dr. Peter Vincent (a Lecturer in the department of Aeronautics at\nImperial College London), and will build upon current work funded by 3 x EPSRC DTAs, 1 x Airbus/EPSRC iCASE DTA,\nand an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship (EP/K027379/1).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M50676X/1","grantId":"EP/M50676X/1","fundValue":"191981","fundStart":"2014-09-15","fundEnd":"2016-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Edward Vincent","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
