These rather perplexing symptoms can be viewed as arising from problems in a) assimilating information from normal sensory processes and b) decision making. How do we normally make sense of the world around us? It is clear that we combine evidence from our senses, e.g vision and hearing, and incorporate that with our previous experience to make a decision about the likely cause of any perception. It is possible to model the perceptual and decision making process by using statistical models based on Bayes Theorem; this allows one to weight different aspects of the perceptual experience and prior expectation to predict the ?normal? probability of making a certain decision. I propose to examine the decision making procedure in normal healthy people and create a statistical model of that process during controlled experiments ? using neuroimaging to see how this model is instantiated in the brain. I will then examine the same decision making procedures in schizophrenia and clarify not only, how their decision making is different; but also the underlying differences in brain function. Furthermore, I will examine this model under the impact of both antipsychotic medication and drugs with the opposite effect on the dopaminergic system; and how it alters when symptoms have been successfully treated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901868","grantId":"G0901868","fundValue":"494009","fundStart":"2010-10-18","fundEnd":"2014-06-17","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sukhi S.
