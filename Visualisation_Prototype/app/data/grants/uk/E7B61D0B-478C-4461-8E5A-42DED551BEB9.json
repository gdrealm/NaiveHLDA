{"id":"E7B61D0B-478C-4461-8E5A-42DED551BEB9","title":"AEDUS2: Adaptable Environments for Distributed Ubiquitous Systems","abstractText":"This is request for renewal for a further 5 years for a Platform Grant to support personnel and travel for the Distributed Software Engineering Group within the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. This is a world-renowned group which combines practical work on building tools for design and implementation of adaptive ubiquitous and distributed systems and networks with more formal software engineering approaches to behaviour modelling, requirements specification and analysis, language semantics and type systems for distributed programming. This proposal will provide support for cohesion and continuity of funding for a number of experienced researchers as well as permitting short-term evaluation of new ideas and experiments. Projects will focus on a sound Software Engineering approach to adaptive software environments for autonomic systems, policy-based trust, privacy and security, as well as requirements engineering for ubiquitous systems. The proposal will also fund an experienced researcher to provide overall project management and help coordinate the effort required for packaging and maintaining experimental software to make it more accessible to external academic and industrial users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025188/1","grantId":"EP/E025188/1","fundValue":"1107870","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  There were no specific deliverables or direct impact.
