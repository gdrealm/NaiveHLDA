Our project is unique in the sense that we will identify regulatory interactions underlying stress response and lifespan using a combination of natural genetic variation in gene transcription profiles, identification of regulatory and regulated genes and intensive computational modelling. The resulting networks will then be tested and refined using iterative perturbation experiments. In this way the new data will generate new, stronger network models to define genes for perturbation analysis, which in turn will furnish new data for modelling using new computational tools, and so on. The novelty and the strength of our approach is also based on simultaneous use of a variety of new methods for statistical analysis of networks, including those for network matching to be developed by the members of our team. To date, systems biology has not taken advantage of natural genetic variation in predicting the regulatory interactions underpinning important biomedical phenotypes. By combining the most powerful experimental and computational methods with the simplest model animal system, our project will significantly advance both our understanding of a complex regulatory system with direct relevance to human health and in the advancement of methodology that can be applied to other systems. Molecular and quantitative geneticists within this EU-wide group will work together with modellers to connect the dots from genome to phenotype, and on to predictive uses in biomedicine and healthcare.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I004815/1","grantId":"BB/I004815/1","fundValue":"409122","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Robert Cossins","coPersons":["Olga  Vasieva"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" This ERASysBio+ programme was initiated and led from the PI in Liverpool, combining with 4 other groups across the EU. This programme has been successful in reaching its objectives. We have devised new mathematical approaches to modelling network structures, we have used nextgen sequencing to give whole genopme sequences for ~150 C. elegans recombinant inbred lines, and used these to identify thousands of eQTLs. We have devised procedures for prioritising eQTLs for specific phenotypes including longevity, resulting in identification of novel key regulatory genes that have been shown to control lifespan in animals subjected to stress pretreatment. We verify the eQTL approach based on intensive network modelling, and iteration thereafter. Paper in submission with Science. This was a proof of principle exploration grant, which was successful. It needs wider application to generate sufficient new targets for exploration within a healthcare context. Of particular note is the fact that we have defined the first longevity regulatory gene whose effectiveness is influenced by natural genetic variation in wild stocks. Previous work was based on targeted mutation. This indicates that there are natural variants which can indicate novel targets in a number of healthcare-relevant phenotypes, but this is not near market! Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
