{"id":"FC5741BB-DCE7-4EB2-A580-51428B9A2323","title":"The Archaeology of Early Medieval Commemoration","abstractText":"This project explores the archaeology of commemoration in the early Middle Ages (c.400-1100 AD) focusing upon Britain and neighbouring regions. During this period of rapid and successive socio-economic, political and religious changes between the end of the Western Roman Empire and the later Middle Ages, research has identified a diverse range of commemorative practices that drew upon material culture as a vehicle for creating the identities of individuals, communities and kingdoms.\\n\\nIt was in this period that medieval (and hence also modern) strategies for commemoration came into being through a selective process of adapting and reinventing practices from the ancient world mixed with a variety of new influences. These includes traditions from the Celtic and Germanic worlds and innovative and diverse adaptations of Christian world-views to different social and political contexts. In this light, the study will provide the theoretical and methodological underpinnings for new understandings of the societies and social changes in this period of transition is understood. It will be argued that commemoration through material culture was pivotal to how early medieval people perceived their world and their past.\\n\\nThe outcome of this study will be a book published by Oxford University Press.\\n\\nChapter 1 / Introduction / Social Memory &amp; Early Medieval Monumentality\\nThis introduction outlines the argument and focus of the project, arguing that early medieval monuments must be regarded as technologies of commemoration.\\n\\nPART 1 / COMMEMORATION &amp; MATERIAL CULTURE IN EARLY MEDIEVAL SOCIETIES\\nChapter 2 / All the Small Things\\nThis chapter considers 'monuments in miniature': portable artefacts that had commemorative qualities in early medieval societies (Williams 2003a).\\n\\nChapter 3 / Monuments and the Dead\\n This chapter explores the commemorative significance of graves and burial mounds in early medieval commemorative practices.\\n\\nChapter 4 / Living in the Past\\nThe chapter considers the theme of social memory in relation to early medieval settlement archaeology. This will involve a discussion of the role of hall location &amp; architecture in patterns of social commemoration, as well as the practices conducted within them.\\n\\nPART 2 / MEMORIES IN STONE\\nChapter 5 / Architectural Memories\\nThe chapter explores the design and impact of sacred architectural space in the commemoration, specifically in relation to the cult of saints and the commemoration of the dead.\\n\\nChapter 6 / Texts &amp; Stones \\nFocusing on the monumental character of texts - both manuscripts and monumental inscriptions / in early medieval societies, the chapter considers the contrasting uses of ogham, latin and runic scripts in relation to their material contexts.\\n\\nChapter 7 / Words &amp; Pictures\\nThis chapter broadens the discussion of the mnemonic qualities of sculpted and decorated monuments by addressing the use of images in isolation and alongside texts.\\n\\nChapter 8 / Memories in the Abstract\\nThis chapter will consider the use of abstract ornamentation to commemorate upon early medieval monuments in relation to art-historical and anthropological theories of symbol and style.\\n\\nChapter 9 / Tombs &amp; Shrines\\nThis chapter considers the mnemonic significance of grave-slabs, gravestones, sarcophagi and tomb-shrines.\\n\\nChapter 10 - Conclusion\\nHaving explored a sequence of themes the conclusion will chart the evolving nature of commemoration in the period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004504/1","grantId":"AH/E004504/1","fundValue":"23461","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Howard Morgan Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
