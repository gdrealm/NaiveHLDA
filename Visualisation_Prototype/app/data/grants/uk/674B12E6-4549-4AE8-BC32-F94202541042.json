{"id":"674B12E6-4549-4AE8-BC32-F94202541042","title":"Teacher Agency and Curriculum Change","abstractText":"<p>A recent tendency in much curriculum policy is to position teachers as agents of change and professional developers of curriculum. Yet existing change theory and curriculum change policy tend to underplay and misconstrue the ways in which teachers mediate policy to fit local contexts, exercising agency that is both enabled and constrained by the contexts in which they work. Taking as its starting point an ecological view of agency, the proposed project will undertake interpretive, ethnographic research in schools to explore teacher agency in the context of a major national curriculum reform, Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence.</p>\n\n<p>The project has two key aims: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to trial a set of methodologies for identifying the factors that impact upon teacher agency \n</li>\n <li>to develop an understanding of key factors that impact upon such agency in contexts of educational change. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The research will be guided by the social theory of Margaret Archer. The project will construct four case studies, each comprising a single experienced and innovative teacher. Two teachers will be situated in a primary school and two in a secondary school within a single Scottish Education Authority (EA). Research methods will include observations, interviews, reflective journals and event mapping.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4208","grantId":"RES-000-22-4208","fundValue":"79094","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Priestley","coPersons":["Gert  Biesta"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
