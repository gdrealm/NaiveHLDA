In Northern Ireland, the law is still as it was in Britain before the 1967 Act. But Northern Irish women still have abortions; if they can afford it, they travel to England and pay privately for a legal abortion. But every year, hundreds of women who cannot afford to go to England buy pills over the internet to cause a miscarriage - what is known as a &quot;medical abortion&quot;. These are the same pills that are used in about half the NHS abortions in Britain. This study will talk to women in Northern Ireland who have a medical abortion illegally, and women in Scotland who have it legally through the NHS. \n\nThe study will find out, through being part of the NI Life and Times Survey, about what public opinion really is on abortion in Northern Ireland, including whether they think women ought to be threatened with prison for taking pills which are available on the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales. We will look at where the &quot;social harm&quot; occurs because of these illegal abortions. Is the social harm caused by the women taking the pills or is it caused by the state that won't allow her to do it legally? As part of the research, a sexual health expert will look at the women's experiences and see what kind of aftercare, advice about contraception etc that the Northern Irish women get, compared with the women in Scotland who got the pills from the NHS. \n\nThe questions we hope the study will answer are:\n\nWhat are the different experiences of women taking the abortion pill legally on the NHS (in Scotland) and illegally via the internet (in Northern Ireland)?\nWhat impact does the illegal nature of such abortions in Northern Ireland have on the sexual and emotional health of the women concerned?\nWhat do these different experiences tell us about the 'social harm' surrounding the UK's abortion laws?\nWhat is the true state of social attitudes in Northern Ireland in relation to abortion?\nWhat would decriminalisation mean for women (and abortion providers) in Northern Ireland and Britain?\n\nIt can be risky to do research on issues touching on illegality and the issue of abortion is a particularly controversial one but the research team has thought about how it will protect the women who have acted illegally, as well as our research.\n\nThe study hopes to cast new light on existing policy around abortion in the UK, especially Northern Ireland. It will seek to give policy makers new information on which to base their policies, and evidence which might open a debate about whether the UK, like Canada, should have no criminal laws associated with abortion. \n \nThe project team will produce more than just a final report. We will write policy briefs aimed at policy makers, the medical profession and women's and voluntary groups at local and national level. We will also send information about what we learn to the United Nations committee that oversees women's rights. Some of the summaries we write will be aimed at the general public and we will present papers at conferences and seminars, and any events to which we are invited.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N007409/1","grantId":"ES/N007409/1","fundValue":"199849","fundStart":"2016-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Goretti  Horgan","coPersons":["Linda  Moore","Ann Marie  Gray"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
