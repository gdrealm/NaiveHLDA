More than 635 different anthocyanins have been identified, distinguished by methylation, glycosylation and acylation with both aliphatic and aromatic groups. There is mounting evidence that consumption of anthocyanin-rich food promotes health, supported by many recent studies of anthocyanin-rich fruits such as blueberry, bilberry and cranberry. \nTheir relative abundance in the diet and their potency against a range of chronic diseases have made anthocyanins the subject of intense research in experimental and preventive medicine and, more recently for formulating natural colours. However, the limited range of anthocyanins commercially available and the expense of pure preparations mean that most research is done with crude extracts of plants which are not standardised with respect to the particular anthocyanins they contain, nor the amounts of each anthocyanin in the extract. Variations in anthocyanin decoration account for differences in colour stability and hue of anthocyanins and underpin the need for developing production systems for pure anthocyanins for investigating the effects of chemical specificity on uptake, signalling and physiology, toxicity of anthocyanins for medical applications and for developing new formulations in the natural colours industries. \n\nIn ANTHOPLUS novel plant cell cultures will be developed for the stable production of a wide variety of anthocyanins. The novel procedure for generating these cultures means that they are not constrained by prior art. Our cell cultures, uniquely, allow sustained, high level production of diverse anthocyanins. Enhanced supplies of pure anthocyanins will be highly valuable for the colourants industry to investigate the effects of decorations, co-pigments, pH on colour and stability to provide a robust scientific foundation for developing new plant sources of natural colourants and new formulations for natural colours.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M004864/1","grantId":"BB/M004864/1","fundValue":"404331","fundStart":"2014-05-06","fundEnd":"2017-05-05","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Cathie  Martin","coPersons":["Anthony  Miller"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" Not applicable at this time Not applicable at this time Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
