This infrastructure supported a large number of grants and several studentships in Leeds and helped the University to maintain its international competitiveness. An example of how findings might be taken forward is provided by the work of Prof Urwin. Microarray analysis provided important insights into the global changes in gene expression following nematode infection. Expression patterns of genes that have roles in the interaction between M. incognita and Arabidopsis were analysed during the parasitic process. This work provided a platform to discern those gene responses that are primary causative events in the formation and particularly the maintenance of nematode feeding sites.
