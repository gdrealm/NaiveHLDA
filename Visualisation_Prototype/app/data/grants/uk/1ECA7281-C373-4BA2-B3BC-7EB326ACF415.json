{"id":"1ECA7281-C373-4BA2-B3BC-7EB326ACF415","title":"Using reference-assisted chromosome assemblies to study chromosome structures and evolution in vertebrates","abstractText":"Genomes contain genes that encode proteins that build organisms. In the course of evolution genomes change and these changes affect genes by changing the time when proteins are formed or even leading to formation of new genes or death of old genes. These events together form one of the sources of variations used by the natural selection to form new species or for species adaptation to the environment. Complete sequencing of a genome refers to the identification of the sequence of nucleotides along chromosomes. To understand what mechanisms drive changes in chromosome structures in different species and how this affects formation of new species or an adaptation of existing species to changing environment we will reconstruct complete chromosome structures of newly sequenced species using an novel algorithm called &quot;reference-assisted chromosome assembly&quot; or RACA. This algorithm compares sequenced parts of one organism' genome to existing complete chromosome assembly of another and reconstructs chromosomes of their putative common ancestor. Then it uses parts of the newly sequenced genome and searches for the differences between the ancestral organization of chromosomes and the organization proposed by parts of chromosomes that are generated for the organism. At the final step it organizes parts or ancestral chromosomes according to the order proposed by sequence scaffolds. In the research proposed in this proposal we will develop several algorithms to verify these reconstructions by looking at the specific features of chromosomes like &quot;telomeres&quot; - chromosome ends and &quot;centromeres&quot; - important for cell division. These structures contain specific sequence features that could be reconstructed from the sequence data produced during sequencing projects. By detecting positions of these features in the reconstructed chromosomes we will be able to check how close the structure of reconstructed chromosomes is to real chromosomes in the species of interest. If there are issues, we will adapt the RACA algorithm to improve the assembly. \nIn the next step we will use RACA-generated chromosomes to investigate mechanisms driving chromosomal changes at the DNA level. We will check if the distribution of chromosome parts that are not rearranged in all genomes included in our analysis can be explained by the random breakage of chromosomes in evolution, or if there is a selection against chromosomal rearrangements in some parts of a vertebrate genome. If we analyze a large set of species we might be able to find &quot;built blocks&quot; of mammalian, amniote, or vertebrate genomes that cannot be rearranged without a lethal effect for the organism. \nEvolutionary breakpoint regions are regions of chromosomes where chromosomes were broken and then rejoined in a different combinations or orientation in evolution. We will use multiple RACA genomes to investigate what features of the genomes are driving these events. An important question to answer is &quot;which genes would more likely be affected by these evolutionary events?&quot; Previously we demonstrated that the evolutionary breakpoint regions are enriched for the genes that are associated with the lineage-specific features. In this project we will perform bioinformatics analysis of these intervals in an attempt to classify lineage-specific changes that happened in ancestral genomes of some lineages leading to the formation of their specific traits chosen by natural selection, e.g., formation of the rumen in ruminant species. Our hypothesis is that the changes in ancestral genomes of the livestock species will be connected to those features of the species that made them attractive source of proteins for humans. Therefore, detection of these ancestral changes is an important step for improving genetics of these species as it will identify best gene and other targets for future artificial selection and breed improvement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J010170/1","grantId":"BB/J010170/1","fundValue":"245390","fundStart":"2012-09-06","fundEnd":"2013-08-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We expect that the major economical and societal impact of this ongoing grant (we are at the beginning of year 3) will be associated with the final part we are working on right now (ruminant genome evolution and detection of genomic sequences that contribute to the formation of rumen and economically important traits in cattle and sheep). However, we had a chance to produce some societal impact through public media (interview given by D. Larkin to BBC online about the blind mole rat genome) and producing tools (Evolution Highway databases) that are used for teaching at the university level at Aberystwyth University, in Brasil, and the USA. We also contributed a chapter to the main textbook on cattle genomics widely used for student education in many countries (see publications). Education ","person":"Denis  Larkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":" During the course of this project we tuned and applied our reference assisted chromosome assembly algorithm (RACA) to several mammalian genomes. We successfully ran RACA on scaffold genome assemblies of Tibetan antelope, yak, blind mole rat, giraffe, gemsbok, and Indian Muntjac. Therefore we already exceeded the minimum number of species (5) which we suggested in the original proposal. RACA-assisted assemblies of yak and giraffe have been verified using centromeric sequences generated by the RepeatNet algorithm as it was initially proposed in our grant application. We found that this algorithm can also be used to predict telomeric scaffolds and are working on implementing that part of our pipeline. \nThe blind mole rat RACA genome assembly was used to identify that blind mole rat has highly conserved chromosome structure compared to other rodents. This could be directly related to high resistance to cancer found in this species (the blind mole rat genome paper was published in Nature Communication. D. Larkin is one of primary authors, Marta Farre - a postdoc funded by this award is a contributing author). Blind mole rat Evolution Highway website containing the results of our chromosome reconstructions is publicly available: http://evolutionhighway.ncsa.uiuc.edu/spalax/. We continue working on the identification of centromeric scaffolds in the mole rat as part of ongoing collaboration with Prof. Nevo (University of Haifa). \nRACA genome assemblies of other genomes (yak, tibetan antelope, giraffe, gemsbok, and Indian Muntjac) were visualized on the internal version of Evolution Highway website for use within our group and by our collaborators on the ruminant genome project (Prof. Harris Lewin, University of California, Davis and Jian Ma, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana; BGI). \nBecause we contributed to sequencing of a large number of ruminant genomes (giraffe, gemsbok, Indian Muntjac) focus on the evolutionary analysis of ruminant chromosomes in order to answer questions related to how changes in ancestral genomes led to formation of economically important traits or organs (e.g., rumen as it was initially proposed). Larkin's group is leading the ruminant genome analysis as part of the Genome 10K initiative. Therefore we also built a local version of the UCSC genome browser focusing on ruminant genome data. We specifically looked for conserved non-coding elements and structure of chromosomes that could be analysed due to the availability of RACA predictions of our genomes generated using funds from this grant. We found that a significant fraction of conserved non-coding elements were formed in the ancestral ruminant genome due to insertions of ruminant-specific transposable elements. We detected genes in/near ruminant-specific chromosome rearrangements, expanded gene families and genes under selection. We plan to make the local version of the database publicly available or will transfer the data to the UCSC Genome Browser website close to publication.\nOverall, first two years of this project we very successful. We were able to achieve the goals stated in the original proposal, contribute as invited speakers to at least 5 conferences, be interviewed by BBC, publish 1 paper, have 1 book chapter in press. We also have a paper in press in Science about the bird genome evolution. We have 3 more papers resulting from this project submitted or under review. Dr. Farr? obtained training at EBI. Results of our research could be and will be used in several ways:\n-Stable chromosome structure in blind mole rat will be studied further to understand how this stability affects regulation of genes that control apoptosis and necrosis and therefore contribute to high cancer resistance in blind mole rat (not a single case of cancer was reported in 30 years of study). The fact that our results are available as a public database facilitates their use by other groups.\n-Our improved reference assisted chromosome assembly algorithm is already used by the group of Prof. Steve O'Brien to predict chromosome structures and improve genome assemblies in large cats (see information about the visitor we had from this group last year)\n-Results of ruminant comparative project will be used in several ways: a) conserved non-coding elements will be used to select and annotate mutations that are parts of cattle and sheep genotyping arrays and are located within evolutionary conserved sequences (collaboration with Prof Jerry Taylor and Sheep Genome Consortium); b) to identify candidate genes that contributed to the formation of rumen and therefore should be focused during the rumen and breed efficiency improvement efforts.
