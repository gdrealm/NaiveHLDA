This will continue and a 1000-fold increase by 2020 has been forecasted. Future wireless communications promise to provide the required data rate by an utilisation of the increasing spectrum.\n\nMulticarrier Modulation (MCM) techniques have found application in the majority of modern wireless communication systems, due to strong inherent immunity to multipath fading, which allows for a significant increase in the data rate. MCM effectively transforms a frequency selective fading channel into parallel flat fading channels which immensely simplifies the data recovery process at the receiver. However, these benefits come at the cost of a loss of energy efficiency due to the distribution of finite power to multicarrier signals, an increased sensitivity to frequency offset and Doppler shift as well as transmission nonlinearity caused by the non-constant power ratio of MCM signals. Such drawbacks of MCM challenges its direct application to 5G systems that request a 1000-fold increase in the data rate (e.g., 100 gigabits per second), compared to 4G system that has its ideal peak rate of 100 megabits per second. \n\nAdditionally, the limited power availability at the mobile client coupled with these transmission rate demands present challenges which can be solved by increasing bandwidth over shorter ranges; about 250 times larger than today 4G is considered in 5G. Due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels, training sequences need to be transmitted periodically for the purpose of channel estimation. The overload imposed by training sequences for channel estimation of such a large bandwidth can be significant, especially for power-limited device applications. Power-limited transmission and large spectrum modulation challenges must be simultaneously tackled.\n\nThis project introduces a simple and low-cost mapping method for index keying based multicarrier systems in dispersive channels. The key concept involves a special index mapping function named MCIK (multicarrier index keying). At every transmission, only a few random sub-carriers are active for high energy-efficiency and, simultaneously, index of the active/inactive sub-carriers helps inherently to transmit extra information bits with no extra power. This MCIK concept is promising to effectively transmit big data volumes at low-power, especially on the large bandwidth and realistic dispersive channels. Our goal is to provide theoretical references and guidelines for a successful MCIK implementation that can produce significant advance; our preliminary results show 50% power savings and a potential rate of tens of gigabits per second over classical multicarrier transmission. MCIK is suitable for a power limited system modulating a large number of multicarrier. It provides a mechanism for attaining both diversity and multiplexing so that the energy efficiency and the spectral efficiency are increased. We also propose to design a linearly processed MCIK system to facilitate a low-cost data recovery process, resulting in higher spectral efficient multicarrier system. In order to effectively overcome carrier frequency offset and multiuser interference problems in the current orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) transmissions, we propose a new multiple access technique which can allow the practical performance limits and needs for the desired performance to be easily obtained and show how MCIK features should be combined with multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems. \n\nOur emphasis in this work will be on the study of special properties of 'index keying' process in MCIK which have been overlooked by others. We aim to leverage these properties in the context of multicarrier index modulation, detection and estimation, and multiple access design. This is to attain optimal performance with affordable computational complexity, for future wireless communications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M015521/1","grantId":"EP/M015521/1","fundValue":"92911","fundStart":"2015-06-29","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Youngwook  Ko","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
