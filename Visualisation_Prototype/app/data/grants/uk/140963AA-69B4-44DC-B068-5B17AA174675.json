More than 10000 compounds enter the preclinical drug discovery and development pipeline of large pharmaceutical companies per annum. The task of these preclinical stages, which rely heavily on animal experimentation, is to predict desired and adverse effects in man. This importantly before investigational new drugs are given to humans in the clinical stages. Thus the life of many animals and of humans is decided in these pre-clinical stages. Animal-derived in vitro tests have been developed to meet commercial pressures and to implement the 3Rs. One of these tests, termed mouse embryonal stem cell toxicity test (mEST) is able to identify compounds that lead to fetal malformations and other toxicities. However, the mEST is only moderately reliable, thus hampering its acceptance by industry and simultaneously the implementation of the 3Rs. Here we will enhance the predictive power of this platform by its ?humanisation?. This will be achieved by employing human umbilical cord stems cells (not human embryonal stem cells) and at the same time by introducing human drug metabolism into these systems. It is anticipated that these novel platforms will reduce the number of animal experimentation, while at the same time improving drug safety.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700611/1","grantId":"G0700611/1","fundValue":"323614","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Roland  Wolf","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
