{"id":"E012EFFC-9602-44D1-B83E-1E3229ADA158","title":"MicroBooNE","abstractText":"The MicroBooNE experiment is a new type of neutrino detector that will operate at Fermilab (near Chicago) from 2015. It consists of a large volume (about the size of a double-decker bus) filled with liquid argon at -189 degrees Celsius. An intense beam of neutrinos is fired 470 m towards the detector from the Fermilab accelerator complex. Neutrinos are &quot;ghost particles&quot; that barely interact with matter and most will simply pass through the MicroBooNE detector and Earth's crust. However, the beam is sufficiently intense that a few 100,000 will interact in the detector in approximately three years. The MicroBooNE liquid argon technology enables the interactions to be photographed in three dimensions with sub-mm precision. This proposal focusses on the development of advanced reconstruction software to turn the recorded MicroBooNE data into three-dimensional images of the particles produced in the neutrino interactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004007/1","grantId":"ST/M004007/1","fundValue":"144581","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Andrew Thomson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
