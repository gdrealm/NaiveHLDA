{"id":"EB4EE8E0-91E3-4E9E-9EFB-65815EE163FD","title":"Studies in 'The Ironic End of Art'","abstractText":"Much art and literature of the present day provokes charges of nihilism and emptiness. Indeed, a number of contemporary art historians and critics have proclaimed 'the end of art'. My project, a series of three linked articles, will explore the contemporary conditions of aesthetic theory and literary practice in the light of this claim.\n\nIts key focus is the pervasive practice of irony in contemporary art. Suspicion of aesthetic irony has its roots in Hegel, who charged it with undermining universal meanings and values. Hegel's antagonist Schlegel, in contrast, celebrated irony's capacity to dissolve given perceptions of the world.\n\nMy project situates contemporary theories and practices of art in the context of this controversy, which continues to play itself out in today's debates on the function of the aesthetic. I intend to explore how and why certain forms of contemporary art and literature refuse the appeal to common understanding, subjecting their audience to an experience of 'infinite' irony. Drawing on Continental philosophy and psychoanalysis, I will read this mode of irony as at once destructive and creative, a means of both annihilating and generating meanings.\n\nIn my studies of aesthetic theory and of two contemporary American writers, Lydia Davis and Donald Barthelme, I will argue that, in contrast to the 'knowing' irony described by theorists of postmodernism such as Linda Hutcheon, post&shy; Schlegelian irony involves a resolute unknowingness, what Paul de Man calls 'a language of stupidity...error...and madness.' This mode of irony, I suggest, serves as kind of perpetual refusal of the Hegel will to universal comprehension, a means of maintaining the radical openness and completeness of any and every artwork.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505511/1","grantId":"AH/E505511/1","fundValue":"20341","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Josh  Cohen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
