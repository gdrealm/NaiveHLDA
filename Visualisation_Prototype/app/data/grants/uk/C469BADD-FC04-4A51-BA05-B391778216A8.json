The RedPharm Study","abstractText":"Nicotine assisted reduction to stop means treating smokers who do not want to stop smoking but are prepared to reduce smoking with nicotine replacement therapy. Trials in highly controlled circumstances showed this increased smoking cessation, but there are doubts about whether this can be implemented in health systems. We propose a trial to examine whether pharmacists who provide stop smoking services can integrate a reduction service into their practice and develop methods for use in a subsequent trial. This subsequent trial will investigate whether behavioural support is more effective than no support and whether shorter reduction programmes are more effective.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802135","grantId":"G0802135","fundValue":"301216","fundStart":"2010-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-07-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Aveyard","coPersons":["Jean-Francois  Etter","David  Weller","Timothy John  Coleman","Rachel Helen  Bridson","Susan  MacAskill"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
