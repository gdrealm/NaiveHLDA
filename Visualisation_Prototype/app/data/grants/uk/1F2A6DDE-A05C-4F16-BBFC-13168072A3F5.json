{"id":"1F2A6DDE-A05C-4F16-BBFC-13168072A3F5","title":"Roadmap to XEUS","abstractText":"XEUS addresses fundamental questions on the nature of the Universe, its large-scale structure, and the physics of extreme environments. The mission concept embodies advanced technologies for spacecraft, optics, and detectors leading to unprecedented observational capabilities at X-ray wavelengths. This 'Roadmap to XEUS' application describes a development programme that will place UK researchers and industry in a strong position to participate actively in all phases of the mission. It is being made by a consortium of university research groups from the University of Leicester, Brunel University, Birmingham University and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory of University College London, together with industrial partners EADS Astrium (UK), e2v Technologies (UK) and Space Cryomagnetic. The XEUS concept envisages an X-ray observatory at the L2 Lagrangian Point (at about 1.5 million km from Earth), comprising separate mirror and detector spacecraft. This configuration, coupled with recent major advances in light-weight X-ray mirror design, will provide 5 m2 of collecting area / 10 to 30 times more than XMM-Newton (currently the largest X-ray observatory to be launched) / feeding a set of state-of-the-art X-ray detectors and spectrometers. The resulting very high sensitivity, combined with excellent imaging and spectral capabilities, will, for the first time, bring the power of X-ray diagnostics to bear on studies of the hot, high red-shift Universe, as well as on the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions. With unprecedented sensitivity to the hot, million-degree Universe, XEUS will provide the long-sought answers to key questions in contemporary astrophysics: - How did supermassive black holes form and grow? - How did feedback from these black holes influence galaxy growth? - How did large scale structure evolve? - How did the baryonic component of this structure become chemically enriched? - How does gravity behave in the strong field limit? - What is the equation of state of nuclear matter in Neutron stars? XEUS address two of the four main questions posed in Cosmic Vision, namely: What are the fundamental laws of the Universe? and, How did the Universe originate, and what is it made of? XEUS has now been proposed to the ESA Cosmic Vision programme for the first L-class launch in 2018. XEUS also has very strong international support: the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is a partner in the Cosmic Vision proposal and both Russia and China have expressed strong interest in taking on a significant role in XEUS. Informal discussions are also taking place with NASA, with a view to US participation. XEUS carries forward the key scientific achievements of XMM-Newton by exploiting major emerging technical advances. This application seeks funding for a programme of technology development that will place UK research teams and UK industry in a strong position in XEUS. This application encompasses four areas of activity within the UK. In X-ray optics the goal is to support a programme of design, modelling and testing of the new silicon micro-pore optics technology, which could give the UK Principal Investigator status in this core XEUS programme. Detector development programmes are proposed encompassing the extended wide-field imager and the cryogenic narrow-field instrument, both of which are key elements of the XEUS focal plane instrumentation suite. The proposal also seeks support for the continuing development of adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerators as the milli-Kelvin flight cooler for XEUS. Involvement of UK industry has been secured in all of these areas and indeed will be critically important for the success of the programme. The key objective of the proposed programme is to establish a strong UK position in XEUS, including technological leadership in one or more areas of the XEUS payload complement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F006632/1","grantId":"ST/F006632/1","fundValue":"455620","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Willingale","coPersons":["George  Fraser","Richard Malick Ambrosi","Martin John Turner","Michael Geoffrey Watson","John P.
