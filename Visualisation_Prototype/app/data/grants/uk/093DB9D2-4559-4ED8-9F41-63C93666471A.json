Let's find out how far you are.","abstractText":"This project is to practically allow primary pupils to have a better understanding of research into supernovae and how to measure extremely large distances which is carried out in the Astronomy Group at the University of Southampton.\n\nOne of the drivers behind this project is to explore the ideas of scientific models. Scientific models are used widely in Space Science to explain evidence collected. The project uses models in a practical way to develop better understanding of things which are often difficult to comprehend like the solar system, moon phases, positions of stars and galaxies in the universe. Pupils at the end of primary are generally just beginning to understand the use of scientific models and find them helpful. It has a simple focus on what each model is and isn't showing us.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002024/1","grantId":"ST/N002024/1","fundValue":"9948","fundStart":"2015-09-21","fundEnd":"2016-06-20","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Anne Langford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Sphere Science Ltd","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
