This causes great difficulties in schools, and speech and language units; some children get unnecessary treatment while others do not get the services they need.</p> \n<p>This study will measure how children with EAL understand words and sentences using a series of novel experiments. This can reveal how well they comprehend sentences as they unfold and why they sometimes fail to understand the sentences they hear. In addition, it will assess non-impaired and impaired EAL children with a large battery of assessments in order to identify which tests can best differentiate the two groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001343/1","grantId":"ES/E001343/1","fundValue":"321916","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of the study have informed speech and language therapists and teachers in the UK and beyond about the importance of using language assessments in both the first and second language of sequential bilingual children.

The majority of these children have typical language development, but at least during the early school years their language comprehension and expression in English often falls behind those of their age peers who have English from birth. A subgroup of children with English as L2 have specific language impairment (SLI), and show atypical language development in both their L2 and L1. These children need language intervention to ameliorate negative long-term effects and reach their educational and vocational potential.\n \nWhereas there is an extensive research in adult second language acquisition, fewer studies have focused on child L2 acquisition and only recently have studies emerged comparing language abilities of L2 children with children with SLI. Finally, no studies have investigated how L2 children process sentences using on-line methodology. \n\nThis project filled this vacuum by investigating language abilities of L2 English children with and without SLI in comparison to children with English as L1 and the way these groups of children process sentences in real-time. \n\nThe project demonstrated that there are important differences in the way typically developing sequential bilingual children process language compared to sequential bilingual children who have specific language impairment and also monolingual children with specific language impairment. The findings are important for speech and language therapists and teachers who have sequential bilingual children in their caseload/classroom, bilingual communities and families.
