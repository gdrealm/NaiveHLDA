Hence, we have chosen to present the proposed work in this light, using it as an effective platform to reach people and subsequently inform them about the proposed study on determinants of plant invasiveness. In other words, the text below could be a typical press release send out upon initiating the study. One of Britain's best known seabirds, the puffin, is being forced out of a number of Scottish seabird island colonies by an invading fast-growing alien plant species. Scientists have discovered that dense stands of tree mallow, growing up to 3 metres tall, are choking puffin breeding sites and have warned that the plant could soon start affecting other coastal breeding birds such as cormorant, eider duck, herring gull and fulmar. Tree mallow, Lavatera arborea, an Atlantic-Mediterranean plant native to coasts, is believed to have escaped into the wild in Scotland after being planted in coastal gardens. Whilst present in confined places for several hundreds of years, the plant has suddenly become invasive, taking over island ecosystems and thereby suppressing ground breeding birds and native vegetation. The reasons for this rapid expansion are milder winters and, ironically, an increase in the number of breeding seabirds who fertilise the soil and disturb the vegetation through burrowing and trampling. Manure-rich, bare patches in seabird colonies are now the places where tree mallow establishes and from which they gradually invade island ecosystems. The problem occurs not only in Scotland, but islands in Australia and New Zealand are also having their seabirds squeezed out as tree mallow takes over. Despite being a superior competitor in parts of its non-native range, tree mallow is not invasive in the southwest of the UK, where it survided the last ice age and lives among other plant species in harmony. This 'Dr. Jekyl-style' change in behaviour seems to occur in many plants, with only their invasive character shown when introduced to new environments. Understanding why plants can be invasive in one place whilst not in another has become essential. Once established, the negative effects of invasive plants on native plants and animals, and the associated costs of operations to control them, rise steeply, so a better strategy is to identify high risk species and take measures to prevent this from happening. However, we need to know where and how the problems are likely to arise so that these preventative measures can be targeted precisely. Rather than discussing problems from behind a desk, scientists from the University of Aberdeen propose to study both invasive and non-invasive ranges. Parallel experiments will be set up in Scotland and Cornwall in which conditions that seem to favour tree mallow are being mimicked: guano from birds will be added, and the vegetation disturbed just like seabirds do in their breeding colonies. Moreover, half of the sites will be protected from grazers such as rabbits and sheep as their appetite for the grazing-intolerant tree mallow seems also to play a critical role. In both places, the growth of tree mallow plants from Scotland and Cornwall will be compared to reveal whether Scottish plants are something special, or whether the conditions under which tree mallow grows determines whether or not it will actually turn invasive and cause biodiversity loss. Invasive plants are a major threat to global biodiversity, and their economic costs are estimated to be far in excess of $87 billion U.S. per year worldwide. We hope that our research on this single plant species will give us insights that help finding ways how best to limit further spread of invasives, to the benefit of our natural environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H012419/1","grantId":"NE/H012419/1","fundValue":"38705","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our finding that invasive behaviour of a plant species can be created through manipulation of an ecosystem (notably bare soil and high nutrient availability combined) is an understanding that has taken on board by the Craigleith management board in their management of tree mallow on Craigleith and Fidra, Firth of Forth, Scotland. This community based invasive species project had over 600 volunteers working on the two focal islands to cut tree mallow. The NERC findings inform them in the sense that disturbance to the plant-soil system is kept to a minimum to prevent the generation of yet more invasive plants.

Through integrating field survey and experimental approaches, we tested the following specific hypotheses: (i) Tree mallow is invasive throughout its UK range if facilitated by specific environ-mental factors; (ii) The conditions for high invasiveness (i.e. competitive suppression of extant vegetation) only arise under a unique regime combining low grazing, high disturbance and high soil fertility; (iii) Such a combination of conditions is more likely to be found in the invasive range than in the native range.\n To test hypotheses i and ii, a large-scaled field experiment was set up containing four treatments: 1- Seed provenance, collected in Scotlandâ€™s Firth of Forth (invasive population) or Cornwall (non-invasive); 2-Nutrient enrichment, with plots unfertilized or fertilized with 50 kg ha-1 N; 3-Disturbance, with plots undisturbed or disturbed by stripping the turf to remove competition; 4-Vertebrate grazing, with plots fenced to exclude rabbits or unfenced. This was set up at four sites (with four replicate blocks each) in both Cornwall and Firth of Forth. Three tree mallow seedlings surrounding a single core of Festuca rubra were planted in each 1mx1m cell in May 2010 and harvested six months later. \nThe experimental findings were surprisingly consistent across all sites: Although disturbance signify-cantly increased mallow biomass, N addition was by far the most influential factor. Nutrient enrichment and disturbance to the sward combined provided the best opportunities for tree mallow growth, enhancing this by more than an order of magnitude relative to control plants. It was under these conditions that the invasiveness of the species was most pronounced (i.e. suppression of Festuca rubra cores), thus providing strong support for our hypothesis that specific environmental factors can turn tree mallow invasive in both Scottish and Cornish locations. Rabbit grazing was remarkably low in both regions; only 2% of the experi-mental plants fell victim to grazing with notable the smaller plants from control and disturbance treatments being selected. That low grazing pressure remains precondition for tree mallow to survive, however, was put in sharp focus when every single plant was killed during a short period of exposure to goats in one of our eight replicate sites due to a, for us somewhat traumatic, breach in agreement with a local farmers.\nAlthough environmental manipulation (notably N enrichment) was clearly the strongest driver of tree mallow invasiveness, seed provenance played a role too: Plants of Scottish (invasive) provenance respon-ded stronger to N additions than those of Cornish (non-invasive) provenance. In Cornwall, where the plants generally grew better (in line with a warmer climate), average biomass (Oct 2010) in nutrient enriched, disturbed plots was 22.2 &plusmn; 2.3 (SE) g for plants of Cornish provenance, but 31.1 &plusmn; 3.4g for those of invasive Scottish provenance. Our decision to prolong the experiment util the following spring (with the intended aim to more fully test for grazing impacts) brought out sensitivity of this Atlantic-Mediterranean plant to severe winter conditions. Few plants survived the unusually harsh Scottish winter. In milder Cornwall, 38% of plants in control and disturbance treatments survived, but 67% in nutrient enrichment plots. Again, plants Scottish provenance stood out, with an impressive 75% getting through the winter. \nA survey of 22 tree mallow sites across the UK revealed that invasive populations were on soils much richer in nutrients, notably NO3-, with tree mallow cover being strongly and positively associated with both soil NO3- and PO43-. Where invasive, the vegetation was generally more disturbed (i.e. with competitor-free patches) and subject to low vertebrate grazing pressure. Conditions of low grazing, high disturbance and high nutrients were almost exclusively found on islands, and mostly outside the species natural range (SW UK) but not exclusively so. Unsurprisingly, more tree mallow seeds were found where it was invasive (18.0 &plusmn; 4.0 vs. 10.4 &plusmn; 3.7 g-1 litter). However, 91 &plusmn; 3% of these were found to be dead, compared to only 73 &plusmn; 6% in conditions where tree mallow was not invasive. Here, soil faunal abundance (of orders which potentially consume seeds) tended to be greatest (1.3 &plusmn; 0.4 vs. 2.1 &plusmn; 0.4 g AFDM-1), but only marginally significantly so. \nThus, although some differences in performance between plants from invasive and non-invasive populations were found, seedlings from both provenances could be turned invasive through manipulation of their environment in both Scotland and Cornwall. This has important implications on how to view plant invasiveness and approach management of this global environmental threat. Our findings highlight that disturbance of the natural environment may as much be a reason for plants from elsewhere to turn invasive, as might be their specific characteristics. Our findings highlight that disturbance of the natural environment may as much be a reason for plants from elsewhere to turn invasive, as might be their specific characteristics.\nThis has repercussions for the way management of ecosystems and invasive plant species therein is planned and carried out.
