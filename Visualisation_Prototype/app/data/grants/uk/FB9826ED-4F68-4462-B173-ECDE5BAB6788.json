Neurological disorders have a profound effect in the lives of many people that are either directly or indirectly affected by them. It is of particular interest that a variety of neurological disorders that affect for instance memory, cognition or learning abilities are now believed to have a neurodevelopmental component in their origin. Consequently, the more we understand what the molecules are that work together and maintain the proper functioning of the brain, the more we will be able to understand what goes wrong in neurological disorders. A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the different functions of the brain will in turn provide us with valuable tools and targets that can be subsequently used to improve the therapeutical methods used to treat these disorders. Unfortunately though, the cerebral cortex is a tissue that is only present in mammals. Thus, if we want to understand the molecular mechanisms that operate in the brain in order to multiply our tools in treating efficiently a wider range of patients we need to use a mammalian system to perform this research. Thus, the main objective of this project is the use of rodents to unravel the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of memory in mammals. Our efforts will focus in the intracellular components of this process. We have already isolated a gene whose function appears to regulate the reaction of neurons that regulate learning ability. What is interesting is that this gene can be used as a reference point and direct our research in identifying additional components that regulate learning abilities. Thus, our major aim is to analyse into detail this mechanism in an effort to understand how our brain 'learns'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000754/1","grantId":"BB/E000754/1","fundValue":"322009","fundStart":"2007-04-23","fundEnd":"2010-12-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Pavlos  Alifragis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
