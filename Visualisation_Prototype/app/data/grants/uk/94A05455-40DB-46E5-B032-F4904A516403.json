This town formed the focus of a study published in the late 1950s which subsequently became used to mark a mid-point in a synthesis of the how rural and urban communities might be seen to relate to, and differ from, each other. The town was portrayed as retaining considerable autonomy and independence, and has having a well-integrated community. However, the town has experienced considerable change since this study was conducted, become the location for Manchester over-spill and commuter housing developments, as well as experiencing de-industrialisation and a loss of retail and welfare services. It has been argued that towns such of Glossop that are located on the fringes of major cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, may have become settlements inhabited by people who either have little engagement with, or attachment to, their place of residence, or else have an 'elective sense' of belonging which is based primarily on comparisons with people and places elsewhere. The present project seeks to undertake historical and contemporary research within Glossop, both to explore whether the suspected changes to the town have actually occurred and to consider how the study of communities has itself changed over the period since the publication of the initial study of Glossop.\n\nThe project, which involves an interdisciplinary team of researchers drawn from the arts, humanities and social sciences, focuses particular attention of people's emotional and sensory engagement with ideas of community, both within present day Glossop and in the past. It also seeks to document the activity paths routinely enacted by people living within the town, in order to assess the degree to which they are embedded within the town or revolve around places well beyond its bounds. Attention is also drawn to the influence of the historical development of Glossop, which grew from a series of quite distinct settlements, and the topography and landscape settings of the settlement, both of which may be seen to have encouraged, or afforded, the development of a series of quite autonomous communities within the town.\n\nThe project will make use of developments in digital and Web 2.0 technologies to both examine and represent contemporary and past forms of community life within the town of Glossop, as well as involve members of the town in the generation and presentation of research findings. Methods used will include in-depth interviews, focus groups, oral histories, archival research and participatory art. The projects outputs will include an interactive website where people can add commentary to materials derived from the project, an interactive mapping system whereby people can explore what particular places in Glossop might mean to the residents of the town, a temporary exhibit of material from the project and heritage trails leaflets which will include QR (or quick-respinse) codes which will allow people to obtain information contained in the project's website and in other on-line locations.\n\nThe project is being undertaken in collaboration with a series of local groups and organisations, with residents in the town being invited to become involved as researchers in the project as well as participating through the provision of information and commentaries within questionnaires, interviews and focus groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J006920/1","grantId":"AH/J006920/1","fundValue":"79999","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-02-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As outlined in the Key Findings Section, this project developed the concept of 'iterative methodologies' which were most clearly demonstrated in the development of an interactive engagement game 'Glossopoly'.

This settlement was the focus on a study in the 1950s that is often cited as an illustration of a 'classic community study' as well as an incubator of a series of concepts of social change that were to come to prominence over later years, such as middle-class migration, professionalisation and cosmopolitanism. This project revealed how this earlier study was represented and received at the time it was conducted and explored how a range of new methods could be employed in the study of communities, including mobile interviewing, gps-tracking, participatory art and mapping, and psycho-social interviewing. Through such activities the project has sought to develop the concept of 'iterative methods'. These are methods that seek to deepen understanding through repeated engagements with the people, places and artefacts of research. Drawing on such methods, the the research explored how senses of community can continue to exist in places of high levels of daily and migrational mobility, highlighting the significance of emotion, connectivity and symbolic and material spatiality to the formation of relations and identities of community. It also revealed how these are of significance to contemporary policy concerns including the sale of public buildings, services and land; heritage conservation; placemaking; urban regeneration and civic engagement. One of the aims of this project was to develop collaborative research partnerships with community organisations in the area being studied. That this has been achieved is clearly evidenced by continuing work with High Peaks Community Arts and Glossop Heritage Trust beyond the end of this research project, not least through the development of further AHRC funded research and dissemination activities, including a project involving the creation of open access digital resources (Affective Digital Histories (AH/L008025/1)) and one focused around amplifying the legacies of this project's development of iterative methodologies (Evaluating the Legacy of Animative and Iterative Connected Communities Projects (AH/L013177/1). It is envisaged that these projects, alongside the continuing actions outlined under 'Engagement activities', will foster use of the project's methodologies by academics and also community groups, community development workers and community organisers. The creative engagement game 'Glossopoly' has attracted considerable interest, both in the UK and also abroad, with there having been one workshop already held with community groups in Athens and a further one planned in early December this year. It is the intention to develop this game into a package that can be readily adopted by community groups and also potentially employed by schools. The first of the above named follow-on AHRC projects also involves the creation of a 'building projection show', 'ipad app' and physical 'exhibition exhibits' that will draw upon the outputs of this research, engaging local residents, community groups and policy makers. A series of further outputs from this project will be forthcoming in the next few years, including a series of academic journal articles and book. These outputs will encompass the two themes of the project, namely how communities have changed and how the study of communities has changed.
