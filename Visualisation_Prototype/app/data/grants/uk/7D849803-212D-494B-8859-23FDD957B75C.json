Presently, we ignore any plasticity in such systems altogether, but this is potentially financially disastrous, overly conservative or, even worse, unsafe when considering how to best prolong the lifetime of existing RC structures. This proposal will deliver urgent structural-mechanics-based insight into how we might exploit redistribution of bending moments in FRP-strengthened continuous concrete structures such that our strengthening schemes are cost effective, safe and reliant on sound principles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K019015/1","grantId":"EP/K019015/1","fundValue":"316264","fundStart":"2013-05-09","fundEnd":"2016-05-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Ibell","coPersons":["Antony  Darby","Mark  Evernden"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":" We can rely on moment redistribution when using FRP to strengthen concrete structures.
