{"id":"A3DD76E4-B483-43A5-B520-2BFB28611E6D","title":"Cosmic Ray Tomography","abstractText":"The University of Bristol and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) aim to produce high resolution resistive plate chambers (HRP) for cosmic ray muon tomography. Cosmic ray muons can be used to non-invasively probe luggage and other containers. Muons are impossible to screen against and as no above-background radiation is introduced, it is impossible to booby-trap a device such that it explodes during examination. HRPCs are ideal to detect the muons as they are cheap and straight-forward to build, even for large areas and do not require an external trigger. This device can be used e.g. to screen containers and luggage and will be used in ports and airports.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H002561/1","grantId":"ST/H002561/1","fundValue":"119311","fundStart":"2009-11-17","fundEnd":"2010-11-16","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Cussans","coPersons":["Johannes  Velthuis"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
