It was born from an AHRC-funded study on ‘power in community’. The study found that community activists thought of power in terms of enabling, sharing and cooperating, but were often unable to exercise such power effectively for change. It posed the question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How can non dominating be effective without reproducing dominating power?’.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>During the feedback session to community participants, it was agreed that power and participation needed further study, but in a context which values, builds on and exchanges experiential and academic knowledges. Academics and activists co-designed&nbsp; Comm-Uni-ty as a year long pilot project to experiment with such a learning platform, where up to 30 community participants will interact with academics around individual and collective agendas for change. The co-constructed curriculum will be taylored to these agendas. Each participant will generate an ‘act of communication’ to receive their ‘CommHons’ degree, to be presented to wider community audiences and policy makers in a final event. In addition to enhancing community participation and understanding of power, the project experiments with new ways of connecting Universities with their communities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005537/1","grantId":"ES/K005537/1","fundValue":"49785","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our Impact Adviser recorded individual impacts which have potential to lead to wider societal engagement amongst Comm-Uni-ty participants: &quot;It's given me a lot of confidence, it's surprising and delightful to feel I do have the confidence to say what I want to say - I stood up and spoke at a national conference for the first time ever, I was incensed - it's about having the passion - you can do anything. The course said 'you can do lots of things, you can have an impact'&quot;; &quot;I spoke at the neighbourhood forum; a year ago I wouldn't have done it&quot; ;'Belonging' - understanding that we are not alone, that we are not outsiders, that we can be part of something collective&quot;. \n At our Final Event, we engaged with many national organisations involved in community organising. Varied approaches to connecting communities and building community capacity to impact on public affairs are being explored in the UK by political parties, trade unions and organisations such as Citizens UK. We linked up with these to share the role new approaches to knowledge production might play. Through our role as learning advisers to Locality's Community Organising Programme, and through a Keynote lecture to ARVAC (Association for Research in the Voluntary and Community Sector), we have fed through the experience of Comm-Uni-ty to the community sector, and will continue to do so. Our co-researcher from Salford (now Middlesex) continues to develop pathways to new forms of accredited learning, building on his collaboration with Comm-Uni-ty and we will work with him where possible. Thus, our main impacts on society are through the enhanced sense of confidence and protagonism amongst the participants in the Comm-Uni-ty collective, and through feeding in our experience of knowledge exchange to the emergent national approaches to community organising and change.

Over the course of a year, academics from Bradford University worked with local community activists in Bradford to develop a way of bringing academic and experiential knowledge together for mutual learning around acting in the community. For some, we found, this involves building a community garden and focussing on the very local or neighbourhood. For others, it is about big issues such as Palestine, inequality and power. A strong bond developed amongst participants, with genuine personal life changes. A Final Event brought community organising practitioners from all over the country and Comm-Uni-ty participants together to share experiences of new forms of neighbourhood organising and to hear the feedback from Comm-Uni-ty in a creative presention supported by the University’s Theatre in the Mill. There are two pathways to more impact. Academically, there is a need to influence the debate on how higher education can engage with communities in ways which support new forms of knowledge production contextually relevant to local change agendas, particularly in contexts of disadvantage. The Community University demonstrated the challenges as well as potentialities of co-producing knowledge with these communities, so that experience is complimented by systematic academic knowledge and vice versa. A group of academics interested in a range of ideas around what is called 'mass intellectuality' planning an edited book. With respect to the community, participants in the Community University have continued to meet at intervals, in a Thinkspace, organised by the Programme for a Peaceful City at the University of Bradford. This enables academic and university participants to co-reflect on issues facing the District of Bradford and to build on the relationships of trust built together during the Community University. A very detailed, analytical report has been submitted to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the partner-funder in this initiative, with the aim of generating debate within this important NGO working around issues of poverty and community. The key issue is how universities and community activists might exchange knowledges in a mutually respectful way that could enable more sustainable approaches to addressing not only poverty, but also alienation and withdrawal from political participation.
