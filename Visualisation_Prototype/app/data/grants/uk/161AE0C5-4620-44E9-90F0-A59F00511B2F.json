When this supply or removal goes wrong, diseases can result, including the disease that causes heart attacks and strokes. The water and other substances are transported around the body as part of our blood. In order to get to the cells, they therefore need to cross the walls of the blood vessels through which the blood flows. The most difficult step is to get across the sheet of endothelial cells, called the endothelium, that lines the inner surface of all our blood vessels. Although movement across the endothelium is important to us, there are many things about it that we do not understand, so we cannot develop drugs to treat the diseases caused by problems of supply or removal. We don&iquest;t know enough because these processes are hard to investigate. If we try to study them in living animals, then we cannot separate movement across endothelial cells from movement across the layers of our blood vessels that lie immediately under the endothelium. Also, it is impossible to get accurate information about things like blood flow next to the wall or the surface area of the wall. The ideal solution would be to grow endothelial cells out of the body, using methods called cell culture. We could grow the cells until they formed a continuous sheet and then measure how fast water and dissolved substances travel across it. This has been tried many times, but unfortunately the endothelium seems to be up to 1000 times leakier out of the body than in it; we cannot trust the results from such experiments. There is an urgent need to develop better methods. In this proposal, we suggest that the problems occur because the culture conditions are unlike the conditions inside the body. We want to see if making these conditions closer to those in the body will give us an endothelium in culture that behaves properly. We will try: (i) taking care that or cultures are not contaminated by other types of cell that would disrupt the endothelium, (ii) making sure that the substances whose transport we are studying are present at the concentrations at which they occur in the body, in case there movement across the cells gets relatively slower as their concentrations rise (because the pathways get full up), (iii) improving the culture solutions: in particular, culture solutions usually contain a liquid obtained from clotted blood, but clotting may itself release chemicals that increase endothelial leakiness, (iv) exposing the endothelial cells to flow and pressure, just as if they were growing inside our blood vessels, (v) making sure that the cells do not get too much oxygen: cells in culture are normally exposed to air, which contains more oxygen than our blood and may increase leakiness, and (vi) adding the naturally-occurring components of our blood which reduce inflammation (cells in culture can be a little inflamed, and this increases leakiness). If the project were successful, it would reduce the need for animal experiments, and it would give us a cheap, convenient and accurate way of studying how substances cross the endothelium; in the long term, this might allow us to develop new drugs. The project is also interesting because it lies on the boundary between engineering and biology (and would be carried out by engineers and biologists working together); research that crosses boundaries is being encouraged because it often leads to discoveries that could not be made within a single subject.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D522711/1","grantId":"BB/D522711/1","fundValue":"214957","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter David Weinberg","coPersons":["Giovanni Enrico Mann","Jeremy David  Pearson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
