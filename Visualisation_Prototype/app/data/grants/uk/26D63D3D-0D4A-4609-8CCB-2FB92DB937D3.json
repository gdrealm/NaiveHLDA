{"id":"26D63D3D-0D4A-4609-8CCB-2FB92DB937D3","title":"The Effects of Realistic Tidal Flows on the Performance and Structural Integrity of Tidal Stream Turbines","abstractText":"This project investigates the effects of extreme conditions on marine energy generators when installed as a single device or in arrays or farms. By combining the results of experiments, computer predictions and real life expertise, the research will enable the industry to produce, design and manufacture better tidal stream turbines that can be optimised to suit the prevailing sea conditions. Once these devices are deployed there will be a need to remotely monitor their condition and manage their operation during their life time. This research will deliver a system that will allow the owners of the devices to remotely monitor their condition and performance to ensure they achieve optimal energy production whilst maximising their life span. This will enable the electricity suppliers using this source of renewable energy to achieve the best possible long term economic performance. Finally, the environmental impact of such installations will be considered to ensure the positioning of these devices is not detrimental to the surrounding sea, coast and seabed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010200/1","grantId":"EP/J010200/1","fundValue":"1389370","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  O'Doherty","coPersons":["Carlton Barrie  Byrne","Robert John Poole","Ming  Li","Simon Philip Neill","Daphne M  O'Doherty","Alan Geoffrey Davies","Paul  Prickett","Joao Alexandre Teixeira","David  Mba","Roger Ivor Grosvenor","Gholamhossein  Najafian","Ian  Masters"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" oEngineered fully instrumented scaled turbine available for suitable future research projects. Will provide the basis for array configuration testing and turbine design and performance characterisation, including blade design, manufacture and testing. \noGiven the time for an individual model to run (16 (32) core workstation, 64 GByte RAM, 7 rotations - 10 weeks for a single TSR) two way modelling of a full turbine structure should be limited to extreme scenarios after CFD and one way coupled FSI.\noDevelopment of a structure for a turbine in conjunction with Mabey Bridge for the CFD/FEA modelling. The remit for the structure was to provide support and be manufacturable.\noRefinement of a BEMT model to provide 'quick' outputs for turbine developers.\noDevelopment of CFD wave models (with ADCP derived velocity profiles) with the capability of modelling surface breaching.\noIntegration of CFD results and condition monitoring algorithms to enable turbine prognostics. The instrumented turbine can be used at Laboratory scale for developers to characterise blade design.\nThe design of the turbine can be used when studying array placement.\nMethodology for FSI modelling should be useful for researchers considering 2 way coupled models.\nThe improved BEMT model will provide more accurate outputs for turbine devleopers before detailed studies.\nThe use of CFD outputs for assessing condition monitoring is a very useful tool examining failure prediction.
