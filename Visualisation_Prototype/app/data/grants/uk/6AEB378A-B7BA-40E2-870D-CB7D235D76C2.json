Produced in collaboration with foreign partners, quantitative measurement has been carried out on the office networks of 175 leading business service firms in 526 cities worldwide. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the project is to derive the most knowledge that can be gleaned from this data about business relations between cities on the eve of the current economic crisis.</p>\n\n<p>This very large data set provides new opportunities for more thorough and innovative analyses than previously attempted on the 'world city network'. Thus the essence of the project is to employ a 'creative social statistician' to add key analytical skills to the current research team. The appointed person will be expected to improve and develop the existing techniques we use and, in addition, experiment with new techniques customised to our data (and its theoretical underpinning). For instance, an animated representation of our new data on the web would be incredibly useful for analytical experiments and for disseminating our work to policy-makers and professional practitioners in firms and cities.</p>\n\n<p>The end product will be a benchmark description of cities in globalization before the demise of neo-liberalism. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001077/1","grantId":"ES/H001077/1","fundValue":"74321","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter James  Taylor","coPersons":["Michael  Hoyler","Kathryn  Pain"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
