It is intended to use this facility to support approximately 180 materials researchers at the University of St Andrews and extend this capability to users outside St Andrews in both academia and industry. It builds on the outstanding record of St Andrews in high quality research and investment in advanced materials research by the University, SFC, EPSRC, and industry as well as our experience of sharing our facilities with external users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L017008/1","grantId":"EP/L017008/1","fundValue":"5216440","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2023-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  HawkesworthJohn Derek Woollins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
