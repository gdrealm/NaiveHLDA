International in membership, and in correspondence with scholars across Europe, they were fundamental to the development of the intellectual networks later defined as the 'R&eacute;publique des Lettres', and to the dissemination of ideas in early modern Europe. Their membership included pioneering scientists, writers, artists, political thinkers, and representatives of both sexes and all social classes. The interests of the Academies ranged from the humanities, to the figurative and performance arts, natural sciences and medicine; many were interdisciplinary in their outlook and activities. \\nThe RE project has now established a significant scholarly resource on Academies in Naples, Padua, Bologna and Siena. Significant outcomes of that project include: (i) the discovery of many Academies not previously listed in existing scholarship; (ii) the evidence of the extensive networks of intellectual exchange within Italy and across Europe; (iii) the identification of the notable contribution of women including as authors, dedicatees and illustrators; (iv) the complex operation of censorship and its variability; (v) much vital new information from the analysis of dedications and dedicatees; (vi) the realization of the importance of illustrations in Academies' books for understanding their interests and operations.\\nThe project has also surpassed its stated objectives and greatly increased its research potential by: providing enhanced access to information about learned Academies (ca 250) in these centres; including ovr 1,000 digitized images relating to Academies.\\n\\nThe present proposal aims to build on these outcomes by: \\n(i) extending the scope of the database, by inputting data on Academies in both large and smaller centres, including: Rome and Venice, which had very large numbers of academies only a tiny fraction of which have been the subject of previous studies; cities such as Ferrara and Mantua, where the academies co-existed with the aristocratic courts; southern cities outside Naples (especially in Sicily) whose academies and their contribution to culture remains largely unexplored. \\n(ii) addressing the research questions and problems posed by the material already catalogued and developing research on new data. Among the important research questions to be addressed are:\\nWhat was the relationship between the Academies and institutions such as courts and Universities? What roles did women have within Academies? What was the role of illustrators and printers? How many foreigners took part in the life and publications of Italian Academies? How were intellectual discussions conducted and networks maintained? How did individual Academies relate to the demands of censorship? What were the relationships between Academies and the Spanish political and cultural establishment of southern Italy? How did Academies represent themselves through art and spectacle?\\nThese questions are emphatically inter- and multidisciplinary and demand a collaborative approach. The research proposed will be conducted by the existing RE project team who have acquired important relevant expertise in handling the data and in developing methodologies for analysing and presenting it. This expertise will be enhanced by the participation in the team of a colleague with research interests in topics linked to women, theatre and the northern courts.\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H023631/1","grantId":"AH/H023631/1","fundValue":"834140","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Everson","coPersons":["Denis Vincent Reidy","Lisa  Sampson"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":" The grant concluded only at the end of September 2014, and it is thus too early to be able to enter all the expected detail in this section. Information will be added during 2014-15 in order to provide a full report by the next submission period.\nSignificant Achievements:\nDevelopment of the Italian Academies database to include data for Academies in Rome, Venice, Mantua, Ferrara, and Sicily. The database now has more than 8,300 entries for academies, members and books held in the British Library, and continues to grow.\nHigh volume of interaction with the scholarly community worldwide, in particular through frequent attendance at conferences, research workshops and seminars; large number of papers given at these by members of the team, including frequently as invited speakers.\nSuccessful organisation of an international conference and two workshops which attracted international speakers and significantly stimulated debate.\nCompletion of the publications proposed as outputs, of which some have appeared (see Publications) and the remainder are in press for publication in 2015.\nAll the grant objectives have been met or will have been met when the publications in press have appeared.\nContact with other groups working in similar areas with whom we continue to discuss the possibility of new collaborations at European and international levels. The Italian Academies database has been adopted by the British Library manuscripts division for the IAMS project.\nColleagues at Stanford University (CA) have requested to scrape data for use in their network of digital resources on the early modern period.
