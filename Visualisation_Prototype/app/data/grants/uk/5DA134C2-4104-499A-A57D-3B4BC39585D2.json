WTC differs from the benefits that preceded it because it is administered by the tax authorities, rather than the department responsible for social security. It has been part of a government 'welfare-to-work' strategy. WTC is supposed to provide a greater incentive for people to take low-paid employment and to be less stigmatising than previous schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This research explores the potential effects of WTC on the changing nature of the work ethic among workers in low-paying employment. It investigates the extent to which recipients value the opportunity to work for low wages topped up by WTC, or whether they sometimes feel devalued or undervalued in their jobs. </p>\n\n<p>Previous research has examined problems with the administration of WTC and its effectiveness in sustaining household incomes. This project focuses on how recipients understand the principles of WTC; what their experiences are of the jobs they do; and what the effects might be upon their sense of self-worth or self-esteem. </p>\n\n<p>The research entails in-depth interviews with WTC recipients living in different kinds of household and different parts of the country.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G032319/1","grantId":"ES/G032319/1","fundValue":"121448","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings were widely circulated to and expressly acknowledged by a variety of policy, labour market and community actors (as detailed in report to ESRC).

Most considered that they were not being paid what they were worth, though many were positive about the jobs they currently held. \n\n\n\n2) Participants exhibited confusion regarding Working Tax Credit (WTC): - as to the name of the benefit; its relationship to other benefits; and the basis upon which they were entitled to it. Though the research has to date had no demonstrable effects upon policy and are unlikely immediately to influence current policy makers in the UK, the findings have relevance for future policy - in the UK and beyond - in relation to income maintenance mechanisms for low-paid workers and may yet have impact.
