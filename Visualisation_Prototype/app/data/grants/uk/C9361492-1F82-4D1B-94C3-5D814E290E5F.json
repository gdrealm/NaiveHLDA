The laser-wire uses a finely focussed beam of laser light to scan across the electron beam. By counting the rate of Compton events as a function of relative position of laser and electron beams, the electron beam transverse profile can be determined.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E002498/1","grantId":"PP/E002498/1","fundValue":"441453","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Grahame  Blair","coPersons":["Stewart Takashi Boogert"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
