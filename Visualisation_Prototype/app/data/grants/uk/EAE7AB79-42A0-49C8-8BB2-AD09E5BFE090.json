{"id":"EAE7AB79-42A0-49C8-8BB2-AD09E5BFE090","title":"Enzymology and engineering of the biosynthesis of polyether antibiotics","abstractText":"This project seeks to combine the efforts of two established research teams in Cambridge to solve a major outstanding problem in chemistry and biochemistry: the way in which a certain large group of natural antibiotics called polyethers are produced in Nature. Polyethers are antibiotics, whose clinical use has been restricted by their toxicity and by the difficulty of synthesising them or modifying them chemically, but which have been recently discovered (for example) to be highly effective against drug-resistant malarial parasites, a major global health threat. There is therefore great interest in developing new biological ways of synthesising libraries of such molecules to test as the starting point for potentially improved drugs of lower toxicity. We already know that to build up such complex small molecules from the simple building blocks inside bacterial cells requires multiple steps, each one catalysed by an enzyme. Some of these are physically tethered together into massive multienzyme complexes, the most complex biological catalysts so far discovered, but all are orchestrated to provide a smooth cascade or chain of reactions so that nothing is wasted and typically a single end-product is made. The opportunity for this research arises because one of us (PFL) has recently (with BBSRC support) succeeded for the first time in cloning and sequencing not one but four giant gene clusters governing the biosynthesis of four different polyethers; and his group has developed genetic methods to harness an industrial bacterial strain which overproduces one of these polyethers called monensin, so that products accumulate at levels up to 1000-fold higher than from the wild type, making the analysis of even minor products possible. Understanding polyether biosynthesis in molecular detail will require diverse experimental approaches including genetic manipulation of the genes inside the bacterial cells to see in what way the altered blueprint directs the synthesis of an altered end-product; and attempts to reconstitute portions of the catalysis in the test tube using purified enzymes and artificial substrates. We aim not only to provide a new appreciation of how the properties of individual enzymes are modulated when combined into such an integrated system, but also to learn the rules of how to alter the genes, or combine the genes from two or more polyether pathways, so as deliberately to divert the biosynthesis to make new target natural products. Our joint project aims to accelerate the further development of this exciting technology, with its broad potential benefits in the pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018943/1","grantId":"BB/D018943/1","fundValue":"890310","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Polyketide natural products are a diverse set of small molecules produced by animals and plants but especially by micro-organisms, whose physiological roles include acting as antibiotics or as signalling molecules. Molecules of this class, or synthetic molecules inspired by them, account for over ?10 billion drug sales per annum. Over the last 20 years, work in Cambridge and elsewhere has established that many of these molecules are made in bacterial cells by remarkable multienzymes called modular polyketide synthases. The assembly-line nature of these synthases makes it possible to make rational changes to the genes that encode these enzymes and obtain precisely altered versions of the antibiotic product.\nIn this project, we aimed to study the enzymes that biosynthesise polyethers, the most complicated of polyketide classes, where the initially-synthesised chain is folded and oxidised in an origami-like process to form multiple linked rings. We undertook the cloning and sequencing of the clustered genes for representative polyether gene clusters, including the curious mirror-image polyether tetronates called tetronomycin and tetronasin. We analysed the contribution and function of many of the individual genes by selectively deleting them and analysing the mutants for their ability to make either the original antibiotic, or an intermediate form, or a modified form. In this way we not only produced new molecules which showed altered properties, but we also gained a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the exquisitely specific and stereospecific ring formation process. For selected genes, we obtained additional insight by expressing the genes and purifying the individual enzymes so that they could be studied in pure form for precise confirmation of their role in assembling these remarkable molecules. \nRecently, polyethers have been discovered by researchers in the USA to possess remarkable properties in selective killing of cancer stem cells, thought to be responsible for the regrowth of tumours after initial therapy, so our results are having a direct impact on our ability quickly to produce multiple versions of these molecules, for further testing as novel anticancer compounds.

Experimental confirmation of key features of our mechanistic proposals for the biosynthesis of a major group of bioactive natural products. For example, that oxidative cyclization of monensin, nigericin, and other conventional\nionophoric polyethers does take place on a separate ACP protein (e.g. monACPX) not on free intermediates; that MonCII is indeed a novel thioesterase; that MonB-like proteins do (as we predicted) act as novel stereoselective epoxide hydrolases in polyether biosynthesis, and actively direct the stereochemical outcome (even when contrary to Baldwin's Rules)\n2. Uncovering of a wholly unexpected difference in the way that the tetronic acid rings of the near\nmirror-image twin polyethers tetronomycin and tetronasin are assembled, one of which requires\na novel 10 MDa-hydroxypyruvate dehydrogenase\n3. Demonstration by in vitro reconstitution that a single FabH-like enzyme is necessary and sufficient for tetronic acid ring formation in the model compound RK-682, a paradigm for the growing family of pharmaceutically-important tetronate and spirotetronate natural products. Our results have provided the ground rules for understanding the natural synthetic pathways of key antibiotics and provided insiraiton for current attempts, mainly in academic laboratories, to engineer these pathways to produce novel antibiotoics and other natural product-based drugs, including selective inhibitors of cancer stem cells.
