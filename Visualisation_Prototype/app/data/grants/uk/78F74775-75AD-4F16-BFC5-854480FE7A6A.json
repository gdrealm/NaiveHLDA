{"id":"78F74775-75AD-4F16-BFC5-854480FE7A6A","title":"The time-course of syntactic constraints in second language sentence processing","abstractText":"<p>This project examines the application of grammatical constraints during native and non-native sentence comprehension, with the aim of determining how, and to what extent, native and non-native processing of complex sentences differ. Adapting existing experimental designs, two experiments will be carried out, one examining the processing of sentences containing reflexive anaphors such as ‘himself’ or ‘herself’, and one investigating the processing of sentences with non-canonical word order. Participants’ eye movements will be recorded while they read short texts on a computer screen, an experimental technique that provides detailed information about the time-course of reading comprehension. Specifically, participants’ reading patterns should reveal when during processing structural (syntactic) and non-structural (pragmatic or discourse-related) constraints on sentence interpretation become operative. Examining different groups of learners whose native language is either similar or different from English with respect to the two phenomena under investigation will furthermore help us determine whether, and how, properties of participants’ native language influence sentence processing in a non-native one. The project will help fill a current research gap by providing new sets of real-time processing data that will increase our understanding of the mental processes involved in non-native language comprehension.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2508","grantId":"RES-000-22-2508","fundValue":"72887","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudia  Felser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
