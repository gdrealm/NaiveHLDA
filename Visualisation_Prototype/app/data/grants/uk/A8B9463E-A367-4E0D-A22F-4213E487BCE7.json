With their benefits novel and difficult to quantify in financial terms, valuing and pricing these products has proved problematic, making it hard to come-up with estimates regarding the size of the potential market. While a significant constraint on innovation in this field, these problems have wider relevance to sectors where the benefits of innovation are uncertain and difficult to quantify. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to contribute to theory development in this area by exploring the relevance of the notion of 'regimes of worth' to this issue through a two case empirical study of serious games innovation that will investigate how the value, and ultimately the underlying business model, of these innovations are constructed through the interactions between 'serious games' developers and their actual or potential clients. Further, the project seeks to assess the scope for, and potential practical and theoretical contribution of, future research on this topic using such an approach.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-598-25-0024","grantId":"RES-598-25-0024","fundValue":"38499","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joe  Nandhakumar","coPersons":["Harry  Scarbrough"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
