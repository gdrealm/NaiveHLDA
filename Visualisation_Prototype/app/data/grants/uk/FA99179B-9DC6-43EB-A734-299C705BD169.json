Building on a previous survey undertaken in rural North Wales, this study will evaluate change in older people's social networks over 15 years and examine whether cognitive decline at a given age has reduced alongside improvements in health, exercise and activity.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>2500 people aged 65 and over will be interviewed twice, two years apart, so differences in rates of change over time can be compared between cohorts born 15 years apart.&nbsp; This will be augmented with a new cohort from urban South Wales, with the combined sample of 5000 being used to study the relationships of resilience, coping and well-being to changes in cognition. Potential preventative factors for the development of cognitive impairment, such as having a higher level of education, remaining active, physically and mentally, having a more active social life, nutritional status and being bilingual will be examined. </p>\n\n<p>The core of the data will be shared with the on-going&nbsp; MRC funded CFAS II study, using similar procedures in 3 sites in England&nbsp;- giving a combined sample of 12,500 older people for providing estimates of health and of levels of cognitive impairment and mood.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G035954/1","grantId":"ES/G035954/1","fundValue":"3424230","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Thomas Woods","coPersons":["Vanessa  Burholt","Kate Mary Bennett","Linda  Clare","Cherie Frances McCracken","Carol  Brayne","Judith Eleri Phillips","Gillian  Windle"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
