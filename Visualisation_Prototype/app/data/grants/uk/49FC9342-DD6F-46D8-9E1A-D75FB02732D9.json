{"id":"49FC9342-DD6F-46D8-9E1A-D75FB02732D9","title":"Patterns of Flexibility, Associated Management Practice, Careers and Family Life","abstractText":"<p>Patterns of flexible working, the development of associated management practices, the impacts on individual careers and on the experience of people in their family lives have largely been considered separately to date. How these flexible working patterns are impacting on management practice and on the behaviours, expectations, and lives of employees is relatively unknown. Also, the relationships and possible tensions between these domains have yet to be adequately explained and understood. However, there is widespread acknowledgement by some practitioners, workers and academics that they are related, and that research needs to focus on the relationships between these fields of study. This seminar series will provide the forum for this to take place, bringing together practitioners, policy makers and academics to critically evaluate how these flexible working patterns are impacting on management practice and on the behaviours, expectations, and lives of employees inside and outside of organisations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4303","grantId":"RES-451-25-4303","fundValue":"8599","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Musson","coPersons":["R  Hyde","P  Dick"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
