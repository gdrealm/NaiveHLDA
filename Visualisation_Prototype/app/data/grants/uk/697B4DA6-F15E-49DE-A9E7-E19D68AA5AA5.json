Research findings will be used to address a range of issues (eg roles, identities, digital technology&nbsp;and popular culture in urban classrooms), and to enable participants to investigate their own classrooms. There will be three c. 3-session courses run by local authorities; one c.6 session course in a school-wide change programme; c.3 sessions in an MA module; and 2-3 sessions in a PGCE programme.</li>\n\n <li>A set of resources for wider distribution which will be consolidated from the professional development programme. It is envisaged that these materials will be presented in a book of c. 120 pages and a CD of classroom talk - which will be disseminated through local authorities and/or professional associations.&nbsp; </li>\n\n <li>A post-project seminar with policy-makers, professionals and researchers to promote an informed understanding of the nature and purposes of the resource materials. <br /></li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H000372/1","grantId":"ES/H000372/1","fundValue":"81213","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roxy  Harris","coPersons":["Adam  Lefstein","Constant  Leung","Ben  Rampton"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
