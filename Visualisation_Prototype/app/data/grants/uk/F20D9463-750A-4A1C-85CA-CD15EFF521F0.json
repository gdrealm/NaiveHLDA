{"id":"F20D9463-750A-4A1C-85CA-CD15EFF521F0","title":"Improving Swim Performance by Optimising Glide Efficiency and Time of Initiating Post-Glide Actions","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to develop and test 'user friendly' software for providing immediate feedback to swimmers and coaches to optimise glide efficiency and time of initiating post-glide actions in starts, turns, and the glide phase of the breaststroke. The software will be based on a new mathematical model that has been developed and thoroughly validated as a doctoral thesis by Roozbeh Naemi. The software will then be used to establish and test protocols for providing advice to swimmers regarding posture to 'fine tune' their gliding ability on an individual basis and also to optimise the time of commencement of the post-glide actions. The software will be developed and tested at the Centre for Aquatics Research and Education at the University of Edinburgh by Dr Naemi under the direction of Professor Ross Sanders in collaboration from Professor Steve Haake at Sheffield Hallam University. Dr Simon Goodwill will provide expertise to establish 'user friendly' Visual Basic interfaces with the MATLAB mathematical model. The software and testing protocols will then be available for application by coaches and scientific support personal to improve performance of British swimmers. The efficacy of the software and testing protocols will be assessed through testing of swimmers from two leading Scottish swimming clubs, City of Edinburgh and Warrender.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006276/1","grantId":"EP/F006276/1","fundValue":"31771","fundStart":"2007-10-23","fundEnd":"2008-10-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work has been used with swimmers to improve techique.
