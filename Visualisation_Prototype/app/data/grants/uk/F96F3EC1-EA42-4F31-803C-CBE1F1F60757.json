Currently available treatments are limited in their effectiveness and often cause significant side effects.\n\nWe now know that after a meal, the gut naturally produces hormones which act on the appetite centres of the brain to switch off appetite and make a person feel full. Using this effect of gut hormones has the advantage of mimicking the way in which the body normally controls food intake, and so has less potential for side effects than some other treatments. We have recently shown that injections three times a day (before meals) of the gut hormone oxyntomodulin helped obese volunteers lose more weight than volunteers receiving a placebo. Oxyntomodulin, however, is broken down rapidly in the blood, meaning it has to be injected frequently and its effects are short-lasting.\n\nWe have altered the structure of the hormone in order to make it more resistant to the mechanisms by which it is broken down in the body. We now propose to test this analogue of oxyntomodulin in volunteers, to test it efectiveness.\n\nWe shall firstly start by injecting the analogue at very low doses into volunteers, and then giving them a standard meal to eat. The effect of the analogue on the amount that they eat at this meal will be measured. We will gradually increase the dose until we find a dose that causes a 20% reducition in the amount eaten at a test meal compared with when the volunteers have no analogue injected.\n\nWe will then proceed formally to compare the analogue against a placebo, and record the amount eaten at a test meal as well as at subsequent meals for 24 hours afterwards. We will also take blood smaples from the volunteers to measure levels of the analogu inthe blood, to confirm that it is longer-lasting that oxyntomodulin itself, as well as measure other hormone levels and glucose levels.\n\nThis research is being conducted by the Department of Metabolic Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College, London. The department has a long-standing interest in gut hormones and appetite regulation and has conducted and published work in the field over the last 3 decades.\n\nIt is hoped that, if the results of this study are promising, it might be possible to develop an effective treatment for obesity based on oxyntomodulin.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502025","grantId":"G0502025","fundValue":"285024","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mohammed K Meeran","coPersons":["Stephen R Bloom"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
