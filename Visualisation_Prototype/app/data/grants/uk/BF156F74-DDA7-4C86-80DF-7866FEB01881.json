{"id":"BF156F74-DDA7-4C86-80DF-7866FEB01881","title":"An open-access centre for nanoscale analysis and fabrication","abstractText":"We propose to offer to UK academics free-access to a range of the latest high-resolution microscopy instruments and fabrication facilities, currently located in internationally renowned research groups. This equipment enables the visualization and manipulation of objects, ranging from individual atoms and molecules to complex pharmaceutical and biological materials, to the nanometre scale. These are complemented by the available fabrication facilities which allow the construction of structured objects, also at this scale.Collectively presented as a 'Centre for nanoscale analysis and fabrication', access to this equipment will be made via a single-point contact within the Nottingham Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Centre (nnnc). The contact will be supported by a strong management and technical team to provide an efficient service that is easy to access for UK academics, and able manage and locate the resource available within the Schools and Centres involved. This single-point contact will also provide means to provide and receive feedback from users, to coordinate training activities and to make the most of any future opportunities for research collaboration and exploitation of the gathered data.The service offered includes 80 days of access, supported by 25 days training and analysis per annum. Following analysis/fabrication the centre will help prepare a short report of the involved work for the both the user and for the Centre's records. This report, together with any feedback received will be catalogued and used to produce a 6 six monthly report summarizing equipment usage and the Centre's activities. This, in turn, will be used to inform the Management Group Meeting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F056478/1","grantId":"EP/F056478/1","fundValue":"162862","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project involved many users from different HEIs using a range of state of the art analytical equipment at the University of Nottingham, free at point of use. These data have led to many publications and other research outputs and some new collaborations.\n\nThis project was also played a significant role in the the new strategy of the University in investment in shared and open access to equipment across the University and with other HEIs in the midland region.

To our knowledge, all of the requests for access to the facilities were for quick, pump-priming type projects. The work performed has resulted in various outcomes including at least 5 publications in refereed journals (with several more to follow), presentations at UK and international conferences, valuable contributions to PhD student theses, fellowship and research grant applications and industrial collaboration. We are also aware of the possibility of further collaborative research as a result of the project (we continue to receive requests to use the service), and are still in touch with the visiting researchers for follow-up discussions. Several of our users returned to use the service again. The funds received only enabled access for researchers based in academia. The funds received did not directly fund a dedicated research project, but rather it funded access for other researchers (predominantly RCUK funded) in academia, to dedicated research equipment.
