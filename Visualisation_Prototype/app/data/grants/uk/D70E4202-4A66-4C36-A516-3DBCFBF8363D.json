{"id":"D70E4202-4A66-4C36-A516-3DBCFBF8363D","title":"Preventing TAB1-mediated p38 activation during myocardial infarction","abstractText":"During myocardial infarction an enzyme called p38 becomes activated and worsens the injury suffered by the heart. Although p38 can be inhibited with drugs, and this leads to reduced heart injury, these drugs have caused serious side effects in early clinical trials. This is probably because p38 is a very important enzyme throughout the body. The purpose of this grant is to find a way of inhibiting p38 during myocardial infarction by interfering with the way it becomes activated. The reason why this is attractive is that the activation mechanism during myocardial infarction is very unusual in that it requires p38 to bind another protein called TAB1. Thus interfering with this mechanism should not inhibit p38 activation under other circumstances.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001138","grantId":"G1001138","fundValue":"573580","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Stephen Marber","coPersons":["Brian John Sutton","Maria Rosaria Conte"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
