{"id":"A524B050-61FC-4A34-9434-4EFED2E622FB","title":"Skills for Managing Spatial Diversity","abstractText":"<p>This research looks at the application of the Egan Review in Northern Ireland and the extent to which the region offers a distinctive learning opportunity for the rest of the UK. Here, the struggle to manage and develop communities stratified by high rates of segregation and poverty provides useful case material and potential for comparative analysis. The approach values the perspectives offered by other places where race, violence and spatial segregation challenge local planning including South Africa, the Middle East and indeed, North America. </p> \n<p>The methodology is based on an interactive approach with the key stakeholders and an emphasis on ensuring that the user community is engaged in the design and delivery of the empirical work. We propose a quantitative e-survey of groups and practitioners involved in the management of segregated places and this will be complemented by a series of case studies drawing on experiences in the public, community and private sectors. A programme of semi-structured interviews within national focal points in England, Wales and Scotland and with regional policy makers will explore the type and mix of competencies required to manage spatial diversity and identify strategic supply gaps both regionally and nationally.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E023916/1","grantId":"ES/E023916/1","fundValue":"36284","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to inform UK government policy on sustainable communities; the development of a Northern Ireland skills framework; and a new postgraduate degree pathway in urban regeneration Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment Policy & public services","person":"Brendan Joseph Murtagh","coPersons":["Geraint  Ellis"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" The need to focus more on problem solving competencies and mediation techniques, rather than just knowledge acquisition in planning and urban regeneration.
