This activity will widen the audience for policy-relevant economic research; it could also increase the number of UK students in economics interested in carrying out future research in the area. </p> \n<p>The Instituteâ€™s strategy has two strands. First, to organise a series of lectures on public economics aimed at sixth formers and undergraduates, drawing on their expertise in areas such as policy evaluation, labour supply, pensions and saving, inequality, public spending and productivity, as well as introducing and exploring economic theory. These will build on the annual IFS&nbsp;(Institute for Fiscal Studies)&nbsp;series of Oxford and Cambridge public economics lectures, but broaden the potential audience by holding a one-day event in a large London venue, providing funding to subsidise travel for students coming from further afield.</p> \n<p>IFS will also expand the current section of its website known as Fiscal Facts. They will improve the coverage of the tax tables and add to the briefing notes on the tax and benefit systems to include a survey of local government finance.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0002","grantId":"RES-172-25-0002","fundValue":"26138","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  There were no research findings as this was a 'follow-on' grant.
