{"id":"EF3F6078-B9F8-4457-BB4E-5ADCB70ED1A9","title":"New Green Methanol Production","abstractText":"The aim is to exploit a recent discovery concerning a new catalytic route for methanol production based on using bio-renewable feedstocks as starting materials. This new process and associated catalysts has been protected by a patent filing. The key feature is that the process opens up a wholly new route for the manufacture of methanol which is a key commodity chemical. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J013420/1","grantId":"EP/J013420/1","fundValue":"193290","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are starting to see how we can scale up the laboratory discovery.
