The meeting has been organised to review developments made in the field of engineering ceramics during the last 50 years. The meeting will mark the 70th birthday of Professor Sir Richard Brook, Director of the Leverhulme Trust and a leading figure of engineering ceramics in the UK. The meeting will take place at University College London, from 10 / 11 April 2007. Leading experts from the UK, Europe and USA have confirmed their participation and submitted high-quality manuscripts, which will be reviewed and published in a special issue of the Journal of the European Ceramic Society (Elsevier) to be distributed at the meeting. It is the aim of the organisers to encourage the attendance of young researchers from academia and industry, to whom this meeting will be of particular benefit. Therefore, a number of places have been set aside for junior participants, who will be charged a small fee of 150. It is hoped that the meeting will be successful in enhancing scientific understanding and celebrating the career of Professor Sir Richard Brook.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F056400/1","grantId":"EP/F056400/1","fundValue":"33717","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  An international meeting was organised to review developments made in the field of engineering ceramics during the last 50 years, to coincide with the 70th birthday of Prof Sir Richard Brook, a pioneer in this area, and a former Chief Executive of EPSRC.
