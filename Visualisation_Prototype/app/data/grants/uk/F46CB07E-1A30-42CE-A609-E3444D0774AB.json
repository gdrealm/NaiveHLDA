Our primary focus is the behaviours and outcomes of individuals in late childhood and adolescence, including their physical and mental health, risky behaviours, school performance.</p>\n\n<p>Our aims are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>To chart the relationship of these outcomes with socio-economic status of the family of origin of a large population based sample of young people currently living in the UK.</li>\n\n <li>To understand the complementarities between different aspects of children’s and adolescent’s lives at one point of time and across time, examining lives from birth to adolescence.</li>\n\n <li>To examine the antecedence of these outcomes in earlier children outcome measures and study the pathways by which socio-economic status of parents affects outcomes for their children.</li>\n\n <li>To undertake methodological innovation in the analysis of large scale survey data.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will primarily focus on analysis of the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) data, which is a rich set of data has been collected from children (and their parents) at high frequencies.</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Further information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Contact: Prof Paul Gregg</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:p.gregg@bristol.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">p.gregg@bristol.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ESRC contact: Heath Bampton</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:heath.bampton@esrc.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">heath.bampton@esrc.ac.uk</a></li>\n\n <li>Telephone: 01793 444519</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-060-23-0011","grantId":"RES-060-23-0011","fundValue":"3604230","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Gregg","coPersons":["Jonathan  Sterne","Deborah Anne Lawlor","Carol  Propper","Andrew Robert Ness","George  DaveySmith","Leon  Feinstein","Frank  Windmeijer","Fiona Alison Steele","Marcus Robert Munafo","Glyn  Lewis","Simon  Burgess"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
