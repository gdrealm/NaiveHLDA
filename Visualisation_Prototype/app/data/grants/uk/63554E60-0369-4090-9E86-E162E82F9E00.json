This is a\nquantum technology as it relies on the interference of the atoms with each other, a manifestation of wave-particle duality,\ni.e. the fact that matter can behave like a wave under certain circumstances; it is the quantum nature of the technique that\naffords it great sensitivity. This project will, for the first time, demonstrate an atom interferometer in a UK commercial\nenvironment. The expertise of M Squared Lasers in laser engineering and system integration will be combined with the\nacademic excellence of the University of Birmingham to create a collaborative team capable of delivering the proposed\ncommercial product. Gravitational sensors enable one to see through matter and below the ground. Applications can be\nenvisaged in many sectors, from the detection of new oil and gas deposits, surveying unknown underground infrastructure\nsuch as pipes and cables, to monitoring the water table.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508226/1","grantId":"EP/M508226/1","fundValue":"117467","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  Boyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
