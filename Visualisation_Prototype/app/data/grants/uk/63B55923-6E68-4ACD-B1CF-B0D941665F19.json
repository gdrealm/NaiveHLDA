{"id":"63B55923-6E68-4ACD-B1CF-B0D941665F19","title":"Particle Size Magnifier for Fundamental Nucleation Studies","abstractText":"This proposal is concerned with an atmospheric process referred to as nucleation. The term nucleation refers to the process where molecules of vapour in the air attach together and begin to grow into liquid droplets or solid particles which ultimately become tiny specs of dust in the air. Nucleation processes are important because in some regions of the atmosphere they determine the overall number of particles in the air which itself influences global climate and has implications for human health as breathing airborne particles has been shown to be detrimental to health. In order to study nucleation processes, it is necessary to be able to investigate extremely tiny particles that are associated with the start of the process. Current particle measurement instruments cannot see particles that are this small and consequently a device known as a &quot;particle size magnifier&quot; is needed, and in this project it is planned to purchase a recently developed particle size magnifier instrument and to test its suitability for studying the early stages of nucleation. If it proves successful, then the instrument would be used to study nucleation in an underground laboratory where the influence of cosmic rays on nucleation processes is minimal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002120/1","grantId":"ST/K002120/1","fundValue":"28580","fundStart":"2013-03-31","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The project supported a feasibility study of using a Particle Size Magnifier to study atmospheric particle nucleation processes.

This process is relevant both to human health as particles represent an inhalation health hazard and to the changing climate. Our work is contributing to an understanding of how nucleation processes occur at a very fundamental level. No doubt other researchers will seek to study nucleation processes using the Particle Size Magnifier as a means of observing extremely small particles. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
