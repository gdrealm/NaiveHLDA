We have recently discovered that the basic biochemical mechanism of gene transcription, in which an activated gene is copied into RNA may be further enhanced by a process called splicing. Splicing was hitherto perceived as a separate process to transcription that acts to convert the initial RNA copy of the gene into a functional messenger RNA which is then translated into the gene?s final protein product. However we have now discovered that splicing also directly activates gene transcription. This research programme aims to characterise this new aspect of gene regulation in full molecular detail. The completion of the human genome sequence (and other eukaryotic genomes) has produced a clear divide between our massive knowledge of the basic genetic blueprint in man and how exactly this genetic data is interpreted by the cell into biological function. This research programme aims to unravel a newly discovered but key feature of how genes of eukaryotes (especially man) function.\nNJP is a Lecturer and Tutor at Oxford University and as such teaches advanced aspects of Science relating to this research programme to both Biochemistry and Medical students at Oxford University. Both NJP and AA give numerous lectures about their research at conferences and at invited seminars in the UK as well as internationally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200452","grantId":"G0200452","fundValue":"1046510","fundStart":"2004-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Jarvis Proudfoot","coPersons":["Alexandre  Akoulitchev"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
