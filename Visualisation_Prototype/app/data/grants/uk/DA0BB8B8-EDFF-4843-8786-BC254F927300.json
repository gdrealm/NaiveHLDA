Key in the latter village was high school staff turnover in recent years and the shift away from the headteacher occupying a residential and prominent role within the village;\n\n\n\nWP2 An analysis of the role and significance of the school in the rural community.\n\nThat the recent social histories of both villages were deeply significant in shaping the role of the school and villagers' familiarity and attachment to it across their lifecourses. The economic circumstances (both post-'boom') of the locales also held profound implications as did, in one village, a key figurehead.\n\n\n\nWP3 To evaluate the sustainability of each school and instances of good practice. The sustainability of one school was threatened during the fieldwork, primarily through its failure to appoint and retain headteachers and the following consequences. Nevertheless, the personal commitment to the school demonstrated by both staff and some parents was marked. The relationship between the two (turnover vis-?-vis commitment) warrants further exploration.\n\n\n\nWP4 To situate and examine educational provision alongside other core services. Service provision in one locale was high, but this did not equate to user satisfaction. This was due to transport links, despite relatively close neighbouring towns, being restrictive and therefore impacting upon the services some villagers were readily able to access. This included school choice.\n\n\n\nWP5 To explore the rural schooling experience offered to pupils, staff and parents. The schooling experience offered to pupils, staff and parents in a rural setting varied. One school was characterized by both 'pushy parents' and deeply dissatisfied and disaffected villager parents, yet possessed an extremely happy student body. Significantly, a high proportion of pupils resided outside the village (albeit within catchment). Therefore their experience was in-school, rather than that of a rural village school. The quality of the staff experience was undermined by a sustained period of high staff-turnover and also informed by Teaching Assistants outnumbering PGCE-qualified staff.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
