Yet, to date, the biomedical community have struggled to integrate these technologies and generate the impact anticipated some years ago. The University of Manchester proposes to engage with this challenge by setting up a completely new facility, building on its strengths in biochemistry, to enable clinicians to choose the right treatment for the right patient at the right time. The biochemistry base that will be built, using state of the art technologies, can serve this objective in a number of different ways for a wide range of different diseases. Furthermore, the benefits generated from the facility will be available to researchers from other universities and industrial partners (such as drug companies) to use, with the aim to maximise its impact in diagnostic and translational medicine beyond Manchester. \n\nThis new facility will use a new development of mass spectrometry that supports the measurement of many proteins within a sample (such as blood, urine, or from tissue such as a tumour biopsy) within a much shorter time than has ever been possible before. Such techniques will be of huge benefit to clinical researchers as it will allow them to see the differences between samples from, for example, healthy people and people with a specific disease - this will give insights into how that disease develops and, importantly, how it might be treated. In addition, by examining the differences in the levels of particular marker proteins from patients who respond to a drug compared to those who don't respond, doctors will be able to identify which drug is the best treatment for individual patients. This will have economic benefit as drugs will not be used on patients who will receive no benefit from them. We will look in the first instance for such protein markers through the disease course, and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M008959/1","grantId":"MR/M008959/1","fundValue":"12820700","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony David  Whetton","coPersons":["Ian  Jacobs","Iain Edward Buchan","Graeme  Black","Robert  Graham","Christopher Ernest Griffiths","Simon  Hubbard","Anne  Barton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
