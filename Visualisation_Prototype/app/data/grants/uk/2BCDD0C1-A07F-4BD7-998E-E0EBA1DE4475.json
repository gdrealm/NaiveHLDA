The latter problem is resolved by inserting proteins into the membrane that specifically recognise extracellular signals and then transduce them into intracellular signals capable of controlling cellular activity. Ca is the most important of these intracellular signals, not least because it is present at much lower concentration within the cell than on the opposite side of the membranes that either surround the cell or the organelles within it. The opening of Ca channels within these membranes is the most common means whereby extracellular stimuli evoke an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. For many years we have known that IP3 receptors are the most important and widely expressed Ca channels within the membranes of intracellular stores, but our recent work suggests that they are also functionally expressed in the membrane (PM) that surrounds the cell, where they provide the route for much of the Ca that flows into the cell from outside. To our great surprise, each cell absolutely reliably counts 1-3 IP3R into the PM from the many 1000s expressed within the cell. Such counting is important because otherwise IP3R in the PM might cause the cell to be overwhelmed with Ca and that would be toxic. But how can a cell so reliably count so few proteins into the membrane surrounding each cell? This project aims to answer that question.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004660/1","grantId":"BB/E004660/1","fundValue":"320781","fundStart":"2006-09-11","fundEnd":"2010-03-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  By scientists working in cognate fields Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Cultural","person":"Colin William Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The final report on this grant was submitted to BBSRC in 2010. An abstract is shown below:\nThe versatility of calcium as an intracellular messenger depends upon the spatial organisation of calcium signals. Using a novel application of the patch-clamp technique we demonstrated that IP3 causes IP3R, the most abundant of intracellular calcium channels, to gather into small groups, within which their regulation by IP3 and calcium is re-tuned. This demonstrates that IP3 both regulates IP3R and assembles them into the clusters within which they are better able to evoke coordinated openings of several IP3R. We developed novel ligands of IP3R that less effectively open the IP3R than the natural agonist, IP3. With these partial agonists, we were able to show that after IP3 binding to the IP3-binding core, the major conformational changes pass entirely via the N-terminal suppressor domain to the pore. We showed that cAMP, another ubiquitous intracellular messenger, directly regulates IP3R (increasing their sensitivity to IP3) independent of the proteins through which cAMP exerts all its known actions. We also applied patch-clamp methods to another intracellular channel, TPC2, that normally resides in lysosomes. By re-directing TPC2 to the plasma membrane, we showed that is the pore-forming subunit of an NAADP-sensitive calcium channel. Used to develop further ligands of IP3 receptors with potential to lead to new means of regulating their function. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
