It has been critical in defining cultural groupings and successions, and in recent years has been incorporated into discussions of cultural responses to climate change. While its specific meaning will probably always remain hotly debated, it is undoubtedly one of the most intimate windows to the cultural past. However, chronological uncertainty seriously hampers our understanding of nearly all aspects of rock art, especially its relationship to the unstable climate of the Upper Pleistocene and to the rest of the Upper Palaeolithic record. This project will redress this situation by producing one of the largest corpuses of radiometric dates for one of the core regions of Palaeolithic cave paintings and engravings, the Iberian Peninsula. The results will considerably improve our understanding of the distribution and changes over time of the art and relate this to the climatic background. Radiocarbon has been used to provide dates for the organic pigments used in rock art, but many of the results remain controversial. This is because organic pigments may become contaminated by the much older limestone of the walls of caves, or because the charcoal used to make a black pigment was itself old at the time the art was made. At present it is still not certain if the art appears around 32,000 or 18,000 years ago. Furthermore, radiocarbon can only date carbon based pigments, and the majority of early rock paintings are either engravings with no pigments, or use mineral pigments such as red ochre that is unsuitable for dating. However, some of these engravings and paintings are directly on, or are overlain by, calcium carbonate deposits similar to stalagmites and stalactites. The date at which these crusts formed can be determined by uranium-series dating, a technique that measures the ratio of uranium to its radioactive decay product thorium. Thus a minimum or maximum age can be calculated for the art, and by measuring enough different examples a chronology for the development and spread of different styles can be built up. This data will provide the basis by which we will understand how and when rock art first came about in Iberia, and its relationship to similar art in Southern France and the rest of Europe. We will investigate whether the appearance and subsequent intensification of rock art is related to rapid climatic change that occurs in the Late Upper Palaeolithic. Records of raipd transitions from warm to cold periods in the run up to the last glacial maximum have been revealed by marine sediment and ice cores. We will compare the frequency and date of the rock art to these climatic records to test the hypothesis that the intensification of artistic expression in caves was a social response to a changing climate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F000510/1","grantId":"NE/F000510/1","fundValue":"101841","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our research has informed professional and public understanding of cave art, including in World Heritage sites such as Altamira Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Alistair William Pike","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" We have made 118 uranium-thorium (U/Th) dates on calcite samples associated with art motifs from 11 of the most important cave art sites in Northern Spain. We have back dated the origins of the tradition of cave painting, certainly in Iberia, but most probably for the whole of Europe, by some 10-20,000 years. We can show, for the first time, that the tradition of cave painting arrives in Spain at least with the arrival of the first modern humans in the Aurignacian, some 40,000 years ago. This is at odds with the majority of the radiocarbon chronologies for cave painting in Europe where the few apparent Aurignacian dates remain controversial. While we can only provide maximum or minimum ages of a motif, and only in rare cases both, we have demonstrated the advantages of the U/Th method over radiocarbon in providing a chronology. All of the motifs we have dated to older than 25,000 years are red ochre or other mineral pigment, and would not have been suitable for radiocarbon dating. Furthermore, since the formation of flowstones is independent of human intervention, it circumvents problems with repainting, or the use of old charcoal to make pigment. In addition, it is arguably less destructive than radiocarbon dating since we are removing (cleaning if you like), for dating, secondary encrustations, rather than pigment.\n\n\n\nOur earliest date of 40,000 years, for a red disk in El Castillo Cave, in Cantabria, Spain, is only a minimum age, and thus the art may be significantly older than this. We cannot therefore rule out that some of the painting was done by Neanderthals who were present in the region until about 42,000 years ago. Cave art sites are part of the heritage and tourist industries of many European countries, and several number among UNESCO World Heritage sites. Our research significantly enchances our understanding of and the visitors experience of these sites. Cave art is notoriously difficult to date, and our results represent the first step in providing a robust radiometric chronology for cave paintings. It will allow the testing and calibration of chronolgies based on 'style' and make possible the correlation of art with below ground archaeology, not just in Europe, but in other major cave art regions of the world.\n\nOur research has prompted other research groups to apply a similar methodology to cave art in other areas. Recent U-Th dates of cave art from Sulawesi have shown the worlds earliest figurative art there at &gt;36ky, which has profound implications for the origins of cave painting and the migrations of the earliest humans out of Africa.
