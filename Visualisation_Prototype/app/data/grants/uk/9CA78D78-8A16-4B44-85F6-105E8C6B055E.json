All segments of the hard drive market remain in demand and the recording transducer is critical for storage\ncapacity. A total of 25% of the world's transducers are manufactured in the UK thus we have a unique opportunity to grow\nthis market as demand for this highly complex nanoengineered component increases. This project will deliver smart\nnanophotonic materials to be used in the writer for the next hard drive technology transition using Heat Assisted Magnetic\nRecording, due in 2018. The very high performance demands and fluctuating operating temperature make reliable\noperation difficult to achieve in prototype devices today. The solution is to make this key component from smart materials\nwhich self-compensate for these thermal effects as well as providing other functionality. The UK has world class capability\nin the area of nanophotonics (UoS) and material discovery and optimization (Ilika) and this project provides an opportunity\nto develop these materials for improved product performance and competitiveness for the manufacturing business of end\nuser Seagate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N510063/1","grantId":"EP/N510063/1","fundValue":"211227","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dan  Hewak","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
