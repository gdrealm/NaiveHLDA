{"id":"97387C4E-4290-492B-B10C-7A01DE45DC88","title":"Assessing Students' Concept of a Substance","abstractText":"<p>Modern chemistry is founded on the concept of a substance. It is inherent in descriptions of phenomena in terms of changes of state, mixing, separating and transformations to new substances (in various combinations and permutations). Particle ideas at increasing levels of sophistication provide the theoretical explanations. Research suggests this view of the world presents many challenges to our students. </p>\n\n<p>This project will construct an adaptive computer-based instrument to assess students’ understanding across scenarios making a range of demands on the concept of a substance (eg from melting ice to a candle flame).&nbsp; It will also screen for ideas believed to inhibit students’ progress in chemistry (eg that ‘solids’, ‘liquids’ and; ‘gases’ are three separate types of stuff) and explore the relationship between students’ understanding of the particle model and their macroscopic conceptions of events.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The instrument will be applied to a representative sample of the UK secondary school population to gain a picture of students’ thinking, set against a number of background variables. Rasch modelling will also be used to investigate the existence of an interval scale of difficulty in relation to the concept of a substance.&nbsp; Findings will be of interest to all holding a stake in chemistry education.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1460","grantId":"RES-000-22-1460","fundValue":"43266","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Michael Johnson","coPersons":["Peter  Tymms"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
