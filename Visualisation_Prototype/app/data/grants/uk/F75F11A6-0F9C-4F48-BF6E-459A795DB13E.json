At low light intensities, growth is limited because of insufficient light to drive photosynthesis. At higher intensities, growth becomes inhibited because of the damaging effects of light on the photosynthetic apparatus found in the chloroplast. This phenomenon of photoinhibition has a profound effect on crop yields especially when plants are subjected to high light in combination with other stress conditions such as heat and water stress. One of the targets of light damage in the chloroplast is the photosystem two complex, which is involved in water oxidation and photosynthetic electron transport, and in particular the D1 protein. Plants have developed a repair mechanism to replace damaged D1 by a newly synthesised copy. Under most conditions this repair mechanism allows PSII activity to be maintained. However at high light intensities the rate of repair is unable to match the rate of damage to PSII and under these conditions there is a net loss of PSII activity and photosynthetic performance. In principle, improving the repair mechanism is one route by which more light-resistant plants can be generated. As yet the molecular details of PSII repair are unclear, especially the process by which damaged D1 is removed from the membrane. Recently we discovered the identity of a particular class of protease (FtsH proteases) that was needed for D1 degradation. We have also discovered that the N-terminus of D1 is important for D1 degradation in cyanobacteria, which are closely related to chloroplasts. This has led us to postulate a mechanism for D1 degradation that involves the recognition of the N-terminus of damaged D1 by the FtsH protease. Our hypothesis is at odds with the current model in the scientific literature. In this proposal we have designed a series of experiments to differentiate between the two models. Ultimately the results of this work will provide a clearer picture of PSII repair in plants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E006388/1","grantId":"BB/E006388/1","fundValue":"343259","fundStart":"2007-07-09","fundEnd":"2011-01-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have been used to advance the research field  ","person":"Peter J Nixon","coPersons":["Bart  Feys"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Plant growth is exquisitely sensitive to the intensity of light in the environment.

As yet the molecular details of PSII repair are unclear, especially the process by which damaged D1 is removed from the membrane. Recently we discovered the identity of a particular class of protease (FtsH proteases) that was needed for D1 degradation in both higher plants and cyanobacteria. Work done during this project revealed that the length of the N-terminal tail of D1 was important for prompt degradation of damaged D1 in cyanobacteria, consistent with a mechanism involving highly processive proteolysis starting from the N-terminus of D1 catalysed by FtsH. A mutant of tobacco in which D1 was shortened by 20 residues at the N-terminus was able to accumulate 30% of WT levels of PSII and showed impaired PSII repair at the levels of both synthesis and degradation. The role in PSII repair of D1 phosphorylation at residue D1-Thr2 was examined by creating tobacco chloroplast mutants in which the Thr residue was changed to Ala, Ser or Asp. All mutants behaved like WT in terms of accumulation of PSII and rates of electron transport. Damaged PSII was also repaired in the mutants although there were subtle differences which need to be explored in future work. To help establish an in vitro assay for FtsH-mediated degradation of D1 and other PSII subunits from cyanobacteria, we have isolated His-tagged derivatives of unassembled CP47, unassembled CP43 and a PCII core complex lacking CP43 from Synechocystis 6803. Analysis of the pigment and subunit compositions of these complexes supports a modular assembly of PSII involving PSII sub-complexes and various PSII accessory factors. We have also isolated the FtsH2 protease from Synechocystis 6803 and shown that it forms a complex with the FtsH3 subunit. The structural organisation of this complex will be explored in future work. Ultimately the results of our work have provided a clearer picture of PSII assembly and repair in cyanobacteria and plants. The findings formed the basis of a subsequent successful BBSRC application to study the structure of the FtsH2/FtsH3 complex (BB/F020554/1) Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
