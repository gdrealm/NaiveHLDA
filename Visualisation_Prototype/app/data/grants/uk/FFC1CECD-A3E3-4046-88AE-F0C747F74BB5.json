{"id":"FFC1CECD-A3E3-4046-88AE-F0C747F74BB5","title":"Characterisation of a Novel Human Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase","abstractText":"Human cells possess a class of proteins known as topoisomerases that stop DNA from becoming twisted or overwound. Occassionally, these proteins accidentally break DNA and thereby render our genetic material unstable. If not repaired properly, such DNA breaks can lead to cell death or cancer. Here, we have identified a completely novel human enzyme that can safeguard DNA against topoisomerase-induced DNA damage by repairing these breaks if they arise. We now wish to characterise the function of this novel human enzyme in detail, and investigate its importance to DNA stability and human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901606","grantId":"G0901606","fundValue":"364219","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Caldecott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
