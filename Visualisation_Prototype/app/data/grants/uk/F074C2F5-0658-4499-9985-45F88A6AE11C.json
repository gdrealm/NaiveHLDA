For example, they might want immigrants to integrate, assimilate, or live segregated. They might be in favour or against immigrants keeping their cultural identity. They might seek contact with or avoid immigrants. These attitudes are called ‘acculturation preferences’. To date, we know little about psychological antecedents of such acculturation preferences among ‘natives’. This research will employ an experimental methodology to test potential antecedents.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>The effects of four variables will be assessed. These are 'perceived acculturation preferences of immigrants' (eg whether immigrants are perceived to be willing to give up their culture or not), 'prejudice against immigrants', 'identity threat' (ie perceived threats to the worldview of the 'natives'), and 'essentialism' (ie a belief that group memberships are biologically determined). Two experiments among white British university students will be conducted. The independent variables will be manipulated using different techniques. For example, to manipulate perceived acculturation preferences of immigrants, participants will be exposed to video clips of fake, pre-prepared interviews with alleged immigrants. Acculturation preferences of the interviewees will be systematically varied. The effects of the manipulations will be measured.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2113","grantId":"RES-000-22-2113","fundValue":"77137","fundStart":"2008-08-26","fundEnd":"2009-08-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Hanna  Zagefka","coPersons":["Marco  Cinnirella","Rupert  Brown"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
