This project examines the other 'face' of population aging: the fact that for any given chronological age, individuals have a lengthening life expectancy which one might imagine will also affect their attitidues and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>This project uses&nbsp; vital registration (births deaths, migration) life table and census data, including linked data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to examine how the gradual decrease in mortality has played out in different areas of Scotland (defined by geography and by deprivatioin indices) and by social class.</p>\n\n<p>The heterogeneous nature&nbsp; of population ageing and the flexible ways in which it can be negotiated will be examined. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004611/1","grantId":"ES/K004611/1","fundValue":"142785","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  MacInnes","coPersons":["Jeroen Johannes Spijker"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
