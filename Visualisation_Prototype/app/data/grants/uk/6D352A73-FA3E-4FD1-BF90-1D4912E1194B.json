Indeed pathology of the BG can lead to Parkinsonâ€˜s disease and dyskinesias. Neurones of the GP receive excitatory input from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and inhibitory input arising from the striatum and other GP cells. These two inhibitory inputs not only contact different regions of each GP cell but preliminary studies indicate additional functional differences. We propose to identify and characterize, at the level of single cells, these two classes of inhibitory input on the basis of electrical (biophysical) properties and specific molecular markers. \n\nRecordings will be made from single and connected pairs of GP neurones in brain slice preparations. GABA synapses, the specialized structures formed between brain cells that permit cell-cell inhibitory communication, will then be studied. Functional, physiological data and its capacity for modulation will be linked with the number, type and precise location of the synapses which give rise to the physiological data. These studies will give an unprecedented insight into the inhibitory circuitry of the GP, highlighting functional differences in the connectivity that may provide differential targets for novel therapeutic approaches to extra-pyramidal motor disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300179","grantId":"G0300179","fundValue":"576590","fundStart":"2004-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Martin Stanford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
