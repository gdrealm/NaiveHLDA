We propose three themes: (i) the investigation of stability via renovation events,(ii) the investigation of stability for networks with spatial interaction, and (iii) the development of performance techniques for random fluids.Stochastic networks play an important role as mathematical models of various modern complex systems, such as the Internet, mobile networks and traffic networks. Although these systems are quite different from the engineering point of view, they share common characteristics as regards the mathematical models used in describing them and, in effect, predicting their behaviour.We are seeking support for a postdoctoral research fellow for 36 months, some computing equipment, funds for research exchanges and funds for participation in scientific conferences.The research fellow is expected to contribute to the topics described below.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E033717/1","grantId":"EP/E033717/1","fundValue":"293624","fundStart":"2007-06-11","fundEnd":"2010-06-10","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our results have been used by researchers, cited 92 times (according to Google Scholar).

(2) Developed a rigorous theory of rare events in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, around &quot;the single big jump phenomenon&quot;: the main cause for something unusual to happen is a single &quot;giant&quot; event. We have developed general mathematical theory that may be used by colleagues and may be applied to a number of areas: communication networks, risk processes, etc. Education,Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Transport,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
