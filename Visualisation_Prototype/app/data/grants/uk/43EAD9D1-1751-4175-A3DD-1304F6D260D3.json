It is timely because of the massive expansion in such projects and the unique methodological issues they present. In an area where practice is outstripping a fragmented methodological literature the research sets out to explore this gap.</p>\n\n<p>The design is based upon a national questionnaire survey and six in-depth case studies. The survey aims to gain responses from approximately 100 projects about the methodological and ethical issues they have faced. To support reflection each questionnaire will be accompanied by a 'trigger' DVD showing a selection of video based scenarios illustrating key issues. The case studies will be selected on the basis of the survey results and take place over three one-day visits each resulting in a new video scenario to be included in a final DVD. After the completion of this DVD a national seminar series aimed at research participants and end users will follow based around the methodological issues raised during the course of the research. The project will produce supporting materials for researchers working in this area, including a DVD and set of ethical guidelines.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2057","grantId":"RES-000-22-2057","fundValue":"73670","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kaye Frances Haw","coPersons":["Mark Philip Hadfield","Karl  Royle"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
