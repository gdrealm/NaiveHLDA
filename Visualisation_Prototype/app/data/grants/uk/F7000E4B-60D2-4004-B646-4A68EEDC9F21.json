{"id":"F7000E4B-60D2-4004-B646-4A68EEDC9F21","title":"VERification-Driven Asynchronous Design (VERDAD)","abstractText":"This project redefines conventional asynchronous VLSI tool flows, by incorporating verification into the heart of the design process. Assertion-based verification is used to drive the synthesis procedure by analysing the behaviour of circuits to prove properties which may be exploited for optimisation. Using verification as part of the synthesis procedure represents a major paradigm shift from existing approaches where the validity of optimisations is determined statically and verification is performed after synthesis. Combining synthesis and verification will provide practical and theoretical advances in both areas extending beyond the focus of the project domain. Results of the project will be disseminated into the VLSI community in the form of tutorials and workshops with the aim of promoting asynchronous circuits as an effective solution to the problem of process variation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G02930X/1","grantId":"EP/G02930X/1","fundValue":"373569","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Furber","coPersons":["Douglas Andrew Edwards"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The following research contributions have been made during this project:\n\nTechniques to synthesise petri-net models have been added to the Teak synthesis system to allow petri-net models of Teak descriptions to be synthesised and verified using unfolding tools PUNF and MPSAT.\n\nThe petri-net models were used to identify errors in the existing Teak latch insertion scheme that causes deadlock under certain conditions and a new deadlock free scheme was implemented and validated using the models\n\nA structural based deadlock detection scheme was created which can identifies malformed structures in Teak circuits which may cause deadlocks. Structural techniques have an order of magnitude performance increase over reachability-based techniques.\n\nNew performance based latch insertion schemes have been developed that analyse the delay of cycles within Teak circuits to optimise the performance of synthesised circuits showing 40% improvement over existing techniques\n\nA new formalism for constructing quasi-delay insensitive combinational logic circuits was developed, the formalism determines the conditions necessary for technology-independent implementation of any QDI CL circuit.\n\nExact and heuristic algorithms were created to efficiently synthesise any m-of-n encoded QDI combinational logic circuit.\n\nA formal definition for block-level relaxation was defined for arbitrarily encoded QDI CL circuits and algorithms were developed to synthesise relaxed QDI CL circuits\n\nA multi-level synthesis system was defined for QDI CL circuits that allows minimised implementations of arbitrary encoded QDI circuits to be created. Formal proofs were defined to ensure that all of the optimisations applied during the synthesis process uphold the QDI property. All the tools developed during the project have direct applications in the area of microelectronics and there should be few barriers to their adoption in a commercial context The software developed during the project will be made publicly available under a GPL license. The Teak synthesis system is being actively used by several sites globally leading to publications from institutions in Brazil and China. The developments undertaken in this project are being exploited in the GAELS EPSRC project (EP/I038306/1). Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
