Atmospheric loading of particulate matter also has serious implications for urban air quality. Historically, it was assumed that aerosol particles were composed only of inorganic material. However, it has been found that organic components may constitute a substantial fraction of the aerosol composition, ranging from 20-60% of the fine particulate matter depending on the location. Condensed organic material is either directly emitted (primary) or formed in-situ by condensation and transformation of low-volatility and semi-volatile products derived from photo-oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (secondary organic aerosol:SOA). Gas-to-aerosol partitioning, or creation of SOA, is key to determining the chemical composition and loading of aerosol particles. A detailed knowledge of the formation, properties and transformation of SOA is therefore required to evaluate its impact on atmospheric processes, climate and human health. However, organic material can comprise many thousands, as yet largely unidentified, compounds with a vast range of properties. As a consequence, the chemical and physical processes associated with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation are complex and varied, and a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation does not exist and therefore represents a major research challenge in atmospheric science!\n\nKey uncertainties associated with our understanding of SOA formation have been identified. A compound will partition to the particulate phase if its equilibrium vapour pressure is low enough. This is dependent on the pure component vapour pressure, which can further decrease if the compound undergoes condensed phase reactions in the aerosol phase, enhancing gas/particle partitioning. Unfortunately, uncertainties associated with pure component vapour pressures and effective volatility of mixtures are enough to cause uncertainties in aerosol mass spanning up to 4 orders of magnitude. Vapour pressure predictive techniques are largely based on atmospherically irrelevant compounds used within industrial engineering and there is a large gap concerning the rates and importance of postulated relevant condensed phase reactions which we cannot even elucidate on using current analytical laboratory techniques.\n\nIn this proposal we aim to address these fundamental uncertainties via \n\n1) Measurement of pure component vapour pressures using our well-established and validated method of Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry. The resulting data will be assimilated into the Dortmund Databank (DDB) and new model revisions will be carried out by our industrial partner.\n\n2) Directly link chemical composition to volatility within mixtures for the first time\n\n3) Assess the complexity required to truly capture the SOA formation in atmospheric models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J009202/1","grantId":"NE/J009202/1","fundValue":"345824","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  As a follow on from a previous NERC grant, we have used this work to create an international community now focused on resolving the critically important issue of aerosol volatility.

Not only that, we have helped foster an international community to better understand this challenging area of research that impacts on how we better predict air-quality and climate of the future. The focus of this project has impacts in many other fields. By exploiting the development of a novel web-portal on another NERC grant, we hope developments made here can be used by others.
