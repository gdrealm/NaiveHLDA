The asylum system clearly awards certain ‘rights’ (of residence, protection and future citizenship) to acknowledged ‘refugees’, but it also disciplines and excludes far larger numbers of asylum applicants and ‘illegal’ immigrants. The system is regulated by national and international law; the former, implemented by the Home Office, tends towards a restrictive approach to asylum while the latter provides judges with a broader set of legal instrument with which to assess asylum cases.</p> \n<p>This project seeks to shed light on the tensions in and work of the asylum system by focusing on the experience of asylum applicants from the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia &amp; Eritrea) through: </p> \n<ol> \n <li>undertaking research with refugee communities in the UK about the situation experienced by individual asylum applicants;</li> \n <li>researching the work of immigration lawyers/case-workers who prepare and argue individual asylum cases; and</li> \n <li>by analysing the work of the immigration (and, where necessary, the Administrative) Courts as they determine asylum claims.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0296","grantId":"RES-062-23-0296","fundValue":"312622","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
