{"id":"8692136E-CB49-4AB9-8536-DB9217BC06DD","title":"Designer TIMPs: Therapeutic applications against TACE-related diseases","abstractText":"TNF-alpha is a key protein produced by our body as part of the self-defense machinery. Excessive levels of TNF-alpha are known to lead to many common inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. The agent responsible for the release of TNF-alpha is an enzyme called TACE. Medications that slow down or partially destroy the activity of TACE have been shown to prevent the destruction of vital organs and subsequently lead to a better clinical prognosis. In the human body, TACE is controlled by a group of natural inhibitors - the TIMPs. Given the significance of TACE and its impact on human health, it is importance for us to learn to control the activity of the enzyme, and should it be necessary, know how to destroy it. In this project, we aim to unlock the secret of TACE regulation by the TIMPs. We have created a new generation of 'designer TIMPs' that are highly potent against TACE and wish to investigate their inhibitory behaviours under physiological conditions. Furthermore we are interested in developing these designer TIMPs into therapeutic agents against TACE-related diseases. Strategies will be developed to enhance the potency as well as the delivery efficiency of the TIMPs to the sites where their remedial effects are most required. It is our hope that this project will lead to the creation of a novel class of safe drugs that could be used to treat patients suffering from disorders caused by inappropriate activity of TACE enzyme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E004288/1","grantId":"BB/E004288/1","fundValue":"305063","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Only in further basic research by collaborators  ","person":"Gillian  Murphy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" 1.We further characterised the structure-function relationships of key tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs and their activity in model systems. \n\n2.Mutagenesis studies showed that surface anchored forms of TIMP-3 are more effective than wild type TIMP-3 in cell based assays of disintegrin metalloproteinase activity. \n\n3.The anchored TIMPs also delayed A549 lung tumour progression in vivo (unpublished work carried out by MHL at the University of Toronto)\n\nPublications:\n\n M.H.Lee, S.Atkinson, G.Murphy Delineation of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)-binding motifs of TIMP-3 and its transplantation to TIMP-1 J.
