Over the course of our lives, an enormous amount of information is stored in memory - in effect, the record of our lives. Different situations require us to selectively retrieve information relevant to the situation or task at hand from this record without being inundated with a flood of task-irrelevant information that is also stored in memory. The fact that we are able to do this indicates that we exert a significant degree of control over what is and is not retrieved from memory. This research proposal is concerned with understanding both the functional nature of these memory control processes (i.e. what are they, and what do they do?), as well as identifying the brain regions that are associated with these processes. Understanding how memory control processes operate in healthy individuals will provide insight into the reasons why ageing and various patient populations (such as those suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's Disease) experience memory problems. These impairments are often specific to the retrieval of task-relevant information from memory, in that these populations are often either unable to retrieve information when needed, or are unable to filter out the retrieval of irrelevant information. Some evidence exists to suggest that these problems can be reduced if appropriate retrieval strategies are provided, which suggests that the locus of these memory impairments is not necessarily the ability to remember information, but rather the ability to spontaneously adopt appropriate retrieval strategies (i.e. the ability to control retrieval). Refining our understanding of how these processes operate in healthy participants - and the brain regions involved - will permit greater understanding of memory impairments in other populations. This research programme will employ a variety of brain imaging methods to explore these issues. This is because no imaging method provides all the information needed to understand the brain basis of behaviour fully. Some methods, such as EEG and MEG, give detailed information regarding the timecourse of brain activity and the frequencies involved. Others, such as fMRI, give much more detailed anatomical information (i.e. specifically which brain regions are associated with the processes of interest). Employing a variety of methods in this research programme will not only permit a greater understanding of the neural basis of memory control processes, but will also provide insight into how brain imaging data collected using each of these techniques relate to each other.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E009921/1","grantId":"BB/E009921/1","fundValue":"289442","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Wilding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
