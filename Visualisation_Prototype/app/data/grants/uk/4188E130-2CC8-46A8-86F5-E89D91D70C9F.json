Moreover, the organic syntheses of these materials allow for great flexibility in the tuning of their electronic and optical properties. By combining these properties, organic semiconductors such as conjugated polymers and small molecules have been demonstrated as the active layer in a wide range of optical and electronic devices including photovoltaic solar cells. The leading design of organic solar cells is based on the bulk heterojunction , in which organic blends comprising an electron donating component (usually a conjugated polymer) and an electron accepting component (such as a fullerene derivative or a conjugated polymer) that are dissolved in the same solvent and then spin-coated from the solution to form a thin film, sandwiched between two different electrodes. Recent developments in materials and device fabrication processes are leading to rapid improvements in performance of these devices. For example, solar conversion efficiencies up to 5-6 % were reported for solution-processed organic solar cells. Despite their significantly improved device performance, a number of scientific challenges remain to more fully understand, quantify, and predict the behaviour of the organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. In particular, the dependence of device performance on the thin film morphology of organic blends and the factors affecting the development of specific thin film structures from blend solutions are still poorly understood. To understand the interplay between the organic blend thin films and devices, it is therefore important to identify the structure-property relationship of the organic materials and its effects on device performance.Our work at Imperial College London seeks to provide key fundamental and technological insights into this issue. We aim to clarify the structure-property-performance relationships of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. We will achieve this aim through a combined application of scanning probe microscopic techniques and optical and electrical techniques to identify the nature of organic nanostructures and interfaces in terms of their chemical, physical, optical, and electrical properties, and thus to clarify the role of these organic nanostructures and interfaces on device performance. It is our vision that only the fully complementary information obtained by measurements of these properties will be able to provide the necessary powerful tool to study organic nanostructures and interfaces and thus to further develop organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G062056/1","grantId":"EP/G062056/1","fundValue":"288685","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ji-Seon  Kim","coPersons":["Saif Ahmed Haque","Iain  McCulloch","Jenny  Nelson","Donal Donat Bradley"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Organic semiconductors combine the semiconductor properties traditionally associated with inorganic materials with the more desirable properties of plastics such as low cost, flexibility and ease of processing and patterning. Recent developments in materials and device fabrication processes are leading to rapid improvements in performance of organic devices (e.g. solar conversion efficiencies up to 9-10 % were reported for solution-processed organic solar cells). Despite their significantly improved device performance, a number of scientific challenges remain to more fully understand, quantify, and predict the behaviour of the organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.\n\n\n\nThe main aim of the project was to clarify the structure-property-performance relationships of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. We have achieved this aim through a combined application of scanning probe microscopic techniques and optical and electrical techniques to identify the nature of organic nanostructures and interfaces in terms of their chemical, physical, optical, and electrical properties, and thus to clarify the role of these organic nanostructures and interfaces on OPV device performance.\n\n\n\nFirst, we demonstrated the use of AR-XPS (also UPS) and PC-AFM techniques to probe thin film structures of OPV blend films and devices. Second, we developed resonant and polarised Raman spectroscopy techniques as a simple and powerful technique to probe the degree of local molecular order and orientation of organic semiconductors in OPV films. Third, we built and demonstrated PC-AFM technique to image the local optoelectronic properties of organic blends in working OPV devices with high spatial and depth resolution. Fourth, we demonstrated simultaneous Raman-AFM measurement for simultaneous determination of physical, chemical and structural properties of organic semiconductors using light emitting polymer nanowires.\n\n\n\nBased on this combined application of advanced techniques, we clarified the crucial structure-property-performance relationships in the OPV blend films and devices. They include important findings that an increase in the regularity of the side-chain of P3HT polymer enhances its degree of molecular order and substituting the sulphur atoms in P3HT with selenium atoms leads to better crystal quality but less fraction of crystalline-phase. An amorphous phase of polymer can mix better with PCBM small molecules suppressing the formation of micrometer sized PCBM aggregates, which strongly influence photocurrent generation and thus ultimate device performance. In addition, self-assembly of P3HT polymers into nanowires leads to higher degree of molecular order enhancing charge transport properties and thus increasing OPV device efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe key advances in organic semiconductor nanostructures and interfaces achieved throughout this project provide important insight into a design rule of organic semiconductor and devices, not only for future development in organic solar cells but also for other novel molecular electronics. Based on this project, we have published 10 refereed papers in high impact journals including J. Am. Chem. Soc., Adv. Funct. Mater. and Energy Environ. Sci. and 1 invited book chapter in &quot;Optoelectronic Devices and Properties&quot;. Two more papers have been recently submitted. I believe that this project has been very successful and our research has been greatly benefited from this EPSRC-NPL post-doctoral research partnerships grant. This project was a basic research programme that leaded to advances in the science and technology of organic semiconductors and their devices, with a particular focus on organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. Its impact based on fundamental understanding of organic semiconductors and their nanostructures is, however, expected towards much broader areas of organic electronics. Furthermore, this project was multidisciplinary, providing us a unique and invaluable opportunity to establish a strong working relationship with NPL (UK), which leads to publication of high impact scientific papers and additional new research grants for further collaboration (see Appendix C). It also provides us an opportunity to work closely with other national and international academic and industrial organisations with world-leading experts in organic semiconductors and devices. Several industrial organisations such as Cambridge Display Technology Ltd (UK)/ Sumitomo Chemical Company (Japan), Cytec Engineered Materials (UK) and Samsung Mobile Display (South Korea) have shown strong interest in our research outputs, in particular scanning probe microscopic techniques developed in this project, which has already led to an industrial support for CASE studentship (one awarded from CDT/Sumitomo Chemical Company). Two additional studentships (from Cytec Engineered Materials and CDT/Sumitomo Chemical Company) as well as research support from Samsung Mobile Display are under negotiation. Awarding these grants will enable me to continue research towards future potential industrial exploitation of this project.\n The key results obtained in this project have been presented at various international/ national conferences/ workshops and industrial organisations as invited lectures/ seminars and published in scientific journals of high visibility. Further research focusing on Organic Semiconductors for Plastic Electronics will be carried out based on further research support that has arisen as a result of the work supported under this grant. I have been awarded 7 research grants in this research area since 2009 from various research funding sources including EPSRC, Technology Strategy Board (TSB), Industrial Organisations, British Embassy and Imperial College. By securing these research grants, I have been able to set up new nanoanalysis facilities including scanning probe microscope techniques, which are essential for my research and also have been able to establish my research group with 7 PhD students and 3 Post-doctoral researchers so far. At the appropriate stage, main research results achieved in this project will be continuously presented at scientific meetings and published in high quality scientific journals as before.
