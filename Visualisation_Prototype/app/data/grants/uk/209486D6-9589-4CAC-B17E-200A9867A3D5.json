{"id":"209486D6-9589-4CAC-B17E-200A9867A3D5","title":"Astronomical Instrumentation for Ground- and Space- Based Telescopes","abstractText":"We propose a continuation of our successful rolling programme of research and development in astronomical instrumentation for ground- and space-based telescopes. The primary goals are to investigate key technologies for the next generation of large and extremely large telescopes which will rely heavily on adaptive optics to deliver their full scientific potential. Over the period 2007-2012 we propose to develop high fidelity simulations of adaptive optics systems and to test the performance of very high order wavefront correctors in the laboratory. We will also continue our joint programme with ESO to develop a next generation real-time control system for future adaptive optics systems and explore the use of new techniques in determining site the charachterisation parameters relevant to extremely large telescopes. We will continue to develop our in-house manufacturing capability for high precision micro-optics components and explore the potential of photonic crystal devices to deliver fundamental new capabilities in spectroscopic instrumentation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001041/1","grantId":"PP/E001041/1","fundValue":"2780710","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ray Martin Sharples","coPersons":["Gordon  Love","Jeremy  Allington-Smith","David  Robertson","Simon Leo Morris","Richard Michael Myers"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
