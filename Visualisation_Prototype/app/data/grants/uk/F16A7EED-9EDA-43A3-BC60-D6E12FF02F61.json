{"id":"F16A7EED-9EDA-43A3-BC60-D6E12FF02F61","title":"Enhanced solar light harvesting and charge transport in dye-sensitized solar cells","abstractText":"Dye-sensitized solar cells are moderately efficient with verified solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 12% reported. However, even in the state-of-the-art systems only a fraction of the incident sun light is absorbed, implying substantial scope for improvement. Here we develop both state-of-the-art liquid electrolyte based DSCs and contemporary solid-state hybrid DSCs with the target being to considerably enhance the light capture and adsorption in these devices and also significantly improve the charge transport characteristics. Routes to both improve the photonic structure of the solar cells, create improved semiconducting oxide electrodes for enhanced charge transport and collection and develop and optimise new sensitizers for these systems shall be undertaken.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G049653/1","grantId":"EP/G049653/1","fundValue":"101895","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Henry James Snaith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
