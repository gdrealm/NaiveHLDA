{"id":"BE96761B-D2FC-49FE-AE0F-A5FFACCC257C","title":"The Roman Shaping of Greek Cultural Identity 30 BC-AD 267","abstractText":"The aim is to complete a project which reassesses Greek culture under Roman rule. It demonstrates that the archaism characterising provincial Hellenism from the 1st cent BX onwards was, broadly speaking, the Greek expression of the process of 'becoming Roman.' It uses case-studies to show that provincial Greek elites emulated the hegemonic version of Hellenism favoured by Roman cultural and political elites in the capital and projected back into the provinces by the deepening penetration of Roman power from Augustus on. Greek notables reconfigured Greek culture to match Roman preferences for an antique, idealised Hellenism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113031/1","grantId":"113031/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony  Spawforth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
