In particular, JASMIN WEST created and continue to support facilities for the analysis of palaeoclimate studies. Although broadly similar to similar issues tackled by other parts of JASMIN, studies of past climate require multi-millennial simulation of climate models of medium resolution which creates special challenges in terms of size and number of output files. The facilities continue to be heavily used for past climate change research, and thus continues to facilitate progress in this area for a wide variety of projects. Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
