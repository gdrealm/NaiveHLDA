These protein degrading enzymes, proteinases are numerous and have over lapping structures and properties, We plan to make novel inhibitory molecules that prevent the action of individual proteinases by binding to them in a very specific way. We contend that such inhibitors will teach us more about the way that proteinases function and will give guidelines for the design of new inhibitors with therapeutic potential against diseases such as cancer.\nCommunication of our results is largely achieved through scientific means (publications, poster presentations, web sites) and departmental Open days. GM has also been involved in telephone interviews with the media and has spoken on local radio.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400637","grantId":"G0400637","fundValue":"462918","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian  Murphy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
