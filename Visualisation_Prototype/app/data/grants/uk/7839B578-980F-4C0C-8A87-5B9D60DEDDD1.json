This enhances social science analyses of behaviour in society, industry understanding of behaviour in markets and government policy-maker's understanding of the global Digital Economy. In this way the Grid enables global collaborations between data holders where benefits are shared and innovation in product and service development is promoted. </p>\n\n<p>The economies of East Asia, and particularly China, define the world's largest market in a single time zone, generating the majority of global economic growth. The relationship to UK supply and demand makes improved understanding critical to innovation processes through which industry generates and sustains competitiveness. </p>\n\n<p>This project builds on ESRC-funded work establishing Grid-based collaborations with China, and EU-funded work providing direct communications networks to East Asia. Based on demonstrated technical capabilities it explores collaboration from a socio-technical perspective to build a framework for collaboration that directly engages with industry in both the UK and China. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0066","grantId":"RES-189-25-0066","fundValue":"95020","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashley Duncan  Lloyd","coPersons":["Terence  Sloan"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
