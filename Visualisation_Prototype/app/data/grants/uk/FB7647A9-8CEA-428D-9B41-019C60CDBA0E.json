By incorporating this extra information into models of contagion this study will considerably improve the understanding of observed patterns of infectious disease within communities, how they may be best controlled in terms of efficacy and resources, and to robustly inform public-health policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004255/1","grantId":"ES/K004255/1","fundValue":"159618","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Due to the short time of the project, no findings have been used by policy makers.\n\nWe are in communication with Public Health England regarding our findings as well as their data and analysis needs for modelling of infectious diseases. We have also been in communication with the equivalent organisation in the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to make them aware of our work and the potential for a similar study using US data.\n\nWe are currently preparing two manuscripts arising from this work: the first will describe the systematic identification of data sources and to make the modelling community aware of the information available to parameterise models of society; the second will present the findings from the detailed household model of disease transmission.

In total, we identified and reviewed 147 publicly-available information sources, of which we identified 44 which have directly relevant information. These identified data sources will be of immediate use for researchers wishing to model the structure of society and social interactions, in particular to model the spread and control of infectious diseases.\n\nOur analysis focused on 3 studies with direct information about social interactions, and 8 information sources which contained detailed information regarding co-location of individuals (which types of people tend to interact or share common space). Of these 8, we conducted extensive analysis of 4 studies which are large studies of co-habitation and describe which types of people live with each other. \n\nWe devised a framework of individual attributes and characteristics with which to amalgamate information from different sources and studies in a consistent manner. Data were collated under this framework to produce a very large data-set of sampled households, the individuals who live in each household, and various attributes of those individuals and their households. These individual attributes include the age, sex ethnicity and occupation of individuals. For households, attributes include the number of people living in the household as well as information such as number of bedrooms -- information which has previously not been incorporated into mathematical models of epidemics, yet may have a great impact on the transmission dynamics of certain infections, such as influenza.\n\nUsing the collated data-set, we developed a realistic mathematical simulation model of social interactions and transmission of infection within and between households. With this model, we have shown that striking inequalities in disease risk arise naturally as a consequence of the choices people make in who they live with. Our work will be of interest to many researchers attempting to model infectious disease transmission and control (including the cost-benefit analysis of new vaccine policies) within Great Britain.\n\nTo this end, we will make available demographic-attribute based 'mixing' matrices for a variety of attributes. These tables describe the probability of individuals of different demography cohabiting or co-locating, and are based on secondary analysis of identified data sources. They will be presented in a form suitable for modellers to 'plug-in' to existing models. We anticipate that they will be considered for use by the modelling teams at Public Health England.\n\nThese matrices will be useful for research beyond the realm of infectious disease modelling, in that they will be available and relevant to any researcher attempting to characterise contagious processes within Britain; we anticipate they will be important for modelling the influence of peers on lifestyles and health (such as smoking and obesity) as well as the spread and maintenance of political and other beliefs.
