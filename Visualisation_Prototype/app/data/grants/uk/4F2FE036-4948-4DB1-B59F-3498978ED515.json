{"id":"4F2FE036-4948-4DB1-B59F-3498978ED515","title":"University of Surrey Ion Beam Centre","abstractText":"This proposal is to support the development, training and core componants of the successful national Ion Beam Centre. Innovations over the next four years include: extending the DanFysik Implanter to give a low energy capability (down to 200 eV); replacing the beam line on the 2MV implanter to give an 8 inch wafer capability; add a verifiable low dose capability for ion beam induced damage studies. Funding is being sort from other sources to also build a horizontal and vertical nanobeam to expand both ion beam analysis capabilities and exploit research at the biomedical interface.An added advantage of these developments will be to place the IBC in a position that it will be able to expand its research base from micro electronic materials into new areas including cultural heritage, biomedical applications, nanotechnology and geology and cosmology. In 4 years time we expect the IBC to be funded: One third from industry; one third from other funding bodies; one third from EPSRC. This will significantly reduce the amount of funding requested from EPSRC.Efficiency gains within the IBC will allow us to reduce the ticket price from 240 currently to 180 for this new grant period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D032210/1","grantId":"EP/D032210/1","fundValue":"2271580","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The ion beam facilities available at Surrey continued to be used and supported a large number (40) of EPSRC full grants during this time period.

It provided 6828 beam hours to EPSRC projects as full grants, pump priming activities for EPSRC student projects and a quality assurance and development programme. During this time period a new technique to analyse the heavy metal components of proteins using PIXE was developed and exploited by a number of small start up companies and University research groups. Generally Ion Beam Analysis techniques and ion implantation facilities for academic and industrial users continued to be required. The provision of ion beam facilities to many other EPSRC grants has allowed for successful completion of these grants. Without the provision of the ion beam facilities many of these grants would not have been able to contemplated.
