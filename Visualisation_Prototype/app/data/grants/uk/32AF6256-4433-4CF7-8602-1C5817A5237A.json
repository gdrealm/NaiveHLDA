The Higgs mechanism, which gives mass to the bare quarks, is responsible for only a small fraction of the nucleon mass. The confinement of quarks within mesons and baryons is a direct consequence of their fundamental interactions. The field theory of the strong nuclear force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is now well established, and yet the phenomena described above cannot be understood from the QCD Lagrangian; they are emergent properties that arise from the unique complexity of these interactions. QCD is as yet intractable at the mass scale of nucleons and nuclei, so a clear picture of the fundamental nature of matter at these energies does not yet exist. However, this situation is set to change, and both theoretical and experimental developments in the coming decade are expected to revolutionise our understanding of nuclear matter within the context of QCD and the Standard Model. \n\nWe have an ambitious plan of work that encompasses the development of research programmes from existing themes, possibilities for new physics measurements that have opened up recently, and the completion of physics projects from data that has been previously obtained. Our programme will build on the work of our previous consolidated grant and we will exploit the investment in manpower and equipment to address the current issues in our field at the highest possible level, at the world's top facilities. The challenges for the science programme are encapsulated by several key questions, which we group together as they roughly match the themes we have defined:\n\n* What is the mechanism for confining quarks and gluons in strongly interacting particles (hadrons)?\n* What is the structure of the proton and neutron, and how do hadrons get their mass and spin? \n\n* Can we understand the excitation spectra of hadrons from the quark-quark interaction? \n* Do exotic hadrons (multiquark states, hybrid mesons and glueballs) exist? \n\n* How do nuclear forces arise from QCD? \n* What is the equation of state of nuclear matter? \n\n* What is the nature of dark matter?\n\nWe will address these questions by leading experimental programmes at two of the world's leading facilities:\n\n* Jefferson Lab, Newport News, Virginia, USA (JLab)\n* MAMI, Mainz, Germany:","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005700/1","grantId":"ST/L005700/1","fundValue":"35046","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Ireland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
