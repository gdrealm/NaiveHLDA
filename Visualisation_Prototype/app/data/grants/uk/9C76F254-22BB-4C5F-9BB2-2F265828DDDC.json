{"id":"9C76F254-22BB-4C5F-9BB2-2F265828DDDC","title":"Public Services: Exit and Voice as Means of Enhancing Service Delivery Phase 2.","abstractText":"<p>This research continues our panel survey of the first stage. It applies the ideas expressed in Albert Hirschmanâ€™s book, Exit, Voice and Loyalty. He argued that there is a trade-off between exit and voice, which may decrease efficiency because the voice of consumers keeps organisations responsive whereas exit leaves the poor performers behind. In public services, citizens may exit from public provision by moving across jurisdictions and/or moving to other private sector providers. Citizens may use collective voice through: voting and pressure group activity or private voice by personal complaints and comments to public officials. We test whether the possibility of exit makes voice less likely, which suggests that the greater complexity at the local level and new provision introducing more choice, allowing for greater exit opportunities, should cause the quality of local participation to suffer. We will also test whether loyalty in the form of the level of social investment in a community or social capital should increase the probability of voice over exit. We use a panel survey of a representative group of 2000 internet users, asking questions about service satisfaction, use of private services, other exit opportunities, social investment into the local community, and the level of participation. The panel survey will run for a total of five years.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0012","grantId":"RES-166-25-0012","fundValue":"66005","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith  Dowding","coPersons":["Peter  John"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
