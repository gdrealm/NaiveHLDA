This appears to be the most versatile method of optical switching available. It makes possible scalable low-loss multicasting, wavefront control and even programmable control of noise fields. Because it combines a number of functions into a single flexible, programmable module and enables real-time configuration and network management, the holographic LCoS module has significant advantages over competing technologies. As the bandwidth requirements of telecommunications networks increase, optical fibres will be deployed nearer to the customer which will require each neighbourhood or building complex to have such an optical interconnect, providing a large potential market for the module.Previous work by the applicants led to the first LCoS device designed for operation in the telecommunications c-band. This proposal is intended to develop the LCoS research devices and incorporate the technology into a functional demonstrator.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007571/1","grantId":"EP/H007571/1","fundValue":"150068","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The technology demonstrated during the ACCESS project has led to the setting up of a company, ROADMap Systems Ltd.

Advances in both the optical design of the switch and in hologram optimization allowed us to demonstrate multi-casting (routing light to more than one output fibre), and static and dynamic crosstalk reduction. The optical and hologram design results are not only applicable to telecom network switches. Other areas that might benefit from the project's advances in multi-casting and crosstalk reduction include switches for data centres, sensor networks, optical power distribution for laser based manufacturing and for image projection systems, and medical photonics.
