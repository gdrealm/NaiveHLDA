{"id":"AAAD42FA-AFE5-4147-B30F-BCB91BF0FD48","title":"Parallel mesh adaptation for multi-physics problems","abstractText":"Many physical and engineering problems involve the interaction of multiplephysical processes (e.g. fluid-structure interaction, thermal convection in fluids and thermo-elasticity problems). In many cases, the numerical simulation of these multi-physicsproblems requires substantial computational resources and is only feasible if modern computer architectures (such as parallel processors) are used effectively. It is the aim of this project to complete the parallelisation of oomph-lib,the object-oriented multi-physics finite element library, available as open-sourcesoftware at http://www.oomph-lib.org, by implementing parallel mesh adaptationprocedures for multi-physics problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F010435/1","grantId":"EP/F010435/1","fundValue":"127036","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2009-03-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthias  Heil","coPersons":["Andrew  Hazel"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
