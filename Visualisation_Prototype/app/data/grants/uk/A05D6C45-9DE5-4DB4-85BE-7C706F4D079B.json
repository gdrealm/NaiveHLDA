{"id":"A05D6C45-9DE5-4DB4-85BE-7C706F4D079B","title":"Investigating the Role of the Ribosome in Membrane Protein Biogenesis","abstractText":"Living organisms are made up of cells. Cells require barriers or membranes to physically separate themselves from the environment and hence maintain their integrity. Internally, cells contain compartments which are again bounded by membranes. Such internal compartments within the cells allow processes which would otherwise interfere with each other to occur simultaneously. They also allow the generation of energy which powers the rest of the cell. Although the presence of membranes acting as barriers is essential, if the membrane is completely impermeable the cell cannot survive as molecules such as nutrients cannot enter the cell and likewise waste products can not be expelled. To overcome this problem, membranes contain large molecules called proteins, which allow the movement of specific molecules from one side of the membrane to the other. They allow a cell to tightly control what enters and leaves the cell. Membrane proteins can also act as signal relays, sensing molecules or processes occurring outside the cell and then triggering events inside the cell in response. The importance of these membrane proteins is highlighted in many diseases where a single membrane protein is defective and can no longer permit movement of a specific molecule. A good example would be cystic fibrosis where a protein that allows movement of chloride ions fails to function leading to the disease. Having seen that membrane proteins play such important functions and that when they are absent or fail to work properly the consequences for the cell are severe. It is therefore important to understand how such protein are made in the cell, particularly as some diseases including cystic fibrosis are caused when the membrane protein is not made correctly. Proteins are made by large complex machines termed ribosomes. Not only does the ribosome make the protein but it can also interact with the machinery that correctly places, or inserts, the membrane protein into the membrane. The two machineries are organised such that while the protein is still being made it starts to be inserted in to the membrane. Ribosomes make a vast array of proteins yet only around a third of them are membrane proteins. A key question of this project is to understand how the ribosome knows that it is making a membrane protein and therefore that it needs to be placed in the membrane. As new proteins are made they move from a place deep inside the ribosome through a narrow tunnel to the surface of the ribosome, where they can be released to the rest of the cell. Parts of this tunnel inside the ribosome can 'sense' when a membrane protein is being made and so the machinery that inserts the membrane proteins can be alerted that a membrane protein is on the way. This project aims to understand how the ribosome manages to do this, which bits of the ribosome are needed and what happens if it doesn't work properly. By understanding how this processes occurs normally it will help us to understand what can go wrong and how this can cause disease. The sensing of the new protein inside the tunnel within the ribosome may also be important for other types of proteins that need different machineries to help them be made correctly and so the project will also investigate what other processes in the cell fail to happen when the ribosome tunnel no longer works properly. Overall the project will help us to understand more clearly the detailed workings of the ribosome, the machine which synthesizes all proteins in the cell, and how it can respond to different types of proteins as they are being made to ensure they are then further processed correctly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H007202/1","grantId":"BB/H007202/1","fundValue":"320691","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have published our research findings in leading journals (JCB and PLoS Biology) and these papers are well cited by the protein biogenesis field reflecting their importance.\nWe have generated yeast mutants with altered recruitment of protein biogenesis factors to the ribosome.

Parts of this tunnel inside the ribosome can 'sense' when a membrane protein is being made and so the machinery that inserts the membrane proteins can be alerted that a membrane protein is on the way. We have found that a component of the tunnel called Rpl17 functions as a 'molecular switch'. In one state it allows the ribosome to recruit the machinery necessary to target membrane proteins to the membrane where they can then be inserted. In the opposite state, it recruits the machinery required to process and correctly fold up those proteins, which remain inside the cell and are not associated with membranes. We also show that the ribosome is unable to bind both these machineries simultaneously emphasizing the importance in regulating their recruitment. Mutant forms of the Rpl17 protein that are stuck in one state or the other are either unable to make membrane proteins properly or accumulate aggregates of misfolded cellular proteins, respectively.\n\nOverall the project now helps us to understand more clearly the detailed workings of the ribosome, the machine which synthesizes all proteins in the cell, and how it can respond to different types of proteins as they are being made to ensure they are then further processed correctly. Understanding how this works in healthy cells, can then help us deduce what might be happening should this go wrong in disease. \n\nIn addition, this region of the ribosome is important in the field of antibiotics; drugs such as erythromycin bind to the tunnel of the bacterial ribosome, but not to yeast or human ribosomes, and prevent proteins being made, thereby killing the bacteria. Understanding in detail how the tunnel of the ribosome works in yeast and humans compared to bacteria may allow the design of new antibiotics, which bind here but are still specific for ribosomes from bacteria. We have generated mutant Saccharomyces cerevisae yeast strains with ribosomes that have altered recruitment of protein biogenesis factors. These strains may help with over-expression of heterologous proteins in yeast for biotechnology applications. Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
