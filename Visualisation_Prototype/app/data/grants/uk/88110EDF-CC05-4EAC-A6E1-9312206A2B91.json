The emergence of new growing protocols and batch production techniques, from the process sector, have positioned this approach at the forefront of UK horticultural and exotic fruits production, both reducing the UK's requirement to import such produce and offering category managers a flexible production facility to meet changing consumer preferences. This business proposition exploits emerging materials and sensor engineering to deliver an appropriately costed in-line unit capable, for the first time, of monitoring &amp; closed-loop control of the individual major nutrients, notably N, P, K, S &amp; Ca. By integrating this with light management, within a supervisory data-acquisition &amp; control system (SCADA), 100% QA of produce may be achieved with optimised inputs and minimised energy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005151/1","grantId":"BB/M005151/1","fundValue":"150408","fundStart":"2014-07-31","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bruce Donaldson Grieve","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
