Between 2003 and 2005, I explored the beliefs of a representative sample of the UK population, using an original, innovative method. Rather than asking them obvious religious questions, like 'do you believe in God', they talked about their lives, what was important to them, how they knew right from wrong, what made them happy, sad or afraid, and who or what helped them. In 2009 I returned to the field to investigate through interviews and participant observation how their beliefs and identities may have changed as their lives - especially teenagers' - have altered significantly. \nI found that most people described their lives and beliefs as relatively stable. What change did occur was prompted by changes in social relationships and not, as other researchers may suppose, changes in 'life course'. Methodological innovation was necessary to adapt to a deterritorialised 'field' and to ensure that the returning researcher's own theories were not forcing preliminary conclusions. Findings are being disseminated through media, international conferences, schools, universities and specialised academic journals. Further research into faith transmission. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
