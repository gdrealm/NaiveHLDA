{"id":"ED54F87A-B096-4AC4-B653-756571E811A1","title":"The Development of German Idealism","abstractText":"My principle interest lies in the question of how German idealism-the philosophy of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel - developed out of that of Kant. This question has direct implications for the proper understanding of German idealist philosophy, which remains controversial. In addition I wish to argue for a higher degree of continuity than is ordinarily supposed between the ideas and issues that occupy Kant and the German idealist and later European philosophy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112963/1","grantId":"112963/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sebastian  Gardner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
