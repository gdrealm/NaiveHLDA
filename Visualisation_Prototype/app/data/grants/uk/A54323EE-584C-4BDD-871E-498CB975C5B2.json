{"id":"A54323EE-584C-4BDD-871E-498CB975C5B2","title":"Novel Variable Conductance Heat Pipe Coupled with a Stirling Engine","abstractText":"The proposed work involves the design, construction and testing on a micro-combined-heat-and-power (mCHP) unit of a\nvariable capacity heat pipe (VCHP) in which the mCHP waste heat is managed using one or more (depending upon\ncapacity of the store) novel heat pipes arranged to link with a phase change material (PCM) thermal store. Novelty lies in\nthe use of an inert gas inventory in the heat pipe whose pressure can be varied in response to domestic heating demand\nand the inclusion of a compact PCM thermal store. Variations in inert gas pressure are used to regulate the domestic\nheating system heat exchange surface area (and, hence, capacity) smoothly and continuously, whilst the PCM thermal\nstore is used to manage the availability of this heat over extended time horizons. Though the proposal is focused on\ndomestic-scale mCHP applications, the concept is equally applicable to larger scale commercial combined heat and power\nplants.\nNorthumbria's University's contribution is to develop a simulation model of the mCHP unit and VCHP and use the model to\ndesign a domestic-scale experimental pilot rig. The pilot rig will be constructed in Northumbria's Low Carbon Systems\nlaboratory using an existing Stirling cycle mCHP module. The VCHP unit will be constructed by the collaborators to the\nsizing specification designed with the assistance of the simulation model. Northumbria will perform a series of experiments\nat thermal demands relevant to typical domestic heating loads - both winter (space heating and hot water) and summer (hot\nwater only). The intention is to develop the research to a proof-of-concept stage only. A further application of the\nsimulation model will be used to design system options for a range of house types with differing occupancies and heating\ndemands. Results will be reported as a basis for possible prototying and field demonstration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505912/1","grantId":"EP/L505912/1","fundValue":"37415","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research is ongoing - nothing yet to report.
