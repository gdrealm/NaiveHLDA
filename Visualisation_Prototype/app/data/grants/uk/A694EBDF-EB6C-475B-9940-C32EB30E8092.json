Most strokes are due a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. We know that the ?clot busting? drug rt-PA, given to a person with a stroke within the first 2 or 3 hours of start of the symptoms, can improve their chances of both being alive and not being disabled from the stroke. \nBut, we know much less about the benefits in older people and in people who only get to hospital more than 3 hours after the symptoms began. \nTo find out if more patients with stroke could benefit from this treatment, we are a performing a clinical trial. It will involve several thousand people from around the world. Patients who recognise that their symptoms could be a stroke and get to hospital quickly enough will be asked to help with the study. \nIf the study establishes that a wider variety of patients can be treated, millions of people with stroke worldwide could benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400069","grantId":"G0400069","fundValue":"3274640","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Sandercock","coPersons":["Martin  Dennis","Joanna  Wardlaw"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
