There is a need for a cohesive framework to guide social science researchers through ethics processes and procedures, promoting and supporting the development of good practice and encouraging researchers to engage in the ethical issues of their research.</p>\n\n<p>The Research Ethics Guidebook is an online interactive resource for social science researchers, providing training, guidance and information throughout the 'ethics process', from developing and submitting a proposal to the eventual dissemination of study findings. A cohesive user-friendly, intuitive and interactive system will offer a practical guide that aids reflection and discussion, while mapping 'routes' through the ethics process, allowing for variation in different forms of social science research. </p>\n\n<p>The first stages of the project informed the development and content of the on-line resource, by scoping relevant systems and procedures and interviewing key stakeholders (research funders, organisations involved in social science research governance and regulation, and academic centres).&nbsp; Subsequent technical development of the guidebook was followed by a period of user testing and revision, and the Guidebook has now been launched on www.ethicsguidebook.ac.uk.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-035-25-0065","grantId":"RES-035-25-0065","fundValue":"77394","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The Ethics Guidebook website has been recommended as a resource for academic faculty and students by universities including Cambridge, Oxford, Birkbeck, Bath, Glasgow, Leeds, Sheffield.

There are signposts to more detailed information, and prompts for reflection and questioning at all stages of the research process. An interactive 'ethics principles page' is built around the six key ethics principles in the ESRC Framework for Research Ethics. \n\nThe website offers a resource for both social science researchers early in their careers and for more experienced colleagues:\n\no Researchers: To help with writing a research proposal, applying for ethics approval, or dealing with ethics dilemmas that arise during a project.\no Undergraduate and postgraduate students: As a resource for research methods assignments or discussions, or when carrying out student research projects.\no Research supervisors: To help students negotiate ethics at different stages of the research process, and as a tool for reflecting on supervisors' responsibilities in relation to ethics in student research.\no Staff development: For training of ethics committee members or research supervisors.\n\nThe Guidebook website was developed by a multi-disciplinary team at the Institute of Education, University of London. The process of development included consultation with key stakeholders (representing research funders, regulatory bodies, professional associations, and academic experts), and was informed by user testing at the Institute of Education and in other academic centres in the UK.
