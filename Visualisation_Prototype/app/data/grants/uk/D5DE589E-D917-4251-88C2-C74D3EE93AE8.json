{"id":"D5DE589E-D917-4251-88C2-C74D3EE93AE8","title":"Centre for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine","abstractText":"Every year, thousands of patients die from organ failure because there are not enough matching donors for the transplants that they need. Also, thousands of others suffer from the effects of diabetes, even though they take insulin. Existing therapies for many diseases of the brain, such as Parkinson?s and multiple sclerosis, fall far short of a cure. Stem cells could possibly provide cures for these diseases. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from embryos at the earliest stages of development, when the embryo is a microscopic, hollow ball of cells. They provide a promising means for generating many or perhaps all of the 200 specialised cell types of the body. Stem cells have been detected in other body tissues, such as the bone marrow and nervous system, and these also represent potential sources of therapeutic materials. The proposed research is designed to provide the foundations in basic knowledge of stem cell biology to build the clinical treatments that are likely to emerge from a fundamental understanding of this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300723","grantId":"G0300723","fundValue":"1579030","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Arnold Pedersen","coPersons":["Charles  Ffrench-Constant","Anthony  Green","Sarah  Bray","Anne  Cooke","Azim  Surani"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
