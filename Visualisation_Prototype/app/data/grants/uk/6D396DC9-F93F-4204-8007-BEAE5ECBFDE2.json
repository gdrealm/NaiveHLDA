{"id":"6D396DC9-F93F-4204-8007-BEAE5ECBFDE2","title":"Documentation of endangered languages and cultures in the Nigeria-Cameroon borderland","abstractText":"The Nigeria-Cameroon borderland is one of the most linguistically diverse regions of the world, with many languages either near extinction or severely endangered. This project builds on previous work by the participants in surveying and documenting endangered languages in this region. Primary focus is on the Somyewe, a small group of blacksmiths whose language and culture are on the verge of disappearing. Documentation of two other local languages will also be undertaken. Documentation will follow best practice procedures as developed by the EMELD initiative, and will be situated in context of the linguistic and cultural ecology of the region.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112306/1","grantId":"112306/1","fundValue":"220672","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Zeitlyn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
