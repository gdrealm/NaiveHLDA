{"id":"98D4FBF1-7A48-4DEC-B158-3182C7F6D76F","title":"HPC simulations of complex solids and clusters using static lattice techniques","abstractText":"We are proposing to develop and implement new software on HPC platforms which will enable new wide-ranging scientific applications in materials simulations using static lattice techniques. The project will initiate new developments in the GULP (General Utility Lattice Program) which over the last decade has become the standard code for lattice simulations, with a very substantial national and international user base of several thousand users. Current versions of the code are, however, limited to single processor or small cluster platforms, which prevents applications to the type of complex problems and systems which are addressed by materials chemistry and physics. The project will develop new software, which will be based on (i) an efficiently parallelised version of GULP; (ii) a new integrated version of GULP bringing together developments from different groups; and (iii) a new master code KLMC (Knowledge Led Master Controller) that is able to setup novel complex simulations, span multiple GULP jobs, and analyse results in order to achieve the following main application types:(a) mapping energy landscapes as a route to complex simulations of solid state reactions, enumeration and sampling of local configurations in disordered systems;(b) ion ordering in solid solutions, which show unique magnetic, superconducting, optical and catalytic properties;(c) interaction and clustering of multiple defect centres in solid state systems, for example, materials exposed to radiation;(d) structure prediction and properties for complex solids with large unit cells and large clusters or nanoparticles;(e) surface and interface structure and property determination and prediction;(f) free energy calculations of a phase transitions and calculation of diffusion paths and rates;(g) crystal growth of nanoparticles and surfaces.The project is a collaboration between multiple developers as well as academic and industrial users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I03014X/1","grantId":"EP/I03014X/1","fundValue":"272438","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The solutions used in the software developed in this project will aid the development of other client-server codes (which need not be in the field of Materials Modelling) that also aim to exploit to High Performance Computers.

Thus exploitation of National High Performance Platforms has become possible and crucially new science enabled. This development is aimed at resolving the problems occurring in modelling complex materials, their structure and properties, that in particular require massive samplings of configurational spaces and/or hierarchical simulations. KLMC automates many tasks traditionally performed by the user of a range of third party codes; enable a multistage approach where the KLMC code learns on the fly and refines input files that are submitted for new calculations - hence the name knowledge led; and is able to exploit massively parallel computer platforms for a more general set of applications that may require statistical sampling. Currently KLMC is capable of updating a simple database of structures (or solutions); performing post analyses (e.g. computing radial distribution functions, ensemble average - Boltzmann weighted - properties); generating and reading input and outputs files for commonly used materials codes (GULP, FHI-AIMS, VASP and NWCHEM), and running these either on the same platform (either through system calls or as library files) or remotely (KLMC runs itself on a local machine and many individual calculations, or tasks on larger resources elsewhere). Applications include: simple task farming (screening structures from the database through a third party code); structure prediction of nano-sized clusters, surfaces and bulk phases using a range of global optimisation techniques based on basin hopping and genetic algorithms; exploration of ergodic regions (application of the energy lid or threshold algorithm); and statistical sampling of solid solutions or multiple point defects in a crystalline solid, allowing for statistical sampling not only of potential energy, but also more generally any thermodynamical potential of interest.\n\nSupport from this grant also included parallelisation work of the third party code, GULP, and, moreover, enabled the creation of a suitable library version of the third party code FHI-AIMS for KLMC (and potentially other codes) to utilise.\n\nThe overall objective to enable new science, employing the KLMC code, by software developments and enhancements was achieved. Moreover, the progress made in this phase 1 did impress the four referees assigned to assess our application for phase 2 funding, all of whom gave our phase 2 proposal the maximum score. Potentially, KLMC software can be used by secondary schools, or colleges, and moreover there is a high potential for future commercialisation of the KLMC software.\nThe new code enables a host of new complex atomistic simulations to be performed with relative ease and efficiency on modern HPC platforms, and has been distributed to a number of external users, current beta-testers, forming a nucleus of a future KLMC user base. In particular, D. Scanlon (UCL) and P. Ngoepe (Limpopo, South Africa) are currently using KLMC to investigate defect chemistry and doping of ZnO and Li doped manganese dioxide. I. Demiroglu and S. Bromley (Barcelona, Spain) are studying the effect of a metallic surface on the structure of ZnO nanoparticles. A. Walsh (Bath) is studying ion exchange and transport in the quaternary Cu-based semiconductors, which adopt the kesterite mineral structure, of relevance to solar energy applications; and, with J. Bristol, open-shell, Fe doping in alumina. C. Sch?n and M. Jansen (Stuttgart MPI) are working on structure prediction of zinc oxysulphide bulk phases, materials used in desulpharisation of methane in fuel cell devices. Other exciting applications of KLMC include the work undertaken by D. Mor?-Fonz (a PhD Student at UCL funded by the Mexican Government) who is using KLMC to predict the atomic structure of ZnO polar surfaces; and D. Deacon-Smith (UCL PhD student provided as institutional support) who is investigating the structure and composition of external surfaces of perovskite materials that have been reported to support a two-dimensional electronic gas (so called 2DEG).
