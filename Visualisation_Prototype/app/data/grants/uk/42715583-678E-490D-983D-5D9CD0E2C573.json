This study investigates the cultural representation of women in Nigeria and how TfD can be used effectively to empower and mobilise women's participation in development and change. It investigates the growth of local NGOs and women's organisations and TfD practice in Nigeria, the challenges facing its use of indigenous performance techniques to facilitate women's participation in development at grassroots level and the possibilities of alternative models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119645/1","grantId":"119645/1","fundValue":"4960","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jumai Rachel Ewu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Northampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
