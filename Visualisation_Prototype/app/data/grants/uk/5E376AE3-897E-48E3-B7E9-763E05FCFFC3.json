These creative citizens, some organised in groups and networks, some not, are the bedrock of the creative economy. As such, they underpin the intangible assets of the &quot;knowledge economy&quot; upon which the UK depends for its prosperity.\n\nAt present, there is much that we do not know about our creative citizens. Why do they do what they do? What is the value of their creativity, to them as individuals and to their communities? How is their potential changed by the emergence of communications technologies which permit on-line social networking? Does inequality of digital access undermine this new creative citizenship? Are today's creative citizens capable of providing more local and flexible services, previously delivered by more remote public and private sector organisations? If their work is valued, what interventions and policies would facilitate their growth?\n\nThis research seeks to answer these questions by examining three manifestations of creative citizenship:\n\n- hyperlocal publishing groups, writing neighbourhood news most often as a blog site have started to emerge in scores of communities around the UK, sometimes in response to the scaling back of traditional media;\n- community-led design, which is increasingly deployed as a means of ensuring that new buildings and other products reflect the needs, creativity and aspirations of the people who will use them;\n- creative practitioner communities, which take many forms: here we explore the value-creation that arises between relatively formal communities of this kind and the growing highly informal networks of individual creative citizens, many built around online communications platforms. \n\nOur aim in studying these cases is to generate data and insight about each case, but also to answer the more general questions set out above: what is the value of their work, to these citizens as individuals, to their communities and to wider civic goals? \n\nThe background to our interest in creative citizenship arises from the way that on-line communications have enabled inviduals and small groups of individuals to engage more frequently, deftly and in greater depth with many types of organisation. Today, many companies design their products and services in close dialogue with users: this is routine for, say, video games developers, but it is also increasingly true of &quot;smart&quot; manufacturers of cars, toys and other consumer-focused industrial products, using Web2.0 technology. This shift from a &quot;user pays&quot; to a &quot;user makes&quot; approach supports the possibility of a growth in smaller-scale, more flexible and voluntary community services. Nesta, one of our partners in this project, has a laboratory for public service design based upon these principles. Glass-House Community Led Design, another partner, specialises in connecting designers and the widest possible range of stakeholders. The research will produce:-\n\n- improved data on the value, scale and potential of UK hyperlocal publishers and how they interact with traditional media; plus working with our partner (Talk About Local) sharp insights into the conditions likeliest to support the development of successful hyperlocals and the tools needed to achieve this;\n- understanding the value, potential and practicalities of community-led design, with a particular focus upon understanding the potential and limitations of digital media;\n- an evaluation of everyday, &quot;at home&quot; creative citizenship which provides an indication of its scale and potential, along with insight into the most effective ways of providing gateways between the work of these lone or loosely networked creative citizens and more formal organisations and structures. \n\nOur findings will be of value to policy-makers concerned with the development of the UK creative economy, along with strong communities of place and interest.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J005290/1","grantId":"AH/J005290/1","fundValue":"1142330","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2015-06-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We have been a very outgoing research team, conducting scores of public events over the 30 months of our programme and maintaining a website, with associated social media platforms, some of which have pushed at the frontier of innovation (eg our use of Google Hangout). Our impacts have been felt in numerous geographic communities as well as in domain-specific and in national and international contexts, academic and non-academic.\nFor example in hyperlocal news media, the research team has been active at the highly influential 'unconferences' of our partner Talk About Local, whilst also contributing directly to the statistical output of another partner, Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator. \nAnyone who attended our Creative Citizens Conference at the RCA in London (or accessed it online) would have seen the strong connections into London Design Week, of which it was part. A keynote address by Paola Antonelli, Director of R and D at New York Museum of Modern Art, began by noting the linkage between our project's design identity and the design identity of the Creative Commons Movement. Geoff Mulgan, Director of Nesta, connected his organisation's work with the concept of creative citizenship, in a context of the political re-imagining set out in his recent book, The Locust and the Bee. An epic encounter between the diverse attendees at the conference and the leaders of four London political think tanks added seminally to our insights and ambitions for political take-up of our work. Jean Burgess, the leading social media scholar from Queensland University of Technology, considered a history of Twitter. Meanwhile workshops drew out national and international linkages between creative citizenship and related concepts in the DIY, 'pro-am' space.\nIt is also important to note the overlap between the work of the Creative Citizen project and other work currently being undertaken by members of the research team. During the life of the creative citizens project, Hargreaves (PI) has provided seminal input to the intellectual property/creative economy debate, drawing on creative citizenship thinking; Dovey (Co-I) has been simultaneously running REACT, the AHRC creative economy hub, with countless valuable cross-overs; Alexiou (Co-I) and Zamenopoulos are engaged in a mesh of projects internationally which draw upon creative citizenship and contribute strongly to relevant research methods; as is Chapain (Co-I) in the field of economic and cultural geography. Harte (Co-I) and Williams (Co-i) have become closely and further involved in the development of practice in hyperlocal journalism, one manifestation of which is the Cardiff University Centre for Community Journalism, set up two years ago and the first of its kind in the world. C4CJ is, in part, a result of the creative citizens project, and it has been our partner at key events. More recently, Cardiff University's establishment of a Creative Economy Centre and its emergent role in the City Council's deliberations on economic development would not have happened without this fusion of work around the theme of creative citizenship.\nAt the same time, our early career researchers have cross-pollinated from creative citizens to numerous other points (eg citizen movements in Greece) and will continue to do so. They have given the project its tech edge.\nOur partners in community-led design (Nesta and the Glass-House Community Led Design, worked with us to produce the Creative Citizens' Variety Pack - 'inspiring digital ideas from community projects'. Glass-House's core work of helping community-led design projects to succeed has drawn directly upon all of the work in this part of the project.\nWe have also engaged directly with numerous other projects and activities during the life of this project. Particularly memorable was our encounter with the DIY Citizens group (based in Canada), but we have frequently met with great examples of creative citizenship previously unknown to us (eg The Reader Project, which promotes reading aloud in groups.). We have influenced and been influenced in countless exchanges of this kind.

We have established that 'creativity' is indeed an increasingly valued aspect of citizenship. Building upon the emergence of 'creative industries' in the late 1990s; and the 'creative economy' in the following decade our work indicates that it is valid and persuasive to argue for greater attention to be given to 'creative citizenship' - with implications for policy at all levels of government as well as for research funding, education curricula and emergent views on transdisciplinarity. This project has much to say about about the concept and the potential of the Connected Communities Programme as a whole. Taking the points suggested for this entry, we add the following:\n- new knowledge (as above, to be extended in forthcoming book, The Creative Citizen Unbound, Policy Press 2016 and Cultural Science 'special edition' 12/2014)\n- methods useful extensions of 'asset mapping' techniques and experience of purposeful co-creation with communities in digital media projects;\n- online media interventions: greater clarity about potential and limitations, importance of physical/virtual linkages;\n- multiple collaborations and interfaces with related work, some captured in highly successful conference at London RCA September 2014;\n- value of transdisciplinary working confirmed, but practical team management difficulties also noted;\n- large quantities of domain-specific findings (see publicataions) in journalism/hyperlocals; community-led planning and design; and informal/formal creative networks.\nPLEASE NOTE 'FIRST FINDINGS' PROJECT DOCUMENT\n9/2104: downloadable from creativecitizens.co.uk. We see the immediate and active agents of impact as follows:\n\n1. Our partners and their networks. We already note significant adoption and promotion of our work by partners such as Ofcom, Talk About Local, Nesta, The Glass-House Community Led Design. This is very much as we envisaged it in our bid and is substantially domain-specific.\n2. We have probed at the political and policy space, notably in an encounter staged with four of the UK's leading political think tanks at our London conference in September 2014. This helped us to think more clearly about the potential for a 'movement-style' approach to creative citizenship (possibly attractive to political parties) or, more likely, one which collaborates with related projects and actors (eg social enterprise) in a range of sectors or domains, based upon a co-creative ethic necessary in any democratic activity. (see creativecitizens.co.uk for more information). \n3. We are exploring future funding for the engagement aspect of our work, which we think has much further potential.\n4. As an immediate priority, we hope to sustain the creative citizens website, as a source of information and exchange.
