It is also used by industry as a means of checking quality and consistency of proteins produced as pharmaceuticals. This project is to develop new software, VALIDICHRO, as a tool/resource for assessing the quality of CD data, as a standards test of research good practice, in bioprocessing quality control, and as a validation method for data generated that will be shared publicly in the Protein Circular Dichroism Data Bank repository.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G023476/1","grantId":"BB/G023476/1","fundValue":"116529","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bonnie Ann Wallace","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
