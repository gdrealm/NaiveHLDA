{"id":"1DCDE8DA-5012-4C2F-93D5-8AFEBC3EA7A7","title":"Post-launch Support for UK continued involvement in the Japanese Hinode Mission","abstractText":"Hinode is an ISAS/JAXA spacecraft that was launched in September 2006. The mission is a Japan/US/UK mission that studies the Sun. Hinode is designed to answer the fundamental question of how magnetic fields are formed and interact with the atmosphere to create the activity that we observe on the Sun. This subsequently addresses all phenomena that have an impact on the Sun-Earth system, such as the formation of the solar winds (both slow and fast), triggering of flares and coronal mass ejections, and formation and maintenance of filaments and prominences. Hinode has been extremely successful fulfilling all of its mission requirements in the first 2 years of the mission. Indeed the publication rate in the second year of operation far exceeds that of Hubble during the same time period. This proposal is for continued involvement of the UK in the mission in terms of operating, calibrating, data archive and community support for the EUV Imaging Spectrometer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H000429/1","grantId":"ST/H000429/1","fundValue":"464937","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Louise Kim Harra","coPersons":["David Ronan Williams"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
