{"id":"AE25B6D4-3CA6-4934-AD95-1C1A32A3E1B7","title":"Derived categories of coherent sheaves on hyperkahler manifolds","abstractText":"Algebraic geometry, and particularly the geometry of HyperKahler manifolds, studies a highly constrained type of geometry which is very rigid with very few global symmetries. Mysterious predictions coming from dualities in string theory in physics, however, relate these spaces to symplectic manifolds: these are much more flexible geometries with many symmetries. (For instance the symmetry groups of low dimensional topology -- braid groups, mapping class groups -- occur as the symmetry groups of many symplectic manifolds.) The reason is that while the symmetries do not act on the HyperKahler manifolds themselves, they act on their categories of D-branes .This connection between algebraic geometry and low dimensional topology is a surprise and allows one to use the sophisticated and deep structures of algebraic geometry to construct invariants in low dimensional topology -- i.e. algebro-geometric data encoding properties of the low dimensional topology that can be used to distinguish different topologies or shapes . The simplest example is to produce knot invariants from algebraic geometry, giving data which can distinguish between knotted loops of string embedded into normal 3-dimensional space in different ways.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F006705/1","grantId":"EP/F006705/1","fundValue":"39903","fundStart":"2007-10-05","fundEnd":"2008-05-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Algebraic geometry studies spaces defined by polynomial equations. A lot of geometric information about these spaces is contained in an algebraic gadget called its derived category of coherent sheaves, particularly when the space is &quot;hyperkahler&quot; or &quot;Calabi-Yau&quot; -- geometric spaces that appear in string theory.\n\n\n\nAs predicted by the string-theoretic conjecture of &quot;mirror symmetry&quot; the derived category frequently has more symmetries than the space itself, and contains useful &quot;invariants&quot; of the underlying space, allowing it to be distinguished from other similar spaces. These invariants should, roughly speaking, count the &quot;D-branes&quot; in string theory.\n\n\n\nIn this project we make an infinitesimal study of the derived category, providing the necessary foundations to rigorously define such invariants and to solve a long-standing problem about symmetries of derived categories (the &quot;orientation problem&quot; for K3 surfaces).
