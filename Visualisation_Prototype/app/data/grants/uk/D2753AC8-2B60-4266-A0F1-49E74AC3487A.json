They are made by adding small amounts of magnetic materials to semiconductors. Sometimes, it seems that the magnetism arises without such magnetic additions and is related to defects (e.g. when the crystals have missing atoms) in the semiconductors. New Physics is required to explain the DMS mechanism. In this proposal, we are interested in oxides which have potential for applications at room temperature (e.g. to be used in new components in computers). We will study near-room temperature electrochemical growth of films which we find consistently produce the DMS effect. Indeed, electrochemistry is a new way to grow such DMS oxides and it is hoped that by studying the materials made by this method we will understand more about the DMS mechanism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D039894/1","grantId":"EP/D039894/1","fundValue":"58604","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2007-01-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Louise Driscoll","coPersons":["Mark  Blamire"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" We showed how to control defects in oxide dilute magnetic semiconductors. We clearly pinpointed which defects lead to magnetism. All these oxide materials are very complex and the magnetic signals are only weak. So commericial exploitation will be complex. We have learnt an enormous amount about the limitations of thin film oxides. This has a wider context to electronic oxides of other sorts. This is solid basic science which does not have an outcome tomorrow. Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
