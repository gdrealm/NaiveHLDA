{"id":"4B60F9EB-E8EC-4497-93EB-FCA9368A44A9","title":"The effect of reverberation on the representation of complex sounds in the lower auditory pathway","abstractText":"We rarely, if ever, have to detect sounds in quiet and the ability to distinguish signals under adverse conditions e.g. background noise or reverberant environments has important survival consequences. We are steadily increasing our knowledge of the neural mechanisms that exist to cope with background noise but we know little, if anything, about the neural response to reverberation. When listening to a sound in an enclosed space only part of the sound arrives directly at the listeners ears; the rest of the sound reflects from surrounding surfaces. These reflections arrive at the ear with various delays and sound levels and together form the reverberation. Most of us will have struggled with the effects of reverberation at some time in our lives, for example, being placed on speaker phone or listening to conversations in noisy rooms (e.g. cafeterias). These struggles are usually exacerbated with age. An increased understanding of the neural responses to sounds in the presence of reverberation will help in our quest to reduce its problems for the hard of hearing and in developing intelligent prostheses. At the end of this project we will have a much clearer idea about how the auditory nervous system responds to reverberation and also how it may compensate for its deleterious effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E017398/1","grantId":"BB/E017398/1","fundValue":"376450","fundStart":"2007-07-09","fundEnd":"2010-09-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Winter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
