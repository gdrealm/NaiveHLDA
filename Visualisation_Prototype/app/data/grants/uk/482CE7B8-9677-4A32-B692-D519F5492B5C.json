Mild forms of OHSS occur in approximately 1/3rd of all IVF cycles, whilst moderate or severe OHSS occurs in up to 1/10th of IVF cycles. The cause is the use of a drug in IVF treatment which too powerfully stimulates the release of reproductive hormones. Kisspeptin is a hormone found naturally in men and women and it stimulates reproductive hormone secretion similarly to the stimulation which occurs in women with a normal menstrual cycle. In this study we will find out how effective kisspeptin is in patients requiring IVF treatment. Ultimately the aim of our research will be to determine if the use of kisspeptin in IVF treatment could prevent the potentially life threatening risk of OHSS in women with infertility who are otherwise healthy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000455","grantId":"G1000455","fundValue":"854485","fundStart":"2010-12-08","fundEnd":"2013-11-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Waljit Singh Dhillo","coPersons":["Deborah  Ashby","Geoffrey Howard Trew","Stephen R Bloom"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
