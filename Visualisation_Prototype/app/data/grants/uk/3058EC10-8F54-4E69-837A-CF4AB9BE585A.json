For this reason, a stem cell approach to regenerate the heart is attractive. We focus on using embryonic stem cells (primitive cells with the ability to become every cell type desired) or a rare and unexpected stem cell we discovered, which exists in heart muscle itself. These experiments are aimed at solving several fascinating and important problems. Where do these cardiac stem cells come from during life, and what do they become in healthy and diseased hearts? Can we improve their number or function to enhance the repair and regeneration of the heart? What specific genes and connections of genes control cardiac muscle creation? Using advanced robotic methods that test hundreds or thousands of conditions, and advanced genetic methods that measure every gene in the cells, we will study which genes are active in heart-forming cells and which are important for the cells function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901467","grantId":"G0901467","fundValue":"1016390","fundStart":"2011-01-17","fundEnd":"2014-05-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael David Schneider","coPersons":["Timothy  Aitman","Nadia  Rosenthal","Sian E Harding","Ana  Pombo","Jesus  Gil","Amanda G Fisher","Stuart  Cook"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
