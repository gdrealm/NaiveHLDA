Energy-resolved double ionization yields will be calculated at ten separate laser peak intensities at intervals of 0.5 x 10^14 W/cm^2 over the important range 1.5 x 10^14 W/cm^2 to 6.0 x 10^14 W/cm^2 inclusive. Such calculations will be the first for the Ti:sapphire fundamental wavelength (800 nm) where most experimental work is concentrated and through complementing precise experimental measurement have a major impact on the field. Based on early-time usage of HELIUM (which has also established the feasibility of the proposed calculations) we estimate that this work will use 30 million AUs on HECToR over the period January to June 2008.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F052979/1","grantId":"EP/F052979/1","fundValue":"5235","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"K  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
