{"id":"3A628ACD-E81B-47B0-9D35-15EB272250AD","title":"Relating Function to Structure in Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors","abstractText":"The human brain is estimated to have around 100 billion nerve cells, each one making an average of 10,000 connections with other cells. Rapid communication in the brain primarily involves electrical signals, but in signalling between cells a different system is used. A chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) is released from one cell, and this chemical is detected by specialised receptor proteins on the neighbouring cell. When these receptors detect neurotransmitters they change shape, effectively creating tiny holes in the cell, generating a small electrical signal that can then continue through the cell. Some neurotransmitters increase the level of brain activity (excitation), while others reduce it (inhibition). The correct functioning of the brain relies on a delicate balance between the two, with excess activity for example leading to epilepsy, and contributing to the slow degeneration seen in Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases.\nThis research project involves the study of how one class of receptor protein, the glutamate receptors, change shape at the atomic level in response to the neurotransmitter glutamate. To do this controlled changes (mutations) will be introduced into the receptor. The effects of these mutations on the way the receptor protein works will be studied by measuring the electrical signals they generate. By studying the effects of these mutations, it will be possible to identify the key elements of the receptor. This will enable us to describe in more detail how the receptors work. This in turn should ultimately lead to a better understanding of how glutamate receptors interact with drugs, and could potentially lead to the design of drugs that act on these receptors in a more controlled way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200084","grantId":"G0200084","fundValue":"493795","fundStart":"2003-07-07","fundEnd":"2008-07-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Green","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
