DNA is composed of two polymer strands that are entwined to form a twisted ladder, known as the double helix. The rungs of the ladder are made up of a DNA alphabet A, C, T and G. These alphabet pieces, known as nucleotides, pair according to special rules, A will pair only with a T in the opposite strand, and G only with a C thus each strand of the DNA molecule serves as a template to specify the sequence of nucleotides during duplication, or replication, of the complementary strand. The process of replicating our genetic material is awe-inspiring in its complexity, as it involves copying billions of nucleotides with exceptional speed and accuracy. This amazing feat is performed by a group of proteins that together form a 'replication machine'. Flap endonucleases are part of this apparatus. Understanding the function of each of these proteins is critical since failure of any one of them may result in a life threatening disease. In addition to the problem of accurate replication, DNA is under continual onslaught from environmental chemicals and radiation (mainly the sun's rays). These alter the DNA bases so that they no longer pair up, as they should, again a life-threatening situation. Biological systems have evolved a number of enzymes (biological catalysts) that are involved in repairing damaged DNA. In addition to normal replication flap endonucleases and some other proteins like flap endonucleases are a group of these vital enzymes involved in repair. Without flap endonucleases and enzymes like them life cannot exist. Understanding how flap endonuclease and its other family members function at the molecular level is the principle aim of this work. This could lead to new treatments to human diseases, as large amounts of flap endonucleases are present in cancer cells. We plan to study whether flap endonucleases and other enzymes remodel the end of the DNA, unpairing it to react. This is important to understand as it may help with design of inhibitors that are specific. Vital to the process of replication is that flap endonucleases cut DNA at a specific place. We seek to understand how this happens and how cuts in the wrong place are avoided. Flap endonucleases contain a hole through which DNA is proposed to thread. This hole looks like an arch, but there is evidence that sometimes this part of the protein does not exist as an arch. We wish to understand under what circumstances the arch is formed and whether arch formation is required for the enzyme to do its job. This has implications for the types of DNA substrates it can act upon. We are going to contrast the behavior of FEN with other family members that also repair DNA to work out if they operate in the same way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J00300X/1","grantId":"BB/J00300X/1","fundValue":"403558","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Alison Grasby","coPersons":["Barbara  Ciani"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
