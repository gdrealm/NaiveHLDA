Likewise, both CJS strategies and public self-protective measures affect crime levels. Finally, both crime levels and public opinion influence the CJS and the strategies it uses. </p>\n\n<p>This implies that, by addressing factors related to one, other outcomes might be influenced. Thus, identifying and targeting such factors could represent significant financial savings, improved CJS performance and reduced public anxiety. For example, if Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB), fear of crime and community cohesion had predictors in common, by specifically targeting them, the relevant bodies could 'kill' the proverbial 'two birds with one stone'.&nbsp; Similarly, if community cohesion and victimisation levels have a reciprocal relationship (eg a feedback loop), addressing one would, to some extent, be addressing the other—potentially doubling investment returns. </p>\n\n<p>This study attempts to fill this research gap by using advanced statistical techniques to assess any overlap and relatedness in these outcomes using British Crime Survey (BCS) data from 2001 through 2008.&nbsp; In doing so, it also tests the 'Broken Windows' thesis which posits such reciprocal relationships.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3097","grantId":"RES-000-22-3097","fundValue":"23911","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paula Marie Kautt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
