This 'small grant' research proposal will develop software and design tools that will allow any biology microscopy groups to use this novel imaging technique on their own microscopes. We will distribute the software and design tools to biologists who wish to use it to further their research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K016466/1","grantId":"BB/K016466/1","fundValue":"1782","fundStart":"2014-01-03","fundEnd":"2015-06-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Webb","coPersons":[],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
