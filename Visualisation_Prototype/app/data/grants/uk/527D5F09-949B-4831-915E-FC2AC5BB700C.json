{"id":"527D5F09-949B-4831-915E-FC2AC5BB700C","title":"Spatial Aspects of Industrial Organization","abstractText":"The proposed research will develop and apply econometric methods of modeling interactions among firms when their decisions are spatially related, where 'space' can refer to location in geographic or product-characteristic space, and decisions can be continuous or discrete. Three applications are envisioned. The first, which involves discrete choices, is concerned with promotion in a context where one firm's advertising decisions affect the profits of its rivals. The data are a panel of brands of a retail product, and space refers to both geographic (retail-outlet) proximity and characteristic (brand) similarity. The second, which involves continuous choices, is concerned with technological spillovers among firms that are similar or 'close.' The question is how to measure closeness (eg geographic proximity, technological similarity, or vertical importance), and the data are a cross section of UK firms. The third, which is concerned with intrabrand spillovers, will evaluate forced vertical divestitures in US retail petrol markets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1304","grantId":"RES-000-22-1304","fundValue":"49374","fundStart":"2006-01-04","fundEnd":"2009-01-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Slade","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
