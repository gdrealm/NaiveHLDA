{"id":"3A08EC0F-C146-4A7B-9681-57AB0305C823","title":"Advanced Training in Intensive Livestock Health and Production","abstractText":"Extensive free trade, efficient International transportation, knowledge and technology dissemination, resource and workforce costs and legislative burden make the intensive livestock (pigs and poultry) industries searingly competitive. A subsidy for pig production amounting to 23% of value at farmgate averaged across OECD countries which is not available to UK producers exerts increased competitive pressure. Despite large efficient pig and poultry industries the UK has a negative trade balance in both broiler and pig meat production (DEFRA 2007, 2008). Competitive pressure and technological progress have driven remarkable improvements in production efficiency. For instance in broiler production daily weight gain doubled, from 30 grammes per day (g/d) in 1970 to 60 g/d in 2003 and food conversion efficiency (kilogrammes (kg) feed per kg live weight gain) improved from 2.3 to 1.8 over the same period. Productivity gains have been primarily associated with genetic improvement, better nutrition and dramatic advances in disease control which in turn have permitted greater intensification and thus production efficiency. The rate of improvement has slowed as solutions have been found to many straightforward problems and a requirement now exists for more technologically sophisticated innovation. A further step-change in productivity will be required on a global scale to meet the predicted population growth and increased consumption of animal protein which is set to double by 2030. The improved prosperity and social changes in developing countries threaten UK food security which historically has been assured by importation when internal production is inadequate. It is environmentally undesirable to increase the 'footprint' (fresh water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation) as production increases. The livestock industry will be best served by a workforce capable of integrating knowledge and understanding from the DNA of the production animal to the diet of the consumer and in the context of economic reality, business efficiency and ethical constraint. There is a growing shortage of veterinary and associated scientific skills provision for intensive livestock production in the UK. This presents a real, structural danger to UK food security and is contributing to lack of economic competitiveness. Only 3.8% of veterinarians in the UK work in exclusively production animal practice and by inference a smaller proportion work in intensive livestock production (RCVS survey 2010). Whilst veterinarians qualify with an all round ability to deal with the major challenges that arise with food animals, they do not receive the highly specialised training required to operate effectively as intensive livestock veterinarians. Currently veterinarians holding specialist diplomas in poultry and pig medicine in the UK number 6 and 12 respectively (RCVS Register 2009) and of these 72% acquired their diplomas before 1987, suggesting an ageing population. Only 8 UK based European college diplomats exist and there are only 6 European diplomats in the corresponding poultry science college, reflecting the skills shortage in mainland Europe. A similar shortage exists in the USA. Furthermore there are few basic or applied scientists with specialised knowledge of chicken and pig biology and a review of provision for Land Based Studies (HEFCE 2007) identified the paucity of students engaged in courses on livestock production. The case for support is that: Despite an efficient pig and poultry industry the UK has a negative trade balance in pig and poultry products. Substantial improvements in productivity will be required to remain competitive, to contribute to global consumption, to ensure UK food security and to reduce environmental impact. Holistic expertise will be required from DNA to diet to support the industry. There is a small declining cadre of skilled veterinarians and scientists supporting the sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024313/1","grantId":"BB/I024313/1","fundValue":"2907160","fundStart":"2011-08-22","fundEnd":"2014-08-21","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  May","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
