{"id":"21B39981-57F5-4397-9EC1-F740E6AD6871","title":"University of East Anglia NERC Impact Acceleration Account Phase 2","abstractText":"UEA will implement a strategic approach to generating impact from NERC funded research building on the combined strengths of UEA NERC funded projects, identified end user needs and NERC policy objectives. This will be achieved through the identification, mapping on to end user requirements, and launching Impact Clusters. 70% of the funding will be allocated to this stream of activity. The first potential cluster will focus on linking aspects of research relevant to water including its use, supply, management and effect on environments. This is an area of strength for UEA, builds on existing initiatives, is a close fit with NERC policy and objectives and is a major challenge both internationally and in the East of England. The outputs will include reports relevant to end users, a symposium to include researchers and end users and the creation of new links with end-users. End users are anticipated to include both businesses, policy makers and regulatory authorities. Funding will also be allocated to identify further potential clusters that could be developed in a similar fashion. \n\nResource will also be allocated to responsive mode applications for individual projects with clear plans to develop impact. 30% of the funding will be allocated to this stream of the activity that will build on the Phase I of the NERC IAA. This will be aimed at pump priming projects that will be able to take advantage of further funding streams available on the Norwich Research Park, including a new translational fund with a remit of supporting impact from all research disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L013401/1","grantId":"NE/L013401/1","fundValue":"201620","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-12","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David  Richardson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
