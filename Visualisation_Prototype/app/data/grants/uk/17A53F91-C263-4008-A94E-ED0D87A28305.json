How did this happen? Specifically, what social factors created the conditions that allowed a primate-borne virus to be transmitted to people?</p>\n\n<p>This study will attempt to provide answers to these questions by studying present-day interactions between people and wild primates in a &quot;hot spot&quot; of human-primate conflict and contact in western Uganda. It focuses on communities of people who live in close proximity to red colobus monkeys. Decades of research on these primates has revealed that they interact regularly with local people in a variety of contexts, including antagonistic interactions, and that such interactions increase rates of disease transmission between the species.</p>\n\n<p>This study will build on this to explore how human social factors underpin &quot;risky&quot; human-primate interactions, employing qualitative and quantitative anthropological approaches to explore how people perceive and experience the risks of disease transmission. Because risky human-wildlife contact is tied to social resources (eg power, social situation, economic status), this will include reconstructing social networks in order to identify individuals who hold critical knowledge about human-primate contact as well as mapping contact networks for disease transmission into the wider community.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011266/1","grantId":"ES/J011266/1","fundValue":"130454","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mhairi Alexandra Gibson","coPersons":["Simon David Frost"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" We are currently still in a period of data collection and analysis. From January 2015 this data should be entered and ready for main phase of analysis. Outcomes to date have centred around outreach activities (see below), and also some preliminary descriptive analysis identifying the main factors which are responsible for putting people in contact with wildlife around a national part in Uganda. We are still working on producing research outcomes, see above. However, we are already engaging with schools interested in learning about the kinds of anthropological methods and approaches which can be used address contemporary world issues e.g. emerging pandemics.
