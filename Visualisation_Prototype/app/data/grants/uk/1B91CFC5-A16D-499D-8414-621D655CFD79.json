The focus of our empirical work are data collected in the tri-annual Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies demographic surveillance system (DSS) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The objectives of the project are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>identify instruments to measure key indicators of the family environment that can be feasibly implemented in ongoing longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional population studies in sub-Saharan Africa</li>\n\n <li>test different strategies for collecting data about families, including information about non-resident parents, non-parental caregiving and geographically mobile children</li>\n\n <li>evaluate the validity and reliability of family data obtained from multiple respondents</li>\n\n <li>incorporate multiple and dynamic family risk environments in statistical analyses to identify determinants of child health and wellbeing</li>\n\n <li>contribute improved measurement tools and detailed data to inform the design and evaluation of new family oriented child health interventions.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021202/1","grantId":"ES/J021202/1","fundValue":"373096","fundStart":"2013-08-14","fundEnd":"2016-08-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Victoria  Hosegood","coPersons":["Ann  Berrington","Marie-Louise  Newell","Ruth  Bland","George  Ploubidis"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
