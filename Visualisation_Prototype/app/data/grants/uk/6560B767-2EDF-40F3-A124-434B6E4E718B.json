Analyse real-life electrical load data collected by this Institute to provide representative models of demand that can guide\ndesign, testing and implementation of the demand side management system (known as Demand Shaper) to be deployed in\na field trial under this project. This will be performed near the start of the project to inform the design process.\n2. Perform an agent based simulation of the Demand Shaper technology when deployed on a commercial scale, using data\nobtained from the trial project. From this simulation a report will be produced assessing the likely effectiveness at scale\nand any risks and issues that further investigation. This will be performed towards the end of the project to support the\noverall conclusions drawn.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507210/1","grantId":"EP/M507210/1","fundValue":"25369","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Boait","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
