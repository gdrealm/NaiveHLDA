This was facilitated by the knowledge exchange and impact strategy discussed above, and was focused on seeking to ensure that research activity was informed by the developing needs of policy makers and practitioners, and wherever possible had direct implications for policy or practice. In particular TSRC aimed to work in partnership with policy and practice agencies to co-produce outputs from the research and to direct these to the ongoing practice needs of agencies in the sector. Examples of partnership in societal and economic impact included:\n\nThe Futures Dialogue - established in the summer of 2012 and running for eight months through to spring 2013, this used the findings from TSRC research to provide the basis for a dialogue on some of the key issues underpinning the future development of the third sector in England, focusing in particular upon how the sector would, and should, respond to emerging challenges. The dialogue took a number of forms including:\n• publication of a series of discussion papers from TSRC researchers outlining key findings and identifying issues for debate;\n• open invitation seminars where these findings were presented and discussed;\n• online 'Question and Answer' sessions hosted by Guardian Professional;\n• online commentary and blogs on a dedicated Futures Dialogue website established by TSRC;\n• meetings of a 'Sounding Board' of leading sector experts from policy and practice to debate the issues and discuss the future challenges for the sector;\n• a National Conference at the British Library in April 2013 where these issues were debated further by a large open audience. \n• The publication of a final report containing an overview of the conclusions from the dialogue and some of the challenges identified for the sector (Unity in Diversity: what is the future for the third sector? ) which was launched at the AGM of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Civil Society and Volunteering.\nNCVO Almanacs - based on the joint development and analysis of quantitative data on the third sector. The Charity Commission databases, created jointly with NCVO following the collapse of Guidestar, discussed above, provided the major source for the quantitative analysis of the sector published in the annual UK Civil Society Almanac by the NCVO. This is the major source of data on the sector used by policy makers and practitioners across the country and can only be produced because of the collaboration between TSRC and NCVO. Linked to this TSRC and NCVO have also collaborated with the sector skills agency, Skills Third Sector (now Skills Effect), to produce regular quantitative data on workforce trends in the sector, which has also been published as an NCVO almanac and has informed the skills development strategies of the agency. This work has helped to transform the information base for third sector policy and practice, and is used by large numbers of organisations to inform their strategic development and applications for funding.\n\nMaking markets in third sector infrastructure - a programme of theoretically informed research charting the gradual emergence of a new market-oriented model of third sector support services ('infrastructure') over the last three to four years. Through presentations, workshops and roundtables the research has been accompanied by an extensive programme of knowledge exchange and engagement activities, reaching some 675 policy makers and practitioners over a two year period. In particular, TSRC's research has gained influence in the field through close partnership work with a number of leading sector agencies. With the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action (NAVCA) this included a keynote presentation and workshops at successive conferences, and membership of the new Independent Commission on the Future of Local Infrastructure. With the NCVO it included convening a research roundtable on infrastructure, and practitioner workshops and presentations at three major conferences. With the BIG Lottery Fund it included research and knowledge exchange activities on the emerging infrastructure-related 'Building Capabilities' framework, where TSRC has been commissioned to undertake a scoping study of 'what works in building the capabilities of frontline organisations' - a study designed to help shape the agenda for future investment and activity in this field. \n\nThird Sector Knowledge Portal - a new, free to use, online library and web catalogue. The Knowledge Portal was developed by TSRC in partnership with The British Library to promote and preserve evidence, research and analysis of the work of the voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations. It brought together academic analysis, government studies, and reports from organisations themselves, and consolidated these in one easy to use and searchable collection of links and downloads. The Portal is underpinned by a unique third sector thesaurus of keywords, developed in partnership with the British Library. There are over 6,500 records in the Portal and every record in the catalogue has been manually classified at TSRC. Users can click the keywords and author names assigned to each item to find further related content. The Portal has a separate Twitter account with over 2,000 followers, which is used to promote links relating to topical issues, to engage with events and debates via Twitter hashtags, and to foster a 'user community' through informal dialogue and responses to queries. Significant additional funding to support the development and implementation of the Portal was secured from the BIG Lottery Fund.

This information is used in the production of NCVO's biennial Civil Society Almanac. Similar datasets on Scotland and Northern Ireland are being developed. \n\n\n\no TSRC, working with the providers, has made use of its quantitative analysis of major national surveys including the National Survey of Civil Society Organisations, the Citizenship Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society, and the Labour Force Survey, to improve the coverage of third sector issues within them. \n\n\n\no TSRC has developed a major longitudinal study of the dynamics of 15 widely varying third sector organisations, together with contextual analysis of a wider group of complementary organisations. This unique qualitative resource, tracks the experiences and fortunes of organisations over five years of turbulent changes in policy and practice. \n\n\n\no TSRC's research on social enterprise includes papers on the problems of defining and measuring social enterprises.\n\n\n\no Work on the delivery of public services has explored the impact of partnership, collaboration and sub-contracting on third sector organisations, the policy and practice of commissioning, and key areas for third sector delivery including, criminal justice (offender resettlement), employment services (Work Programme), health and social care, and housing associations. \n\n\n\no Research on impact has included critical analysis of Social Return on Investment (SROI). \n\n\n\no TSRC has developed innovative work to identify and map the scale of 'below-the-radar' activity in grassroots and community organisations not captured in quantitative datasets, including those working in marginalised and vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\no Theory and policy analysis has included work on the problems of definition and the government's Big Society Agenda. \n\n\n\no Working with the British Library, TSRC has established the Third Sector Knowledge Portal, an easily accessible on-line database of information and research on the sector.\n\n\n\no TSRC has developed a Research Fellow Scheme with over thirty fellows adding value to its work, including the first prestigious William Plowden Fellow supported by NCVO. \n\n \n\no The Knowledge Exchange Team have become leaders in the field presenting internationally on the Knowledge Exchange, Communications and Impact model devised and implemented for TSRC. \n\n\n\no TSRC's 100th Working Paper has been published. TSRC's Working and Briefing Papers are accessed by policy makers, practitioners, and other researchers. Our findings are of direct relevance to policy makers in the third sector field in national and local government.\n\nThey have also informed the practice of a wide range of third sector organisations, in particular through our work with the leading infrastrucutre agencies supporting organisations in the sector.
