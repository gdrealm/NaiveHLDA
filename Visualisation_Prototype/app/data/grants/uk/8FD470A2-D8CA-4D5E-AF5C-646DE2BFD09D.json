{"id":"8FD470A2-D8CA-4D5E-AF5C-646DE2BFD09D","title":"Integrating Infection Prevention into Health Care Delivery","abstractText":"This grant puts forward a vision to develop an internationally recognised Centre for translational research, training and leadership in Infection Prevention and Management which aims to improve health systems, healthcare delivery and directly improve patient care and safety. It focuses on the key Public Health priorities in hospitals and healthcare associated infection as well as antibiotic resistance. A large number of different groups based in Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, the UK Health Protection Agency and a commercial partner Dr Foster develop positive interaction, build on a strong local track record for developing an organisational approach to infection prevention within the Imperial Trust. \n\nThe programme of research has four main workstreams. The first investigates the embedding of infection prevention within NH organisational structures and looks at how best to implement innovation and best practice. It also examines how techniques of social marketing and behaviour change can be used to improve infection control and antibiotic prescribing. The second work stream which involves studies into clinical infection, molecular epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics, focuses on identifying factors in the bug and the patient which affect the spread and carriage of serious healthcare associated infection. The aim is to develop new diagnostic tools and ultimately new vaccines and treatments. The third work stream of the project looks at the best way of developing and utilising infection surveillance schemes across primary and secondary healthcare as well as informing the research in work stream two. There will be a focus on surveillance of high risk populations and evaluation of systems to monitor antibiotic resistance and best prescribing practice. The final work stream, is to develop multidisciplinary training to generate a specifically skilled academic and clinical scientific and medical work force to deliver clinical care, research and leadership in infection prevention. Amongst novel approaches being taken includes the focus on e-learning, the development of MSc and short courses and education at PhD level of a series of academic managers. \n\nAll workstreams have a series of identifiable outputs and their achievement will reflect the success of the research. In the final analysis, overall success will the development of sustainable and internationally recognised centre for infection prevention and management which improves patient outcomes. Alterations in organisational behaviour, new technology, the uptake of innovation, sustainable recruitment and training capacity with continual close working between partner organisations will be further evidence of success.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800777","grantId":"G0800777","fundValue":"4568430","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan S Friedland","coPersons":["Shiranee  Sriskandan","Paul  Aylin","Rifat A Atun","Alison H Holmes"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
