Wall suction has resulted in a delay of transition to turbulence with major benefits, such as reduction of viscous drag, noise, and fuel consumption.The central aim of the proposed work is to apply wall suction to attenuate the intensity of Klebanoff modes arising in swept-wing laminar boundary layers due to free-stream turbulence. These flow structures have never been studied over large scale aerodynamic bodies, despite their vast importance in numerous industrial and technological applications, such as the design of aircraft wings and turbine blades. The effects of wall suction have not been investigated for these technologically relevant flows. A reason for the dearth of works is the extreme difficulty in predicting and controlling such flows.The problem will be tackled by a combination of mathematical and numerical techniques. The proposed approach will offer a fast and numerically robust toolkit in line with the long-standing effort of the fluid mechanics community to control pre-transitional flows in an efficient manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I033173/1","grantId":"EP/I033173/1","fundValue":"99830","fundStart":"2011-10-14","fundEnd":"2013-04-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have published one paper in the world-leading journal Physics of Fluids, we have presented the work at the best international conference in Rio de Janeiro and another publihsed work is currently in revision in the other leading journal, the Journal of Fluid Mechanics Education Cultural","person":"Pierre  Ricco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Free-stream turbulence is one of the key external agents acting on laminar boundary layers, causing this flow to transition to fully-developed turbulence. In this projects, we have studied investigated two methods to attenuate the effects of free-stream turbulence in laminar boundary layers: i) distributed wall suction ii) spanwise wall oscillations. Both methods have been discovered to be very effective in attenuating the strength of these perturbations. We have also corrected a previous work by other authors on a similar problem. Exceeding the original objectives, we have studied the effect of wall suction on compressible boundary layers. We ahve focused on the linearized dynamics of perturbations in laminar boundary layers. The next step is to include the effects of nonlinearity on both methods and to study their effects on the secondary instability of the perturbations and therefore on the transition to turbulence.
