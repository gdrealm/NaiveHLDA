An improved understanding of how this process occurs for cases of so-called boundary-layer flow over solid surfaces, such as aircraft wings, would be of benefit in a wide variety of engineering applications. The study of laminar-turbulent transition in boundary-layer flows typically involves three complementary approaches: (i) mathematical analysis of the equations that govern the behaviour of the fluid flow; (ii) physical experiments and (iii) numerical simulations. The work that is proposed is aimed at bringing together two active researchers who both have significant expertise in (iii). Funding is sought so that they will have the opportunity at visit each other at their home institutions, in Cardiff and Arizona, to discuss a number of problems of common interest and to explore some possibilities for future collaborative research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D034426/1","grantId":"EP/D034426/1","fundValue":"4936","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
