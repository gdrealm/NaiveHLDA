In line with our key goal, guidance for the conduct of video parades was developed taking into account the results from the field study and in close consultation with participating police forces. The project provides new data on the factors that can influence video identification performance in field settings. Our results show that suspect identification rates remain unchanged with the use of video. However, some procedural aspects of the video identification procedure are problematic. We found that witnesses who requested at least one additional viewing of the lineup were two and a half times more likely to identify fillers than witnesses who did not request any additional lineup viewings. Filler identifications are known errors but filler identification rates cast doubt on the reliability of suspect identifications. We are suggesting revisions to the PACE guidance on multiple viewings of video identification parades. Two scientific papers have been prepared (one is in press in the International Journal- Law and Human Behavior). \nVideo was introduced to use resources more efficiently. Live parades were difficult, costly and frequently cancelled due to lack of suitable volunteers. Video parades can be put together within 24 hours and hence the question arises as to whether the shorter delay will increase identification rates. Our data suggest the speed with which a video identification parade can be put together is likely to impact suspect identification rates. The longer term effect on prosecution of crimes is something that should be examined. The shorter delays also have a further beneficial impact for the police in that it increases the chances that when victims and witnesses come forward an identification parade can be put forward in a timely fashion and before a witness/victim changes their mind about helping the police.
