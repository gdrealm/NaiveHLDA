The meeting was extremely successful in communicating results between mathematicians and life scientists, and progress was made both with the practical improvements in understanding the difficulties encountered by both groups and in the development of new tools to improve the measurement of biodiversity and diversity more generally.\n\nAt least six papers have been published from work discussed and developed at the meeting in Ecography, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, PLoS One, Evolution, Ecological Monographs and the arXiv.\n\nThe work has led to a large interdisciplinary collaboration forming in the broad area of diversity research, and has already led to two large (&gt;&pound;1M) grant submissions.

The workshop connected research carried out across remits of five of the research councils for the first time - BBSRC, EPSRC, NERC, MRC and ESRC - with PIs with funding from all of them able to attend it and/or subsequent follow-up meetings. It can be taken forward by making research in biodiversity, animal breeding, genetics, evolution, disease control, immunology and mathematics more interdisciplinary in nature.\n\nIt is indeed already being taken forward in the development of a large interdisciplinary consortium in this new, broad, diversity-based research area; the expansion of the University of Glasgow's Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health's research remit and membership beyond disease research to areas of biodiversity and animal research; the publication of six papers leading on from the workshop; the organisation of two follow-on meetings (the last, in July 2014, was attended by over 100 researchers); and the submission of two large (&gt;?1M) grants by consortia of attendees at the workshop.
