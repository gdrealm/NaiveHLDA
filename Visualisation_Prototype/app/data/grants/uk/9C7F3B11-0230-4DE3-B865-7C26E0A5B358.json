However, we know remarkably little about the history of even conventional forms of participation such as party membership and activism. This project will use a range of methods - including multiple recapture techniques for studying hard to measure populations, archival research and oral history - to examine Labour and Conservative members and activists in the North-east of England in the post-war years. This will be the first major historical comparison of activism in the two major political parties in this period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119222/1","grantId":"119222/1","fundValue":"97570","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gidon Daniel Cohen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
