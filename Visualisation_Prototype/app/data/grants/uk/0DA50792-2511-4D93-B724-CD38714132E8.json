The respondents are manual workers, low-grade non-manual workers, and their families. Their testimonies give details of income and expenditure; housing; occupational status and education. They also offer subjective assessments of socio-economic status and social relations and networks.</p>\n\n<p>Additional quantitative and qualitative material will be used, including research notes from these studies; government data on employment, earnings, and housing; and approx. 50 oral histories. These data will underpin analysis of the distribution of wealth and poverty by occupational status, gender, race, and age, across the majority of England's population. They will enable this largely quantitative aspect of the analysis to be related and compared to a qualitative examination of subjective understandings of class. </p>\n\n<p>The research will offer a historically sensitive, dynamic assessment of the interaction between wealth distribution, identity and class, and the relationship of this to historical change in modern England.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0032-A","grantId":"RES-061-23-0032-A","fundValue":"107849","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Selina  Todd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
