{"id":"E9DFCF84-F5FE-43D1-B15F-A34CEF468FB1","title":"Future-Proofing the Sustainability of the MRC High Throughput Sequencing Hub in Scotland","abstractText":"The GenePool is the leading next generation genomics facility in Scotland, and one of the largest academic facilities in the UK. The GenePool is funded by the MRC as a High Throughput Sequencing Hub, with specific remit to deliver collaborative access to next generation sequencing and informatics across the MRC science area. This application is for renewal for 24 months of the initial 3-year funding, to bed in the advances made in setting up the MRC Hub, and to move the facility to full cost-recovery. We will focus on delivering first-rate data and analysis on cutting edge science, to a wide range of collaborators both new and established, using the transformative tools of Illumina sequencing and high-throughput computing. We will build upon our MRC Hub and &quot;spokes&quot; model, fostering bioinformatics training and next generation genomics understanding across our target area.\nWe request core support for promotional and outreach activities, including a new bioinformatics staff member jointly appointed between the Liverpool and Edinburgh MRC Hubs who will organise and deliver advanced training in next generation genomics to PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. We will deliver proactive Next Generation Sequencing Clinics in academic research institutes and departments across Scotland. We will continue to support the Next Generation Bioinformatics User Group meetings, including inviting international speakers and delivering 2-day research workshops on selected technologies. The MRC network of 'spokes' bioinformaticians in institutions across Scotland will be expanded. We will produce promotional materials for distribution to potential collaborators and grant applicants, and use our web site and social media portals to promote the MRC HTS Hub approach to next generation genomics.\nWe will develop standard operating procedures for new techniques, and to explicitly and rigorously cross-check manufacturers' claims. We have good relationships with the major technology and reagent suppliers and will use these to negotiate early access to new products. We will perform in-house trials of new kits, in direct comparison to existing protocols, and make the results known to our collaborator base. We will work with companies and collaborators to bed in and develop new approaches to the generation of and analysis of next generation sequencing data.\nThe next generation sequencing revolution is based on two principles: transformative technologies and skilled staff. We have a mature charging model that includes elements of instrument depreciation and staff time, and generate a working surplus (for investment in the facility) each year. We have already transitioned several staff from core grant to cost recovery support. In the period of 24 months of the renewal, we will transition three further core MRC staff posts to full recovery (one bioinformatician and two high-level research technologists). Two new posts will be created to ensure best service to our collaborators, particularly given the vastly increased throughput of the Illumina HiSeq platform. A laboratory manager will ensure fitness-for-purpose of our LIMS installation, manage the wide portfolio of instrumentation (including robotics, qPCR, analytical platforms and other ancillary instrumentation), and provide oversight of the full laboratory workflow process. A business manager will administer the large number of active projects within the facility, in particular dealing with the financial side, managing the LIMS, and keeping collaborators up-to-date with project progress. Both of these new posts are planned to transition rapidly to full cost recovery in two years. Initiation of these posts will free the GenePool Scientific manager (Dr Karim Gharbi) and the Director (Prof Mark Blaxter) to focus on speeding the transformation of researchers' ideas into viable projects, well-analysed studies and high-hitting publications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K001744/1","grantId":"MR/K001744/1","fundValue":"542587","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Lyon Blaxter","coPersons":["Karim  Gharbi"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
