{"id":"32DD6B0B-932F-497D-BCDC-391B58EADE8B","title":"Symmetric Lie superalgebras and quantum integrability","abstractText":"Symmetric Lie superalgebra is a complex Lie superalgebra with an involutive automorphism. \nAll involutive automorphisms of simple Lie superalgebras were classified by Serganova, \nso the list of all symmetric simple Lie superalgebras is known.\n\nIn contrast to the Lie algebra case the theory of spherical functions for symmetric Lie superalgebras is at a very early stage. \nThe proposed approach to this difficult programme is based on the theory of quantum integrable systems. \nIt goes back to an important observation of Sergeev (2001), \nwho discovered a relation of spherical functions of one of the classical series with the theory of deformed quantum Calogero-Moser systems \ndeveloped earlier by Chalykh, Feigin and Veselov.\n\nA particular case of spherical functions are the characters of finite-dimensional irreducible representations, \nwhich generate the Grothendieck ring of the corresponding Lie superalgebra. For basic classical Lie superalgebras \nthese rings were recently explicitly described using Serganova's notion of generalised root systems.\nThe theory of the deformed CM systems provides certain deformations of these Grothendieck rings with the action \nof the deformed CM operators and their quantum integrals.\nThe conjecture is that the algebra of spherical functions for basic classical symmetric Lie superalgebras can be described as a specialisation \nof the corresponding family and can be studied using the spectral decomposition of the deformed CM operators.\n\nThe approach was already very successful in the representation theory of orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras:\nit was shown that a suitable limit of the super Jacobi polynomials \n(which are the eigenfunctions of the corresponding deformed CM operators) are nothing else \nbut the Euler characters studied by Penkov and Serganova.\nIt is natural to expect that a similar phenomenon happens for the spherical functions as well.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00488X/1","grantId":"EP/J00488X/1","fundValue":"152067","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Veselov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
