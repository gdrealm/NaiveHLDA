The brightly coloured neotropical Heliconius butterflies are one of the best studied examples, but the molecular genetic basis of mimicry remains poorly understood. In particular mimicry offers an opportunity to study the repeatability of evolution, as the same patterns emerge again and again in divergent lineages. The project falls into two broad areas, first we use cutting edge sequencing technology to make a genetic map of the H. melpomene genome. This will be used to help assemble the genome sequence currently being generated. This will form the basis for a genome-wide survey of adaptive divergence between H. melpomene races. Divergent geographic populations of this species form narrow hybrid zones where they hybridise and exchange genes. Thus, narrow regions of the genome controlling wing patterns are genetically differentiated against a background of extensive recombination. This offers a powerful opportunity to identify changes responsible for wing pattern differentiation. We will first characterise variation within and between races by genome resequencing at low coverage. Then we will use novel 'sequence capture' technology to enrich genomic DNA for regions of interest from 96 individuals, taken from six phenotypic races of H. melpomene. The experiment will be designed to sample two chromosomal regions containing wing patterning genes, and a further 12,000 variable sites located across the genome. This will offer a unique genome-wide analysis of parallel divergence between the six populations sampled. In particular we aim to determine a) how much of the genome is involved in colour pattern divergence b) whether the same regions are implicated across independent hybrid zones c) estimate the age of the alleles involved in wing pattern divergence and d) identify putative functional sites for further analysis. The second major aim of the project is to investigate the kinesin gene that represents a strong candidate locus for controlling the red forewing band of H. melpomene. We will study the spatial distribution of kinesin gene expression patterns between divergent phenotypes, in order to test whether spatial regulation underlies pattern regulation. Many genes show different variants generated by alternative splicing, generating variant forms of the protein containing alternative forms of the exons. Alternative splicing is a potentially powerful but under-explored mechanism that could generate evolutionarily relevant variation. We have evidence for alternative splicing the Kinesin gene, and here will characterise the isoforms of this gene and test for correlations between isoform expression and wing phenotype. We will investigate the molecular function of the gene, including a search for other molecules that interact with the kinesin protein, and test to confirm its motor function. Finally, we will develop trangenics methods for explicitly testing the function of the kinesin gene in wing pattern specification in divergent races of H. melpomene. The major gene dominant control of the red band means that we expect to be able to generate a red-banded phenotype by expressing the 'red' kinesin allele in a yellow banded phenotype. This will provide the first explicit test of function for a gene causing pattern variation in any butterfly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H01439X/1","grantId":"BB/H01439X/1","fundValue":"447660","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have used the results of this work in our presentation for the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2014 in which we described the evolution of butterly wing patterns to ~15000 members of the public Education,Environment Societal","person":"Chris David Jiggins","coPersons":["Isabel M Palacios"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" Mimicry among butterfly species is a commonly cited example of evolution and adaptation and Heliconius are perhaps the best studied example, but the molecular genetic basis of mimicry has only recently been studied. The goals of this project were to continue to develop genomic resources for Heliconius and reveal the molecular basis for wing pattern specification at the BD locus. \n\nWe have published a RAD sequence linkage map that was used to scaffold 85% of the H. melpomene genome. This work was fundamental for our recent publication in Nature of the H. melpomene genome sequence. We are now working on version 2 of the genome assembly, and improving the genome is an ongoing project, but the published work demonstrates that we have already achieved this goal as planned\n\nWe have obtained both SureSelect sequence capture data and whole genome sequences for ~80 individuals across the BD locus. This has provided remarkable resolution towards isolating associated sites across the BD locus, and permits separation of loci associated with distinct patterning elements (see Fig. 1). This has shown that shared patterns in the melpomene group have arisen through adaptive introgression (2,3) and that population divergence in centred on non-coding sequence between optix and kinesin (1). In particular we can separate the red basal forewing patch (Dennis) and the hindwing ray pattern elements (Rays) and localise associated haplotypes to regions of 6kb and 12kb respectively. \n\nWe have used both qPCR and in situ hybridisation to show that the kinesin gene is expressed in association with the red forewing band in both H. melpomene and H. erato. This confirms parallel and independent co-option of this gene into wing patterning in these convergent species. However, kinesin is not associated with any other pattern elements tested so far, including the rayed pattern, which is also controlled by this BD locus. So far we have not demonstrated any consistent slice variants associated with patterning, so it is unclear whether alternative splicing is going to be an important mechanism. In collaboration with Dr Reed, we have shown that expression of the transcription factor optix is associated with all red patterning elements (Reed et al., 2011). Furthermore, Since both kinesin and optix are associated with pattern, we have been cautious about proceeding with more complex functional experiments on the kinesin gene. Instead we have carried out an additional microarray expression experiment to test patterns of differential expression both between wing regions and between races. This has clearly supported the role of the kinesin in pattern specification alongside optix. Kinesin is expressed earlier in development as compared to optix (Figure 1), supporting a functional role for both genes.
