It is often said that France provides the most extreme example of a prescriptive, interventionist and indeed purist attitude to use of language. This project researched the origins of this concern for linguistic correctness in the seventeenth century, the period of the founding of the French Academy, whose statutes explicitly state that its mission is to rid the language of 'impurities'. \n\n\n\nBringing together scholars from North America, France and other parts of Europe, the project focused on a particularly French type of text, Remarks and Observations on the French language. The earliest example, Vaugelas's Remarks on the French Language, published in 1647, aims to prescribe good written and spoken usage not for foreigners, but for those who already have a good mastery of the language. The work was a best-seller and highly influential in its day: we know, for instance, that in 1660 the great playwright Pierre Corneille reworked the language of his plays to take account of Vaugelas's judgements and that Jean Racine, author of some of France's finest tragedies, is said to have taken a copy of the work with him to the south of France so not to become contaminated by regional speech. To appreciate the appeal and influence of these works requires an understanding of the social and cultural history of France. In a period of great social mobility, when nobility could be purchased by the newly rich, these works acted as a kind of linguistic courtesy book. Someone arriving new to the King's court would need to know not only how to dress and eat properly, but perhaps above all how to speak correctly, so as not to offend polite society.\n\n\n\nThe project has resulted in an electronic corpus of fifteen key texts which will be a valuable tool for future research in a number of disciplines. We also published a series of paper publications (books, articles, critical editions), most notably a monograph on the history, evolution and importance of the genre, both for the history of French and for the history of linguistic thought in France. Indeed its impact still resonates today - it is surely no coincidence that the author of the most influential grammar of contemporary French, Maurice Grevisse, in a work which significantly bears the title 'Good Usage', is described as the twentieth-century Vaugelas. The electronic corpus is to be available under national licence to all public libraries in France (some 8,000-10,000 university, town, hospital libraries, etc.). This will allow anyone interested in the French language to search the origin of certain rules of grammar or pronouncements about the correct usage of French. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
