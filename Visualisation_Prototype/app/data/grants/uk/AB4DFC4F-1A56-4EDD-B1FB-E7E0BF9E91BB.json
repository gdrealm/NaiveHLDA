Often young people are affected. As yet we are uncertain of the causes, although genes and the brain are directly involved. We know that there are changes in a number of areas in the brain, and it is highly likely that the connections or nerve tracts between these brain areas are also abnormal. With MRI we can accurately map these nerve tracts and show how they connect to certain brain regions, particularly those involving speech and language. \nWe aim to study schizophrenia in adolescence â€“ an age when the brain is still developing. By comparing teenagers with schizophrenia to healthy adolescents, we hope to gather important information on how schizophrenia affects brain development during the vital period of&nbsp;adolescence.&nbsp; If we can understand which nerve tracts and brain regions are abnormal, and relate this to symptoms,&nbsp;we will be in a better position to develop targeted drug treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500092","grantId":"G0500092","fundValue":"167656","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  James","coPersons":["Paul M Matthews"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
