With respect to computing power, today 's handheld devices are similar to Cray-2 supercomputers from the 1980s. Due to higher computational load (e.g. via multimedia apps) and the variety of radio interfaces (such as WiFi, 3G, and LTE), modern terminals are getting increasingly energy hungry. For instance, a single UMTS upload or a video recording process on today 's smartphones may consume as much as 1.5 Watts, i.e. roughly 50% of the maximal device power. In the near future, higher data rates and traffic, advanced media codecs, and graphics applications will ask for even more energy than the battery can deliver. At the same time, the power density limit might lead to a significant share of &quot;Dark Silicon&quot; at 22nm CMOS and below. Obviously, disruptive energy optimizations are required that go well beyond traditional technologies like DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) and power-down of temporarily unused components. The GEMSCLAIM project aims at introducing novel approaches for reducing this &quot;greed for energy&quot;, thereby improving the user experience and enabling new opportunities for mobile computing. The focus is on three novel approaches: (1) cross layer energy optimization, ranging from the compiler over the operating system down to the target HW platform, (2) efficient programming support for energy-optimized heterogeneous Multicore platforms based on energy-aware service level agreements (SLAs) and energy-sensitive tunable parameters, and (3) introducing energy awareness into Virtual Platforms for the purpose of dynamically customizing the HW architecture for energy optimization and online energy monitoring and accounting. GEMSCLAIM will provide new methodologies and tools in these domains and will quantify the potential energy savings via benchmarks and a HW platform prototype.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K017594/1","grantId":"EP/K017594/1","fundValue":"349507","fundStart":"2013-01-10","fundEnd":"2016-01-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project team at Queen's University of Belfast has entered into discussion with Credit Suisse to explore the potential of GEMSCLAIM technology for improving the bank's understanding on the power-efficiency of their servers and the implications of current workload distribution practices on overall datacentre energy-efficiency.

Cumulatively, these activities aim at understanding the sources of energy waste in computing systems and ameliorating this challenge.

The unique aspect of this prototype is that all layers of the architecture, from the gate level up to the system software level, implement co-operative methods and apparatuses to reduce overall system power consumption. Reduced power consumption is delivered while sustaining a level of performance set by the end user or by a Service-Level Agreement between the end user and a service provider. \n\nThe scientific discovery underpinning the GEMSCLAIM prototype was a co-designed hardware and software apparatus to perform accurate, component-level power measurements and power accounting throughout the hardware and software stack of a many-core computing system. GEMSCLAIM developed an apparatus that accurately reflects how power consumption is distributed between hardware components and how much power is consumed because of software activity on each of those hardware components. This in turn enabled GEMSCLAIM to be the first project to populate and leverage accurate measurements of power consumption in operating systems for the purposes of resource management.\n\nThe GEMSCLAIM apparatus, which is an amalgam of power sensors and power models controlled by firmware, has uncovered previously overlooked system components that consume significant amounts of power, and helped us understand how the interaction between software and hardware affects power consumption in non-obvious and non-intuitive ways. For example, GEMSCLAIM has demonstrated how software operations that access memory and perform device-to-device communication consume power for time intervals that extend beyond the completion of the software operations; or, that the same processor instruction executed with the same inputs can consume significantly varying amounts of power when executed under different conditions. \n\nGEMSCLAIM has also demonstrated a surprising finding that using more cores and more memory does not necessarily translate to higher performance and higher energy-efficiency in a computing system. This finding is in line with the recent development of 'dark silicon', a phenomenon that forces processor designers to power off portions of the semiconductor real estate on a chip in order to sustain it's reliable and correct operation.\n\nThe project findings are summarised in ten publications spanning the areas of energy-efficiency optimisation under power constraints (IEEE FPT'14, IEEE ICCD'14), energy-efficient resource allocation on heterogeneous many-core systems (IEEE IC-SAMOS'14, Computer Science R&amp;amp;amp;D, SC'13, ICS'13, COSMIC'13, APPT'13) and methods for accurate energy accounting on many-core systems (Sustainable Computing). The findings of GEMSCLAIM can help the billions of users of mobile devices across the world to first and foremost understand why and how battery is consumed by their devices. The project has also been a generator of ideas on how battery can be saved on mobile devices, via interventions in system software and improved hardware-software co-design methods.
