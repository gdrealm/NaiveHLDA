{"id":"75D45973-993D-44B2-865F-A49F7A9378C5","title":"Urban Transformations / Foresight Future of Cities Knowledge Exchange Fellowship","abstractText":"The ESRC is developing a wide ranging agenda for research and knowledge exchange in the area of Urban Transformations to critically assess and understand the impact and significance of urban transformations for the welfare and wellbeing of urban citizens across the globe. Where appropriate, we will work in collaboration with other relevant organisations that share a mutual interest in these urban issues.\n\nThe ESRC is therefore delighted to invite Expressions of Interest for a collaborative Knowledge Exchange Fellowship in partnership with the Foresight Future of Cities project.\n\nThe aim of this Fellowship is to work on behalf of the ESRC Urban Transformations portfolio to synthesise evidence, promote opportunities for research impacts and support various knowledge exchange activities. This will include identifying opportunities to enhance the links between the Foresight Future of Cities project, the wider network of cities' stakeholders and the urban academic research community. The fellow will be expected to work closely with the ESRC Urban Transformations Coordinator and Foresight Future of Cities Project Team.\n\n[taken from ESRC website on details for call http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/funding-opportunities/34457/esrc-urban-transformations-and-foresight-future-of-cities-knowledge-exchange-fellowship.aspx]","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N01510X/1","grantId":"ES/N01510X/1","fundValue":"92358","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola  Headlam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
