Differences across states (oil producing states and non-oil producing states) in diseases risk will be investigated by relating the geographical location (environmental exposure from petroleum production and air pollution) to the observed spatial distribution of diseases in the data.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1221","grantId":"RES-000-22-1221","fundValue":"41522","fundStart":"2006-06-26","fundEnd":"2007-06-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ngianga-Bakwin  Kandala","coPersons":["John  Micklewright"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
