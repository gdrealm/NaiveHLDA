As the underlying technologies are being further developed and translated from laboratory settings to real-world applications, RAS is playing an increasingly important role for the UK's economy and its future growth. The recent capital investment from the UK government through the EPSRC has resulted in the creation of eight dedicated centres/facilities across the country covering key areas of transport, healthcare, manufacturing, and unmanned systems to ensure that the UK will maintain its leading engineering and research capacity in RAS. This capital investment is further enhanced by the announcement of four Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in RAS. To ensure that the capital investment and core activities of the CDTs are fully integrated to support the wider UK communities in RAS and underpin its future development, there is a pressing need to establish a nation-wide RAS Network to coordinate and strategically grow the research base, act as a portal to interface with industry and deliver technological advances with the potential for translational uptake, maximise the impact of CDTs and provide flexible access to the state-of-the-art capital equipment. \n\nThe key focus covered by the proposed Network includes transport, healthcare, manufacturing and services, unmanned systems for aerospace, marine, environment and defence, as well as underpinning technologies of RAS. The activities of the Network include: 1) Network Events: UK Robotics Conference, Symposia and Focused Workshops; 2) Strategic Roadmap Events and User Forums; 3) Support for Interdisciplinary Mobility and Industrial Secondment; 4) Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Projects and Design Challenges; 5) Public Engagement and Exhibitions; 6) Online Engagement, Web Forum and Social Media; and 7) Government Policy and High Level Engagement. As the Network expands, it will include broader stakeholders in the UK and leading international collaborators in both academia and industry. \n\nThe Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators of the project are:\n\nProfessor Guang-Zhong Yang, Imperial College London (PI)\nProfessor David Lane, Heriot-Watt University\nProfessor Paul Newman, University of Oxford\nProfessor Chris Melhuish, University of West England\nDr Arthur Richards, Bristol University\nProfessor Sethu Vijayakumar, The University of Edinburgh\nDr Robert Richardson, University of Leeds\nProfessor Paul Conway, Loughborough University\nProfessor Stephen Roberts, University of Oxford\nProfessor Tony Prescott, University of Sheffield\nDr Michael Jump, University of Liverpool\nProfessor James Scanlan, University of Southampton\nProfessor Mandayam Srinivasan, University College London\nProf Lord S Bhattacharyya, University of Warwick\nDr Robert Merrifield, Imperial College London","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M012522/1","grantId":"EP/M012522/1","fundValue":"507337","fundStart":"2015-03-02","fundEnd":"2019-03-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Guang-Zhong  Yang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
