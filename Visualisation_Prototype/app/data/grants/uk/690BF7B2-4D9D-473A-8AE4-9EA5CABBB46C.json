This monograph -the first book to be devoted to a single work by this leading living composer - will examine the complex genesis and organisation of The Mask of Orpheus, including discussion of its integral components and its staging. The study will also consider the wider issues raised by the work in a range of interdisciplinary context, including the significance for late-,modern art of myth, memory, nature and identity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113142/1","grantId":"113142/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Cross","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
