Its malleable properties, along with its resistance to corrosion, has made it a highly attractive metal for use in a variety of different applications, from lead-based pipes, paint, and even food-storage vesicles. This is despite it being known as a poison since Roman times. Although strict environmental regulations are now in place, lead is still responsible for the highest proportion of environmentally caused diseases. The impact of lead poisoning is enormous, yet little is understood about the actual chemistry of lead in biological systems. One of the its targets is RNA; lead(II) ions have been shown to be very efficient at cleaving RNA, specifically in the single-stranded regions such as loops and bulges. In lead-free conditions, many of the cleavage sites are actually bound to inert metal centres, such as zinc(II) and magnesium(II), indicating that lead possesses a unique property that cleaves RNA whereas as other metal centres do not. It is assumed that lead first coordinates to RNA and then cleaves the sugar backbone. Several biochemical studies have investigated this process, but there have been no chemical examples for this type of cleavage reaction. This proposal describes a method for observing this reactivity by synthesizing models of lead coordinated to RNA using a well-defined ligand system instead of RNA, and investigating whether it is possible for these model complexes to cleave RNA strands. In addition, this proposal strives to understand why lead behaves differently to that of other metal centres by comparing the reactivity of the lead model systems to other group 14 metal complexes (such as those of tin and germanium).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E032575/1","grantId":"EP/E032575/1","fundValue":"188975","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Robin Fulton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
