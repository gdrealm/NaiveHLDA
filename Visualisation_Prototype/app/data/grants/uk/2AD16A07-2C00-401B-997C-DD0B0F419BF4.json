{"id":"2AD16A07-2C00-401B-997C-DD0B0F419BF4","title":"Activation of human ovarian follicles and derivation of competent oocytes","abstractText":"Women are born with a store of eggs that must last them throughout their reproductive life. These eggs are in the ovary at an immature stage within protective sac like structures (follicles) and held in a resting state until they are activated to grow. This process of activation is the most important factor that determines a womans reproductive lifespan and when she will enter menopause. However, almost nothing is known about how this process is regulated in humans although its disruption can lead to Premature Ovarian Failure (POF), infertility and associated female health problems.\nThis study is looking at how activation is regulated and how it can be manipulated to alter the number and quality of eggs that develop to the stage where they can be fertilised. We are now able to tackle this problem in human tissue by using a novel culture system that we have developed that supports activation of follicles outside the body. Using this we will investigate the role of two mechanisms (PTEN and mTORC1) that have been shown to affect the rate of follicle activation in mice by adding factors that disrupt (inhibit/stimulate) them. Oocyte development and function can then be tested after these manipulations. The results obtained could lead to improved treatments for POF, infertility as well as development of methods to regulate female fertility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901839","grantId":"G0901839","fundValue":"488299","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Evelyn  Telfer","coPersons":["Joo  Thong","Richard  Anderson"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
