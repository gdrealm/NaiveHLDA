The challenge of big data is that the sizes \nof the domains of the distributions are immense, typically resulting in unacceptably \nslow algorithms. Scaling up a computational framework to comfortably deal with \never-larger data presents a series of challenges in algorithms. \n\nThis prompts the basic question: Given samples from some unknown distribution, what can we infer?\nWhile this question has been studied for several decades by various different communities of researchers,\nboth the number of samples and running time required for such estimation tasks\nare not yet well understood, even for some surprisingly simple types of discrete distributions.\n\nThe proposed research focuses on sublinear-time algorithms, that is,\nalgorithms that run in time that is significantly less than the domain of the underlying distributions.\nIn this project we will develop sublinear-time algorithms for estimating various classes \nof discrete distributions over very large domains. \nSpecific problems we will address include:\n(1) Developing sublinear algorithms to estimate probability distributions that satisfy various\nnatural types of &quot;shape restrictions&quot; on the underlying probability density function.\n\n(2) Developing sublinear algorithms for estimating complex distributions that result\n from the aggregation of many independent simple sources of randomness.\n\nWe believe that highly efficient algorithms for these estimation tasks \nmay play an important role for the next generation of large-scale machine learning applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L021749/1","grantId":"EP/L021749/1","fundValue":"98776","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ilias  Diakonikolas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
