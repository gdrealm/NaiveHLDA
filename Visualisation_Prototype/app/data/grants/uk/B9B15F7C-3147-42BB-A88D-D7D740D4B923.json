Malaria also causes much suffering in adults, preventing people from working and sustaining the cycle of poverty. Modern drugs and insecticides do not provide complete protection against this disease; there is concern that malaria control will be weakened as the parasite and mosquito vector evolve resistance to them. There is an urgent need to develop alternative malaria control methods that are sustainable and do not rely on chemicals. Bednets offer best practice for personal defence but do not protect the whole family and equity issues have always been a concern for coverage. \n \nHistorically, malaria was controlled in many parts of the tropics by mosquito-proofing houses with screens. This technology is now largely ignored or forgotten. In a pilot study in experimental huts we found that installing screen ceilings reduced entry by malaria mosquitoes by 78-80%. We now propose to investigate the level of protection from malarial mosquitoes that can be achieved by installing full screens or ceilings (as a less expensive alternative) in real homes for real people. The study will be based at the MRC in The Gambia and conducted in Farafenni, a sub-Sahelian town of 27,000 people. \n\nWe aim to assess whether the provision of house-screening or screen ceilings can reduce the exposure to malaria mosquitoes in the house by half; to investigate the household?s perceptions of comfort, durability and acceptability; and, in a separate study using experimental huts, to investigate the added value of impregnating the screens with insecticide. \n\nThe effect of the screens will be measured by catching mosquitoes inside houses using light traps ? a standard tool for collecting mosquitoes. These mosquitoes will then be tested to see how many carry malaria parasites. This will allow us to assess the degree of protection from infection afforded by the screens. Household members will sleep under bednets for the course of the study. \n\nThe knowledge generated will help governments, NGOs and policy makers make informed decisions on malaria control strategies. Findings from this important study will be shared with our partners in the Gambian Government and the NGO community through local workshops. The findings may warrant media attention regionally and internationally. Screening may be a welcome addition to the existing methods of malaria control that gives affordable, sustainable and long-lasting protection for the whole family.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400031","grantId":"G0400031","fundValue":"534205","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven William Lindsay","coPersons":["Paul M Emerson","Amy A.
