{"id":"B23CCC2D-73DE-4047-8D1C-6A5F8E920498","title":"Queer family and form: Audiovisual reconfigurations","abstractText":"This project has examined recent lesbian and gay film and video productions that explore changing meanings and memberships of 'family'. The research intervenes in a context where the same-sex marriage an adoption and lesbian/gay 'families' of choice' operate as boundary conflicts' within boarder debates over intimacy and kinship. Or particular interest are the 'cultural forms' (such as genre and narrative) through which ideas and ideas of kinship are reproduces and challenged in audio-visual media. The contemporary pertinence and interest of this research arises from its attention to the ways in which lesbian and gay film and video makers intervene with prescience to 'image' changing kinship practices, including diaspora kinship.\n\nThis grant has facilitated the completion of two articles for publication in refereed academic journals: 'Auto ethnography and the &quot;queer look back&quot;: Imaging queer kinship' for the Gay and Lesbian Quarterly, and 'Queer melodrama and the &quot;family romance&quot; for Cinema Obscura. During my leave, I presented work in progress at conferences in Vancouver (Society for Cinema and Media Studies) and London, Canada (Global Queries). Tremendously fruitful, this leave has enabled a rich foundation for developing a monograph entitles Queer Kinship: Audio-visual reconfigurations. Further, the exploration of queer auto ethnography has inspired plans for an edited collection on that topic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111937/1","grantId":"111937/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Julianne  Pidduck","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
