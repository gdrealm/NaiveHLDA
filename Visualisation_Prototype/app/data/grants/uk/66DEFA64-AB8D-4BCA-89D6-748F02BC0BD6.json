Central to our ability to intervene in this situation is a clear understanding of the link between diet and obesity and the ability of industry to deliver food products capable of reducing risk. This project will lay down the scientific rational linking the gut microbiota with obesity, and provide a rational for using functional foods in the obese for improved health, targeted towards modulating the gut bacteria. Traditional risk factors for obesity and associated metabolic disorders are dietary, genetic and exercise linked. However, there is the contention that these cannot fully explain the explosive increase seen in recent years. This was given added significance in 2006 when the first reports appeared suggeted that gut bacterial profiles in obese and lean persons differed. It was hypothesised that the bacterial profiles variably affected calory extraction rates from food and that some of their metabolites could influence satiety. This is still an area of some debate (and it may be that the traditional risk factors themselves affect microflora profiles), however what is not in question is that the gut microbiota has a major role to play in human metabolism. This is because of the huge numbers that are present and their constant supply of nutrients (principally diet). Should the gut microbiota differences be a factor in obese related conditions, then this opens up the possibily of altering the situation by using dietary ingredients that have a selective fernentation in situ. Prebiotics are functional foods ingredients that exert major composition and metabolic changes in the human gut microbiota. Together with probiotics, they are attracting much attention for their ability to improve gastrointestinal health. New products are constantly being developed, with the main remit being improved digestion and wellbeing. Research on modulating the gut flora has largely targeted gut infections including links into chronic disorders like IBS and ulcerative colitis. Given the recent link between gut microflora and obesity, it makes sense to research whether prebiotics can exert a modulatory role. In this project, these have been chosen over probiotics as they are more efficacious in exerting change in bacterial populations within the gut. Our collaborative research in an animal models has shown that LPS, a cell wall constituent of Gram -ve bacteria, can exert a metabolic endotoxaemia which is characteristic of diabetes in humans. Prebiotics target Gram+ve flora (principally bifidobacteria). Further studies in the murine showed that the toxic effects of LPS could be reversed by repressing Gram -ves at the expense of bifidobacteria. Here, we aim to replicate these experiments in humans at risk of metabolic syndrome. We will use a proven prebiotic (BiMuno, a type of galactooligosaccharide GOS), that was originally developed in our laboratories and is now commercially availble, to target bifidobacteria in a human feeding study. Prior to this, food quality experitise will be applied towards assessing the most appropriate dietary delivery vehicle that maintains functionality of the ingredient and has optimal sensory qualities. A placebo will also be trialled. The outcomes will be an in vivo assessment of the capacity to alter gut microbiota and concomitant effects upon validated markers of metabolic syndrome. If the research is successful it will lead towards a dietary intervention product that positively affects the risks associated with obesity in a manner that changes the microflora influence. This would have much impact upon a major 21st century dietary problem and tally that with an extremely topical functional food approach. The outcome would also partly inform on the health attributes that can be expected from altering a person's gut microbiota and has relevance for both the probiotic and prebiotic industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H004734/1","grantId":"BB/H004734/1","fundValue":"586985","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Prevalence of obesity is increasing with abdominal adiposity playing a role in metabolic syndrome (MetS) development.

These products were initially manufactured in the Food and Nutritional Sciences department of the University of Reading. Products were tested for sensory properties by human sensory panels and for prebiotic functionality using in vitro gut model experiments. Subsequently the products were produced on a larger scale, by Allied Bakeries and Coca-Cola, and used in human intervention studies, assessing both prebiotic properties and markers of the metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nInterim work conducted during this project was presented at the Wellcome Trust, Cambridge, 2012 Exploring Human Host-Microbiome Interactions in Health and Disease. A further presentation occurred at the annual meeting of the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics, Cork, 2012. Oral presentations of this research have also been given at the RANK prize meeting in Grasmere 2012, at the Society for Applied Microbiology Annual Summer Conference 2013, Cardiff. A final project summary was given at the Wellcome Trust 2013 Exploring Human Host-Microbiome Interactions in Health and Disease Conference in Cambridge. \n\nTwo radio interviews on BBC radio Berkshire in July 2012 were given detailing the theory behind the project. \n\nIn 2012 September Dr. Gemma Walton participated in an evening event at the Science Museum (Science Uncovered - September 2012). An in vitro model of the gut was used to attract attention and members of the public were able to ask questions about any gut, or microbiology related work being conducted.\n\nFurther public engagements on Channel 4's Embarassing bodies, children's BBCs Absolute Genius and the BBCs Mysterious World of the Human Stomach with Michael Mosely have been carried out.\n\nThe PI gave a presentation to Science in Parliament in 2013, that included the project. This was a briefing on gut health to MPs, Lords and Key Opinion Leaders from universities, industry and the media.It was also presented at a workshop in Palmerston North, New Zealand in 2012. This was to develop links with scientists in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, draft FP7 submissions and help plan the content for Horizon 2020.\n\nLay lectures to University of 3rd Age and Oxford Speedwell Trust were also given on the area of obesity and gut microbiome.
