{"id":"EC8F9037-2CFD-409D-AD23-5CFA848958CC","title":"Does the presence of thrombophilia increase the risk of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?","abstractText":"The cut surface of the lung resembles a bath sponge ? with numerous tiny air sacs being supplied with air by larger airways. Each air sac is surrounded by a lattice-work structure of small blood vessels which remove the oxygen from the air sac and transport it on around the body. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease in which the walls of the air sacs become thickened and distorted, and the close relationship between the air sac and the blood vessels destroyed. As a consequence the lungs become stiff and inefficient and people with IPF develop an annoying and persistent cough, and marked shortness of breath on exertion. The average life expectancy of a person with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is less than 3 years and people die about 7 years prematurely. There are about 4500 new cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis each year in the UK, and this number is increasing rapidly for reasons that are not known. At present there are no treatments which improve the outlook for people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in terms of either survival or symptom control.\n\nAbout 20% of the UK population have an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) as a consequence of either inherited or acquired defects in the clotting cascade. On the basis of evidence from laboratory experiments, epidemiological studies and one small trial we believe that these people might be at increased risk of developing IPF and once they get it might have a worse outlook. In our study we will look for the presence of thrombophilia in 250 people with IPF collected from 9 hospital centres in the Trent region of the UK and compare these people to 250 members of the public without IPF recruited from general practice. We will also follow-up our people with IPF to determine their outcome.\n\nIf our study shows that our hypothesis is correct then the next step is a simple trial of anticoagulation in this patient group. The drugs to do this are currently available in the UK and used to treat other conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis. The development of this trial would offer the hope of some benefit from medical intervention for this patient group for the first time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802065","grantId":"G0802065","fundValue":"458198","fundStart":"2009-08-10","fundEnd":"2013-01-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Brian Hubbard","coPersons":["Gisli  Jenkins","Simon Richard Johnson","Andrew W Fogarty","Anthony John Avery","Moira Katherine Whyte","Tricia  McKeever"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
