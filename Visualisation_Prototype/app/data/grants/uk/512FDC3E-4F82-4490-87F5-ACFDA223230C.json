{"id":"512FDC3E-4F82-4490-87F5-ACFDA223230C","title":"Art-Science Collaborations, Bodies, and Environments","abstractText":"The proposed AHRC-NSF Collaborative Funding Opportunity between Leigh Payne (University of Oxford) and Kathryn Sikkink (University of Minnesota) aims to develop an empirically-tested theory of transitional justice (i.e., human rights trials, truth commissions, and amnesties) to explain its impact on human rights and democracy. It also strives to develop a corresponding set of policy recommendations to achieve those political goals.\nThe collaborators' prior research qualifies them for this project. Each has published widely on violence, human rights, and democratization. They recently formed separate research teams to develop large-N, cross-national data bases on transitional justice mechanisms. Both teams confirmed for the first time that transitional justice has a positive impact on human rights and democracy. Contradictory findings from their research, however, have motivated them to collaborate to develop a new project that further improves understanding of transitional justice. \nThe proposed project will construct a new data set that merges their existing data, adds newly collected and refined data on transitional justice mechanisms, and employs a mixed-method approach to explain the success of transitional justice in achieving its political objectives.\nQuantitative research, utilizing propensity scores and matching techniques, will allow the researchers to make inferences from the large-N data set while qualitative research, specifically fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fs QCA), process-tracing, and the case study method, enables the team to identify combinations of conditions and/or multiple causal pathways for positive or negative effects on democracy and human rights.\n\nIntellectual Merit. \nThe proposed project will build the first empirically-tested theory of when, why, and how transitional justice achieves human rights and democracy goals. It will derive and test assumptions from four theoretical approaches: enforcement and deterrence, norms and socialization, rule of law, and accountability with stability. The first three focus on the role of trials in bringing positive political change, a mechanism identified by both research teams as crucial to transitional justice success. \nThe fourth approach examines how combinations of mechanisms (i.e., trials and amnesties or trials, amnesties, and truth commissions), findings from Payne research, achieve these positive results. Based on these theoretical approaches and previous findings, the collaborative team has created a research design that will allow them to make an important theoretical contribution to the study of transitional justice, human rights, and democratization. They will present their findings at international scholarly conferences and publish scholarly articles to advance academic debate in an under-theorised field.\n\nBroader Impacts. \nFirst, the study will advance transitional justice policy. The project identifies the specific types and combinations of mechanisms and contextual factors (i.e., political and economic conditions, judicial institutions, and political agency) that enhance the likelihood of success of transitional justice. \nThe researchers will produce a policy blueprint and present their findings to policy-makers at conferences and meetings, disseminate them to relevant organisations, and make them publicly available on their website.\nThe collaborative project emerges from a creative method for resolving contradictory findings in the researchers' previous work. Rather than using their different findings to carve out separate and competing projects, the researchers have chosen to collaborate to achieve important theoretical and policy goals. \nSecond, the collaborators will build an institutional partnership between the Oxford Transitional Justice Research program and the University of Minnesota's Transitional Justice Research Collaborative, in which both researchers play leading roles, to maintain the data set and encourage future research initiatives. \nThird, the project includes training and professionalization dimensions. The original members of the research teams will remain involved in the collaboration as consultants, contributing and enhancing their skills, and co-authoring scholarly papers. The advanced quantitative (e.g., propensity scores, matching techniques) and qualitative (e.g., fs QCA, process-tracing, case study) methodologies incorporated into this joint project provide new training for the consultants and the new Oxford and Minnesota graduate student members of the research teams.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I500022/1","grantId":"AH/I500022/1","fundValue":"350548","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We are as yet in the early stages of analysis and dissemination.

And why do artists want to engage science? In a multi-sited study of contemporary collaborative projects involving diverse groups of scientists and artists we sought to understand the institutional, political, epistemic and technological forces that both allow for these interactions to emerge and that shape their development and wider impact. We have focused on detailed descriptions and analyses of the day-to-day activities, as well as the products of, such collaborations.\nThe core work of the project was the development of ethnographies of a number of sites around the world. These ranged from top agenda-setting art/science groups to emerging, experimental ones. These included: Arts Catalyst, London; Swiss Artists-in-Labs; SymbioticA, Australia; Cape Farewell, UK; Advanced Visualisation Lab, US; and several emerging environmental arts practitioners, including Frances Whitehead and Lillian Ball.\n \nThe project findings fall into several categories.\n\n1.Artistic Case Studies\n\nIn the course of our research we have generated a series of publications that explore artistic case studies from our sites, focusing on particular works and practices. These explore the contribution art can make to our understanding of bodies and environments, and the scientific discourses that frame these. \n\nThese have focused, for example, on art as a form of environmental remediation; art as a means of imagining the nano; and sensing environments.\n\n2. Reanimating Aesthetics as a way of engaging with complex problems.\n\nPapers and an edited book have been produced that explore the crucial role of aesthetics not simply as an artistic practice, but a scientific one also, in framing the public's apprehension of complex problems such as climate change. Two curated exhibitions, one 'virtual,' have taken these ideas forward to the public.\n\n3. Promoting Inter-disciplinarity\n\nA key theme in our publications, but also our research practice, has been the promotion, but also critical assessment of, an inter-disciplinarity. We have worked as a group across various subfields in geography, and have made extensive connections with both artistic and scientific groups in the process. We are currently working on some 'best practice' commentaries in light of this work.\n\n4. Science Communication and Engagement\n\nWhile all of our case study sites involved much more than new ways to communicate scientific practice, one of the unexpected findings of our of project has been the receptiveness of scientific venues to introducing these issues. We have produced, and continue to do so, a number of reviews for Science, Nature and Nature Climate Change on the changing practices of science venues, from museums to laboratories and botanic gardens, and their integration of art. We are in the early stages of assessing and disseminating key findings. However, we can refer to the following: \n\nFirst and foremost, the ethnographic case studies that we have produced, and are publishing on, provide interested groups (artists, scientists, funding bodies, and institutional bodies) insight into the day-to-day factors that shape successful art/science collaborations, as well as the range of problems encountered in the process. As these groups further push an inter-disciplinarity, these studies offer a valuable source of information.\n\nSecond, the research undertaken has itself fostered a range of new networks, which are currently being nurtured in the form of new grant applications, studentships and research initiatives (see outputs). \n\nThird, and in methodological terms, we have adapted methods of data collections and invented others in order to get a grasp of 'art/science' phenomena and worldviews; these do not fit readily into accepted techniques. Our reworked Q sort method, now bespoke for visual as well as verbal literacy, is of particular interest to researchers working on inter-disciplinary projects.
