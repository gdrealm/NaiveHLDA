{"id":"5DFA51A5-63D3-4C2F-B55C-8B503A380AE8","title":"Follow On: Rapidly Deployable Large Span Shelters","abstractText":"The proposal's objective is to develop a concept for rapidly deployable shelters with span between 12 and 40 metres, capable of housing helicopters and large machinery in an emergency relief or military operation. Such shelters must be air transportable, affordable, durable, easy to deploy, maintain, and function at locations worldwide.The previous research developed a unique deployable structure. The structure uses the Bennett linkage, which when modified enables compact folding and the combination of many similar linkages together, forming large deployable assemblies of various profiles including arches and towers. We shall examine two types of Bennett structure: a deployed arch supporting a membrane cover, and a single linkage held in place by a guy rope system with the whole supporting the membrane cover.This proposal is to select, make and test the proposed structures ready for the creation of a prototype shelter.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502903/1","grantId":"EP/E502903/1","fundValue":"89479","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is a relatively small project in which we developed two valid concepts for large shelters.

The 1st shelter consists of a number of deployable arches upon which membrane covers can be attached to complete the shelter. The arch can be shored to a compact bundle for transportation. The 2nd one is made from four large components hinged together. These shelters can be used for both military and civilian operations where fast installation of accommodations is required. The concepts work well, which has been demonstrated by a 8m span model. We just need an industry partner to take it forward. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction","dataset":"gtr"}
