The main focus of this is 'personalisation', a strategy to enable people to control their own individual budgets so that they can choose the services that they need. Although individual budgets have operated successfully for disabled people, early evidence suggests older people may be less comfortable with this. Older people do want to have their say about services and the importance of enabling older people have a voice has been recognised.This project will contribute to effective and ethical ways to enable older people to have a voice in the changes that are taking place in welfare services, as well as their own support services. <br /><br />The project will develop a knowledge exchange between researchers, practitioners and older people.The aim is to build understanding of how to involve older people in decision making in ways that can contribute to well-being. It is based on both findings and practice experience of working with older people as co-researchers in studying well-being. It will involve development of practice guidelines, resource and training material that can be disseminated to practitioners and researchers working with older people in the statutory and voluntary sectors.<br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J001058/1","grantId":"ES/J001058/1","fundValue":"85386","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marian  Barnes","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Ward"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
