{"id":"C7113B06-6DA7-4ECA-A346-966EE62EF4C8","title":"The role of ocular aberrations and retinal image quality in accommodation response accuracy","abstractText":"SummaryMyopia (short-sightedness) is an increasingly common visual problem, caused principally by excessive axial expansion (i.e. growth along the front to back axis) of the eye. The condition blurs distance vision. Research carried out to date shows that genetics (i.e. inheritance of myopia from parents to children) plays a major role in the onset of myopia, but there is an additional influence from the visual environment. Studies of the effect of the visual environment have shown that people doing nearwork-intensive jobs (e.g. microscope users) are more likely to develop myopia than those in occupations where their vision is mainly focused at distance (e.g. professional drivers). The exact link between near vision and the development of myopia is not yet known.This research project aims to investigate the effect of wavefront aberrations (errors in the focusing of a light source as it leaves the eye having been reflected from the retina) in people without myopia, with stable myopia, and with increasing myopia. An instrument (an adaptive optics system) will be constructed to measure the wavefront aberrations of the eye. The instrument will have the added facility of being able to manipulate the wavefront aberrations (e.g. totally correct the wavefront error, or increase the wavefront error). The way in which the eye focuses for near vision will be recorded with the modified wavefront aberrations.When an eye views white light source, the optics of the eye split up the white light into its component colours (longitudinal chromatic aberration). A number of modern artificial light sources have outputs that peak at specific wavelengths. This is particularly apparent in fluorescent lamps. It may be the case that the choice of lamp selected to illuminate a near vision task has influence on the ability of the eye to focus accurately. This project will measure the ability of the eye to focus different wavelengths of light from a variety of artificial sources. The work will then be extended to measure the error of eye focus during near tasks under different light sources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D036550/1","grantId":"EP/D036550/1","fundValue":"120426","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Mallen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":" This project designed and constructed a unique adaptive optics system for the study of the human accommodation system.The system comprises two channels which allows the simultaneous manipulation of ocular aberrations (small errors in focus of the eye, over and above those corrected by conventional spectacles or contact lenses), together with monitoring of the real time measurement of the fluctuations in focus of the eye. Key findings surround the role of higher-order ocular aberration, together with their dynamic fluctuations, in the feedback mechanism that controls human accommodation responses to changes in stimulus. From our published data, it is the case that the role that aberrations play in accommodation control depends upon the direction of the response of the system to a change in stimulus (i.e. whether the eye is shifting focus towards or away from itself). It follow, therefore, that the accommodation control system is drawing feedback signals not only from the quality of the retinal image (i.e. blurred or clear), but also from the motor inputs to ciliary smooth muscle (the ring of muscle that flexes the lens in a human eye). This may also be linked to inputs from the convergence system, (the muscular system which rotates the eyes to align the visual axes to a common point); this is the subject of the next project funded by EPSRC. Non-academic uses for the monocular adaptive optics system could include the testing of performance of new lens implants fitted following cataract surgery. The system could also be used in the evaluation of visual performance in new methods of vision correction, e.g. ophthalmic lenses with special surfaces to minimize optical distortion. The system has been in constant use since the completion of the grant. A recent study using the system has explored the role of chaos theory in the control of ocular accommodation. Manuscripts reporting this work are under review, and will hopefully be reported via ROS in due course. The system has been designed such that it will function with minimal maintenance costs, thus providing a sustainable measurement platform for the future. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
