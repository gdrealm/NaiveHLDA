A systematic study into factors affecting tranquility is urgently needed in response to the European Directive on the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise (END). Although defining quiet areas in accordance with the END using purely acoustical measures is an important step in protecting tranquil spaces, there is a need to go further and integrate both aural and visual factors into an overall descriptor that will be sufficiently precise and practical. There have been several attempts to study the cross-modal interaction and the link between the perceived degree of noise annoyance and specific visual settings. However, the relevant importance of visual and auditory stimuli for the construction of a tranquil space is far from being understood. The purpose of this work is to complete a detailed investigation on how the auditory and visual stimuli influence the perception of tranquillity in order to develop robust design tools for use in designing and protecting tranquil spaces in urban and rural locations. A unique feature of this project is the focused attempt to determine the bimodal estimate of tranquillity for a combined audiovisual scene. For this purpose a coherent team of optometry and acoustics experts has been assembled. The proposed work is a combination of field data collection and laboratory analysis. The work aims to achieve better understanding of the effects of visual and audio stimuli on the perception of tranquillity of rural and urban landscapes, refine a newly proposed engineering tool for the design of external tranquil spaces with a highly variable audio and visual characteristics and to provide multi-disciplinary training for MSc/PhD students, research and academic staff. For the first time a systematic work on the multisensory perception of tranquillity of external spaces affected by sounds will be examined using avanced method of integration of information. A representative range of locations will be identified at which audio and visual recordings will be taken based on a previously obtained database of landscape types. Special software will be developed to analyse objectively the termporal and spectral characteristics of the recordings. The recorded data will be also analysed using a representative number of subjects recruited for the new tests. Two unique psycho-acoustic suites available at the Universities of Bradford and Sheffield will be used for these experiments. The dependent variables will include an overall rating of tranquillity and the independent variables will include noise descriptors, sound quality indicators and visual parameters such as the space occupied by natural features in the scene and the number of people present. The results of the objective measurements and the subjective experiments will be merged with the existing tranquillity assessment database and analysed using appropriate software. A unique outdoor area (Peace Garden) on campus has been recently developed. This facility will be used to conduct experiments on tranquillity to test the developed design tool. The creation of the garden which is nearing completion was a result of a joint effort between various Schools at the Universities of Bradford and Sheffield who foresaw its use for a variety of research purposes including studies of tranquillity. The work will involve MSc/PhD students who study courses in Engineering, Life Sciences and Multimedia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F055986/1","grantId":"EP/F055986/1","fundValue":"165643","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The tranquillity rating prediction tool which was developed as a result of this project has been used extensively by researchers to study the environmental noise quality in restorative urban environments such as parks, gardens and dedicated green spaces.

This tool links directly the objectively measured noise level, proportion of contextual features and a subjectively perceived tranquillity rating. An important deliverable is simple mathematical expressions suitable for practitioners who design and maintain restorative outdoor spaces with enhanced tranquillity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An important part of this project was to consider the relative importance of uni- and bimodal stimuli (audio and visual) on the construct of the tranquillity space (Task 5). The simplest model here is one in which the combined audiovisual tranquillity estimate is equal to the mean of the unimodal estimates. Any departure from this simple model means that the effect of one particular modality is dominant. Our results show that the tranquillity rating fells into two distinct groups. For scenes with a combined high tranquillity rating, the combined rating is higher than the average of the unimodal estimates, i.e. the combined rating converges towards the higher of the unimodal estimates. For scenes with a low tranquillity rating the opposite is true, i.e. when a combined rating is lower than that expected from a simple mean of the individual ratings, the tranquillity rating converges towards the lower of the unimodal estimates. This result suggests that the visual quality of environment cannot be neglected in a soundscape quality evaluation exercise and contributes strongly to the tranquillity construct. We found that pupil size and heart rate measures do not represent physiological correlates of tranquillity ratings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The collected stimuli were used in an additional fMRI study which was organised by Prof. Woodruff and Dr. Hunter of Cognition and Neuroimaging Laboratory at Sheffield. The results of this study demonstrate a significantly greater effective connectivity between the auditory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex in subjects presented with more tranquil scenes. This work is highly novel and it paves the way to the development of objective measures of the influence of environmental features on the mental states of individuals and populations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The project results have been disseminated via conferences and journal publications 5 of which are listed in the Publication section. In total 9 journal and 8 conference publications have emerged from this project. 2 new grant proposals to the EPSRC are being developed as a result of this work. The team used part of the EPSRC funding to organise a final dissemination event which took place in Huxley Lecture Theatre at London Zoo on the 9th of October 2009. This event was opened by the Major of London, Mr Boris Johnson, and it attracted over 150 practioners from the UK. The tranquillity rating prediction tool developed as a result of this project is sufficiently practical to be used by consultants, environmental engineers and landscape architects to predict the visual and audio quality of external spaces. This work paves the wave to the development of a range of quantitative prediction models for assessing the restorative quality of internal and external spaces.
