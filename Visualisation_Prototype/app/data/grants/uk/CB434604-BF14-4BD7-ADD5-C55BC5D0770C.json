Topics for discussion will include molecular nanoobjects, polarons on nanoscale, low-dimensional conductors, strongly-correlated electrons in nanoobjects, metal-insulator transitions and size quantizations, and mesoscopic quantum theory including first-principle simulations. The workshop is planned as a unique meeting of European researches working in experimental nano-physics, quantum chemistry and nano-engineering, and theorists studying strongly-correlated electrons and polarons. The workshop will also mark the centenary of the birth of Sir Nevill Francis Mott (The Nobel Laureate), whose research on metal-insulator transitions, polarons and amorphous conductors has tremendous impact on our current understanding of strongly-correlated quantum systems. The EPSRC award will make the ESF workshop more relevant to the UK research community and will better position Loughborough and other UK Universities to secure research funding from Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D07777X/1","grantId":"EP/D07777X/1","fundValue":"6347","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"A Sasha Alexandrov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
