Although morphological and petrological features of ash and scoria have provided insights into the mechanisms of explosive basaltic eruptions, important questions on the transition between different mechanisms are still unanswered. Three approaches to understanding ash composition are: plume spectrometry, chemical analysis of bulk plume particle samples and particle microscopy. The first of these techniques is experiencing a step change in its ability to provide insight for two reasons. Firstly, high resolution refractive index data from volcanic ash samples is becoming available through a NERC funded project. While this data is not critical to the project, it allows the refractive indices of samples from a known eruption (e.g. Grimsv&ouml;tn) to be used to generate the optical properties that are used in the retrieval of the properties of the volcanic ash cloud from satellite measurements. Secondly, high resolution infrared spectrometers now observe the Earth with sufficient frequency that recent eruption in remote locations have been well observed, e.g. the 2011 eruption of Nabro in Eritrea. \n\nThe project will initially construct a database of ash optical properties (extinction coefficient, single scatter albedo and phase function) based on existing information in the scientific literature and new ash measurements. These properties will then form the basis of an optimal estimation type retrieval of ash composition, optical thickness and effective radius from high resolution infrared spectra. The retrieval algorithm will be developed for three different types of observation:\n\n1) High resolution infrared transmission spectra of ash near the volcanic vent. These spectra are provided by our project partners who will assist in the interpretation of the measurements.\n\n2) High resolutioninfrared emission spectra from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard MetOp satellite. IASI is a nadir viewing Fourier transform spectrometer that covers the spectral range 645 to 2760 cm-1 (3.62-15.5 microns). The IASI field of view consists of four circles of 20 km diameter inside a square of 50 x 50 km, and nominally it can achieve global coverage in 12 hours.\n\n3) High resolution infrared emission spectra from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) onboard ENVISAT satellite. MIPAS measures atmospheric limb emission spectra from 685-2410 cm-1 (14.5 to 4.1 microns) over a tangent altitude range 6-68 km from 2002 to the present.\n\nUsing these instruments we will observe volcanic ash generated by several different volcanoes and during different stages of eruptive behaviour. The satellite based estimates of ash properties will be validated by comparing them to ash properties measured from ash samples as well as by comparison with other satellite results. Eruptions for which we have correlative measurements include Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull, Grimsv&ouml;tn, Nabro and Puyehue. The observed ash behaviour will then be interpreted in terms of the ash-generating volcanic processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J023310/1","grantId":"NE/J023310/1","fundValue":"321846","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Roy Gordon Grainger","coPersons":["David  Pyle","Tamsin Alice Mather"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
