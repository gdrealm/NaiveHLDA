In Malawi, one of the 10 poorest countries in the world, initial enrolment in school is high, but half the children drop out by the end of year 6, and only a third complete the 8 years of primary school. Drop-out in adolescence is higher in girls than in boys, and often follows early pregnancy and marriage. Using data from a large population-based study with annual surveys in northern Malawi (&gt; 10,000 children), and a study that has followed &gt;2500 adolescents over time in southern Malawi, we propose to explore the pathways to drop-out and their causes. \n\nImportant questions that we will address include: \n\nDo girls drop out of school because they are pregnant, or do they get pregnant because they were already disaffected with or failing school? \n\nHow far is an adolescent's own school behaviour influenced by the schooling or sexual behaviour of their peers or siblings?\n\nWhat attributes of the schools, of families and of the community reduce drop-out?\n\nThis research is a collaboration between academic researchers and those working in the Ministry of Education in Malawi, at national and district levels, allowing lessons learnt to influence education policy and practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L013967/1","grantId":"ES/L013967/1","fundValue":"160920","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Glynn","coPersons":["Barbara  Mensch","Fiona Ruth Parrott","Bianca  De Stavola","Amelia Catharine Crampin","Stephanie  Psaki"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
