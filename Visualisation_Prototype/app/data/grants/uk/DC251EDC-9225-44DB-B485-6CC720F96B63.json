The overall project\naims are to demonstrate the controlled emission of entangled photons from an LED structure emitting at a wavelength of\n1.55microns. This wavelength is the standard wavelength for fibre communications. Devices operating at this wavelength\nwill be required to achieve commercially significant Quantum Communications technologies. However entangled photons\nfrom quantum dots at this wavelength have not been demonstrated and there is a significant epitaxy challenge in\ndeveloping this technology.\nThe Cambridge team will develop Indium Arsenide quantum dots grown on Indium Phosphide substrates by Molecular\nBeam Epitaxy (MBE), complementing and contrasting with the development by Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy\n(MOVPE) in Sheffield. To demonstrate single photon emitters at this wavelength is challenging and there is a need to\ninvestigate the properties of the quantum dots by both techniques to understand how the quantum dots form and what\ncontrols the fundamental properties that will generate photon entanglement; including aspects such as the exciton spin\nsplitting value. The work will build significantly on the prior work carried out at shorter wavelengths in Sheffield, Toshiba\nand Cavendish laboratories using a different material system. In particular at Sheffield the result of quantum dot structures\ndeveloped under an EPSRC Programme Grant will benefit the project strongly since many of the physical properties may\nbe similar. The demonstration of high quality devices at this wavelength will be a significant milestone in matching Quantum\nCommunications to the current non-quantum fibre-communications infrastructure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508263/1","grantId":"EP/M508263/1","fundValue":"99879","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Ritchie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
