Researchers have adduced key evidence for both from the evolution of English possessive -s and the related but subtly different constructions in Swedish and Dutch. What has not to date been attempted, and what the present proposal offers, is a systematic synchronic and diachronic comparison of these constructions across all three languages. The aim is threefold: to provide a consistent multi-lingual dataset; to compare detailed historical trajectories; to develop a theoretical account of these items within a typology of grammatical markers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119317/1","grantId":"119317/1","fundValue":"177166","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kersti  Borjars","coPersons":["David  Denison"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
