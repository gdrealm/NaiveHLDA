{"id":"B67E4D6E-E92B-49E9-A482-BF669296A904","title":"Molecular genetics and biochemistry of parasites","abstractText":"The proposed research concerns important areas of biology of some of the most important groups of parasitic infectious agents. It is aimed at identifying processes in these organisms that are essential for the organisms to survive in their hosts. This in turn allows the identification of molecules that are essential to these parasites. Once identified, it is possible to use a variety of methods to identify small chemical compounds that interfere with the normal function of these essential parasite molecules. Such compounds can then be refined and evaluated for use as new drugs.\n The proposed research also has potential benefits to other areas of human medicine in that the findings generated may help in the design of treatments against other human diseases such as cancer and HIV infections and also underpin the development of diagnostics and vaccines. \n The research of the proposed group will be communicated to the general public in a variety of ways. We will make active use of the World Wide Web to publicise positive aspects of our research (publicising research into tropical medicine is subject to the usual concerns of publicising the use of animals in research). We will make use of the Universities? Publicity Services that produce publications aimed at local members of the public and business, and, where appropriate, issue press releases and contact the media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9722968","grantId":"G9722968","fundValue":"592681","fundStart":"1999-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Charles Mottram","coPersons":["Antony Paul Page","Eileen  Devaney","Michael Peter Barrett","Graham Herbert  Coombs","Malcolm  Walkinshaw","Iain Lindsay Johnstone","William Nigel  Hunter"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
