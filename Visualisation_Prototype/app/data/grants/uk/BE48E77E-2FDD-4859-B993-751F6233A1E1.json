However, within the last decade a range of studies has demonstrated that chemokines also have wide-reaching effects in the nervous system, where they have been shown to have diverse effects in a range of processes, regulating development, inflammation and communication between cells. Consequently, they have been implicated in a variety of disease states including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Huntingdon's and Alzheimer's diseases, and chronic pain. This proposal focuses on a relatively little-studied member of the large chemokine family. Our recent work provides the first demonstration that this particular chemokine and its receptor are expressed in the nervous system. Evidence from other studies now clearly shows that chemokines can initiate and maintain increased activity within peripheral and central pain pathways and thus contribute to the development of chronic pain. This raises the possibility that the chemokine we propose to study may also be important in the development of chronic pain and other diseases. We will investigate the role of the chemokine in pain from the mouth and face; as this area is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, pain from this region is known as trigeminal pain. The overall aims of the study are to determine which components of the trigeminal pain pathway express the chemokine and its receptor, and to investigate its role in increased activity in this pathway. This will enable us to establish its potential contribution to the development of chronic pain in the oro-facial region. Initially we will determine the expression of the chemokine and its receptor in specific cell types within normal rat trigeminal tissues that are involved in pain initiation and processing, including the tooth pulp, a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and elements of central pain pathways. We will then establish how their expression is altered in two conditions, nerve injury and inflammation, known to produce increased activity in pain pathways. This activity plays a key role in the initiation of chronic pain. We will determine whether levels of expression correlate with the time course of development of increased activity, as determined in our previous studies. We have access to unique archives of human tissues stemming from our provision of a national service for advice and management of patients who sustain trigeminal nerve injuries, and from treatment of patients with dental pain. We will use this tissue to examine the expression of the chemokine and receptor in human tooth pulps and injured nerves from patients with known clinical pain histories, enabling us to establish whether expression at sites of nerve injury or inflammation in human tissue correlates with the presence of pain. We will also carry out a series of functional studies to determine the effects of this chemokine within a region of the brainstem involved in the central processing of trigeminal pain. These studies will establish whether the chemokine is able to influence activity in different cell types in this region and investigate how it may modulate signalling between and within cells. Thus we will be able to establish whether this molecule is capable of enhancing activity in the central nervous system, and identify any potential role in modifying activity in central pain pathways. This project will enable us to determine any putative role for this chemokine within peripheral and central pain pathways and establish whether either the chemokine or its receptor may provide a target for novel analgesics. This, in turn, may lead to the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and potentially other neurological conditions for which there is currently no reliable treatment, thus substantially improving quality of life for patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I011323/1","grantId":"BB/I011323/1","fundValue":"368888","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"F  Boissonade","coPersons":["Alison  Loescher"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
