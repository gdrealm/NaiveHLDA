At a European and local level concern continues to be expressed about the differential gender impact of the RDP.</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically we will consider how the RDP might be mainstreamed, and whether there are tensions between the EU’s commitments to gender mainstreaming and a viable agricultural industry. In general across Europe, men inherit land.&nbsp; While women are rarely the holder, they are key contributors to the farm family labour force, and frequently their off-farm labour is essential to the viability of the family farm. It is unclear how gender mainstreaming can apply to an industry that is intrinsically premised on the exploitation of family labour.</p>\n\n<p>At a local policy level, the research process will actively engage with policy makers, civil society sectors, and the political sphere. It will be designed in close consultation with DARD, the Local Action Groups who deliver the programme, women’s networks, key rural development and agricultural organisations, and political actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will update desk research, qualitative interviews, and focus groups. Ethical approval has been obtained for this research.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010316/1","grantId":"ES/J010316/1","fundValue":"69730","fundStart":"2012-02-20","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally  Shortall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
