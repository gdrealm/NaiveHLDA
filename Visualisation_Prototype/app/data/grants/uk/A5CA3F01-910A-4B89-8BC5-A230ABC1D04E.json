{"id":"A5CA3F01-910A-4B89-8BC5-A230ABC1D04E","title":"NETWORK: UK-Japan Network on Human Adaptive Mechatronics","abstractText":"The proposed new network will generate interdisciplinary research collaboration and bring together mechatronics/robotics researches from the UK and Japan, to share experiences and formalise discussions for defining a common strategy for future R&amp;D and collaborations at all level of research, teaching and technology transfer. Such a network is vital if the different communities in Japan and UK are to work together for mutual benefit. The network will also act as a knowledge base from the existing mechatronics/robotics community to create a new research community in human adaptive mechatronics able to address the many common challenges (e.g. Pollution / CO2 issue, Aging population issue, etc) in UK and Japan. In particular, the network will explore a number of key challenges: such as a) Investigating the modelling of a man-machine system that explicitly includes all necessary functions of humans as machine operators with sufficient accuracy; b) Implementation of human adaptive behaviour in autonomous systems; c) Application of human adaptive mechatronics to upgrade UK high-tech products; d) Development of human adaptive mechatronics into biomedical applications; e) Development of mathematics to model and analysis human adaptive mechatronic processes in productions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E025250/1","grantId":"EP/E025250/1","fundValue":"158083","fundStart":"2007-03-05","fundEnd":"2010-09-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hongnian  Yu","coPersons":["David Howard Owens"],"organisation":"Staffordshire University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
