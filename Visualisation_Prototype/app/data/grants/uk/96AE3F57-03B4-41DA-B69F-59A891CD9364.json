In this project we will investigate QDs for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping which is a key technique in cancer treatment.\nA further objective is mapping of QD fluorescence in metastases using targeted vs. untargeted QDs. Mapping of potentially malignant lymph nodes adjacent to tumours (ie sentinel nodes) followed by surgical excision of the nodes can lead to improved survival. However current SLN mapping techniques using blue dyes and radioactive colloids have several disadvantages. Fluorescence imaging offers improved detection sensitivity for SLN mapping. Nanoco has unique patented technology to synthesize heavy metal-free water soluble fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) in large quantities. This project aims to demonstrate the use and functionalisation of QDs with red/NIR fluorescence developed by Nanoco for application in SLN/metastasis mapping using clinically relevant models at UCL.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_14093","grantId":"MC_PC_14093","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  MacRobert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
