Indeed, in the only longitudinal study carried out to date, initiation of oral contraceptive use induced shifts in women's attractiveness judgements which were absent in a control group, suggesting that hormonal contraception has a causative effect on expression of partner preferences. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to test whether using hormonal contraceptives when we meet our partner could have a measurable effect on who we choose and on the outcome of our long-term relationships. By means of questionnaires completed by established couples, and by obtaining ratings of photographs of these couples, differences will be examined in partner characteristics between women who were using or not using hormonal contraception at the time the relationship began, specifically with regard to key physical and personality traits. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, existing longitudinal survey data will be used to test specific predictions about consequences of such altered choice on measures of relationship quality and wellbeing within marriage, including relationship breakdown and divorce; and to further test predictions with regard to difficulties in conception, pregnancy outcome and child health.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I008217/1","grantId":"ES/I008217/1","fundValue":"79671","fundStart":"2011-02-24","fundEnd":"2012-02-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stewart Craig Roberts","coPersons":["Anthony Charles Little"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":" Study 1: Amongst the couples sampled at the Glasgow Science Centre, we first investigated measures of relationship satisfaction. We found a significant interaction between pill use when the couple met and current use, such that women who met on the pill and were still on the pill reported being more satisfied in sexual aspects of their relationship than those who had been on the pill but since stopped; in contrast, congruency between current and former pill use had little effect on former non-users. Measures of non-sexual satisfaction, and male partner's perception, were unaltered. Patterns of pill use thus alter relationship outcome, but downstream effects are especially prevalent in women who meet on pill. We aim to submit a paper provisionally titled &quot;Oral contraceptive use during partner choice: congruency between past and current use predicts subsequent relationship satisfaction&quot; to Biology Letters.\n\n\n\nWe then examined an age-matched sample of 170 of these couples, in half of which women reported either using or not using the pill when the partnership was formed. In forced choice tests, the partners of women who were non-users during choice were perceived as more masculine than partners of users. Computer graphic tests based on shape differences and facial measurements supported this finding. Overall, this study provides evidence that pill use during partner choice influences partner appearance. We will submit a paper provisionally titled &quot;Oral contraceptive use in women alters mate preferences and mate selection&quot; to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\nStudy 2: During the first year of marriage, women who had used the pill just prior to marriage reported more frequent arguments than those who had not, including arguments about chores, children, money, affection, and about other women. No differences were found for arguments about religion, leisure time, drinking and relatives. Over the lifetime of the marriage, former OC users reported higher frequency of arguments about other women. However, there were few significant effects on marital outcome or child health in this dataset. The paper is provisionally titled &quot;Oral contraceptive use during partner choice and relationship satisfaction: evidence from a longitudinal sample&quot; to be submitted to Contraception.\n\n\n\nStudy 3: Pregnancy and child health data are currently being analysed. However we found several significant relationships between pill use during partner choice and subsequent relationship satisfaction and outcome. Among women not currently using the pill, those who used it during partner choice reported lower sexual satisfaction in their relationship compared with those who did not, sexual dissatisfaction increased with relationship length, and these women were relatively more likely to initiate a separation if it occurred than their male partner. However, the same women were more satisfied with non-sexual aspects of the relationship, were less likely to separate than non-users, and had longer relationships if they did.

Understanding and appreciating the psychological consequences of using oral contraception during partnership formation; potentially influence on design and testing of new hormonal birth control methods Our first paper (Roberts et al. 2012, Proceedings of the Royal Society B 279:1430-1436) led two colleagues to publish a commentary on the findings, calling for those working in the sexual health and contraception field to take more note of psychological effects of oral contraceptive use: Cobey KD, Buunk AP (2012) Conducting high-quality research on the psychological impact of oral contraceptive use.
