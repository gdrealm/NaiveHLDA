Insufficient levels of physical activity and poor diet are believed to account for increases in obesity. The reasons for changes in health behaviours have not been clearly identified, but may be due to the environment in which we live. There is now substantial interest in understanding the influence of the physical environment on activity and dietary behaviours, and a number of environmental features have been associated with health in young people. However our understanding of the relationship between environment and diet and physical activity is limited by poor measurement. The major limitation is that most studies relate features of the physical environment to places they think adolescents visit for physical activity or to obtain food rather than places they actually visit. For example, the presence of a park near a school may be associated with the physical activity of adolescents in the school, but they may not actually use the park. This lack of specificity with respect to where physical activity occurs (or where food is obtained) is likely to contribute to an underestimation of the strength of real associations between the physical environment and health outcomes. \nThe aim of the research is thus to determine which measures of the environment are related to time spent being active in different locations or near to food outlets. To do this we will use objective measurement of the environment (GIS) combined with objective measures of where people actually go (GPS) linked with an objective measure of physical activity (accelerometer) and a valid self-report measure of diet. We will carry out these measures in 900 adolescents aged 13-15yrs from schools in different areas (urban/rural/suburban). This information will give us a precise estimate of which features of the environment differentiate between adolescents with high/low physical activity and healthy/unhealthy dietary profiles. We will use this information to generate similar self-report measures for wider use in public health research and policy. The study will be conducted by a team of established researchers from Universities of Bristol, East Anglia, London and Cardiff who have expertise in developing physical activity and diet measures (Page), objective measurement of physical activity in children (Cooper), objective measurement of the physical environment (Jones) and food environment (Cummins) and school based research methodology and statistics (Moore).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001164","grantId":"G1001164","fundValue":"798304","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Angie  Page","coPersons":["Laurence Anthony Moore","Ashley Ronald Cooper","Andrew Peter Jones","Steven Christopher Cummins"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
