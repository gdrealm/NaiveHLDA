We have shown that BRSV and related viruses express an essential protein, M2-2, by using a novel mechanism that relies on the action of a protein, DDX3 that is present in the cells that the viruses infect. If the virus M2-2 protein is not made in sufficient amounts the virus cannot grow effectively. We have identified a number of inhibitors that interfere with the action of the DDX3 protein and as a result prevent production of the M2-2 protein. This treatment prevents the growth of BRSV and its related viruses. We intend to develop these inhibitors as potential drugs to combat the virus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L024438/1","grantId":"BB/L024438/1","fundValue":"194725","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Easton","coPersons":["Andrew  Marsh"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
