Two humour styles are adaptive (affiliative and self-enhancing) and two are maladaptive (aggressive and self-defeating). </p>\n\n<p>Children aged 11-13 years (years 7 and 8) will complete the measures on a whole class basis at the beginning and end of a school year (N = 900). The measures will include a peer nomination/rating inventory and self-report questionnaires to assess: verbal, physical and indirect bullying and peer victimisation, peer acceptance, number of friends, humour styles, depression, loneliness, and self-esteem. </p>\n\n<p>We propose that humour acts as both a risk and resilience factor in relation to certain bullying roles. Furthermore, certain humour styles may act as mediators of the effects of peer victimisation on psychological wellbeing, while others may moderate such effects. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2647","grantId":"RES-062-23-2647","fundValue":"123266","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Louise Fox","coPersons":["Simon Charles Hunter"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
