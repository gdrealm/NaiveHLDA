More than two decades and dozens of repeat studies later, experts have still not reached a consensus on alleged sperm count decline or the future of sperm count levels and the fate of the human race. One problem in tracking sperm counts over time is that technologies for counting sperm have changed, which some experts argue, could explain reported drops in sperm counts. Not only have techniques changed over time, but they also vary by location and practitioner. Amid the variation in twentieth century sperm counting practices, state agencies like the World Health Organization adopted standards for sperm and semen parameters. These standards attempted to answer the question, what is normal? More specifically, how many sperm would a man need to father a child? How many sperm would a population need on average to sustain itself?\n\nThe purpose of this research is to examine the history of the standardisation of sperm counting technologies and practices in order to shed light on the current debates. To date, no research has explored the variety of techniques historically used to count sperm, the decision of the World Health Organisation to adopt a sperm count &quot;gold standard&quot;, or the reliability of the gold standard to predict male fertility. The &quot;Counting Sperm&quot; research project, led by Dr. Liberty Walther Barnes at the University of Cambridge, addresses each of these points, uncovering the history of sperm counting in the twentieth century and offering clues into the mystery of sperm count decline.\n\nSperm counts reveal more than just male fertility. They provide a window into other pressing social issues, like environmental degradation and population growth. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to chemical toxins and pollutants hamper sperm production. If sperm counts are indeed trending downward, policy-makers must carefully consider how impacts to the environment are also affecting public health and what kinds of public policies are necessary to preserve fertility and protect the environment. Dr. Barnes' research provides clues into the mystery of sperm count decline, helping other researchers untangle the available statistics on sperm counts by identifying their sources and methods of attainment. Additionally, Dr. Barnes analyses the fundamental facts and assumptions that informed the gold standard for sperm counts, what this standard is believed to reveal about male fertility, and the evidence marshaled to support these claims.\n\nAs part of this project Dr. Barnes will collect oral histories from expert scientists and practitioners who pioneered practices for counting sperm in the twentieth century. These histories will be preserved in archives at the British Library and be made available for use by other scholars and journalists. Dr. Barnes will host public forums the Cambridge Festival of Ideas and at the annual meetings of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) to debate the future of human sperm production around the globe and educate the public about the value and meaning behind sperm counts. Dr. Barnes will maintain a website to provide information on sperm counting to political advocacy groups and the general public. The findings from this research will culminate in scholarly articles and a book detailing the history of the standardisation of sperm counting practices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L010720/1","grantId":"ES/L010720/1","fundValue":"218724","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Liberty Walther Barnes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
