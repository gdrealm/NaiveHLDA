There is currently no green &quot;nature identical&quot; herbicide on the market, and the major classes of commercially available products are now in the mature phase of their life-cycle. Sorgoleone, a powerful allelopathic chemical, is currently produced by plants in minute concentration. This project seeks to develop a commerically viable biotech synthesis route using a plant based starting material (available in thousands of tonnes). The project will develop a UK-based supply chain aimed at producing and selling the chemical. The lead organisation, Hockley International, an UK based SME in the agrochemical market has developed, through a TSB funded KTP, a methodology for the synthesis of the saturated component of sorgoleone using a widely available natural resorcinolic lipid. Hockley has now a patented approach to selectively extract the resorcinolic precursor of the target anti-weed molecule from cashew nut shell liquid (a non-valorised sub-product of the cashew kernel production available in 100,000 tons). Hockley's current chemical process is a five step route involving an oxidation with chromium. This funding will allow investigation into the possible reduction of the five steps to a two or three-step route via a cytochrome P450 enzymatic oxidation and enzymatic methylation. Field testing of the nature-identical synthetic molecules will also be undertaken to estimate its efficacy and applications rates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M012867/1","grantId":"BB/M012867/1","fundValue":"479078","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Viacheslav  Tverezovskiy","coPersons":["Peter  Golyshin"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
