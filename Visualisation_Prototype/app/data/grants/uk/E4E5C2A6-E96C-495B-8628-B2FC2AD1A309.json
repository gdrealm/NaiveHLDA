This is the consensus view of climate scientists and one with which economists are increasingly finding agreement (eg The Stern Review). It is much less certain, however, that our economic, social and political systems can respond to the challenge. Will public, private and civic actors take action to create low-carbon economies? What emission reduction strategies will be efficient, equitable and acceptable? How much should we invest, and when, on measures to reduce vulnerability to climate change? Who will bear the costs and enjoy the benefits?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-599-28-0001","grantId":"RES-599-28-0001","fundValue":"4644910","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Anne Rees","coPersons":["Nicholas Herbert Stern","Jouni Juhani Paavola","Leonard Allen Smith","Andrew  Gouldson","Simon  Dietz"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
