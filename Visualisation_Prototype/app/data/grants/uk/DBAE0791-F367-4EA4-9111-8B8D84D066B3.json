These include: desk-based research; semi-structured interviews; fieldwork observation; visual approaches and document analysis.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G028761/1","grantId":"ES/G028761/1","fundValue":"65458","fundStart":"2009-04-28","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara  McDowell","coPersons":["Brian  Graham"],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
