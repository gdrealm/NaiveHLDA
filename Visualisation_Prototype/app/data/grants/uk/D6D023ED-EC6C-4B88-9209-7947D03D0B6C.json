One of the major challenges in large scale utilization of cellulose from biomass is dissolution and processing of cellulose to prepare downstream products such as high performance textile fibres. The Viscose method is the most common way to manufacture cellulose fibres; however, it is a complex, multistep process which involves use of very aggressive chemicals and requires a large volume of fresh water. In the 1970s, petroleum based synthetic polymer fibres such as polyester and nylon were commercialised and were proven to be more economical than producing cellulose fibres via the Viscose method. Hence, the production of cellulose fibres was reduced from over 1.3 million tons per year in 1973 to 0.4 million tons per year by 2008 (Source: International Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Committee). \n\nTo overcome this issue of processing of cellulose we are proposing to develop an environmentally benign method of manufacturing of high performance cellulose fibres using &quot;Green Solvents&quot;. The proposed research will help develop sustainable and high performance cellulose fibres which can in-principle replace heavy glass fibres (which requires high energy during its manufacturing) and non-renewable polymer precursors used for manufacturing of carbon fibres which are widely used in composites for aerospace, auto, sports and wind energy industries in UK and abroad.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L017679/1","grantId":"EP/L017679/1","fundValue":"2060470","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2019-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Potter","coPersons":["Sameer Sharad Rahatekar","SJ  Eichhorn","Alexander  Bismarck","Thomas  Welton"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
