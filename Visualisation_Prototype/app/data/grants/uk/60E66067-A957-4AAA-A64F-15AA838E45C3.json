{"id":"60E66067-A957-4AAA-A64F-15AA838E45C3","title":"Structured Sampling Operators for Compressive Terahertz Imaging","abstractText":"Terahertz (THz) waves, with a frequency range of 0.1-10 THz, have huge potentials in many applications such as medical imaging, non-destructive inspection, quality control, homeland security, etc. However, most existing THz imaging cameras have high operational cost and slow scanning speed. Even with the state-of-the-art THz time-domain cameras, 6 minutes are required to acquire a 400x400 image.\n\nRecently, single-pixel THz cameras have been developed based on compressed sensing theory with the great potential of dramatic reduction of imaging time, power consumption and implementation cost. Despite their great promises, such systems are still at the infant stage and there still exists a large gap between theory and practice. This project aims to study practically-oriented sampling operators for compressive THz cameras. We will focus on the design and development of fast computable, memory efficient, and hardware friendly sampling operators. We will also investigate their theoretical performance limits. Moreover, software package and proof-of-concept hardware implementation will be demonstrated. The results of this project may open up new opportunities for the development of fast, relatively inexpensive and even portable THz imaging cameras.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I038853/1","grantId":"EP/I038853/1","fundValue":"96088","fundStart":"2011-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lu  Gan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
