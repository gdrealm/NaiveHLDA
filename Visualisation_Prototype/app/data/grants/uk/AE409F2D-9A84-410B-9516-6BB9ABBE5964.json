{"id":"AE409F2D-9A84-410B-9516-6BB9ABBE5964","title":"An outcomes model for type 2 diabetes","abstractText":"Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly common chronic disease which can cause a wide range of serious complications including heart disease and blindness. We propose improving and making widely accessible a model which simulates the likely course of the disease for patients, given their particular characteristics such as blood pressure, current age and time since diagnosis. The model is based on information from patients in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a landmark study of diabetes treatment. It has already been found to give more accurate predictions than other diabetes models, and is being used by researchers in many countries. Some elements now need to be updated, and it needs to be made more user-friendly. Our model will then give patients and their doctors valuable information on current prognosis and the benefits of therapy. The usefulness of the model to other researchers will also be greatly enhanced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801042","grantId":"G0801042","fundValue":"465563","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair McIntosh Gray","coPersons":["Michael  Goldacre","Borislava  Mihaylova","Philip  Clarke","Rury  Holman"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
