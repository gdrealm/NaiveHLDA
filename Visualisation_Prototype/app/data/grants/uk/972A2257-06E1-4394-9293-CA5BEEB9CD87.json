Throughout childhood, the way the body responds to stresses put on it are dependent on the developmental stage of the child. For example, a 3 month old baby will respond very differently to a teenager during a significant infection such as pneumonia. In this example the breathing rate per minute of the baby could be about 60 but in the teenager just 20. The way the heart responds to illness also varies significantly depending on the age of the child. In children, unlike in adults, the body systems can compensate for illness right up until the time of death. For these reasons, it can be difficult to recognise when children are seriously unwell, as opposed to a simple fever relating to a cold, and this has been highlighted recently by 2 independent reviews of child deaths. Improving the recognition of seriously ill children would be an important step to reducing over and under treatment, reduce the length of hospital stay, reduce the long term health complications associated with advanced illness, and potentially reduce child deaths. With over 800,000 children admitted to hospital in England each year the clinical care of a large number of children could benefit from better monitoring.\nThere are over 17,000 children admitted to intensive care units each year in the UK with the majority requiring heart and breathing support. Bedside observations such has heart and breathing rate, oxygen levels and skin perfusion can be used to create an early warning score. These scores can identify children with worsening illness allowing timely treatment and prevent the need for intensive care and reduce the risk of death. Unfortunately, these systems can be labour intensive and are non-continuous so could delay urgent treatment if not performed frequently enough. Many emergency paediatric guidelines and early warning systems use capillary refill (a test where the skin is pressed and the time counted for it to return to its original colour once released) as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular status. Although capillary refill is widely used in clinical practice it is well known to have marked observer variability making it less reliable as a clinical guide. \nWhilst technology exists to measure key variables such as heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, no automated medical device has been developed to monitor capillary refill. Using our patented light technology, we aim to develop an innovative automated capillary refill device with an electronic bedside system to provide a paediatric continuous early warning (PaedCEW) monitoring system. Development of such system would provide a valuable clinical monitor for children that could allow the developmental age of the child to be taken into account. This system could aid the recognition of clinical deterioration in children thus allowing timely intervention.\nThe device will be non-invasive, require minimal training and operate in an automatic manner providing age specific alarms and alert thresholds. The PaedCEW system would complement and support current clinical practice and aim to address difficulties of recognising ill children. We expect that this device would improve outcomes, reduce healthcare costs via the earlier treatment of children and free up nursing/medical staff time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K007610/1","grantId":"MR/K007610/1","fundValue":"398545","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Don  Sharkey","coPersons":["Barrie  Hayes-Gill","John  Crowe"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
