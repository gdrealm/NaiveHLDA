Carbon-related food interventions such as smartphone apps have largely targeted supermarket shopper decisions 'in store' and have yet shown little evidence of impact.\n\nTo be truly relevant, we must seek nuanced understandings of food acquisition both within and beyond the supermarket: these include the negotiation and planning of household meals, and positioning with respect to take-away and convenience foods.\n\nUsing multidisciplinary methods as diverse as ethnographic observation, interaction design, carbon profiling and crowdsourcing, we will iteratively develop and trial both low and high tech interventions which meaningfully support food acquisition and carbon awareness, with the aim of promoting lower impact food practice.\n\nBuilt into the research programme is continual engagement with the supermarket itself, to explore opportunities for making scalable, sustained reductions, in its role as a food institution for tens of thousands.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K012738/1","grantId":"EP/K012738/1","fundValue":"214455","fundStart":"2013-06-29","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We continue to explore with our commercial partner whether they can incorporate some of our findings into their promotional activities (meetings forthcoming).

Our analysis of shopping behaviour in store has also helped us profile high and low GhG impact shoppers, with a view to providing targeted advice to reduce the footprint of a typical shop. The supermarket partner may be able to offer new services around sustainable shopping recommendations to consumers (discussions in progress).
