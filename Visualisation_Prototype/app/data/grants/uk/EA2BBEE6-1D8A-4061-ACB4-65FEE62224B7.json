{"id":"EA2BBEE6-1D8A-4061-ACB4-65FEE62224B7","title":"Miniature milli-kelvin cryo-cooler","abstractText":"We propose the development and construction of the world's first milli-Kelvin cryo-cooler, transforming the use of the milli-Kelvin temperature domain in the same way 4 K cryo-coolers have for the liquid helium region. It will enable those inexperienced with such low temperatures to easily access very low temperatures in a bench top system. We propose to construct a small cooler module, a continuous adiabatic demagnetisation refrigeration (cADR) which will extend any 4 K cryo cooler to a milli-Kelvin (&lt;100 mK) cryo cooler. Current 4 K pulse tube coolers can reach 4 K from room temperature within 2 hours, we anticipate a further 2 hours for the cADR to achieved &lt;100 mK, giving a complete cool down from room temperature to &lt;100 mK in 4 hours. By controlling the ADR's various magnetic fields, the proposed cryo-cooler module can provide a highly stable temperature anywhere from the base temperature of the attached 4 K cryo-cooler to &lt;100 mK. This therefore represents a complete cryo-cooler solution and thus extreme ease of use for a technology which is still large and cumbersome. The technology to enable this proposal for a ground based system has come about by the large investment in developing ADR technology for future space missions at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H04888X/1","grantId":"EP/H04888X/1","fundValue":"505612","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hepburn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
