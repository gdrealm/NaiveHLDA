These agents must be able to target therapeutic genes to the relevant cells and organs both in culture for basic investigations as well as in the body for therapeutic applications.\n\nAt present, there is a great need for the development of gene carriers which do not use attenuated viruses as a vehicle. We propose to develop such a carrier system based on coupling the genes to magnetic nanoparticles. This will allow us to use oscillating magnetic fields to target, improve and enhance gene delivery both in culture and in the clinic.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701054","grantId":"G0701054","fundValue":"220931","fundStart":"2008-05-12","fundEnd":"2010-08-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Dobson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
