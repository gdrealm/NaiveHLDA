By examining series of closely related probes, we shall define systems that locate to a particular compartment of a cell, allowing it to be visualised selectively.\n \nThe optical probes that are currently used are based either on organic compounds, on large man-made proteins or on so-called quantum dots; each of these probes suffer from problems of low chemical stability, a tendency to fade and, in certain cases, they are rather toxic to the living cell. Thus we aim to change the thinking of the microscopy community and to pave the way for such emissive metal complexes to be used as stains and probes in biology. These metal complex probes emit light over longer timescales than conventional probes, and so their is more time to collect the emitted light after pulsed excitation and only short exposure times to the light that is used to excite them. The long emission lifetime avoids problems in data acquisition that are associated with light scattering and background autofluorescence. \n\nIn parallel, we shall develop instrumentation methods that allow the spectral signature of these probes to be recorded quickly using fast imaging methods. We shall work with microscope manufacturers and with optics specialists to this end. This will allow changes in chemical composition within a cell to be tracked on a 10 second timescale. As a first step, we shall develop probes that can report on pH change and on the amount of sodium, magnesium and zinc within a specific cell compartment, allowing changes in the amount of these important metal ions to be tracked in living cells in real time. By adopting a modular approach to probe design, different metal ions can be examined subsequently, by introducing the appropriate metal-binding moiety into the probe structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019124/1","grantId":"EP/L019124/1","fundValue":"357832","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not yet; award began in late 2014 Chemicals,Healthcare Economic","person":"David  Parker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" The way to make very bright europium optical probes that target certain organelles in a cell and respond to pH, among other variables. too early to say Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
