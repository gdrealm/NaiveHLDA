Assessing the EU's partnership-building approach with Eastern Europe","abstractText":"<p>This project investigates the ENP’s effectiveness in Eastern Europe (EE), in the light of a growing tension between Europeanisation and Securitisation. Although Europeanisation is seen as better suited for building a sustainable partnership with EE, being linked to the wider process of modernisation, its validity has been progressively challenged by Securitisation, which prioritises the EU’s immediate security concerns over the long-term promotion of democracy in EE. The existing conceptual tension may not only affect the ENP’s successful implementation, but also hinder the development of a constructive dialogue with the ‘outsiders’ – Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova in particular. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The project will seek to establish the following: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How are Europeanisation and Securitisation defined in the key ENP documents?</li>\n\n <li>Is there a growing tension between the aims and the means of these discourses?</li>\n\n <li>To what extent do these discourses correspond to those adopted by EE?</li>\n\n <li>What implications may the tension have on achieving stability, security and well being in the wider Europe? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project methodology will include content-analysis of official documents across the border; elite interviews; published data in the EU and national surveys in EE; ‘school essays on Europe’ and focus-groups in EE to allow individual-level analysis of public responses.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0001","grantId":"RES-061-25-0001","fundValue":"325402","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elena  Korosteleva","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
