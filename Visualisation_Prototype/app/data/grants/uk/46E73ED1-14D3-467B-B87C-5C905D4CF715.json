These include an electric dipole moment of the neutron (for which the unsatisfactory SM parameterisation of CP violation predicts a value many orders of magnitude smaller than most other models such as Supersymmetry), Lorentz invariance violation (a feature of some Grand Unified Theories), precision measurements of neutrino oscillations (which require a finite neutrino mass), and neutrinoless double-beta decay (which would require neutrinos to be so-called Majorana particles, i.e. their own antiparticles). All of the projects in this proposal are, or can expect to be, world leading in their respective areas, despite being very low-cost in comparison with more 'traditional' collider-based particle physics projects. Much of this work also provides a vital link to cosmology, thus bringing us closer to an understanding of our origins -- for example, CP violation underlies the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe.The work is to be carried out in a variety of locations: neutron EDM development work at Sussex is to be followed by exploitation at the ILL in Grenoble; MINOS is situated primarily at Fermilab (Chicago), and SNO in Ontario; SLAM will stay at Sussex; COBRA is based at Gran Sasso, Italy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000398/1","grantId":"PP/E000398/1","fundValue":"1812260","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Greville Harris","coPersons":["Kai  Zuber","Michael  Hardiman","Benjamin  Varcoe","Elisabeth  Falk","Maurits  Van Der Grinten"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
