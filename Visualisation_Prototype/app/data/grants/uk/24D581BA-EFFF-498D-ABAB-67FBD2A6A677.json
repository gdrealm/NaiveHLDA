{"id":"24D581BA-EFFF-498D-ABAB-67FBD2A6A677","title":"Experimental Particle Physics Rolling Grant 2009-2014","abstractText":"The Particle Physics Group at Manchester University will continue to probe the fundamental particles and forces of nature. This is done by several experiments: ATLAS at the LHC at CERN will study proton-proton collisions at the highest energies yet, and is expected to reveal a wealth of new particles. LHCb will reveal further details of the properties of B hadrons. Dzero is at Fermilab, which is presently the highest energy collider till the LHC starts. SuperNemo will search for a type of nuclear beta decay which, if found, would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle. We also run an ongoing R and D programme for the detectors, electronics, accelerators and computers we use for our investigations into fundamental physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001166/1","grantId":"ST/H001166/1","fundValue":"1450870","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","coPersons":["Frederick  Loebinger","Thorsten  Wengler","George  Lafferty","David Spencer Bailey","Christian  Schwanenberger","Brian  Cox","Un-Ki  Yang","Roger  Barlow","Terry  Wyatt","Cinzia  Da Vi√°","Rob  Appleby","Stephen  Watts"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
