The majority of symptoms are caused by narrowing of the airways. A major component of airway narrowing is due to contraction of the muscle (called airway smooth muscle) in the airway wall. This contraction is due to calcium release within the muscle cell or entry of calcium into the muscle cell. The mechanisms underlying these responses are poorly understood. This project will systematically define the important pathways and signalling molecules responsible for these processes. By defining these mechanisms, it should be feasible to design new treatments for asthma. We will also gain a fuller understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of asthma.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701390","grantId":"G0701390","fundValue":"328156","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
