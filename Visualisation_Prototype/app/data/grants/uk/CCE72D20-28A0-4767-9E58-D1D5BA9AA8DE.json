{"id":"CCE72D20-28A0-4767-9E58-D1D5BA9AA8DE","title":"The Viennese Cafe and fin-de-siecle culture","abstractText":"The Viennese cafe was a key site of turn-of-twentieth century modernity. It functioned as both home and workplace, affording opportunities not only for leisure but also for intellectual exchange. This multi-disciplinary project explores the social and artistic interactions that took place in Adolf Loos's Cafe Museum (1899) an icon of modern design, as well as archetypal Viennese coffee-house. It will result in an international conference and a major publication. We also hope to arrange an exhibition at the Royal College of Art, London. There will be an exhibition broadsheet; as well as a series of musical and literary performances.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119281/1","grantId":"119281/1","fundValue":"132392","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Aynsley","coPersons":["Tag  Gronberg","Simon  Shaw-Miller"],"organisation":"Royal College of Art","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
