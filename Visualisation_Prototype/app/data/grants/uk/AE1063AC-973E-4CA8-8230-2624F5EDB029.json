September 2010. The scope of the programme has been expanded to include the UK participation into the HIRES instrument.\nThis proposal is to request support for the contribution to HIRES by the Department of Physics and by the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge, as detailed in the UK E-ELT Programme spending proposal CRCv5 (Colin Cunningham) and approved by the E-ELT Steering. More specifically the work packages for the University of Cambridge are:\n\n- Blue book support, provide input from science, optics, opto-mecanics and detectors specialists. Request: 14.5 k&pound;, SM TBD\n\n- Investigate methods for image/pupil slicing. Request:3 k&pound;, SM TBD\n\n- Investigate methods for mosaicing large gratings at cryogenic temperatures. Request: 12 k&pound;, SM TBD\n\n- Investigate near-IR detector performances and limitations (e.g. stability, flat fielding, read out noise). Request: 5 k&pound;, SM TBD","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005514/1","grantId":"ST/L005514/1","fundValue":"34465","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Our results have not yet been used.

We have also analysed new techniques of reading near-IR detectors which enable a significant reduction of the noise, which will allow astronomers to reach extremely high sensitivities in instruments developed for extremely large telescopes. The development of a prototype of our concept will enable us to test and improve the mosaicing technique. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
