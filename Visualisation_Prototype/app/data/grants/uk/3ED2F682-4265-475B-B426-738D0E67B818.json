The proposed research will contribute to the scientific understanding of mechanisms of creep-crack growth, creep-fatigue crack growth and dwell-fatigue crack growth in a specific stainless steel alloy. Flaw evaluation procedures in future nuclear reactors can then be based with more confidence on models of materials' behaviour underpinned by increased physical understanding. In particular the study will address how results obtained from accelerated tests can be applied appropriately to predict flaw extension behaviour under envisaged operating conditions (over a design lifetime of sixty years).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N016351/1","grantId":"EP/N016351/1","fundValue":"420446","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bowen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
