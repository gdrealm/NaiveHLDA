{"id":"792BA548-B30D-4254-A70B-1180696A5B19","title":"The Complete Theoretical Works of Johannes Tinctoris: A New Digital Edition","abstractText":"The corpus of twelve Latin theoretical treatises by the fifteenth-century Brabantine musician and lawyer Johannes Tinctoris (c.1435-1511) is acknowledged as one of the most significant and comprehensive sources for late medieval musical notation and compositional process, as well as a central focus for important recent research on musical aesthetics and reception at this crucial point in western European culture. Their content demonstrates not only an exceptional technical command of musical notation and theory, but also an intimate acquaintance with contemporary polyphonic practice, derived from a wide knowledge of the composers of his day and their music, both in northern Europe, where he began his career, and in Italy. This project will complete a new online edition of the whole corpus (also to be made available as a more permanent resource in DVD format), supplanting the existing edition (ed. Albert Seay, American Institute of Musicology, 1975-8) which has long been regarded by musicologists as highly unsatisfactory. The completed resource will greatly enlarge both the scope and accessibility of Tinctoris's work. Full English translations will be provided in addition to the Latin texts; in many cases these translations will be the first ever made, which will further enable the detailed significance of the treatises to be appreciated and explored by both scholarly and performance-based readers outside academia who are unable to handle the original Latin. Multiple layers of hyperlinked commentary material will also be provided, covering a wide range of technical and historical issues arising from both the texts themselves and the wider context of Tinctoris's life and musical environment in Renaissance Europe. Combining the highest levels of historical, textual and critical scholarship with innovative technological presentation, this open-access edition explores new methods of relating text-based materials to the numerous, often complex, music examples (both monophonic and polyphonic, mensural and non-mensural) that punctuate the treatises. An additional outcome will be the production of a new notation software package which will make available a wide spectrum of medieval and Renaissance musical notations for the first time to scholars, students, editors, publishers and performing musicians in a flexible and user-friendly application to a high professional level of historical and typographical accuracy. As the project progresses, the edition will have additional layers added which will use Tinctoris's primary texts as a pedagogical resource to enable users (e.g. undergraduate and postgraduate students, and early-stage scholars of pre-modern music repertories) to learn and practise the detail of late medieval notation through interactive engagement, independent virtual learning and self-testing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I003827/1","grantId":"AH/I003827/1","fundValue":"400223","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Since the project is still ongoing at time of writing, and has been focusing primarily on the academic development of the resource, it is a little early to give concrete evidence for non-academic impacts. Eventually (say, within the few years following the completion of the project) it is highly likely that that contents of the site -- especially the texts and new translations of the Tinctoris treatises, but also the evolving commentary material -- will have significant, if slow-burn, impact on other non-academic areas of the early music world, involving performers' increased understanding of the historical, cultural and technical aspects of the music being performed, as well as related activities in editing, publishing, sound recording and broadcasting. An embryonic instance of this has been the feed of academic content from the project research into a public concert exemplifying Tinctoris's output as composer, given as part of the essentially academic conference 'Johannes Tinctoris and Music Theory in the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance', which took place at Senate House, London in October 2014, in collaboration with the Institute of Musical Research.\n\nHowever, beyond the strictly musical and musicological frameworks, it has already become apparent that from a broader cultural point of view this project, in raising the profile of Tinctoris within the context of francophone Belgian patrimony, has impacted substantively at a local level in that country. As a result, articles by the project's PI (Woodley) and another colleague in Li?ge (Marl?ne Britta) have been published in the journal of the local historical and genealogical society in Tinctoris's home town of Braine-l'Alleud (Brania 2012: listed under Publications). Indeed the newly forged contacts at this local level have themselves enabled access to primary archival material, not hitherto investigated, resulting in clear transfer of impact between academic and non-academic domains, and between the UK and Belgium.

The primary resource developed through this award has been the open-access website 'Johannes Tinctoris: The Complete Theoretical Works' (http://www.earlymusictheory.org/Tinctoris), itself embedded in a new more broadly based Early Music Theory website (http://www.earlymusictheory.org), which has been set up as a long-term sustainable resource for other scholarly materials relating to the theoretical and intellectual underpinnings of music from the medieval and early modern period, beyond the current project.\n\nThe Tinctoris project itself has so far produced something in excess of 200,000 words of material, comprising newly edited Latin texts of Tinctoris's treatises, English translations (in most cases the first available), and detailed source transcriptions and facsimile images from the major fifteenth-century manuscript and early printed sources. Texts completed, which also include some initial (and ongoing) commentary material in article format, are listed separately here under Publications. Considerable time and care has been taken to develop custom-built software of a much more sophisticated nature than originally envisaged in the grant application. This embeds into the web-based representation system a software parser which can display on screen both normal text and fifteenth-century music notation from alphanumeric input, enabling Tinctoris's numerous music examples, which are an essential component of his treatise texts, to be both generated and searched in ways that would be impossible with purely graphics-based presentation. We believe that the time taken in developing this software, along with other technical aspects such as its exportability in TEI-compatible form, will be well repaid in its wider usefulness and transferability beyond the current project. All software materials are open-source and publicly available: for details, see under Software and Technical Products. The project is intended to be continued beyond the lifetime of the present funding, and new sources of support are currently being explored, in both the UK and the US.\n\nAside from the project website, a successful international conference was organised and part-funded by the project, held in collaboration with the Institute of Musical Research, School of Advanced Study, University of London, at Senate House, University of London 9-10 October 2014. Contributing delegates, beyond the immediate project team, included both senior established and younger-generation scholars from the United States, Australia and Europe as well as the UK, and the proceedings included particularly valuable practice-based presentations from the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis (Switzerland), and a vocal concert of Tinctoris's polyphonic compositions, freely open to the public, given by the ensemble Il Suono and directed by the PhD student on the project. A volume of essays, based on (but not exclusively) extended versions of the conference papers, has been agreed in principle for the prestigious series ?pitome musical (general editor: Philippe Vendrix, Director of the Centre d'?tudes Sup?rieures de la Renaissance, University of Tours), to be published around 2016 by Brepols (Turnhout, Belgium). A further concrete outcome of the project has been the publication of a special issue of the Journal of the Alamire Foundation (April 2013), also published by Brepols, devoted to Tinctoris, with contributions by each of the three members of the project team (Woodley, Dean, Lewis), with Woodley also acting as invited Guest Editor. The principal website of the project is openly available to the public, which will include not only other academic scholars and research students across the world, but also others involved in the understanding, performance and dissemination of late medieval and early Renaissance music, such as professional musicians, editors, publishers, broadcasters and record companies. From a musicological perspective, the research, especially the technical components of the online presentation of materials, suggests several next steps. The most immediately apparent of these is the perceived need to develop software that can take the precepts of Tinctoris's primary theoretical texts and use these to translate directly between fifteenth-century mensural notation and more modern 'common-practice' notation, both for editorial purposes and as a testing-ground for the comprehensiveness, or otherwise, of the theoretical precepts themselves. The project team are currently investigating possible funding sources for this next stage of the research.
