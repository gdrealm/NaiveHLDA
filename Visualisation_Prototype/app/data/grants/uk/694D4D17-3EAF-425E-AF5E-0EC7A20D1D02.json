{"id":"694D4D17-3EAF-425E-AF5E-0EC7A20D1D02","title":"Correspondences of K3 surface via moduli of sheaves","abstractText":"K3 surfaces is one of the most remarkable classes of algebraic surfaces which are very important in contemporary Mathematics and Physics. During last 40 years there was a big progress in their understanding, but we still discover some their new, unexpected and important properties. , elements of the Picard lattice (generated by algebraic curves) of a K3 surface deliver remarkable two-dimensional algebraic cycles on the product of the K3 surface with itself, and a correspondence of the K3 surface with itself. It happens when moduli of coherent sheaves over a K3 surface with a given Mukai vector coincide with this K3 surface. We want to study this phenomenon in details.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D061997/1","grantId":"EP/D061997/1","fundValue":"285459","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Viacheslav Valentinovich Nikulin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
