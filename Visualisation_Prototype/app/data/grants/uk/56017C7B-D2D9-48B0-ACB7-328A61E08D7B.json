{"id":"56017C7B-D2D9-48B0-ACB7-328A61E08D7B","title":"The dynein-2 microtubule motor","abstractText":"Nearly all cells in the human body build a primary cilium, an antenna-like structure that emerges from the surface of nearly all human cells. Defects in the formation and/or function of the cilium lead to a cohort of human diseases known as the ciliopathies. This project does not seek to define the molecular basis of disease but instead is solely directed at a fundamental understanding o cilia biology. Cilia are of particular importance for developmental signalling and therefore, dynein-2 underpins the normal function of all cells in the body. Cilia are built around a microtubule rich structure along which molecules are transported by motor proteins. Considerable work has now shown that the cytoplasmic dynein-2 motor complex is essential for normal human development because of its function in both directing molecules into cilia as well as controlling their movement along cilia. Dynein-2 is distantly related to dynein-1, a complex that is relatively well understood in terms of function and particularly well in terms of its composition. These two &quot;cytoplasmic&quot; dyneins move large molecular complexes around inside cells and are distinct from the &quot;axonemal&quot; dyneins that drive beating of cilia and flagella. In contrast to the axonemal dyneins and to cytoplasmic dynein-1, until very recently we have known little about the individual proteins that go to make up the dynein-2 machine. Here, I propose to build on our work that has, for the first time, defined the biochemical composition of the human dynein-2 complex. Building on a strong track record of work linking membrane trafficking and microtubule motors, I propose to use a combination of biochemistry, advanced cell imaging, and selective proteomics to provide a clear definition of the fundamental biology of dynein-2 in cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N000420/1","grantId":"BB/N000420/1","fundValue":"375407","fundStart":"2016-01-11","fundEnd":"2019-01-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Stephens","coPersons":["Kate  Heesom","Peter  Cullen"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
