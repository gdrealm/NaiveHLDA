Age, Gender and Welfare in English Labour Markets During Industrialisation","abstractText":"<p>Revisionist interpretations of the industrial revolution, have strong implications for the working of labour markets. Yet seldom have these implied developments in labour markets themselves been scrutinised. For example, while the idea of an &quot;industrious revolution&quot; has attracted quite considerable attention of late there have been no clear cut answers as to what caused increased effort, or higher participation rates.&nbsp; Similarly why labour moved out of agriculture at such low per capita incomes and in such force as to practically obliterate any inter-sectoral productivity gap has remained in doubt. </p> \n<p>We feel that it is time to bring studies of the labour market to bear on these questions. Recent work on social history points to the need to examine more closely the money wage in the context of overall entitlements. The seminars will consider distinct sections of the workforce and explore key aspects of remuneration, job search, career ladders, on the job training, welfare and related topics. Each seminar will aim to include both a theoretical contribution and a presentation that puts British experience into a broader international perspective and will hopefully have present- day parallels. In addition to an introductory and a concluding plenary session we plan to have seminars on the following topics: i) child labour, (ii) female labour, (iii) wages, customs and perquisites, (iv) welfare policies, the poor law and wages .</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4045","grantId":"RES-451-25-4045","fundValue":"11930","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Leonard  Schwarz","coPersons":["Jane  Humphries"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
