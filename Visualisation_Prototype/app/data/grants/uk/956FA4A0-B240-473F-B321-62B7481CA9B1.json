Here we will prepare XxFe1-xOOH, XxFe2-xO3, XxFe3-xO4, XxFe2-xO4 and YyBa1-yXxFe12-xO19 at various x (Mossbauer-AAS-ICP) and y with different particle sizes (1nm100nm) and changed viscosity. They can be Fe- (e.g. BaFe12O19) or Co/based. Petroleum-based ferro fluids are used as dielectric fluids (D-fluids) in transformers. Whether the magnetic nanoparticles are in the oil (o) or water (w) phase, they allow the surface tension (gamma g) of the oil-water interface to be measured because when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the ferrofluid interface it causes Cowley-Rosenberg peaks to appear at a separation of lambda l in the surface (where g=g(ro-rw)l2/4p2 and (ro-rw) is the density difference between oil and water phases). In addition the volume fractions of oil and water phases can be deduced from the vertical position of the ferrofluid interface. Measurements of magnetorheological properties provide evidence of fingering, torque. Ca2+/Ba2+ ion-exchange will (through the change in magnetic properties) reveal the level of scaling potential. Here we will evaluate the magnetic nanoparticles derived in phase I in oil- and water-based fluids for on-line well-head analysis. Phase III: Remote In-reservoir Analysis. BP-UniS have developed nanoparticles in aqueous and oil phases that can be injected into oil wells to control scale at a distance. Remote chemical sensing in the atmosphere can be achieved by optical interrogation of microporous Si-based smart dust. Here we wish to investigate, understand, optimise and deploy smart magnetic nanoparticles that can be interrogated after injection into oil-wells and water injection wells. Here we will evaluate the magnetic nanoparticles prepared and characterised in phase I in reservoir conditions with geomagnetic monitoring (using SIN-coated optical fibres) to sense cation concentrations, water contents and oil contents of fluid reservoir phases and their spatial-temporal distribution within the reservoir and hence determine their potential to allow exploration of new fields, better estimates of reserves and maximise/extend oil production from existing wells. Phase IV: Field Trials. Trials of this nanotechnology (when phases I-III are encouraging) will be undertaken at selected BP oil fields These trials would take place through an oilfield services provider who would be able to facilitate manufacture and supply the nanoparticles and monitor their response. For ease of operation, the initial trials would take place on land-based fields such as Wytch Farm in the UK and Prudhoe Bay in the USA. At this stage it is difficult to quantify the cost of these trials since the cost of manufacture of the particles and the cost of the monitoring technology is unknown. Generally, however, field trials of new technology cost in the region of $300,000 to $1 million. Therefore it would be reasonable for BP to expect to allocate initially a budget of 500,000 to perform the first field trial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F006845/1","grantId":"DT/F006845/1","fundValue":"269358","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Sermon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
