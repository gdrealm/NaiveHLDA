These are intensive research interactions between researchers from across and beyond the social sciences who are using cutting edge methods.</li>\n <li>Training and capacity building activities including a series of one-day training workshops; a series of ‘methods in dialogue’ workshops; online resources and a major conference in the final year.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G007411/1","grantId":"ES/G007411/1","fundValue":"965210","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Mason","coPersons":["James  Nazroo","Carol Christine Smart","Brian Thomas Heaphy","Vanessa Linda May"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
