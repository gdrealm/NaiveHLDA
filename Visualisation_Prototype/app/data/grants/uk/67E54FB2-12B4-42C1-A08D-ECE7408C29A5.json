This facilitated organisation of workshops, and particularly CMMB staff, postdocs and PhD students attending numerous events at the MBI. The partnership between the Centre for Mathematical Medicine and Biology (CMMB) at the University of Nottingham (UoN) and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI, Ohio) continues via joint funding from UoN and the MBI. This will continue to facilitate exchanges, participation in MBI programmes and postdoctoral mentoring in the field of mathematical biology.
