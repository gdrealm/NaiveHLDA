In most of these magnetic quantum oscillations of magnetization (the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect) and/or resistance (the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect) are extensively used to measure the Fermi-surface and electron correlations.. Essential deviations from the conventional three-dimensional oscillations have been found in low-dimensional conductors. A consistent investigation of the SdH and dHvA effects in multi-band low-dimensional metals, with a particular attention to the difference between canonical and grand canonical ensembles, is one of the project objectives. There are also significant opportunities for discovery of unique galvano-magnetic phenomena arising from the dimension quantization in nanowires and nanotubes, which are manufactured of almost any cross-section down to nanometer scale and of any length using modern nano-technologies. Taking into account a great demand for quantitative characterization of nanowires the proposal seeks to develop the theory of magnetic quantum oscillations in metallic nanowires. We expect that an interplay between size and magnetic energy-quantizations will manifest itself through novel magnetic quantum oscillations. A significant impact of this research is expected on the current experimental and theoretical studies of strongly-correlated low-dimensional electrons and on nano-technologies employing novel materials.
