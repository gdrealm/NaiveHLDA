Towards a point-of-care test.","abstractText":"There is an urgent need for new simple rapid cheap diagnostic method for bovine TB. In a pilot study, funded by the BBSRC, we have found 7 serum protein biomarkers that discriminate between culture positive proven cases of bovine TB from non-infected animals. Two markers have been identified at the molecular level. We propose (1) to validate these 2 markers using an immunologically based test on a separate cohort of TB-infected and non-infected animals and (2) identify the remaining 5 biomarkers at the molecular level and also validate them. The data will be used to formulate a simple point-of-care (POC test) for bovine TB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E527247/1","grantId":"BB/E527247/1","fundValue":"89840","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul R Langford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We found the amount of two proteins were higher in the blood of cows with bovine TB compared to those that did not have the disease.
