Funding is sought for organizing workshops, facilitating exchange visits, setting up a visiting programme for international leading researchers and for seeding projects related to discovery of novel materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I017836/1","grantId":"EP/I017836/1","fundValue":"85891","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  An annual interdisciplinary forum to bring together physicists, chemists, materials scientists and theoreticians in and around Oxford to advance the science and promote direct collaboration between groups interested in novel quantum materials and phenomena.\n\n\n\nThe Oxford Symposium on Quantum Materials is a new annual interdisciplinary forum to bring together physicists, chemists, materials scientists and theoreticians in and around Oxford to advance the science and promote direct collaboration between groups interested in novel quantum materials and phenomena. It has resulted in new collaborations and interactions between among the participants.\n\n\n.\n\nBeneficiaries: Academics, researchers and students (80 participants) and has resulted in new interactions and collaborations.\n\nContribution Method: This meeting has provided the necessary ingredients towards collaborations in overlapping research areas with the aim to advance knowledge, train scientists and open up new avene of research by collaboration.
