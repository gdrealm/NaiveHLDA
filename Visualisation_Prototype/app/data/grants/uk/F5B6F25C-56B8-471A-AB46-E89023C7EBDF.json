Proteins can be fluorescently labelled with high specificity and this permits one to study where and when they are produced or degraded within living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. The fluorescence signatures may also report on subtle changes in the molecular environment of the tagged proteins. For example interactions between proteins may lead to subtle intensity, colour and lifetime changes in the emission of the reporting fluorophores. There is therefore a constant demand in the life sciences for novel, better, and more flexible instrumentation to measure fluorescence from within living cells. The fluorescence lifetime in particular is a key parameter in such efforts. Molecular proximity can quench fluorescence and this in turn results in a reduction of the lifetime. Measuring lifetime from molecules in cells is however a difficult task: There is always a trade-off between the precision and the speed at which a lifetime measurement can be performed. In the current proposal we seek to improve on a technique called frequency domain lifetime imaging microscopy (FD FLIM): This technique is popular in conjunction with widefield fluorescence microscopy because it is simple and flexible in application but it has drawbacks, because in its conventional form, the speed of measurement and the precision are limited. In the present work we aim to overcome these limitations and vastly improve on the capability of FD FLIM for measurements of protein-protein interactions in living systems. The instrument to be developed here will be used in the study of the molecular processes, which regulate cell division and we will be able to do this in much more detail than before: The features we study are highly dynamic and occur over small spatial scales and the improved temporal resolution and precision will quantify events that we have not been able to observe so far. The capability we are developing here will be available for researchers from various departments and be useful in situations where either molecular scale events need to be monitored at rapid speed, such as signalling events in cells, or in situations where high measurement precision is required, for example to record subtle lifetime changes that may report on different oligomeric states of aggregating monomers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H023917/1","grantId":"BB/H023917/1","fundValue":"119764","fundStart":"2010-10-18","fundEnd":"2011-10-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant was used to develop a novel frequency domain FLIM instrument based on a theoretical concept developed earlier by us.

We have demonstrated and used these capabilities through application in live cell mitosis research. The system was developed through modification of an existing wide-field FD FLIM system and makes use of a pulsed supercontinuum light source for excitation and permits arbitrary phase profiles to be imposed on the gain waveform of the image collection system. In one mode of operation, which we term multiharmonic FLIM (mh FLIM), information can be retrieved from multiple harmonics present in the signal waveform. This permits multiple lifetimes to be resolved in every pixel. In another mode of operation, which we term phi2FLIM, the system will be capable of recording fluorescence lifetime images at several Hz repetition rates. phi2FLIM removes all components from higher harmonic frequencies from the signal and thus completely eliminates frequency aliasing artefacts in FD FLIM. We have applied mh FLIM for the study of the CFP-Plk1/YFP-ubiquitin pair in fixed cells to characterize mitosis-specific FRET between the substrate and ubiquitin. We have furthermore performed dynamic live cells studies using phi2FLIM to establish when and where ubiquitination of Plk1 occurs, and to determine the fate of ubiquitinated Plk1 complexes. This provides us with novel insights into how ubiquitination of Plk1 contributes to its activity, and to the organization of mitosis. The platforms developed can be used for drug screening applications and biomedical diagnostics. Development of hardware:\n\n1) A prototype instrument incorporating mhFLIM and phi2FLIM with a supercontinuum excitation source and fast gated intensifier has been built. An optimised version of the instrument will be made available in the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Center (CAIC), a multiuser imaging facility to serve the life science research community. Software for mhFLIM and phi2FLIM methods has been developed and is available free of charge from our web page.\n\n2) A new tool for quantitative analysis of ubiquitination, in vivo-biotinylatable ubiquitin, was developed that outperforms current assays for endogenous ubiquitin in human cells. The method permits the timing and location of ubiquitination of specific mitotic substrates. \n\n\n\nWe have collaborated with Fianium UK and could show that their supercontinuum technology is ideally matched for high fidelity frequency domain FLIM applications, that are both fast and possess a high photon economy. This opens new commercial opportunities for supercontinuum light sources. We have collaborated with LaVision to obtain a custom made intensifier unit that is optimised for mhFLIM and phi2FLIM applications. We have also been collaborating with Lambert Instruments (Netherlands) on the implementation of mhFLIM on their commercial frequency domain FLIM platforms . \n\n\n\nThe developed widefield techniques are faster and more precise than current techniques and, although this was unanticipated at the time of writing this grant, they are proving useful also in the study of protein aggregation phenomena in live cells and small organism models of Alzheimer's disease\n\n\n\nWe have participated in the Cambridge Science Festival to educate the broader public on the use of advanced microscopic imaging in medical research. The PI has also given a public lecture organised by the Kelvin Club in Cambridge on the history and use of microscopy. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
