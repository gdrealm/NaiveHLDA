In particular his first and major work 'Al-Kitab wa'l-Qur'an: Qira'a mu'asira' (The Book and the Qur'an: A Contemporary Reading, 1990) created a vast amount of literature that served within the repressive atmosphere of Syria's state policies as a vehicle to formulate a counter-narrative to the Islamist paradigm. This project sets out to combine two major objectives in exploring the 'Shahrour-phenomenon': it will first concentrate on M. Shahrour's work itself and produce a critical edition of his major arguments and theories, seeking to explain the novelty and complex nature of his work vis-&agrave;-vis the traditional Qur'anic exegesis. Secondly, it will shed light on the dialogical nature of his work by putting it into the context of other views and counter-arguments by Syrian Muslim intellectuals, Islamic 'Ulama and secular anti-Islamist circles. The analysis will focus on two central debates in the battle against Islamism: the concept of divine revelation and its relationship with human reasoning, and the status of women in Islamic law touching on issues of civil society, gender equality, human rights, individualism, and the place of Islamic law in a modern society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F006500/1","grantId":"AH/F006500/1","fundValue":"27363","fundStart":"2008-01-28","fundEnd":"2008-05-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andreas  Christmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
