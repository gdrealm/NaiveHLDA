The concept of disassembling polymers is new and can be described as macromolecular systems able todisintegrate into their building blocks through a domino-like reaction triggered by a single stimulus, such as a specificchemical reaction. The creation of a cross-linking network within the polymeric matrix would provide three dimensionalcavities where specific interactions with the drug molecule could be favoured. The choice of nanogels, as polymer format,is dictated by the great advantages derived, in terms of applications, by having such materials able to form colloidalsolutions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014578/1","grantId":"EP/I014578/1","fundValue":"173862","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marina  Resmini","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
