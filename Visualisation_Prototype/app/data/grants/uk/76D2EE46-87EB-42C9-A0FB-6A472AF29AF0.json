The project examines Spartan social institutions from the perspective of comparable institutions of other Greek city-states and in societies at their historical times and places. Its comparative approach is grounded in an analysis of the historiography of previous attempts to compare Sparta with other societies and of the mythology of cross-cultural comparison. The objective is an enhanced understanding of Spartan society through viewing her supposedly distinctive institutions in broader historical context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111877/1","grantId":"111877/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-30","fundEnd":"2006-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen John  Hodkinson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" This project formed part of the larger AHRC project, 'Sparta in Comparative Perspective, Ancient to Modern'. The wider key findings of the larger project are outlined in its report. This particular part of the larger project has focused on the military aspects of Spartan culture. \n\n\n\nThe last generation of Spartan research has radically transformed interpretations of many key aspects of Classical Spartan society. The one orthodoxy that has remained largely intact, however, is Sparta's image as a society exceptionally dominated by military concerns and values, whose civic institutions were directed towards preparation for and the practice of war. Indeed, in the 20th century this martial image received strength from the emphasis in Western thinking on Sparta's association with militaristic regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and on her military self-sacrifice at Thermopylae. Terms such as 'militarism' and 'militaristic' are commonly used to depict the nature of Spartan society.\n\n\n\nThis project has undertaken a systematic re-examination of this orthodoxy, addressing it through two complementary approaches. \n\n\n\nFirst, it has examined the development of Sparta's image as a military society in ancient and modern Western thought from the 7th century BC to the late 20th century AD. It has shown the range of diverse and often contradictory representations of Sparta's military characteristics. In some periods (including the 19th and 20th centuries) Sparta has been portrayed as a fundamentally militaristic society. However, in other periods (such in our earliest evidence from ancient Greece and in Renaissance and early modern thought) Sparta's military characteristics have been viewed as just one, albeit important, aspect of her broader civic culture. The project has added a new dimension to our understanding of the Spartan tradition in European thought and has highlighted the historically contingent character of current ideas of Spartan militarism. \n\n\n\nSecondly, the project has undertaken an ambitious and innovative study of the substantive role of military institutions and values in Classical Sparta compared with their role in other Greek city-states and a range of other ancient and medieval societies. This has shown that the role and importance of war-making, military institutions and values in Spartan society, though not insignificant, were in many respects modest in comparison with their roles in the other societies under examination. \n\n\n\nThe project's findings form a major contribution to debates about how to view the character of Spartan society and about the interrelationship between Greek military organization and society. The volume is also relevant to the cross-cultural study of war and society and to the history of political ideas. Several synergies developed through the project have created considerable extra-academic interest, and opportunities have been taken to promote use of the research in non-academic contexts. \n\n\n\n1. Local government cultural heritage policies in modern Sparta\n\nThe project research, allied to Hodkinson's role in creating the University of Nottingham's Centre for Spartan and Peloponnesian Studies, has generated considerable official and public interest within Greece, especially in the modern city of Sparti. In consequence, a close working relationship has been established through the CSPS with the Municipality of Sparti and its Central Public Library. For the municipal government of Sparti, the project's research enhances its cultural heritage policies. The project's revisionist research, depicting a civic-oriented, less militaristic Sparta, has given the local community a new understanding of its classical heritage and continuing role in modern times. This research has been disseminated in Sparti through donation of the project's publications to the Public Library's research collection, where they are much-used by local teachers and students, and through several personal visits when Hodkinson has spoken in both Greek and English to audiences including local government officials, teachers and the general public. The cumulative impact has led the Municipality to change its portrayal of its cultural heritage, to present ancient Sparta as a civic-minded culture with important lessons to offer to contemporary Greece.\n\n\n\n2. Sparta in contemporary popular comic books\n\nThe appearance of Zack Snyder's film '300' (2006), based upon Frank Miller's graphic novel, occasioned significant public interest in Sparta's military culture. This has led to an opportunity for use of the project's research on Spartan militarism to inform the work of the renowned comic book author, Kieron Gillen, who was planning a five-part comic book series titled Three - an intended inversion of Frank Miller's 300 and the subsequent film - centred on the struggle of three fictional helots against their Spartiate oppressors. Gillen was concerned to achieve greater historical authenticity than in Miller's work; hence Hodkinson agreed to act as his historical consultant. For each issue Hodkinson has provided detailed 'authenticity critiques' of Gillen's draft text and illustrator Ryan Kelly's draft images, drawing on the project's research on Sparta's military culture. Text and images have then been heavily revised in the light of his critiques. The first issue of Three will be released in October 2013 and Hodkinson's historical contribution impact is already widely publicised in web and magazine interviews. The significance is enhanced by the fact that a historical comic supported by an expert consultant is highly unusual, if not unique.\n\n\n\n3. Gun control debates in the USA\n\nThe project's research has been used in U.S. gun control debates, following an approach from a campaigner for stricter gun regulation concerned about Sparta's role in the rhetoric of the pro-gun lobby, especially its use of King Leonidas' alleged phrase at the battle of Thermopylae, &quot;molon labe&quot; (&quot;Come and take them&quot;). In response to the question, &quot;Did Sparta exercise arms control in its society?&quot;, Hodkinson supplied an academic opinion, drawing on the project's research, concluding that, though they all possessed arms, Spartiates normally went about unarmed in everyday life and that the &quot;molon labe&quot; phrase was of doubtful historical authenticity. This analysis was posted the New Trajectory blog, along with the activist's view of its implications for current gun lobby arguments. Over the first two days the post received over 1300 hits.\n\n\n\n4. Secondary school and further education audiences in the UK\n\nThe project research has been actively disseminated to secondary school and FE teachers and students through talks and an article in the Classics schools magazine, Omnibus (2005) on &quot;The modern mirage of Spartan militarism&quot;. Recently, it has been used more specifically to assist teachers and students of the Sparta options within the OCR Ancient History AS-level and Classical Civilisation GCSE. In September 2012 the project research was disseminated to teachers at the JACT Ancient History INSET day. At the request of several teachers, Hodkinson has subsequently given a student-oriented version of his talk at a range of 6th form colleges, state, grammar and independent schools, with positive feedback. Hodkinson's INSET talk has also been published in the UK's leading journal for Classics schoolteachers, the Journal of Classics Teaching, &quot;as an effective way to improve teacher subject knowledge&quot;.
