Large time density estimates for multi-species coalescence models;\n\nII. Negative correlations properties for models with coalescence;\n\nIII. Pfaffian, and extended Pfaffian, properties for the particle densities, and joint particle-mass densities, for spatial models with coalescence; \n\nIV. Steady states for coalescent models with immigration;\n\nV. The evolution for the eigenvalues for the real Ginibre matrices and its connection with annihilating systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K011758/1","grantId":"EP/K011758/1","fundValue":"285213","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Tribe","coPersons":["O  Zaboronski"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
