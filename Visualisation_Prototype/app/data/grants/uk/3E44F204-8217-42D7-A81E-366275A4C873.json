At this stage they have only seen interim findings, though they have commended the depth of the research and expressed interest in particular insights. I strongly anticipate that the findings will shape the international marketing and business decision making of Marks and Spencer and other UK and foreign retailers and provide the basis of an Impact Case Study for REF 2020.

Unlike traditional franchising partnerships, where the franchisor is in control and intensively monitors across its network of franchisees, international franchising is best developed through using a capable overseas area development partner. The differences between emerging markets and the UK can be so extreme that it is difficult for the franchisor to control operations, irrespective of their resource base and experience. In effect, the franchisor is reliant on the franchisee to make and implement decisions in the local marketplace and absorb local risks. The overseas franchisees can effectively build the brand with the franchisor in a form of strategic alliance--both sides learn to cooperate over time to this end. Our findings contribute to the first stage of international area development franchising relationship theory development, but also contribute new insights to theory on strategic alliances.\n\nKey to the performance of overseas franchising is the role of the overseas franchisees in interpreting local market conditions and enabling the franchisor to respond to these. For instance, in emerging market settings the consumer can be more aspirational than in the UK and represent a younger demographic profile. The ability to localize marketing (e.g., products and prices), however, can be undermined not only by the franchising model applied (e.g., levels of franchisor control and operational support), but also by the design of the UK retailer's business. More specifically, the franchisees we studied were especially critical of logistics and supply chain and buying and merchandising arrangements, which undermine franchisee responsiveness to local market conditions. These areas of the retail business can put domestic retailing first, which adds to the difficulty of resolving the issues.\n\nThe franchising model is not as profitable vis-?-vis other modes of foreign market entry. However, it is optimal in its ability to accommodate head-winds in risky overseas markets. Marks and Spencer use franchising to remain profitable in Russia and the Ukraine, despite the socio-political tensions in these territories over the past twelve months. The risk of lost sales due to recession is also borne by the franchisee; though Marks and Spencer will take returns of bought and paid for goods under such exceptional circumstances. Where the franchising model has an issue is in internet related expansion, which is far easier if the UK retailer is using a form of ownership overseas (e.g., a joint venture). For instance, Greek Marks and Spencer customers can shop through the internet, whilst this option is not feasible for Cypriots. In sum, the performance of different modes of foreign market entry is highly circumstantial. Franchising should though be playing an important role in overseas retailing operations due to its flexibility and ability to absorb head-winds. UK retailers can derive advantages from using a network of franchising operations (e.g., in emerging markets) as the basis upon which to expand into other, higher-profit modes as and when local circumstances dictate this. The study has produced insights in separate areas: international retailing, franchising strategy, strategic alliances, foreign market entry modes, and emerging markets. The findings can be taken forward by scholars and practitioners interested in any of these areas. This said, it is expected the findings will be of most value to those seeking to investigate research questions and/or develop retail policy across the areas.\n\nThough dissemination is an on-going activity, Marks and Spencer have already fed back on the quality of our findings in various meetings and telephone discussions. The University of Leeds and Marks and Spencer are now in the process of arranging two dissemination events to the wider community of practitioners; the first of which is on December 12th 2014.\n\nThe project team has also started to disseminate the findings to different academic and practitioner conference audiences. Three such presentations have been made, with at least two more to follow. Once the final report is developed and made available via our webpages, impact will escalate. Retail","dataset":"gtr"}
