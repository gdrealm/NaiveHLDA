These formal systems are with respect to their expressive resources and to their consequences incomplete.\\n\\nFor instance, it has been argued that under certain general conditions absolute general quantification cannot be expressed in such formal frameworks. Similarly it has been claimed that the open-endedness of certain domains of discourse is not expressible or describable in the standard formal systems. Moreover, the soundness of a theory, which is implicit in the acceptance of a theory, cannot be adequately expressed or proved within the formal systems aimed to capture our pre-formal theories of certain abstract subject matters. In particular, in the formal frameworks one cannot even express the claim that all consequences of the theory are true and even approximations to this general claim are not provable in the system.\\n\\nWe will investigate how these deficiencies in the expressive and reflective power of formal systems for theories in the abstract sciences can be overcome. Thereby we will make explicit what is implicit in the acceptance of the theories.\\n\\nTo this end we will enrich the formal system with devices going beyond the confines of the usual first-order axiomatisations. We will investigate to what extent the addition of truth predicates, second-order quantifiers, modal operators and other devices can be used to overcome the expressive and reflective weaknesses of the standard first-order systems. Thus our results will also reveal the expressive strength of modal talk or second-order quantification.\\n\\nOur work will yield new insights in the adequacy of formal systems for capturing theories of abstract objects and therefore also in the applicability and significance of formal deductive systems and in their scope and significance.\\n\\nThe theories we will study comprise arithmetic, syntax, set theory, and parts of formal semantics.\\n\\nIn the project we study foundational issues in various disciplines not in separation but from a common viewpoint. Our work is interdisciplinary in the sense that we want to apply concepts and ideas across disciplines. For instance, we look at the role a notion of truth could play if added to a mathematical theory, that is, we are applying a notion from formal semantics to a theory not directly concerned with formal semantics. Likewise, we will combine modal operators familiar from modal logic with set theory and other formal theories from other disciplines; and we shall apply results from mathematical logic and mathematics to study their implications on ontology and philosophy of language.\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039791/1","grantId":"AH/H039791/1","fundValue":"795639","fundStart":"2010-12-31","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1. Axiomatic theories of truth are intended to capture fundamental principles governing the concept of truth and to measure the expressive or deductive strength that they generate over an underlying object theory.

Examples are theories of truth, sets, syntax, computability and various theories in metaphysics such as theories of sets.\n\nThere are various general results that show that these theories are always incomplete: Certain features of the subject matter cannot be captured by the formal theories. For instance, one would like to have a theory of truth characterizing a onception of truth that is not restricted to a certain domain. Such a truth predicate is used frequently in philosophy, for instance, when philosophers claim that whatever is known is true. However, under fairly general assumptions natural axioms for such a unrestricted notion of truth lead to paradox. In fact, if the conception of truth applies to the domain of semantics\nand can be applied to statements about truth, paradoxes arise.\n\nSimilarly, if one gives a theory of a formal system, it will not be\npossible to prove the consistency of that system within the theory, as G?del's incompleteness axioms show.\n\nPotentialist accounts of set theory attempt to take seriously the highly compelling thought that there are no limits to which things can be collected as the elements of a set. Without care, this quickly leads to a contradiction, generating Russell's paradox. To make this idea precise, and avoid paradox, a modal framework was developed to axiomatise set theory. This improved on existing potentialist approaches by increasing the expressive power of the language, permitting us to account for more of standard set theory. \n\nTheories of truth have been devised that allow one to predicate truth in an (almost) unrestricted way. Using truth theories it is also possible to formulate theories that reflect on their soundness, that is, they state, within certain limits, that their consequences are true and that they (or subtheories) are consistent.\n\nIn set theory the very notion of indefinite extensibility can be shown to be at the root of modern formulations of set theory. Incorporating indefinite extensibility in a formal theory allows one to recover the usual axiomatizations of set theory and shows how this idea can provide foundations for set theory.\n\nThe project yielded also results on the mechanisms behind the\ninexpressibility and incompleteness phenomena. It is often thought that sentences that make claims about themselves, so called self-referential sentences, are the source for these phenomena. However, although 'self-reference' is a widely use concept in philosophy, our results shed some light on how elusive this notion is. Even in the precise formal languages self-reference is difficult to capture. - The theories of truth developed in the project can be used in other areas of philosophy (epistemology, metaphysics).\n\n- The theories of truth developed in the project can be used in the foundations of mathematics and in set theory.\n\n- The analysis of self-reference should be useful in philosophy, mathematics and linguistics. In particular, it is useful in the analysis of various paradoxes and facilitates the exact formulation of various questions in metamathematics.\n\n- The work on set th Other","dataset":"gtr"}
