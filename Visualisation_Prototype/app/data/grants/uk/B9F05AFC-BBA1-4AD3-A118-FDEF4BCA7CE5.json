It is believed that the increases in congestion reflect travellers' responses, both temporary and longer-term, to competition for road network capacity. Continuing adjustments to network capacity in pursuit of mayoral transport priorities, for example, improved safety and amenity, and increased priority for buses, taxis, pedestrians and cyclists, has led to increasing delays for private vehicular traffic. The current annual cost of congestion on London's main roads is estimated to be in the range of 1.8 to 3 billion.Analysis of road network performance is intricate. This is because the road network is essentially an open system with many factors and in which travellers can respond by modifying their choices in many different ways that will affect monitored performance outcomes. The form of these factors, their direction of causality, the fact that some of them interact strongly, and their sheer numbers all contribute to the complexity. These factors have different patterns of influence in both time and space, and analysis of the distinct cause-effect patterns is complicated by the non-linearity of the effects, including the possibility of abrupt growth in congestion once it sets in. Modelling spatial-temporal dependency of the factors is the bottleneck in analysis of the network performance. The challenge is to model dependency in both space and time seamlessly and simultaneously so that the accuracy of analysis can be improved. Another challenge is to fully consider the topology (links and hierarchies) and geometry (distances and directions) of real road networks in the analysis. These are also fundamental challenges in modelling complexity of other types of networks.This research will tackle these challenges. It will be achieved by innovative combination of two chosen novel machine learning methods (Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks - DRNN and Support Vector Machines - SVM) with the most advanced statistical space-time series analysis (Spatio-Temporal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average - STARIMA) and Geographically Weighted Regression - GWR. These methods are selected because their applications in transport studies are relatively new compared with conventional statistical methods, and, more importantly, they have the potential to improve the representation of the network complexity. The DRNN and SVM can model the non-linearity and non-stationarity existing in most spatio-temporal data which may not be fully accommodated by STARIMA. The STARIMA has the explanatory capability which is missing in DRNN and SVM. The GWR can model the heterogeneity of the networks and improve the understanding of the scales of the networks. Their use in combination will improve the sensitivity and explanatory power of the analysis, to enable the effects of the factors to be assessed separately (isolatable). These methods will also be explored, refined and further developed in the light of experience in this study.The outcome of this research will advance the new and emerging fundamental researches in agent simulations, dynamic network analysis, and computational models and architectures of artificial neural networks, which are widely involved in space-time analysis of social-economic phenomena. It will offer TfL better tools and techniques to manage the road space and mitigate congestion more effectively thereby improving person journey times and overall journey reliability, and in doing so also deliver large economic benefits to London. The benefits of the research will accrue widely to both public and private transport users. The methodology developed here will be transferable to understand the congestion in other big cities around the world with economic, monetary, social and environmental benefits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G023212/1","grantId":"EP/G023212/1","fundValue":"779651","fundStart":"2009-07-23","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work of the STANDARD has partly led to the creation of a new interdisciplinary research centre at UCL, called SpaceTimeLab.

It pioneered integrated modelling of spatio-temporal dependency of networks via combined statistical regression and machine learning. The case study used Central London with data provided by TfL. The major findings are summarised as follows:\n\n1) Short-term journey time prediction - analysis of a large dataset of journeys collected in London, has contributed to the understanding of how traffic conditions spread across road networks. New models based upon statistical and machine learning approaches have been developed for short-term forecast of journey times in road networks. This provides enhanced performance by comparison with existing models and is robust in the presence of missing data. \n\n2) Simulation of driver behaviour and network performance - New theories and models of drivers behaviour have been developed based upon a dataset of 1.5 million taxi journeys. These theories contribute to our understanding of how the behaviour of individuals generates the large scale traffic conditions that we observe on urban transport networks. Agent-based simulations have been developed based on these theories, which are more realistic than existing models.\n\n3) Identifying and modelling the spread of non-recurrent congestion - The most severe traffic delays are caused by non-recurrent events such as traffic incidents, burst water mains, road works and special events; these are responsible for about half of all congestion losses in London and other major cities. When these events take place, modelling the spread of the resulting congestion is crucial to mitigating their effects. This research has developed novel methods to identify non-recurrent congestion in order to provide early warning for traffic engineers. \n\n4) 3D visualisation of traffic data - The collection, and subsequent availability, of massive datasets with both spatial and temporal dimensions has increased rapidly in recent years. However, the development of methods for visualising them still represents a major bottleneck. This research has developed a number of sophisticated 3D visualisation methods, which allow better understanding of spatio-temporal patterns in traffic data. These methods have been applied by Transport for London to the visualisation of journey time reliability during the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n5) Identification of macroscopic traffic parameters in Central London - Analytical methods were developed for determining macroscopic traffic parameters for the road network in central London. Methods were developed to fuse data of different kinds (flows, occupancies, travel times) from different sources (automatic number plate recognition, SCOOT) to provide an improved representation of the network state, which enables richer analysis. This stream of work has been supported by quantitative analysis of the effect of weather conditions, road works and tube strikes on travel times in London.\n\nInformation and Communications Technology (ICT) offers network managers better tools and techniques to manage road space and to mitigate congestion more effectively. Benefits of this will accrue by travellers by improving their travel experience and network reliability. The methodology developed here will be transferable to monitor, analyse and manage traffic in other major cities around the world with economic, monetary, social and environmental benefits. The outcome of this research also advances the new and emerging fundamental researches in agent-based simulations, dynamic network analysis, and geocomputation, which are widely involved in spatio-temporal analysis of socio-economic phenomena involving big data. o Enabling transport authorities to better understand the performance of their urban road networks in big cities around the world.\n\no Enabling better understanding of drivers' behaviours and congestion propagation on road networks. \n\no Enabling improved modelling and forecasting of space-time series collected on real world sensor networks, including, but not limited to transportation networks.\n\no Enabling exploration analysis of dynamic processes evolving along networks through space-time visualisation.\n\no The methods and algorithms are also being developed as a package for the open source software environment R.\n\n o Several published articles in peer reviewed journals including Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, Journal of Advanced Transportation, Journal of Geographical Systems, Geographic Analysis, the Cartographic Journal, Transportation Planning and Technology and Geoinformatica.\n\no Oral and poster presentations at various international conferences in Geographical Information Science, transportation studies, regional science, geography, and complexity science.\n\no The methods developed are being taught as part of an MSc programme at UCL.
