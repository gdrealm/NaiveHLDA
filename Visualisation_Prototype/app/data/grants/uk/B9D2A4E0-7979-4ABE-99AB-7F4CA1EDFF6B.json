Representations of migrant and diasporic experiences have assumed a more prominent position in cinematic narratives; non-Western and non-European aesthetics have brought new styles and genres. Recent examples of German-Turkish, French beur, Black and Asian British cinema as well as films of transnationally mobile filmmakers from the Balkans and former Soviet bloc countries have won considerable critical acclaim and have captured mainstream audiences. This research network explores how migrant and diasporic filmmakers have challenged traditional views of national identity and 'Europeanism'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119549/1","grantId":"119549/1","fundValue":"20368","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-10-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Through the creation of various platforms of knowledge exchange, this AHRC Research Network has enhanced awareness of migrant and diasporic filmmaking amongst industry stakeholders and the cinema-going public and shaped cultural life. It has also inspired one of the Network members (filmmaker/producer Gareth Jones) to launch an audio-visual development programme, BABYLON, which has, in turn, supported film projects of ethnic minority filmmakers with a migratory background. Since 2007 BABYLON has provided workshop-based training for over one hundred filmmakers. Eight BABYLON alumni have succeeded in getting their films into production and theatrical distribution in the UK, continental Europe and further afield as well as winning awards on the international festival circuit.\nThese eight films have been released in cinemas and some have received extensive press coverage in leading newspapers such as The Guardian, Le Monde, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Zeit and the trade press (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Sight and Sound etc.). Son of Babylon was Iraq's nomination for the Academy Awards in 2010 and was distributed in nine territories. Kuma premiered at the International Berlin Film Festival in 2012 and has since been released in cinemas in eight countries including Austria, Germany, Spain, the UK and France, where it was distributed with 60 prints under the title Une seconde femme, attracting 36,710 viewers.\nIn addition to providing the initial stimulus for the foundation of BABYLON, the Network has created numerous opportunities for knowledge exchange, consultancy and collaboration with high-profile minority filmmakers including John Akomfrah, Abdelkrim Bahloul, Feo Alada?, diversity consultant Parminder Vir, OBE, Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures), producers Leslee Udwin (East is East and West is West) and Ralph Schwingel (Fatih Ak?n's Head-On) and Thierry Lenouvel (Cin? Sud Promotion). These have generated a more comprehensive understanding of diversity and equality issues amongst stakeholders in the media industry. Furthermore, at the International BFI London Film Festivals in 2011 and 2012, Jones convened industry panels entitled 'BABYLON Burning - a public debate on film diversity' and 'BABYLON Breakthrough'. A productive dialogue between Nadine Marsh-Edwards (producer, board member Film London), Nadia Denton (Black Film Magazine), Leslee Udwin, David Thomson (former Head of BBC Films, now Origin Pictures) amongst others ensued at these important forums. The PI, Daniela Berghahn, participated in the industry panel 'BABYLON Burning' in 2011, which received press coverage in BritFlicks. \nBerghahn designed a public-facing interactive website www.migrantcinema.net. Between March 2006 and November 2014, it has attracted 55,540 unique visitors with a total number of 154,692 page views. The website has raised the public visibility of the research and, as a result, the PI and Network participant Carrie Tarr were invited in October 2009 to contribute to an international symposium and a German television programme entitled 'Suddenly so much Heimat: Changing Identity in Film, Culture and Society'. The public symposium was organised by the WDR (West German Broadcasting Corporation) and held at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne. Berghahn was also interviewed for a documentary on the topic, broadcast by the WDR on 31 October 2009, watched by 90,000 viewers. The event and TV programme were initiated by the WDR's Commissioner for Integration and Cultural Diversity and the Head of Television Drama and Film. It brought together filmmakers, journalists, film critics, policy makers and international film scholars and promoted a new concept of Heimat, identity and belonging, thereby supporting the WDR's mission to promote cultural diversity and integration.\nIn 2014, the PI Daniela Berghahn and Network member Sarita Malik were invited to contribute to the 16th ZEMOS98 Festival in Seville. The Festival under the theme Remapping Europe brought together artists, NGOs, activists, journalists and a few academics. It was devoted to immigration in European societies and was funded by the European Cultural Foundation. Berghahn and Malik were subsequently invited to serve on the nomination panel for the ECF Princess Margriet Award. This annual Award is given to European artists and thinkers whose work shows the potential of culture in creating an inclusive Europe.

The Network has been concerned with how films made by migrant and diasporic filmmakers as well as productions which represent migratory or diasporic experiences have shaped and modified our understanding of European identity/ies, previously constructed and narrated within distinct national cinemas. The Network worked on the premise that multicultural and multiethnic presences and themes in contemporary European cinemas should not be studied in terms of their national specificity, because such critical paradigms do not adequately address the shift from the national to the transnational which has occurred since the early to mid-1980s. This shift has been fuelled by the long legacy of colonialism, the ongoing process of European integration, the geopolitical changes after the collapse of communism and the continuing influx of migrants to what is still perceived as the politically and economically stable heartland of Europe. Migrant and diasporic cinema in Europe, therefore, potentially refers to a multitude of social and ethnic groups, movements and histories, cultural heritages and practices. The Network endeavoured to establish a theoretical framework by analysing the new concept of 'migrant and diasporic cinema' in relation to the socio-political implications of existing terminology (including in languages other than English). Our attempt to locate migrant and diasporic cinema in relation to discourses of postcolonialism, globalisation, etc. as well as to current debates in film studies enabled us to identify the specificities of this 'cinema of dual occupancy', which make it distinct from other types of transnational cinema such as 'global Hollywood' or 'Europuddings'. We argue that the emergence of migrant and diasporic cinema has played a crucial role in the 'World Cinema turn' that has taken place in European cinema, both in academia and in the industry. The Network has undertaken pioneering research on migrant and diasporic cinema and numerous other books, articles and doctoral theses make reference to the research findings of this project. It has also resulted in close collaboration with media practioners and the foundation of the audiovisual development initiative BABYLON Film (see under Impact) which has benefited migrant and diasporic filmmakers.
