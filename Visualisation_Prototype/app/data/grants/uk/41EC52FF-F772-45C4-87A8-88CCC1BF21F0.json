{"id":"41EC52FF-F772-45C4-87A8-88CCC1BF21F0","title":"State Dependence, Unobserved Heterogeneity and Female Labor Supply Behavior","abstractText":"<p>In this research, we study the relative importance of the various factors that affect female labour force participation. Clearly, a woman's education level, number and age of children, and spousal (non-labour) income are relevant determinants. Two additional factors that are receiving increasing attention lately are a womanâ€™s unobserved &quot;taste&quot; for work and her previous labour market experience. The common finding in data that there are many women who &quot;always&quot; work, many women who &quot;never&quot; work, and only few women that switch etween unemployment and employment, suggests that tastes and prior experience may be the most important factors of all. </p>\n\n<p>We contribute to the surprisingly sparse literature on the determinants of female labour supply behaviour by studying not only the relative importance of the factors mentioned above, but also the role of classification error in data on female employment status. Classification error arises when a woman is recorded as working when she is really not working, or as not working when she is really working. This type of misclassification can result in a ranking of determinants which is misleading.</p>\n\n<p>The results of our study are expected to have important public policy implications. With our ranking of determinants, we will be able to better predict the effects of changes in labour market subsidization programs and welfare policies on female labour supply decisions. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1529-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-1529-A","fundValue":"28022","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Sauer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
