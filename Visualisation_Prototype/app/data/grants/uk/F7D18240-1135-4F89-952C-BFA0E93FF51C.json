The salary and other costs of the astronomers are funded by other routes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F012292/1","grantId":"ST/F012292/1","fundValue":"19984","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This research has primarily been of benefit to the academic community. Its main non-academic impact has been in terms of contribution to outreach, especially in the Royal Observatory Edinburgh Visitor Centre.  ","person":"John Andrew Peacock","coPersons":["Philip  Best"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" The research supported under these programmes covered a broad range of astronomy and astrophysics. Probably the most significant achievement has been mapping the cosmological distribution of matter in a range of wavebands, as well as inferring the distribution of dark matter. Thus we can visualise how dark matter pulls together gas and measure the quantity of star formation that results. All important results from these grants form part of the academic research literature, and will be elaborated further by interested specialists.
