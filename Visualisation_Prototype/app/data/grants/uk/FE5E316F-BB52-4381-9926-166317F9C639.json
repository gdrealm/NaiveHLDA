Because of the lack of means for online measurement of granule moisture, the fluidised beds are currently operated by trial-and-error, resulting in low operation efficiency (i.e. longer operation time and more energy consumed), and more importantly the product quality cannot be guaranteed. During two recent EPSRC projects (GR/T29383/01, EP/G005702/1), we have made significant progress on fundamental understanding of the complicated gas-solids fluidisation processes and online measurement of granule moisture in fluidised bed dryers, which have been demonstrated on lab-scale fluidised bed dryers both at the University of Manchester (UoM) and in GEA Pharma Systems Ltd and also published in prestigious journals, e.g. AIChE J. In the past 12 months, our EPSRC Follow-on Fund project has allowed the technology to be scaled up from lab dryers to semi-industrial scale dryers and demonstration of the principle of online measurement of granule moisture in semi-industrial scale dryers in an industrial lab environment. This work, in collaboration with GEA and other industrial partners, has generated considerable interest from the pharmaceutical industry, notably AstraZeneca, who has expressed a wish to collaborate on the next stage of development with a view of becoming the first adopter of the technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H502327/1","grantId":"EP/H502327/1","fundValue":"100492","fundStart":"2010-03-15","fundEnd":"2011-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used in Chinese Academy of Sciences for clean coal combustion, which is important to reduce pollution to the environment.

The objective is to optimise the design of the production-scale fluidised bed and to improve operation efficiency of the fluidisation processes. This is the first time that ECT has been scaled-up to a production-scale fluidised bed of 1.0 m in diameter and batch process capacity of 100 kg in a real industrial environment. With a large-scale fluidised bed in a real industrial environment, some key issues on ECT sensor design must be addressed. To validate ECT measurement results, a two-phase flow model has been used to simulate the process in a lab-scale and pilot-scale fluidised bed. The key process parameters include solids concentration and average concentration profiles and frequency spectrum of signal fluctuation obtained by Fast Fourier Transfer (FFT) and multi-level wavelet decomposition in the time domain. The results show different hydrodynamic behaviour of fluidised beds of different scale. The time-averaged parameters from ECT and CFD are compared. Future work on ECT sensor design for large-scale fluidised beds is given in the end of the report. Further funding to develop a commercial product with GEA to be used by AstraZenaca.
