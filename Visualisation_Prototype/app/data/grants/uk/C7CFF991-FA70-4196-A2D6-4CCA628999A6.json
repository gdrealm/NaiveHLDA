{"id":"C7CFF991-FA70-4196-A2D6-4CCA628999A6","title":"Understanding Quality and Success in Early Years Settings / Practitioners' Perspectives.","abstractText":"<p>There is increasing recognition of the importance of high quality staff in early years settings in the light of the government’s efforts to reform services for young children and their families through the Children Act 2004. Indeed, staff qualified to higher levels have been identified as a significant factor in the provision of high quality services.&nbsp;However, earlier research suggests that practitioners may be confused about what constitutes quality in the care and education of young children, and this confusion may be exacerbated by the wide range of stakeholders in the new children’s services.&nbsp;This research aims to examine practitioners’ understandings of quality and success in the context of their particular settings, the effects of these understandings on the children with whom they work and the implications for training and professional development.&nbsp;To gain insights into practitioners’ perspectives, interviews and observations will be carried out in 18 settings (nursery classes, schools, private day nurseries and children’s centres) in two London Boroughs and two shire counties, selected on the basis of ‘good’ Ofsted reports.&nbsp;This research will also contribute to a wider debate about the development of practitioners’ professional knowledge.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0012","grantId":"RES-061-23-0012","fundValue":"190239","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elise  Alexander","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Roehampton University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
