{"id":"299F83B3-760F-4435-BFED-C5307F8D4CE5","title":"Co-designing asset mapping: comparative approaches","abstractText":"Asset based community development (ABCD) is a powerful approach being used with a diverse network of communities and community organizations across the Connected Communities programme to help uncover and utilize their hidden potential, their tangible resources (such as spaces, services and infrastructures) and intangible qualities (such as creative talents, skills, knowledge and social capital). Asset mapping has been deployed as a community engagement, research methodology and co-design tool seeking to enable groups to communicate stories, concerns and achievements but also to generate a shared vision and identify areas for development (personal, economic, environmental, cultural and social). Through a combination of discussion methods with creative techniques (participatory cartography, filmaking, visual art and storytelling, gaming, digital media and theatre performance), asset mapping has been used to trigger creative responses as well as creatively document, visualize and enable collective action, which could potentially improve the livelihoods of groups and communities, their spaces, services and environments. \nIn this context, the scope and possible meanings of 'mapping' drives central effort into the understanding of the different modes of exploration and representation of, and engagement with, communities. A number of questions direct this: What are the different meanings of mapping? What types of assets are captured by different approaches? What are the social, cultural, psychological, ethical, logistical contexts involved in different asset mapping approaches? How can we creatively analyse and reflect on insights gained from asset mapping methodologies? How can the different asset based methodology be communicated, expressed and represented more effectively to enhance their availability as a resource to the wider community? \nIt is thus necessary to develop knowledge that comes from comparison, collaborative reflection and evaluation, and, cross-pollination of approaches, and, to develop useful methods and strategies form meaningful analysis, as well as representation and dissemination that will advance academic research, community practice and policy debates.\nOur collaboration and approach in this project is unique in that it seeks to advance the exchange of perspectives adopted by the different approaches and to promote an agenda for the evaluation of asset mapping across the humanities, arts and social sciences, both as a research methodology and as a co-design/coproduction tool supporting collective/community engagement and action. \nOur collaboration brings together Connected Communities projects from the Open University and the Royal College of Art, and the Universities of Keele, Leicester and Brunel and community partners The Glass-House, Young Vic Theatre and Atenistas Group in Greece. Our methodologies have tapped into narrative and theatre, cultural animation and digital story-telling, group discussion and creative visualisation, participatory chartography and game-playing and brings together philosophical perspectives from American Pragmatism, design studies and informatics, community media and citizen journalism, and fields of action in relation to placemaking and neighbourhood planning, creative networks and volunteerism. The project's innovative mode of delivery includes sharing knowledge and resources among existing CC projects through - field research trips, knowledge exchange with other research projects and experiential workshops where we will co-design approaches for exploring the application of asset mapping in wider and transnational contexts.\nWe will disseminate our findings in workshops, through a visual website and collaborative report and will feed our lessons into the teaching curricula of the seven universities taking part in the project. Our ultimate aim is to develop the meaningful syntheses, processes and tools around asset mapping approaches that can be sustained and developed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L013363/1","grantId":"AH/L013363/1","fundValue":"44169","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our work on this project has been used in one principal way: For the benefit of academic and community partners, with whom we have worked in reflective, inquisitive and experiential activities in the UK and Greece.

We reflected upon the affordances of asset mapping for unlocking perceptions of value about places and communication infrastructures within localities through geographical field trips and for the co-creation of visual, playful and interactive narratives (e.g. the production films in Hackney and the production of Glossopoly, the co-creation a totem pole in Western Hales, the co-creation of visual, digital platforms for participatory planning) act as modes for re-engaging with place, developing critical literacy skills and facilitating communication &amp;amp;amp; networking among local stakeholders &amp;amp;amp; local authorities , to influence action and to support the visibility of diverse communities in localities. Although some asset based approaches work better with groups come together with a shared aspiration or purpose, the process of coming together through creative asset-based and co-design workshops, can fuel focused thinking and creative experimentation that can inspire specific and tangible outcomes. We have translated and adapted instruments from asset based methodologies used by respective partners in the UK, in Greek and used them in respective workshops during September and October 2014. \n\nWe have learned from, and exchanged knowledge with, new collaborators in the UK and Greece and are in the process of analysing rich data collected from insights about perceptions of assets, and asset-based methodologies for civic action in Greece. \n\nAlthough asset based methodologies present interesting ways to unlock community assets and narratives in the process of engagement or co-design, more can be done to further utilise the value of these creative methods as a research/analytical tools. While some techniques lead to creative outputs (e.g. documentary theatre scrips, sculptures, diagrams, etc), we conclude that the combination of traditional analytical approaches (e.g. thematic or discourse analysis) and diagrammatic visualisations can provide a rich account that can be reported back to diverse publics and academic communities. The use of guidelines, handbooks or simply communicated documentation of approaches in a variety of outputs (blogs, website, booklets) can be used to stimulate further appropriations of methods by community groups. \n\nSeveral tensions and ethical considerations exist revolving around asset-based or asset mapping approaches, including:\na) lifespan of activities versus community groups' priorities and researchers'/facilitaors' schedules \nb) getting adequate representation for all stakeholders individuals engaged \nc) although insights about processes are generally positive, recording, representing, analysing and reporting back all data is exceptionally complex \nd) ethical considerations regarding community anonymity and the need for visibility to fuel action\ne) gaining trust of community groups and engage individuals as peer collaborators' involves developing reporting guidelines and negotiating division of labour regularly\nf) enough contextual information (about group's history, relationships and civic practices, issues around areas/localities, etc) may be needed (using interviews and participatory ethnography approaches) and insights analysed to identify ways to build capacity and influence Stories we have collected about assets, unearth various perceptions or aspects surrounding the idea of 'value', to the extent that we can point to potentially credible injection points for investment in civic culture and volunteerism in the Greece, particularly in urban centres, that have been affected by the crisis. Likewise, the idea of several insights and contextual questions about the relationship of people and place focusing on:\na) identity and belonging;\nb) connection and representation;\nc) perceptions and aspirations about the modes, modalities and models of participation for a public purpose;\nd) civic creativity: ideas about tangible ways relating to small actions, and critical reflections about opportunities and challenges in engaging with authorities in localities or for excreting influence influence in decision making.\n\nThe findings will be made available on the project and AHRC websites, and on a number of project partners' websites and publicity materials (additional funding will be sought for the AHRC Connected Communities Showcase) and through prospective academic papers. In the website we have provided some case study materials which we hope to could help inspire other communities to explore how aspects around asset-based approaches could be used to help them achieve their aspirations. A raised interest has been expressed from communities and local authorities in Athens who have participated in this study for sharing expertise and knowledge about the instruments and the approaches to asset-based methodologies beyond the confines of the project.
