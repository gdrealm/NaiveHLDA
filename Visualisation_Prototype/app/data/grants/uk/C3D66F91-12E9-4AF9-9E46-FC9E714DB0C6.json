The Consumption of Design in Barcelona 1992-2004","abstractText":"This project examines the values embedded in certain urban objects and urban spaces, in order to explore the possibility of a design-led narrative of modernity, nation, and urban identity.\\n\\nIt spans the period 1992 / 2004, the second half of what has been called the 'Barcelona Design Boom'. It investigates the possibility of a design-led narrative of modernity, nationality and urban identity through an exploration of the values embedded in a number of case study objects and urban spaces. \\nIt seeks to provide a new interpretative framework, through a study of the evolution of design in Barcelona, within its historical, cultural and political context. \\n\\nThe research addresses various aspects of design during the period, from professional practice, to manufacturing, retail, mediation, consumption and use. In particular, it focuses on the creation of new design-led urban spaces. The process of urban regeneration, and its mediation through institutional and private channels, will be explored to assess the impact of design in the public sphere during the period under study.\\n\\nBetween 1992 and 2004, Barcelona has established itself on the global cultural map as a city with a high symbolic capital. This international reputation is primarily supported by the city's prestige in relation to design and architecture. This project seeks to explore the specific ways in which this has been established, and to assess to what degree that process has had a real impact on design and architectural practice at a local level. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000924/1","grantId":"AH/E000924/1","fundValue":"11914","fundStart":"2006-09-04","fundEnd":"2007-01-03","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Viviana  Narotzky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal College of Art","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
