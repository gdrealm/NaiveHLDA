The need to produce recombinant correctly-folded disulphide-bonded proteins is significant and PDI remains a target of immense interest for further improving the host's capacity to produce such proteins in high yield and high fidelity. Our work contributes to a large and active field that will eventually identify methods by which cells can be 'tuned' by engineering for the expressions needs of a particular target protein. The cellular machinery for protein folding is large and complex and a significant amount of investment has been made by industry and government to better understand the process. The ability to increase the yield of recombinant protein production will ultimately benefit the economic competitiveness of the UK.

PDI is a crucial component of the machinery that enables secreted proteins (such as antibodies, hormones and growth factors, blood-clotting proteins and digestive enzymes) to fold into their correct shape prior to being secreted from the cell. All these proteins contain a specific cross-link (the disulphide bond) which stabilizes their structure and a crucial aspect of their folding is the rapid formation of the correct set of disulphide cross-links. This process is catalysed and facilitated by PDI and the aim of our project was to understand in molecular detail how PDI does this. \n\nWe previously identified one region of PDI (the b' domain) as the region that binds partly-folded proteins (its 'substrates'), and in this project we extended our understanding by: \ni) determining the structure of this b' domain in atomic detail ('solving the structure'), \nii) establishing which surface of the b' domain was directly involved in binding to its target partly folded molecules ('mapping the substrate binding site'), and \niii) showing that a neighbouring region of PDI known as the x-linker, can also bind to the binding site on b', and that this provides a removable 'cap' over the binding site so that it is not usually exposed; a substrate molecule can displace the 'cap' and thus gain access to the binding site. This is a key element in understanding how PDI works. \n\nWe have also begun to study how PDI binds its substrates in even greater detail. We have shown differences in how unfolded, partly-folded and folded proteins interact with PDI and we have studied how PDI associates with partner proteins in the cell. We have studied the dynamics of PDI to show that the binding-site has intrinsic flexibility, not found in other parts of the molecule, which may enable the site to adapt itself to 'fit' many different partly-folded protein substrates. We have also probed the overall mobility and flexibility of PDI, showing that this reflects the movement of part of the x-linker into and out of the binding site on b'.\n\nWe have also started to study the structure and activities of other cellular proteins closely related to PDI. The work was primarily directed towards enhancing fundamental knowledge. The primary users of the findings will therefore be other researchers. PDI is widely cited throughout the biotechnological, biomedical and agri-food literature, hence the findings of this work are of interest to a wide range of scientists.\n\nThe commercial value of recombinant disulphide bonded proteins is now very significant. There is a substantial market in protein therapeutics and the great majority of these agents are disulphide-bonded human proteins. Recombinant products can be generated in a wide range of systems (E.coli, yeast and other fungi, insect cells and mammalian cells), but the yield of correctly folded and correctly-disulphide-bonded product is a critical issue in all. It is in this area of recombinant protein production that we expect our findings to have the greatest impact. \n\nAn important finding in our work was the 'capped' and 'uncapped' conformers of the b' domain of PDI. This reversible 'capping' of the primary substrate binding has the potential to play a key regulatory role in the function of PDI. These findings will be used in future work that looks at the dynamics of PDI interactions with substrates and partner proteins to gain a more complete understanding of how PDI operates as a molecular machine.
