{"id":"9CF5E593-D068-4924-B7D2-5674CC1EE65C","title":"Intelligent Coatings for Energy-Efficient Glazing (ICE Glazing)","abstractText":"We will form a collaboration between leading UK and China universities to investigate and optimise synthesis methods for energy efficient intelligent window coatings. These coatings actively change their properties to let the optimum amount of light and heat into a building, dramatically reducing the energy required for heating and cooling. Heating and cooling buildings can use a large proportion (&gt;30%) of a nation's energy requirements, so improvements in this area offer real benefits, and will assist meeting national and international carbon emission targets. \n\nWe will deposit vanadium dioxide films using a variety of industrially scalable techniques, and characterise the films with state of the art apparatus. We will undertake quantitative energy efficiency modelling to accurately predict the energy saving that might be expected when these materials are used in real buildings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M003353/1","grantId":"EP/M003353/1","fundValue":"435724","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gopinathan  Sankar","coPersons":["Robert Geoffrey Palgrave","Ivan Paul Parkin","Zheng Xiao  Guo"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
