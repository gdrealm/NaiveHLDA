Such dynamics include the co-evolution of actors vis a vis each other, a concept which is central to complexity theory. </p> \n<p>The in-depth analysis of actor relationships with the case study company is likely to highlight hitherto undiscovered dynamics and inform investors and policy makers as to whether current corporate governance mechanisms and legal frameworks are adequate and if not, how they may be re-shaped or adjusted.&nbsp;In so doing, research questions may also be framed as to whether an appropriate position can be reached given the traditional regulatory rationales, and any new actor relationship dynamics with the corporation discovered using complexity theory.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018238/1","grantId":"ES/E018238/1","fundValue":"79109","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christine  Mallin","coPersons":["Marc  Goergen","Hse-Yu Iris Chiu","E  Mitleton- Kelly","Ahmed Mohammad Al-Hawamdeh"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
