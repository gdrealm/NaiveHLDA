All data relating to biblical texts in Greek used by Jews in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages d the early modern period will be collected and analysed to establish the underlying history. Such a project has never been undertaken before, and many of the materials are previously unpublished.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119269/1","grantId":"119269/1","fundValue":"343174","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  De Lange","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" While it is recognised that the books of the Hebrew Bible were originally translated into Greek in Greco-Roman antiquity by Jews for Jews, it is generally supposed that at some early point Jews gave up using the translations, along with the use of the Greek language generally, and they were preserved and used only in the Christian Church. All current introductions to the Greek Bible are written within this framework and focus on the transmission within the Christian Church.\n\n\n\nHowever, materials have come to light, some very recently, that make it plain that some Jews continued to use the Greek language throughout the Middle Ages, and that, while the Hebrew Bible played a central part in their religious and cultural life, they also knew the biblical books in Greek.\n\n\n\nWe have made these texts available to scholars and others online, in searchable form, together with the information that is necessary for an appreciation of their historical background, meaning and exegetical implications, and relationship with other translations, as well as their wider place in the history of Jewish religious culture. \n\n\n\nWe have also organised the first international colloquium dedicated to this subject, as well as several smaller symposia, and have published the papers presented, and we have published a number of comprehensive essays and specialised studies on this subject. Since the texts themselves are in Greek they are relatively inaccessible to the wider public. However, we have included in our publications a number of general essays explaining the nature of the texts and the contribution they make to various areas of general interest, notably the history of the Bible and the history of Jewish culture.
