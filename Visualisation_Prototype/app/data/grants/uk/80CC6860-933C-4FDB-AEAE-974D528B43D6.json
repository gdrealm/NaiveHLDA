They are an important but neglected source for our understanding of the culture and learning of early medieval Ireland. They are not just word for word dictionaries but rather they represent an encyclopaedic compilation of material deriving not only from Irish sources but also from Continental sources, and their interest lies both in their content (some of which has not been preserved elsewhere) and in their modes of analysis of the headwords.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119226/1","grantId":"119226/1","fundValue":"259709","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Russell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
