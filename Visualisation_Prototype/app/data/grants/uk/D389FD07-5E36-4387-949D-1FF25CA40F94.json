The latter can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a safe, non-invasive window into the brain that measures which parts of the brain are activated when someone is doing a cognitive test. \nIn this study we plan to investigate 1) the brain activation of normal children and adults when they perform tests in which psychiatric patients are impaired at, to understand normal brain development of these abilities 2) to what extent children with Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with Conduct disorder (CD) and with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differ from normal children in their brain activity 3) to what extent these 3 different childhood disorders differ from each other in their brain activity. \nThis study will help to find biological markers that distinguish these disorders from control children and, most importantly, that distinguish them between each other. This will be an important new and objective way to tease apart the different childhood disorders. Understanding of the specific brain abnormalities of these psychiatric disorders will be crucial for a more objective diagnosis and is important to develop more targeted future treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300155","grantId":"G0300155","fundValue":"233878","fundStart":"2005-11-07","fundEnd":"2008-11-06","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Katya  Rubia","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
