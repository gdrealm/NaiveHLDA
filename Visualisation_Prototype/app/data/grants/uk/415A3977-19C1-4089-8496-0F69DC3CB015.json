Pulmonary anthrax results from inhalation of airborne spores and is highly fatal. Anthrax acts by releasing two toxins into the body that are transported into cells by a third protein. These toxins, called lethal factor and edema factor, cause cell death and when present at high levels are fatal. The disease is without symptoms for several weeks, progressing to mild fever, aches and cough. As bacteria reach high levels in the circulation, the disease progresses rapidly, causing respiratory disease, shock and widespread haemorage. Death usually occurs within 24 hours and antibiotics are without benefit at this point due to the accumulation of the bacterial toxins.\nOur research aims to develop a new line of compounds for use in anthrax infection. These compounds will act by preventing the anthrax toxins being transported into human cells. This is achieved by targeting the assembly of a key anthrax protein complex, which forms pores in the cell membrane allowing toxin entry.\nThe compounds developed in this project will prevent cellular entry of anthrax toxins, therefore allowing anthrax infections to become treatable by a combination of therapy approach with antibiotics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800185","grantId":"G0800185","fundValue":"321066","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2012-07-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ali  Tavassoli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
