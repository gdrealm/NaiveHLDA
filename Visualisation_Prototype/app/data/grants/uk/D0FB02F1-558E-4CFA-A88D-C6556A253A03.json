{"id":"D0FB02F1-558E-4CFA-A88D-C6556A253A03","title":"An integrated approach to the cost effective production of biodiesel from photosynthetic microbes","abstractText":"Development of Renewable Fuels is an important consideration in terms of replacing fossil fuels, such as mineral oils and coals, as well as reducing the level of CO2 emissions associated with them. In this project we will develop two micro-algae to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it using sunlight into raw material for biodiesel production. The main obstacles which have to be overcome are to develop strains of algae which can grow at high temperature [as flue gasses are going to be used as the source of CO2] as well as efficiently converting the CO2 into carbon compounds which can be used as raw materials for Biodiesel production. The work is being undertaken with a major Biofuels manufacturer and the knowledge gained should advance us both scientifically and industrially.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014241/1","grantId":"BB/H014241/1","fundValue":"844536","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Antoni Ryszard Slabas","coPersons":["Josiah William Simon"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
