Competition to produce such products as cheaply as possible means that the costs of the specialist chemicals added to fermenters to switch on production need to be controlled. The mupIRX gene system in Pseudomonas fluorescens regulates genes encoding the Mupirocin biosynthetic pathway, allows switch on of gene expression by an internal signal that accumulates as the bacteria grow and has already been manipulated to yield benefits for antibiotic production. We will define the elements of this control system to allow us to construct systems to put the production of other high value products under the control of this system. The innovation is in exploiting the native control system in an established and proven industrial host strain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028739/1","grantId":"BB/M028739/1","fundValue":"841021","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2018-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
