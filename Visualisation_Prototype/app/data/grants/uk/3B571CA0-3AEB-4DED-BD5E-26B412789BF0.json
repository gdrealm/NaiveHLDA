{"id":"3B571CA0-3AEB-4DED-BD5E-26B412789BF0","title":"TEDDINET: network of (Build)TEDDI projects","abstractText":"Reducing (and shifting) energy demand is a vital component to more sustainable energy use. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are a key enabling factor to improved demand management, opening (in principle at least) the road not only to smart meters and smart grids, but also to smart citizens who are more aware of their energy use and are acting on that information to reduce energy bills and energy wastage in their daily life.\n\nThe Research Councils UK, through their Digital Economy and Energy programmes, are supporting a very substantial amount of research on the impacts of digital innovation on energy demand reduction in all aspects of life. In total &pound;22 million has been committed to 22 interdisciplinary research projects under two related calls; 'Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation' (TEDDI, 2009) and 'Transforming Energy Demand in Buildings through Digital Innovation' (BuildTEDDI, 2011). No fewer than 29 universities and over 70 high-profile commercial and government organisations are involved in the (Build)TEDDI programme. Across such a large programme there are many potential opportunities for collaboration, including knowledge sharing, pooling of resources, collaborative data mining etc. But with each project team needing to focus on the delivery of their own research objectives, there is little time and breathing space to explore, build and maintain collaborations across the 21 projects. \n\nWe are asking for resources to create a network for all the (build)TEDDI projects to ensure that all opportunities for collaboration are identified and utilised. Over a 4 year period we propose a range of activities to improve communication and knowledge exchange between research and stakeholder communities (industry sectors and policy makers), to build a strong and cohesive research community and maximise academic collaboration between the 22 (build)TEDDI projects for improved project outputs and increased research impacts. \n\nWe have deeloped plans for a total of 14 different types of activities, including engagement with relevant industry sectors to ensure that research findings, experiments and experiences are stimulating innovations and industrial development; stronger and more sustained debate with policy makers to improve the provision of evidence for policy; a 'single shop front' to present all (Build)TEDDI projects and their outputs to date; a pooling of research data and academic publications; systematic and comprehensive dissemination programme of project findings to targeted audiences and stakeholders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L013681/1","grantId":"EP/L013681/1","fundValue":"559981","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dan  Van Der Horst","coPersons":["Janette  Webb","Johanna  Moore","Gareth Paul Harrison","Steven Kevin Firth","Heather Caroline Lovell","Richard Andrew Buswell","Tarek M Hassan","Nigel  Goddard"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
