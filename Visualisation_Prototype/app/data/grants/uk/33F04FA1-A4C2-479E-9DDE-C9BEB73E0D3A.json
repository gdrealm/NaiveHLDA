{"id":"33F04FA1-A4C2-479E-9DDE-C9BEB73E0D3A","title":"Life-course determinants of osteoporotic fracture","abstractText":"Osteoporosis is a major public health problem through its association with fractures of the hip, spine and wrist. Although we know that a number of factors in later life influence the rate of bone loss, little is known of the way in which an individual s genetic make-up is modified by their environment during intrauterine and early postnatal life, to establish the peak bone mass that they reach in young adulthood. The studies proposed in this application will demonstrate the means whereby maternal lifestyle (smoking, nutrition, and physical activity) influence skeletal growth through modification of the expression of certain genes. This information is invaluable for two reasons: first, it enables us to modify maternal lifestyle to improve bone health in the offspring and thereby prevent osteoporotic fractures in future generations. In addition, it might permit the targeting of individuals who would benefit from measurement of bone density and pharmacological intervention, at a time when no mass screening programme for osteoporosis can be recommended.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400491","grantId":"G0400491","fundValue":"1886720","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Cyrus  Cooper","coPersons":["Elaine Margaret Dennison","Avan  Aihie Sayer"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
