A common surgical procedure is laparotomy; an incision whereby the skin and underlying muscles are cut so the organs inside the abdomen are exposed. Scientists have a duty to ensure that after the animals experience little or no pain after they recover from anaesthesia. Because the animals cannot tell us how they feel, however, it is difficult to gauge how painful this is. Scientific research has shown that there are some behaviours that are particularly important for determining how much pain laparotomy surgery causes in rats, because they increase as a result of surgery, but can be reduced if pain relieving drugs (analgesics) are provided (usually injected prior to surgery). This research has shown that different analgesics have different abilities to reduce pain, depending on how much drug the rats are given, and on whether the important (pain-related) behaviours disappear completely or only partially. One major problem, however, is that the researchers are still unsure whether the treatments they use are the most effective, because regardless of the analgesic given to the rats, some subtle behaviour changes usually remain. It is therefore unclear whether the continued presence of these abnormal activities means the rats are still experiencing pain, and so, how effective the analgesic that was given had been. One way to try to fully understand what the rats are experiencing is to give them the opportunity to tell us how they feel, but as they cannot communicate with us, this can only be done indirectly. If the rats are experiencing pain after surgery, then, if given the chance, they should choose to take (self-administer) analgesics to reduce it. The amount of analgesic they choose to self-administer could then be used as an estimate of how much pain was caused by surgery. An essential step in testing this theory, however, is to ensure that the rats know that obtaining the drugs will provide pain relief. Because of this, they will first be trained that poking their nose into a hole in a test chamber will painlessly trigger an injection of a strong pain killer (remifentanil). Once they know this, they should increase the number of times they nose-poke according to how much pain they are experiencing. A very useful aspect of this experiment is that it can also be used to test the pain-relieving properties of other analgesic drugs. The rats will be provided with one of the drugs that, according to the results of behavioural investigations, should be effective for relieving the pain caused by surgery. One such drug is called meloxicam, and another is carprofen. If either of these is given prior to surgery, and the dose given completely eliminates pain, then the rats should not choose to self-administer additional remifentanil when they recover from anaesthesia. Is this occurs, then it will be very good evidence that pain was the reason the rats needed remifentanil. Another way to confirm this is to show that the rats will also consume more remifentanil if the type of surgery causes more pain. The rats will undergo 4 different procedures that will cause different amounts of pain, but none will be highly painful. If the rats continue take more remifentanil even after they have been given meloxicam or carprofen then this will mean that the dose of meloxicam or carprofen was not sufficient, and more was needed. Testing how much remifentanil the rats need over several days following surgery will produce the best possible information on how much pain is caused, how long it lasts and what dose of analgesic is best to prevent it in future. This information would be useful to other researchers who need to conduct laparotomy and other types of surgery as part of their research, and so help to improve the welfare of all rats undergoing surgery in scientific research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015631/1","grantId":"BB/F015631/1","fundValue":"345656","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We now have a greater understanding of many pitfalls arising as a consequence of attempting to train rats to perform an operant task using an opioid as the reinforcer. Provision of the opioid reminfentanil was supposed to enable behavioural responding such that rats would self-medicate if experiencing pain. The major problem was that they became less, and not as originally hypothesised, more willing to respond by increasing their rate of drug consumption once in a painful state. The long exposure to opioids for training purposes also had other detrimental consequences. One of these was that the rats probably became more susceptible to pain during testing due to the development of a drug-induced hyperalgesic state. Due to this we devised an alternative method or training using amphetamine as the reinforcer. This, however, also had confounding effects by causing the animals to become hyperactive. These findings are directing us towards trying to develop a training method that completely avoids the need to use drugs during training by using intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS). The scientific benefits of this could be considerable, but discovering that the welfare of the animals is adversely affected by using opioids is equally if not more important. Avoiding use of these drugs is advisable. These findings have been widely disseminated via invited lectures to colleagues engaged in similar studies, but taken alone, are not well suited to the usual route of publication by peer review. We nevertheless are still attempting to do so.

How much is consumed gives an indication of how severely the patient's pain is. However, as they can't speak, little is known about how severely rats experience pain following common laboratory procedure such as surgery. We planned to use drug self-administration to measure how severe their pain might be. This would be measured by determining how much drug they need following surgery or application of another unpleasant (noxious or painful) stimulus. They were initially trained to obtain the drug by pressing a lever that would activate a pump and deliver the drug directly into their bloodstream. This training in normal rats required several weeks longer than anticipated. During this they injected themselves with large quantities of the drug, however, once exposed to surgery, unlike in humans, their drug intake dropped rather than increased. As we were able to partially prevent this drop in intake using another painkiller we showed that the rats probably do experience pain, and may even be one similar to how humans perceive it. However, it was important to determine why their intake initially reduced rather than increased when they may have been experiencing pain. Eventually we found that this was because the numerous injections they received during training probably caused them to enter a state where they become more sensitised to pain; called hyperalgesia. That meant that following surgery, exposure to the morphine-like drug probably intensified their pain rather than prevented it. The consequence of this was that we chose an alternative method of training using a drug that would not sensitise the rats to pain. These results show that it is probably not advisable for scientists to expose animals to morphine-like substances for long periods, in other words, we helped refine the methods used for research of a similar type in future. We then used a new method of testing called conditional drug discrimination. The basis of this was that rats would be required to press a lever if they were in pain, or another if they were not, in order to receive a food reward. We tried to control the state they were in (i.e. painful or not) by injecting them with morphine or only a placebo (saline). This allowed us to establish more about whether rats can experience pain. It was more successful than the self-administration method because the time needed for training was much shorter. We were able to determine that the rats were aware of pain, but we could not tell how severe it may have been. This knowledge was nevertheless important, and led the research into a new direction that we are currently exploring. The findings made on the project showed that we needed to find training methods that do not involve any drug exposures prior to pain testing. The findings are therefore just as important for other researchers that might attempt a similar approach to pain assessment. One possibility is to train the animals to lever press to obtain pleasurable brain stimulation, which should also change in response to pain. We hope to begin preliminary work on the new approach very soon. If this were successful it should be possible to learn a lot more about how severely laboratory rodents experience pain and what scientists need to do (i.e. what drugs to give) to prevent it.
