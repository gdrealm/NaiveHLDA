The equipment was purchased as proposed and forms part of a multi-user, multi-instrument facility. (See http://www.york.ac.uk/biology/technology-facility/imaging-cytometry/ic-equipment/ic-flow-cytometry/) Cell cycle characteristics of Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus have been published and provide insight into the proliferation of methanogenic archaea.
