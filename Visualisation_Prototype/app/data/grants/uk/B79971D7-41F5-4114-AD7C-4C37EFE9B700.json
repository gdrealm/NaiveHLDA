Nearly half these deaths are premature. Worse still, premature CHD is THREE times more common in deprived communities, making CHD an important cause of health inequalities.\n\nThe good news is that firstly, 90% of premature CHD is PREVENTABLE. Secondly, CHD death rates in Britain have halved in the last two decades. But why has this decline happened, and can things improve further?\n\nWe have investigated this important subject using a computer-based statistical model called IMPACT. We found that about 40% of the recent fall in CHD deaths was due to medical treatments and about 60% to people stopping smoking and eating healthier food.\n\nOur IMPACT model has now helped to explain CHD trends in a variety of populations including England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Finland, New Zealand, and China.\n\nIMPACT is the only CHD policy model that has been convincingly calibrated for the UK population of 60 million. It is comprehensive, covering all the important groups of CHD patients, all the standard treatments and all the major risk factors such as smoking, exercise and obesity. Our results have been reassuringly consistent with other studies in different countries.\n\nHowever, our current model is complicated to use. It is only appreciated by a small number of researchers. The people making decisions in the NHS and in the Department of Health would obviously like a more ?user friendly? version of the model. \n\nWe are therefore requesting funding to work with decision-makers at national and local levels; obtain their views and suggestions, discover how they interact with the model, revise the model, then let them test it out again, before making further improvements. \n\nThis new, improved IMPACT model would be more efficient and user friendly; a decision support system to help answer different questions about reducing heart disease. For instance, deciding which future health programmes are likely to be most successful (and best value for money). For instance, comparing the advantages and costs of new treatments (like defibrillators) and new ideas for prevention (like smoke free restaurants or healthier school meals).\n\nCreating a web-based version of the improved model would then enable us to share it with people trying to control epidemics of heart disease in other countries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500920","grantId":"G0500920","fundValue":"404953","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Capewell","coPersons":["Michael  Robinson","Richard  Heller","Dogan  Fidan","Belgin  Unal","Richard William Morris","Iain Edward Buchan","Colin  Sanderson","Kathleen  Bennett","Ffion  Lloyd-Williams","James  Rafferty","Peter  Whincup"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
