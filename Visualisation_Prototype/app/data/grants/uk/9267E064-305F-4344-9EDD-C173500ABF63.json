{"id":"9267E064-305F-4344-9EDD-C173500ABF63","title":"Making Sense of Fusion: Learning and Reasoning About an Energy Technology","abstractText":"The need to develop practical ways to address human-generated climate change has brought a new urgency in the search for sustainable sources of energy. Among the possible options, fusion (the form of nuclear reaction that powers the sun) has long been recognised as a potential source of safe, sustainable, and effectively limitless power. As the international demonstration fusion reactor (ITER) approaches completion, the fusion R&amp;D community has become more aware of the need to engage with societal awareness of its activities. This project will adopt a group-based methodology to investigate the various modes of practical reasoning employed by lay people in seeking to understand fusion power. The work will examine the character of interpretative resources used in such reasoning, including possible associations with the nuclear fission programme. It will also consider the ways in which the material nature of fusion technology serves to shape plausible patterns of understanding. The project will be carried out in collaboration with CIEMAT (National Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology), a Spanish Government Agency, which will make possible a comparative cross-cultural analysis of British and Spanish data. The project will also provide an opportunity for groups of lay citizens to ‘have their say’ about fusion and related matters concerning possible energy futures.\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F033222/1","grantId":"ES/F033222/1","fundValue":"78536","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  HorlickJones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
