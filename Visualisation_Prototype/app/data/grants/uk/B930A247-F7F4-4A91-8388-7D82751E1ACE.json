It is anticpated that this will give a greater understanding of how constraint influences functional properties in ferroelectric and dielectric thin layers. The proposal will concentrate on three key systems in which tilt transitions are known to influence macroscopic properties; PbZrxTi(1-x)O3, Ag(Nb,Ta)O3 and the newly discovered (1-x)BiMeO3-xPbTiO3 solid solutions. The proposal is joint between University of Sheffield, Pennsylvania State University and Argonne National Laboratory. The latter will submit an independent National Science Foundation proposal which directly compliments the work proposed here. The programme is for 4 years at the request of the National Science Foundation, USA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D067049/1","grantId":"EP/D067049/1","fundValue":"364633","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2011-03-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this project have been presented at a number of major international conferences and have been the subject of a number of key refereed articles in major international journals. The critical results illustrated the manner in which tilt transitions in perovskite thin films can be affected by strain. A new theory of tilt transition behaviour was proposed as a result of this work which demonstrated that the onset temperature of the tilt transition in the PZT phase diagram is in fact the point that the tilting locks into the pre-existing ferroelectric domain structure.

The main fundamental findings were:\n\n1) In relaxed PZT films, the region above the nominal octahedral transition temperature was composed of short range ordered rather than zero amplitude tilting. This has led to a radical rethink of the nature of octahedral tilt transitions in perovskites, a m No direct non academic impact but strained PZT films may be used in commercial applications in the future and this work has aided in their potential development.
