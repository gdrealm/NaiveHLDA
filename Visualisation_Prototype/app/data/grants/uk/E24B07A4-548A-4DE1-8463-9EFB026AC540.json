{"id":"E24B07A4-548A-4DE1-8463-9EFB026AC540","title":"EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative Medicine","abstractText":"Regenerative medicine (RM) is a convergence of conventional pharmaceutical sciences, medical devices and surgical intervention employing novel cell and biomaterial based therapies. RM products replace or regenerate damaged or defective tissues such as skin, bone, and even more complex organs, to restore or establish normal function. They can also be used to improve drug testing and disease modelling. RM is an emerging industry with a unique opportunity to contribute to the health and wealth of the UK. It is a high value science-based manufacturing industry whose products will reduce the economic and social impact of an aging population and increasing chronic disease.The clinical and product opportunities for RM have become clear and a broad portfolio of products have now entered the translational pipeline from the science bench to commercialisation and clinical application. The primary current focus for firms introducing these products is first in man studies; however, success at this stage is followed by a requirement for a rapid expansion of delivery capability - the 'one-to-many' translation process. This demands increasing attention to regulatory pathways, product reimbursement and refinement of the business model, a point emphasised by recent regulatory decisions demanding more clarity in the criteria that define product performance, and regulator initiatives to improve control of manufacturing quality. The IMRC will reduce the attrition of businesses at this critical point in product development through an industry facing portfolio of business driven research activities focussed on these translational challenges. The IMRC will consist of a platform activity and two related research themes. The platform activity will incorporate studies designed to influence public policy, regulation and the value system; to explore highly speculative and high value ideas (particularly clinically driven studies); and manufacturing-led feasibility and pilot studies using state of the art production platforms and control. The research themes will focus on areas identified as particular bottlenecks in RM product translation. The first theme will explore the delivery, manufacturing and supply processes i.e. the end to end production of an RM product. Specifically this theme will explore using novel pharmaceutical technology to control the packaged environment of a living RM product during shipping, and the design of a modular solution for manufacturing different cell based therapies to the required quality in a clinical setting. The second research theme will apply quality by design methods to characterise the quality of highly complex RM products incorporating cells and carrier materials. In particular it will consider optical methods for non-invasive process and product quality control and physicochemical methods for process monitoring.The IMRC will be proactively managed under the direction of a Board and Liaison Group consisting of leading industrialists to ensure that the Centre delivers maximum value to the requirements of the business model and assisting the growth of this emerging industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H028277/1","grantId":"EP/H028277/1","fundValue":"5847890","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Centre's impact on Industry\n\nQuotes from Collaborators giving examples of the Centre's impact on Industry.\n\nThe Centre has made significant impact within the Regenerative Medicine Industrial community as evidenced by the following quotes:\n\n\n\nFrom Dr Amr Abid, Head of Strategic Growth &amp;amp; Development, Life Sciences, GE Healthcare:\n\nGE Healthcare Life Sciences had the opportunity to experience first-hand the uniqueness of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative Medicine at Loughborough University by working on industrial process development for our human cardiomyocytes differentiation from human stem cells.

Its role is to define, deliver and disseminate world-leading, high impact, fundamental and translational manufacturing research building upon its original funding from the EPSRC. Significant additional funding (approximately nine times the original grant received) has been secured from diverse sources. EPSRC Centre members participate significantly in hubs and projects funded by the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform. The recent re-funding of our Centre for Doctoral Training by both EPSRC and the MRC sustains our training pipeline for over 100 PhD students. The EPSRC Centre continues to evolve, reflecting the dynamic nature of investments in the regenerative medicine innovation system, and further alignment with emerging national priorities will be possible next year. The summer has seen a change of Director from David Williams to Nick Medcalf in order to prepare the EPSRC Centre for its next phase of work with industry. Also this year the host department of the EPSRC Centre at Loughborough University, the Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, has also been awarded a 2013 Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education, recognising its impact through research and skills development in high value manufacturing to create economic growth.\nEngagement goes from strength to strength through the development of new consortia-led projects, the promotion of the UK academic community in Europe and the communication of regenerative medicine science and engineering to school-age learners and their teachers. The wider EPSRC Centre has a focus on people development through EPSRC-funded Early Career, Career Acceleration and Manufacturing Fellowships. Support for early career researchers is provided through fellowships from a variety of funders, including the EPSRC-funded Engineering, Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (ETERM) Fellowship Programme and host university programmes.\nCurrent research funded by the EPSRC Centre is focused on our cross-institution challenge project where key manufacturing technology themes are integrated using a framework based on regulatory science to facilitate translation. We are now working actively with the Cell Therapy Catapult on industry projects and partnering strategically on research and translational projects - we look forward to working with the new Cell Therapy Manufacturing Centre. Work on policy and standards and to inform regulation continues with contributions to the work of the Department of Health Regenerative Medicine Expert Group and international standards groups.\nNick Medcalf becomes Director at a time when there is much to do to prepare the EPSRC Centre for the next phase of its development. Regenerative medicine manufacturing remains a key focus nationally and internationally. We are planning for success against this opportunity-rich background. We seek the ongoing support of community members, as both advocates for the importance of EPSRC funding for manufacturing research and in particular as collaborators in research that enables the new industry of regenerative medicine to grow and deliver increasing healthcare benefits. Without a thorough understanding of how to make regenerative medicines safely, economically and in sufficient quantity, these therapies will never reach their full potential.
