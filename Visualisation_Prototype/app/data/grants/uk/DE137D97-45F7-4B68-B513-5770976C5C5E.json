This is both surprising and problematic given that they impact directly on a wide range of environmental, social and economic issues (e.g. flooding, bank erosion, loss of land and infrastructure collapse) and ultimately create deposits that host some of the World's most lucrative mineral and fossil fuel reserves. Present understanding of large rivers is based almost entirely upon the findings of studies conducted in small channels. However, recent research gives us good reason to expect that transferring this knowledge to large rivers may not be straight-forward. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an improved quantitative understanding of the interactions between river processes, channel morphology and subsurface sedimentology in the World's largest rivers. Addressing this knowledge gap represents a significant challenge because it involves developing methods that can be used to investigate process-product relationships that operate across a wide range of time and space scales (from decimetres/minutes up to kilometres/millennia). This research will bring together a multi-disciplinary team of leading UK and overseas researchers in order to achieve this goal. In this project we will investigate one of the World's largest rivers, the Paran&aacute;-Paraguay in Argentina to understand: (1) what controls water and sediment movement and river channel changes over time; and (2) what this means for the formation and preservation of river sedimentary deposits. We will address these issues by implementing a research strategy that involves three key elements. First, we will use state-of-the-art field instrumentation to map river bed morphology and its evolution through time, and measure the three-dimensional patterns of ater and sediment movement around and over channel bars. Second, we will take advantage of recent developments in Ground Penetrating Radar technology to map the three-dimensional sedimentary structure of braid-bar deposits, both within the current river and in formerly active areas that have been abandoned over the past few thousand years. Third, we will develop new numerical modelling approaches to investigate and quantify the interactions between water and sediment transport processes, bar formation, evolution of channel morphology and the subsurface sedimentology of deposits. The latter will involve combining, for the first time, Computational Fluid Dynamics models that provide a sophisticated representation of the physics governing water and sediment movement, with innovative Reduced-Complexity models capable of simulating how these processes interact to determine channel evolution and deposit sedimentology over periods of centuries to millennia. The result of this work will be the World's first comprehensive database on how the morphology of a large river changes through time, obtained concurrently with data on what drives those changes and what this means for the formation of sedimentary deposits. This will allow us to develop new models of how these rivers work and to use these models to address practical questions concerning large river resources and their management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E016022/1","grantId":"NE/E016022/1","fundValue":"226598","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Philip John Ashworth","coPersons":["Daniel Roy Parsons"],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":" 1. (i) planform morphology of large rivers are often dominated by sinuous, km-wide, thalwegs; (ii) the thalweg controls the direction of primary flow with only localized, curvature-driven, secondary flow circulation – unlike many smaller rivers; (iii) stable vegetated bars are constructed by the accretion of mobile compound bars onto older immobile/eroded forms – but mobile sand bars are rare, unlike in many smaller braided rivers.\n\n\n\n2. Large rivers have four principal facies. Key results include: (i) large bars in sandy bed material commonly comprise thick (up to 12 m) cross-sets (up to 72%) with reactivation surfaces caused by episodic accretion – though their locations are spatially limited; (ii) when finer sediment enters the Paran&aacute; (from the Paraguay tributary), up to 40% of the deposits comprise small-scale ripple cross-sets – &amp; thus, large river deposits are not necessarily made up of large-scale structures.\n\n\n\n3. A 10 km reach of the Upper Paran&aacute; was modelled using modified Phoenics CFD code with a grid spacing of 15 m &amp; 1 m in the horizontal &amp; vertical respectively. This model was used to investigate whether in large rivers a roughness-length parameterization is necessary to represent the effects of unmeasured bedform roughness such as dunes. Key results include: (i) CFD predictions were found to be sensitive to roughness-length specification - upscaling roughness length was not found to be an effective means of optimizing the agreement between model and field data; (ii) changes in roughness length have a major impact upon flow routing at the channel-scale; (iii) there is a poor equivalence between the roughness lengths needed in 2D and 3D models, especially in deeper areas of the river; &amp; (iv) applications of both 2D &amp; 3D hydraulic models need to explore roughness-length sensitivity as part of a wider analysis of model uncertainty.\n\n\n\n4.Two new models were developed for simulating flow, morphodynamics &amp; sedimentology in large sand-bed rivers: i) a reduced-complexity (RC) approach based on highly simplified abstractions of the governing process equations, &amp; ii) a physically-based (PB) approach underpinned by the shallow water form of the Navier-Stokes equations. Both models were applied to simulate hydrodynamics within a 38-km reach of the Rio Paran&aacute; &amp; evaluated both against each other &amp; our field flow datasets. These RC &amp; PB models were then used to simulate bar dynamics, channel evolution &amp; sedimentology in a range of settings, including laboratory channels, selected reaches of the Rio Paran&aacute; &amp; in numerical experiments designed to elucidate the generic behaviour of such large rivers. Key results include: (i) the RC model produces grid-independent results (unlike previous RC river models); (ii) the RC model shows strong agreement with hydrodynamic datasets for the Paran&aacute;, showing the dominant role of macro-scale bed topography in controlling flow steering; (iii) compared to the RC model, the PB model yields improved predictions of flow hydrodynamics &amp; both static &amp; dynamic bar characteristics; (iv) parallelisation of the PB code &amp; implementation using high performance computing has meant that it can simulate channel evolution over periods of up to 1000 years for reach lengths of c. 100 km.
