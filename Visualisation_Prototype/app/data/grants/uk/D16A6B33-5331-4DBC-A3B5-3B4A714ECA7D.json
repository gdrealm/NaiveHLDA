As a result these cells and viruses contain many proteins and chemicals which are not found in land-based plants, animals, and bacteria. Scientists at Plymouth Marine Laboratory have become experts at finding and growing both bacteria and viruses from the sea. Working with U.K.-based companies Ingenza and Aquapharm Biosciences we plan to use these skills to look for bacteria and viruses which produce particular enzymes which could be used to make new chemicals and medicines which are not normally found in nature. The enzymes could also be used to make existing chemicals in new ways which would be more efficient and less polluting to the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E011047/1","grantId":"DT/E011047/1","fundValue":"261696","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A NERC Follow-on fund grant was successfully secured to screen for further biocatalysts and a number of new colorimetric screens developed.

This enzyme can be used to make chemically pure amino acids which display only one defined structure and is of value to the pharmaceutical industry. We discovered that these enzymes are very common in the marine environment. We have used the basis of the original project to do much wider screening of marine bacteria for a range of industrially-relevant activities.
