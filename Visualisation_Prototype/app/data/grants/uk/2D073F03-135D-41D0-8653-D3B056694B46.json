Co-production is now also perceived as a solution to an argued 'relevance gap' in research and to the demands of 'impact'. Co-production in research aims to put principles of empowerment into practice, working 'with' communities and offering communities greater control over the research process and providing opportunities to learn and reflect from their experience. Advocates for co-production argue that research is enhanced through including 'experiential expertise' (Collins and Evans 2007) which may highlight relevant questions otherwise neglected by 'experts' (Fischer 2000). Co-production can enhance the effectiveness of research by making it better informed by communities' preferences and needs, with communities then contributing to improved outcomes and achievable solutions (Ostrom 1996). This review takes a cross-cutting perspective, aiming to advance the theory and practice of co-production in research with communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J500646/1","grantId":"AH/J500646/1","fundValue":"32381","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings of the research have been used in a variety of ways and by different groups.In academic terms, the findings have contributed to an inter-disciplinary debate on the purpose of research and research practice.

At the same time, academic research is increasingly being measured according to its benefit to society. Co-production of research is often identified as a means of addressing these concerns. Co-production involved working with communities, recognising the value of their expertise and experiences and offering them greater control over the research process. \nThis scoping study explored what doing research in co-production would mean in practice. We explored both the principles and values which may underpin co-production with communities and some of the practical approaches and methods which may be used. Our findings may be used to: \n- Innovate or challenge existing research practice\n- Support experimentation in research methods and approaches\n- Inform new ways of working with and engaging citizens and communities Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
