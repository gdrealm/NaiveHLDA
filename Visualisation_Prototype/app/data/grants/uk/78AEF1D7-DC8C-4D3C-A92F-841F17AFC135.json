Cold homes are thought to have a dramatic impact on the population in terms of deaths due to strokes and heart attaches and respiratory conditions, especially for the elderly.</p>\n\n<p>This project is concerned with quantifying these effects and estimating how they are changed by weather, winter fuel payments to the elderly and fuel prices. The research will examine a variety of datasets but will focus on 1 per cent of the population who can be followed through successive censuses in Scotland and England where we can match their dates of and places of death to weather patterns. There have been sharp decreases and then increases in fuel prices over the period. And there have been changes in the amounts of winter fuel payment and eligibility criteria. Thus we aim to capture the effects of local weather conditions on mortality and show how fuel prices and income variation plays into this. Ultimately we hope to link the statistical modelling to weather forecasts to produce traffic light warnings.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004298/1","grantId":"ES/K004298/1","fundValue":"157300","fundStart":"2012-10-15","fundEnd":"2014-04-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Walker","coPersons":["Maria  Navarro Paniagua"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
