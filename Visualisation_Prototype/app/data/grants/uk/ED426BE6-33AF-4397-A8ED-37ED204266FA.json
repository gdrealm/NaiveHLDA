{"id":"ED426BE6-33AF-4397-A8ED-37ED204266FA","title":"Managing and exploiting high dimensionality in genetic epidemiology","abstractText":"In the last five years there has been a great deal of progress in discovering the genetic variations that explain differences in risk for complex diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. But it is clear that much remains to be discovered, and in order to explain this so-called missing heritability researchers are conducting increasingly larger scale studies, enrolling greater numbers of patients and including much larger numbers of genetic variations. At the same time, there are increased efforts to use these new genetic discoveries to learn about the biological processes involved in disease. These new studies in the field of genetic epidemiology need specialised statistical methods to analyse their data, as the path from gene to disease is complex and subject to apparently random influences. This research aims to develop powerful methods that allow for, and take advantage of, the large number of genes measured in a typical study. One important aspect is statistical significance: when many genes are studied, some will appear to be associated with disease simply due to chance fluctuations in the data. Standard guidelines have been given for existing studies in order to differentiate true associations from chance effects, and we will extend these recommendations for the next generation of studies that consider a larger number of genetic variants, many of them rare, and which study the range of populations worldwide. We will then study the best way to analyse new genotyping products that are designed to obtain enhanced information for specific classes of disease such as auto-immune, cancer and psychiatric conditions. We will also study an emerging application of genetics, called Mendelian randomisation, which can help to explain whether an observed association between an exposure such as alcohol intake and an outcome such as heart disease is due to a true causal effect or only to other common causes. We will consider how large numbers of genetic variants can be combined into a single tool that can improve the resolution and power of this method. Taken together, this research will provide a methodological basis for gaining further insights from large scale genetic studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K006215/1","grantId":"MR/K006215/1","fundValue":"384766","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Dudbridge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
