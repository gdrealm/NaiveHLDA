Why this is so remains unclear. By highlighting historical capabilities in this path-dependent area, this study will allow practitioners, researchers, and legislators to assess existing national strengths and understand what new firm capabilities and institutional supports are needed for the emerging landscape of global brand competition.</p>\n\n<p>The project will trace developments in trademark strategy from 1860, before the first trademark law, to 1960, when the global strength of branded British consumer goods became clear. We will examine successful brands of the nineteenth century, comparing brands that led to growth and longevity in the twentieth with those that ended in failure. This area of research on the early history of successful trademarks has been surprisingly neglected. A central focus of this study is the co-evolution of trademark legislation and firms' branding practice.</p>\n\n<p>The project draws attention to the contribution of trademarks to 'vertical competition' and the control of supply chains. This aspect of branding, which was evident in the nineteenth century before the rise of the integrated firm, is becoming evident again as production disaggregates into extended, often global, supply chains.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0193-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-0193-A","fundValue":"100236","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Teresa  Da Silva Lopes","coPersons":["Paul  Duguid"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
