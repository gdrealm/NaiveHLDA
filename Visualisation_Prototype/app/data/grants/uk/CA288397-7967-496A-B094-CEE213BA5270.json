{"id":"CA288397-7967-496A-B094-CEE213BA5270","title":"METHODS OF RELIABILITY-CONTROL FOR AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES","abstractText":"Many autonomous underwater vehicles have been recently developed and successfully deployed for various oceanographic, industry and defence applications. Two important aspects in these applications are that they are expensive to produce and that they are mostly one-off products or only a few ofa kind are built that disallows quality control techniques that are used in mass production. This proposal aims to build a system to reduce the chance of AUVs malfunctioning or becoming irrecoverably lost, hence indirectly the proposal aims to reduce the effective operational cost of AUVs. The project is to build onthe many years of experience of designing, building and operatingAUVs at the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. The main parts of the propose system are and fault assessment system (IFAS), design optimization tool for overall operational reliability (DOPTOR) and human interface for daily operation (HIDO) .The cost of development of the proposed system is relatively low and the cost of loss of an AUVs is very high. The design system would pay for itself for a single user. Collateral benefits of the proposal are that the methodology generated is largely transferable to users other than the collaborators and also to other types of costly autonomous vehicles on land and in air.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E02677X/1","grantId":"EP/E02677X/1","fundValue":"307259","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandor Mihaly Veres","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
