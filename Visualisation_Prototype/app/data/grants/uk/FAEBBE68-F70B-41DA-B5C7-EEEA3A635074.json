While they have gained considerable freedom and independence, new, less tangible, forms of constraint and subordination play a defining role in their identities. The series brought together academics, policy makers, practitioners, media professionals and others, to investigate key issues arising in relation to young women's lives and to discuss potential interventions.<br />&nbsp;<br />We considered how young women’s increased social and physical mobility affects their lives. We examined the social conditions of young women's participation in new forms of work, and in particular their continued problematic relationship to science, mathematics and techology. Discussions interrogated the field of sexuality and its visualisation across new and old media in the context of ‘moral panics’ about teenage pregnancy rates, sexually transmitted diseases and internet pornography. We considered the re-positioning of young women as citizens, future mothers, workforce etc, while also reflecting on empirical research on these topics and its theorisation. Participants investigaged the perceived rise in girls' participation in gang membership, violence and bullying, through both physical violence and text and online media, and the impact of youth work interventions on this.<br />&nbsp;<br />A Special Issue of Pedagogy, Culture and Society containing papers from the series will appear in 2013.The first seminar was reported in The TES and an edited version of the final one, plus podcasts from selected presenters, will appear on Pod Academy (www.podacademy.org).

This led to international public debate about issues arising from her research. Online versions of a Daily Mail article about her work were syndicated around the globe, attracting numerous public comments. A BBC World Service interview gained 58 'likes' and 27 comments on the BBC website in a few hours after broadcast. An article featuring Paechter's research in the Times was discussed on the ITV programme Loose Women on 16th November 2012, garnering 23 comments on the programme's Facebook page.

We have been particularly successful in attracting presentations and attendance from non-academic participants, incuding youth workers and those working in the media and in NGOs. \n\n\n\nThe main academic outcomes of the series include a Special Issue of Pedagogy, Culture and Society on Pedagogical Responses to the Changing Position of Girls and Young Women, to be published in 2013. This is expected to include ten papers from both academics and practitioners. Papers from one of the two related events appeared in a Special Issue of Queer-Cultural Studies. The series organisers have been invited by one of the European speakers to participate in a funding bid to the Slovenia National Research Agency, for a project entitled Parameters for Coping with Violence among Adolescents.\n\n\n\nThe series has also produced new collaborations between members. Rebecca Coleman (Lancaster, core member) told us that 'As a direct consequence of involvement in the series I am now co-authoring a chapter with Jessica Ringrose (a participant in one of the seminars) about our work with young women, and we are planning a joint funding application to be submitted in 2012, to work with a girls' magazine.' Christina Scharff (Kings, London, core member) reported that 'Claire Maxwell invited me to contribute to an edited collection on 'Privilege, Agency and Effect'. She became aware of my work because I presented at one of the seminars'. \n\n\n\nFeedback elicited from participants suggested that the series had been important to the development of their thinking. One European academic participant told us:\n\n\n\n'I found the seminar very inspiring as regards the variety of topics, the nice atmosphere and the diversity of speakers, their highly differentiated professional profiles, academic fields and research interests. For sure it inspired me in sexualities research, and still more in rethinking the postfeminism and later feminism (third wave) due to the academic positioning and very concrete researchers' perspectives.' She went on to say that she had subsequently made direct reference to the series in a presentation to a national conference in Slovenia. \n\n\n\nAcademic participants were extremely positive about the contributions from practitioners and others. One participant told us:\n\n\n\n'the series offered a great opportunity to hear about non-academic work on and with girls; the talks and participation from novelists, MPs and activists were great.' \n\n\n\nAnother commented that: \n\n\n\n'A few of [the participants] were known to me but most were not and to have people from beyond academia - eg Meg Munn, was excellent.'\n\n\n\nParticipants also commended the broad age range covered by the series and remarked that the discussions were feeding into their teaching as well as their research.\n\n\n\nThe demand for participation was strong, and attendance at seminars high. Where necessary, we operated a waiting list so that we could offer places elsewhere if people dropped out at the last minute. We anticipate that the planned podcasts on PodAcademy, which is a resource for business, NGOs and the public sector nationally and internationally, will have an impact on practitioners and others well beyond the academic community. The Creative Commons licence used by PodAcademy allows the international use and redistribution of the podcasts, giving our findings a significant potential reach beyond the academic community, for example by teachers and social workers.\n\n\n\nThe involvement of an MP gives the potential for policy-related impacts in the longer term. Findings from the research can be used by practitioners in their work with girls and young women. Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
