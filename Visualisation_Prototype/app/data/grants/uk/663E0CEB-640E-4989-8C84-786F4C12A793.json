Studies have shown how it is migrant workers who are supplying much of this domestic labour, and the concept of global care chains has been developed to capture this. The research has tended to focus on how women are situated within these global care chains. This project, however, aims to illuminate and make sense of some of the ways in which men are positioned within the relationship between globalisation, migration and social reproduction. The project will focus on situations in which families buy-in the labour of migrant handymen to undertake traditionally male tasks of social reproduction such as home maintenance and gardening. The project will combine quantitative and qualitative research methods. A range of existing data sets will be analysed in order to provide a descriptive statistical portrait of the prevalence and characteristics of the migrant handyman phenomenon in the UK. In-depth face-to-face interviews with migrant handymen and labour-using households will be conducted in order to explore themes such as why, how and with what consequences households use migrant handymen, and the processes by which migrants come to be inserted in this type of work.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F029136/1","grantId":"ES/F029136/1","fundValue":"79052","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Majella Mary Kilkey","coPersons":["Diane  Perrons"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
