Currently available representations effectively estimate population at home addresses, or 'workplace' populations, which provide a partial view of the population at places of work.&nbsp; Neither of these satisfies the pressing need for representations of the ever-changing spatial distribution of population over time.&nbsp; The temporal dimension incorporates both historical and cyclical timescales in addition to unique events which influence the spatial distribution of population.</p>\n\n<p>This research will develop new methodology for modelling the distribution of population in time-space.&nbsp; It builds on established spatial population modelling to include emerging datasets in a generalisable modelling framework.&nbsp; Earlier work redistributed data from area centroids and population counts.&nbsp; The project will extend this to incorporate counts appropriate to any specific time and date.&nbsp; Census output areas, workplaces, educational establishments, hospitals and leisure locations can be treated as 'centroids' around which counts can be redistributed over both space and time.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The project encompasses methodological development, computer programming and reference dataset production.&nbsp; Results will be disseminated through a web interface and mid-term research workshop.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1811","grantId":"RES-062-23-1811","fundValue":"251727","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This award has generated widespread interest in building time-sepcific population models. It has influenced thinking in a range of public and private sector organizations with whom the research has been discussed. Follow-on actions to date include three PhD studentships (one funded by Ordnance Survey); one of these students spent an EPSRC-funded internship with HR Wallingford. Discussions are currently under way with Public Health England on how the methods might contribute to potential future funding bids. We have been in extended correspondence with Health and Safety Laboratories regarding how the work might benefit their modelling. Presentations have been given to commercial audiences such as the Demographics User Group. These are all ongong.

This is very different to conventional population mapping which tends to use sources such as census data to estimate residential populations at night-time on a fixed date of enumeration. During the project, a network of non-academic stakeholders including emergency planning, flood modelling and mapping agencies was created. One of these organizations is currently sponsoring a PhD student to further develop the work and another is seeking to do so. The existing methodology could be implemented by any organization holding suitable population data-sets. The software and overall approach serve to inform decision-making in many contexts, including emergency planning, risk assessment, mapping and healthcare planning. The &quot;SurfaceBuilder24/7&quot; software developed during the project is freely available.
