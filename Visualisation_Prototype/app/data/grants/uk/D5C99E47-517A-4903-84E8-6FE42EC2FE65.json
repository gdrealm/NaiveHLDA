{"id":"D5C99E47-517A-4903-84E8-6FE42EC2FE65","title":"LIGHT CLOTH","abstractText":"Awareness of technological textiles has intensified over the past ten years, crystallised by the Thames &amp; Hudson publication in 1998 of Sarah Braddock and Marie Mahoney's Techno Textiles. Practitioners have focused on the interaction of cloth and light and the radical innovation of yarn companies has further fuelled creative activity with the development of numerous technological and reactive materials.This project builds on recent work, investigating dynamic interrelations between light and fabric.The research seeks to challenge and re-present notions and traditions of craft practice by investigating the synthesis of hand woven textiles with technology. A key objective centres around the subjugation and blending of technology rather than a focus on the technology per se.\\n\\nThe project will contribute to the debate around the context and perception of art textiles and involves the development of installations in which light-responsive materials interact with discreet, integrated, gradually shifting, light sources: a performance involving woven compositions and customised moving sequences on light emitting screens. Final outcomes will be geared towards exhibiting in architectural spaces and galleries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E002676/1","grantId":"AH/E002676/1","fundValue":"16390","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  SHellard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
