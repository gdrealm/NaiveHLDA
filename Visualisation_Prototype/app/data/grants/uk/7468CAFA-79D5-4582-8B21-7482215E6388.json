This introduces a counter-cyclical wage movement that masks the true degree of wage rate cyclical responsiveness.</p>\n\n<p>Using highly disaggregate payroll and working time data of British Engineering Employers Federation for the years 1928 to 1937, this project will attempt to assess the effects of biases resulting from data aggregation.&nbsp; In addition to workforce compositional effects, it will assess:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the role played by fluctuations in overtime working, \n</li>\n <li>the consequences of separating time- and piece-rated workers, and \n</li>\n <li>the implications of failing to measure cyclical effects at local geographical levels.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H000887/1","grantId":"ES/H000887/1","fundValue":"50621","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Hart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
