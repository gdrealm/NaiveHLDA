{"id":"F74D1316-DF65-4924-9910-AF3BDB56F9EC","title":"Social and Environmental Inequalities in Rural Areas","abstractText":"<p>The achievement of RELU’s objectives implicitly depends on the distribution of social, economic and environmental goods and services that are needed to maintain and reinforce the vitality of rural areas. Research to inform effective rural policy-making relies on the availability of readily accessible data, from both social and natural scientific disciplines, about this distribution. </p> \n<p>A refined and extended dataset on Social and Environmental Rural Conditions (SECRA) developed in an earlier RELU Scoping Study will be used in this project to examine patterns of social and environmental inequalities in the distribution of social, economic and environmental goods and services. Methods for measuring inequality differ in the natural and social sciences and the project will explore ways to resolve differences and find a common approach. Having identified inequalities in socio-economic or environmental goods and services, consideration will be given to whether they can be regarded as unfair or unjust. The best people to consult on these matters are the people actually living in the areas where inequalities have been identified. Mapping techniques will be used to explore local residents’ perceptions of local inequality and injustice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-25-0004","grantId":"RES-229-25-0004","fundValue":"272938","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Meg  Huby","coPersons":["Piran  White","Steve  Cinderby"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
