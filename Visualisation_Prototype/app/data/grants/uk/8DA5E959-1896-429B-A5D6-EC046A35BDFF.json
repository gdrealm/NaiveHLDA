His reign as duke of Normandy has been overshadowed by the reigns of his brothers, William Rufus and Henry 1 as King of England. This comparative neglect has been has been reflected in the published literature, which has tended to be crucial of Robert's failings. This project seeks to re-examine the career of Robert Curthose in order to assess the significance of his contribution to the history of the duchy of Normandy, the Kingdom of England and to Western Christendom in the eleventh and early twelfth centuries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113097/1","grantId":"113097/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"William Morton AIRD","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
