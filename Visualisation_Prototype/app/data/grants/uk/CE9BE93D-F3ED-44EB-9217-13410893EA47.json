This award will cover our travel and subsistence costs to both STFC and non-STFC observing facilities. The major topics of observational astrophysics research to be covered by the PATT Linked Grant include: - the study of both Population I and evolved OB-type stars in our own and other galaxies; - investigations of supernovae and the end stages of stellar evolution; - high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution observations of the solar atmosphere and those of other cool stars; - studies of solar system bodies, including comets and asteroids; - astrochemistry, including that of interstellar and circumstellar clouds; - investigations of planetary nebulae; - multiwavelength studies of the interstellar medium, in particular high velocity clouds; - followup observations of objects detected by the SuperWASP instrument.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000921/1","grantId":"ST/G000921/1","fundValue":"41678","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  No findings as the grant was only to pay for telescope trips, not undertake research.
