The ITRS roadmap shows a saturation of the number of electrical pins required for input/output on microprocessors beyond 2020 to about 3000 with current technology. This saturation with an ever increasing latency and a limited on-chip clock speed is a bottle neck that high density optical interconnects have to alleviate. To meet the ITRS 2020 goals the target is clear, with over 100 Tb/s off chip IO capability and power consumption for an entire optical link on the order of 100fJ/bit.\nThis work proposes a solution to this problem and provides a novel means of fabrication to go beyond the capabilities of standard planar silicon photonics circuits. To do so we aim to develop a multilayer optical platform based on localised Germanium/Silicon compounds on insulator compatible with the fabrication of micrometre sized cavity based structures enabling devices such as modulators and detectors. The growth of laser sources based on III/V materials or doped Germanium could also be envisioned but this is beyond the scope of this proposal. The proposed platform will establish a means to fabricate and demonstrate micrometre scale optical devices fit to tackle the 3 dimensional, high density, low voltage and low capacitance requirements needed for very large scale optical integration necessary for optical on chip interconnects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K02423X/1","grantId":"EP/K02423X/1","fundValue":"100155","fundStart":"2013-06-26","fundEnd":"2015-12-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is currently on going and it is therefore too early to provide a list of how the findings are or will be used. The first output was published at a post deadline oral presentation at IEEE group IV photonics conference in Paris. The findings have generated interest from companies and research centers such as Soitec (france), Huawei(UK), IHP(Germany), Sandia (USA).\nAs the findings propose a new way of fabrication and therefore a new technological building block for electronics and optical integrated systems, national and international collaboration are being setup to provide the expertise, funding and critical mass necessary to develop the findings further into viable products that will serve different area of the industry and society.
