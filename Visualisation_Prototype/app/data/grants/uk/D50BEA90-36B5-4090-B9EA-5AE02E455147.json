Based on this visual information, the motor system must rapidly correct the ongoing movement, driving the hand in a manner that ensures successful grasp of the ball. Similar visual and motor pathways are used in all sports, where an athlete is required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to the small changes in the world signalled by visual feedback. Indeed, these processes are fundamental to most skilled movements in everyday life. \nThe visually sensed changes may refer either to one's own body, or to objects in the external world (such as a ball). By assigning these visual changes to either itself or to an external item, the visuo-motor control system can respond quickly in the correct manner to ensure skilled action. In this project, we will investigate the neural pathways that constitute this vision to motor action loop. Specifically, we will study three major questions: \nThe first question is how these different pathways, signalling either our hand location or the target location (e.g. ball), interact with one another. The current scientific view is that the brain simply calculates the difference between the target and hand locations and uses this difference to correct the movement. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that this is not true, but rather suggest that the two pathways lead to partially independent responses. Using a robotic device, we will carefully measure the interactions and independence of these two feedback pathways.\nThe second question investigates which parts of the brain are dedicated to the processing of the two feedback pathways. We will investigate active reaching movements using a robotic device while measuring brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The individual activity pattern in each region will reveal how target and hand information are represented in different brain regions, and how these regions interact. \nThe third question is how the brain assigns visual signals to one's own movements, or other action-relevant objects. For example, a huge number of sports utilize bats, or rackets that act as an extension of the subjects own hand. The brain must therefore assign agency to these objects, marking them as self, in order to respond correctly to visual changes in these objects, which may be a different action than responding to changes in external objects such as the ball. We will investigate the process by which this occurs and attempt to distinguish it from attention mechanisms. \nThis project investigates the basic vision to motor action pathways that underlie skilled movements. Understanding these pathways and the manner in which the brain utilizes them for fast action will lead to improvements of training regimes for high-performance sports. In many sports, the highest level of performance requires the ability to respond accurately and with exceptional speed to small, barely detectible visual information. \nThe research also produces an essential understanding of the pathways directly involved in learning of action. As such, it provides important information on the mechanisms used in learning and retraining skills and movements. This has particular relevance for rehabilitation after brain injury, such as stroke. Extensive techniques are being developed which use robotic devices for retraining after brain injury, where feedback is also provided visually. By understanding in detail how and where this visual information is processed, optimal training designs for stroke rehabilitation can be developed, which take into account individual deficits in the various feedback loops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J009458/1","grantId":"BB/J009458/1","fundValue":"266299","fundStart":"2012-09-03","fundEnd":"2015-03-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"JÃ¶rn  Diedrichsen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The role of attention in early visual processes for motor control:\nAttention has long been considered the main mechanism by which the brain filters sensory input for further processing. However, attention is a capacity-limited resource. This poses a problem for online control of goal-directed movements, during which the sensorimotor system must simultaneously extract visual information about the target(s) of the action, as well visual information about the hand(s). Moreover, it must do so in a complex visual world, additionally filtering out non-action related objects. Given these parallel demands on attentional resources, how does the motor system ensure robust and efficient feedback control?\nWe demonstrate that visual processing of hand motion employs a dedicated mechanism that circumvents the attentional bottleneck. In a series of experiments, we study the fast and automatic responses to visual displacements of the hand and target during reaching movements. We show that the processing of visual hand feedback is not influenced by the allocation of visual attention. In contrast, processing of visual target information is modulated by the locus of participants' attention. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extraction of visual information about hand motion among multiple distracting objects is more efficient than the extraction of target motion. Together, these results provide strong evidence that the processing of visual motion information of the own body can occur outside of the focus of visual attention, and is likely subserved by a distinct binding mechanism.\nRelated problems have been discussed in the cognitive and social neuroscience literatures under the term 'sense of agency' or 'self-other distinction'. We provide a radically different perspective to the problem of attributing visual information to one's own action by highlighting its importance for basic motor control. In the natural environment, the visual scene is cluttered with distracting objects. Visuomotor binding provides the necessary 'glue' between the sensory and motor systems, and therefore must constitute a central concept in theories of sensorimotor integration. Our research takes the first steps to characterize this mechanism. \n\nIntegration of visual hand and target information during reaching:\nVisually guided movements rely on visual feedback from both the target and hand. The classical view on feedback control is that the brain extracts estimates of target and hand position from a visual scene, calculating a difference vector used by the motor system for online corrections. However, the complex computations required to calculate this difference vector could be too time consuming given the tight temporal constraints. Our research suggests that the fastest feedback corrections are generated by processing the two visual cues independently. This simpler computation seems to be better suited to the time demands for fast feedback control. In later phases of the movement correction, however, the responses of the motor system conform with a calculation of a difference vector. This means that the brain first computes a quick but sub-optimal solution to enable rapid response onset, which later converges to the sophisticated calculation that enables achievement of the task goal.
