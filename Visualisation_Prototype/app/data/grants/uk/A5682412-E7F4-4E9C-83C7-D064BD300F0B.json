She is currently President of the Medical Section of the BA and an active member of the European DANA Alliance for the Brain. She has written many articles for non-scientists about her own research, research careers and particularly on the importance of animals in medical research. \n\nStuart Allan has given several public lectures and has been directly involved in the supervision of school children during visits to our lab. We often host school children on work experience in our lab.\n\nThe School of Biological Sciences now holds a formal course for graduates and post docs in public engagement in science. Many members of our lab participate in these activities through visits to schools, talks and supervising visitors. We consider that these activities are extremely important and they are actively encouraged.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9219675","grantId":"G9219675","fundValue":"3795770","fundStart":"1993-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nancy Jane Rothwell","coPersons":["Stuart McRae Allan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
