{"id":"12A0E1A0-D0EC-4C84-A9D1-129CA5EE51E9","title":"Beelines","abstractText":"Summary\n\nHuman societies depend on bees. In the UK, insect pollination is worth &pound;400-500m per year and in California commercial beekeepers transport truckloads of honeybees to pollinate orchards on an industrial scale. Across the world, glasshouse production of tomatoes depends on the supply of bumblebees commercially reared in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the same time, declining bee populations have seized the public imagination, shaping campaigns against the use of pesticides in agriculture, adding impetus to concerns about the decline in biodiversity of flowering plants in rural areas, and leading to an upsurge in interest in urban beekeeping, and a trend for architects to design spaces for bees. Given the growing recognition of our entanglement with the world of the bee, and the dependence of agriculture, livelihoods and environmental sustainability upon it, this project asks how can the social sciences contribute to understandings of bee-human relations? \n\nThe project aims to transform approaches to thinking about bees (and by extension other insects or animals) in the social sciences, the natural sciences and the general public. It will do this by developing a methodology that allows us to see bee and human activities as taking place together, in contrast to more conventional views which see humans and bees living separately in society and nature. We will investigate the practices of three different kinds of beekeeper - commercial beekeepers in California and the Netherlands, urban beekeepers in the UK and Denmark, and &quot;barefoot&quot; beekeepers in the UK - and identify how they relate differently to bees. By comparing these three different practices of beekeeping we will be able to analyse how beekeepers use their understandings of bees' worlds (&quot;beenotes&quot;) in order to shape and direct the lives that bees live (&quot;beelines&quot;). \n\nThe project also aims to transform the way social scientists and the general public think about nature and society by taking up the cas of the bee. Whilst most nonhuman animals are seen to be inferior to humans, historically the organization of bee society has been taken as an inspiration for our own. These days bees have become ciphers for environmental concerns, and so the project sets out to investigate how it is that bees enter the polis by raising questions for debate, and bring nature into the city via the increasing practice of urban beekeeping. \n\nIn order to disseminate the research findings, the project investigators will not just write academic papers, but they will seek to engage a wider public with the issues arising around our close association with bees. They will do this by writing a book about the research findings in the popular genre of nature writing, and by engaging a round table of experts and practitioners in order to plan and develop a project pack for primary schools and apply for funding for a museum exhibition. \n\nThe project findings will also be of interest to policy makers in the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and urban planners.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M000834/1","grantId":"ES/M000834/1","fundValue":"186085","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Marsland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
