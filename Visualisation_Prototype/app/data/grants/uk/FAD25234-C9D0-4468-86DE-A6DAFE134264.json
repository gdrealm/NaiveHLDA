{"id":"FAD25234-C9D0-4468-86DE-A6DAFE134264","title":"Institutionalising values: beyond human rights?","abstractText":"One central purpose that political, legal and social institutions can serve is the realisation - the protection, the promotion, the fostering - of fundamental human values. But how can we create and maintain institutions that will serve this purpose well? What principles should guide their construction and operations? This network will bring together an international team of philosophers, political and legal theorists, policy-makers and legal practitioners to address these questions, which can be adequately tackled only through a thoroughly interdisciplinary approach involving both theorists and practitioners. During the period for which AHRC funding is sought, the network will focus on human rights. \\n\\nIn our contemporary rights-dominated climate, the institutionalisation of values is commonly understood as concerning enforcement of people's human rights. There has been a recent flowering of rights-based proposals for re-structuring institutions, from Pogge's proposed reforms to the international resource and borrowing privileges (2002) to Fabre's proposals on the sale of body parts (2006). Academics' proposals have been matched by policy-makers' restructuring of rights-related institutions - e.g. the entrenchment of the European Convention on Human Rights in UK law (1998), and the creation of civil partnerships (2004), of the Scottish parliament (1999) and of devolved self-government for Hong Kong within China (1997).\\n\\nWhile each reform has been examined individually by academics and policy-makers, there has been little critical focus on the general principles that should guide any reform intended to institutionalise fundamental values. In particular, the central role of human rights discourse in these reforms urgently requires international cross-disciplinary attention. Recourse to the language of human rights is contested. For example, instituting a human right to a loving upbringing arguably ignores extra-legal institutions such as the family, and mistakenly takes the relation between institutions and the values they protect to be purely instrumental. Critics also frequently accuse advocates of human rights and their institutionalisation of 'Western imperialism'. What is urgently needed is a constructively critical examination of the role that human rights can properly play in the institutionalisation of fundamental values: but current debates about human rights are usually too limited and too partial to provide this. Critics and defenders of human rights span a diversity of traditions that rarely interact with each other, so that they too often seem to talk past rather than to each other, while the existing international human rights networks largely involve legal and NGO campaigners who fully support the discourse. \\n\\nBy contrast, our proposed network will subject human rights to critical scrutiny from a trans-culturally informed normative perspective, by bringing together critics from law and philosophy, and from different intellectual traditions, along with cross-disciplinary defenders of human rights drawn internationally from both the academy and practitioners.\\n\\nFollowing the AHRC-funded stage of the network, we will develop further projects, broadening our focus to encompass questions - arising from our initial human rights network discussions - concerning general issues about the institutionalisation of value, such as the design of institutions that can appropriately respect the (non?)universality of human rights and other values; the institutionalisation of aesthetic and environmental norms that cannot be accommodated by the human rights approach; the individual's responsibility in relation to value-realising institutions; the appropriate role for legal and sub-legal institutions in realising different values.\\n\\nThe University of Stirling will be the base for the AHRC-funded stage of the network. Public engagement with the network will be mediated through the NGO, Jubilee Scotland.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G014345/1","grantId":"AH/G014345/1","fundValue":"49812","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1. The network fostered several ongoing collaborations between researchers, policymakers and legal and NGO practitioners. \n\nFor example, Rowan Cruft continues to discuss how to understand human rights with several NGO participants, including Jonathan Heawood (PEN) and James Picardo (Jubilee Scotland), and these discussions have informed the proposals put forward by the respective NGOs.\n\nSimilarly, Jennifer Davidson's work on children's rights has led to useful interactions with Aidan O'Neill's legal work. \n\nThe close work between theorists and practitioners that the network enabled has generated a range of fruitful ongoing interactions of this type. Ongoing discussions between the theorists and the practitioners within the network have generated a range of fruitful developments: NGO policy proposals have been informed by the network's theorists' understandings of human rights; so have legal and lawmaking developments involving participants in the network.\n2. One theme emerging from our network discussions concerned the way that academic discplines (in particular, philosophy, politics and law) tend to talk past each other when discussing human rights. \nThe network led to greater understanding between discplines on these issues - e.g. on the extent to which law understands human rights in 'natural rights' terms; on the importance of the political vs. 'natural' understanding of human rights; and on the extent to which human rights are conceived strictly as rights. Different academic displines conceive human rights differently: as the rights listed in legal documents, as 'natural rights' or as important goals (to take three prominent conceptions). Our network discussions brought these differences to the fore, thereby increasing understanding across academic law, philosophy and politics.

Following an initial meeting (Apr 2009), we held four workshops at the University of Stirling: 1. Human Rights and Political Participation (Sept 2009); 2. Human Rights: Defenders vs Critics (Mar 2010); 3. Human Rights beyond the law? (Sept 2010); 4. Human Rights and Subsistence (Apr 2011). We also held a public lecture in Edinburgh and a mini-workshop at the University of York (Sept 2011). These events involved a wide range of participants with interests in the nature and defensibility of human rights, from such academics as Costas Douzinas, James Nickel, Onora O'Neill, Thomas Pogge, Kunibert Raffer and John Tasioulas to NGO practitioners such as Jonathan Heawood (PEN), James Picardo (Jubilee Scotland), advocates and other legal professionals, and civil servants. A wide range of voices was heard including Marxist, feminist, postmodern and liberal critics of human rights, liberal defenders of the discourse, and many who were rights-sympathetic yet critical of contemporary human rights institutions.\n\n \n\n\n\nSeveral themes emerged. Three prominent ones are:\n\n \n\n\n\n1. The need for clarity on the philosophical foundations of human rights.\n\nMany issues relevant to human dignity were discussed: political participation, poverty, hate crime, sovereign debt, extraction of natural resources, official apologies, religious toleration, free expression. We found that which of these are human rights issues, and what this means, depend centrally on the philosophical foundations of human rights - e.g., on whether human rights are strictly rights in Hohfeld's sense, or whether they include 'right-goal hybrids' as Nickel put it, and on whether human rights encompass all serious injustices, or only injustices involving official disrespect (Pogge). \n\n\n\nThe significance of the philosophy of what a human right is and what grounds human rights is reflected in one of our principal outputs: a volume on the philosophical foundations of human rights. This is a large volume (40 essays) drawing together recent research on the philosophy of human rights; it is aimed at both researchers and students. Rowan Cruft, Matthew Liao and Massimo Renzo are co-editors, and it will be published by OUP in Spring 2014.\n\n \n\n\n\n2. The need for clarity in the legislation of rights.\n\nClarity on the moral issues needs to be mirrored in clear legislation. Several legislative measures and guidelines (e.g. the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005; the UN 'Protect, Respect, and Remedy' framework for business and human rights) were criticised either for their vagueness or for their failure to generate suitably determinate duties. These issues interact with philosophical questions about the nature of human rights: for example, must legal human rights 'mirror' pre-legal moral rights? These questions are among those tackled in the volume mentioned above. In addition, the issue of the determinateness of the duties human rights generate is discussed in several other outputs, including Cruft's contribution ('Human Rights as Rights') to the volume edited by Ernst and Heiliger, and the special symposium in the Journal of Applied Philosophy (see outputs below).\n\n \n\n\n\n3. The importance of social inclusion.\n\nA recurrent theme was social inclusion, understood as the capacity to obtain and retain the material and intellectual goods necessary to exercise the basic rights and duties conferred by citizenship, or by inclusion under a supra-national bill of rights etc. Most participants agreed that human rights institutions, and constitutional bills of rights, need to include a right to social inclusion in this sense, if they are justifiably to confer rights and duties on people. All three of the findings highlighted above are of relevance to policymakers, NGO and legal practitioners working on human rights. Our network discussions have already begun to disseminate these points by drawing in selected lawmakers, NGO and legal practitioners. For example, we submitted a briefing paper to the Commission on a Bill of Rights for the UK, and the PI (Rowan Cruft) took part as an expert witness for the Leveson Inquiry into the Culture, Practice and Ethics of the Press. The report of the Inquiry refers to Dr Cruft's evidence in outlining the grounds for a free press, and in sketching the content for a new code of press practice.
