However proteins also cause a range of diseases, mostly those that affect the brains of older people, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease. In these disorders proteins stick together and become lodged in tissues, such as the brain, causing damage. We have looked at how proteins stick together in experiments that we carry out in test tubes and we have developed a computer program that can tell in advance how sticky a particular protein will be. Our recent work has shown that this program can also tell us how toxic a protein will be if it is introduced into the brain of a fruit fly. Although the fly brain is small there are many similarities with the human brain. We expect that by understanding exactly what makes a protein sticky and toxic in the fly brain we will be able to stop the same processes in the human brain. We might be able to do this by developing medicines that change the way proteins stick together to make them harmless.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700990","grantId":"G0700990","fundValue":"1533530","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Damian  Crowther","coPersons":["David Arthur Lomas","Christopher  Dobson","Michele  Vendruscolo"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
