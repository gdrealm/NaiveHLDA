The genomes of humans (and complex eukaryotes) are vastly larger than those of bacteria (prokaryotes). The human genome contains swathes of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of uncertain function, alongside regions recognizable as encoding proteins or involved in regulation of gene expression. The fact that large sections of the human genome are not involved in protein production does not, however, mean they are redundant. Recently, it has become clear that ~3 % of human genomic DNA is used to encode RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules ultimately used for regulation of other genes by 'gene silencing'. The ultimate gene regulatory products are micro RNAs (or miRNAs). Their production initiates with transcription of primary RNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which can be very long (up to thousands of ribonucleotide units). These are cleaved in the nucleus by a molecular machine called the 'microprocessor', which likely contains multiple copies of two proteins / an RNA-binding protein called DGCR8 or 'Pasha' and a RNA-cleaving (RNase) enzyme called 'Drosha'. The shortened products of the microprocessor reaction are precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and these are transported from the nucleus into the cell cytoplasm, where they are further processed by another RNase called 'Dicer' / ultimately forming mature miRNAs that perform gene regulatory roles. It is now evident that miRNAs play critical roles in control of important human processes / including differentiation of organs and tissues, programmed death of cells (apoptosis) and cancer development. Relatively little is known about structures and catalytic properties of the nuclear microprocessor, but recent studies revealed that DGCR8 binds a heme cofactor / identical to the heme in hemoglobin. Our preliminary work to express and purify DGCR8 protein have confirmed this finding, and we have done several other studies that indicate that the iron atom at the centre of the heme is bound by two ligands, likely to be amino acids within DGCR8. We have also showed that the heme iron is in a reduced (ferrous) state, and in this state hemes are able to interact with gases such as oxygen, nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Each of these gases is known to exert profound effects over cellular processes such as respiration and blood flow. In this study, we will exploit our expertise in study of heme proteins and RNA metabolism to perform a detailed characterization of the microprocessor complex and its components. This work will establish exactly how heme is bound to the DGCR8 protein, and the influence of heme on the DGCR8 structure and its tendency to aggregate. We will also investigate the effect of pri-miRNA binding on conformation and aggregation of DGCR8, and examine influence of NO and CO on the state of the heme and its protein ligation, since these ligands may influence DGCR8 structure and reactivity. We will use modern structural methods to define the oligimerization state of both DGCR8/Drosha proteins, and then analyse the nature of their interactions and their oligomeric state in the microprocessor complex. We will use advanced kinetic methods to study binding of heme to DGCR8 and intermediate states in its coordination to the protein, and to examine the rate of processing of pri-miRNA. We will also undertake crystallographic studies to resolve the atomic structures of the DGCR8/Drosha proteins (or sections, 'domains', thereof) and to rationalise the mechanism by which these proteins bind heme and pri-miRNA and perform their reaction. Collectively, this work will lead to a large step forward in our understanding of structure and mechanism of a crucial system involved in human health and development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F014252/1","grantId":"BB/F014252/1","fundValue":"688614","fundStart":"2008-06-16","fundEnd":"2012-12-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our work in this project was aimed at furthering our knowledge of the structure and function of a novel enzyme system now recognized as crucial in regulation of protein expression and intensively studied worldwide.

The microRNAs are produced from longer RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules through the action of an enzyme complex referred to as the microprocessor. This has two major components - an RNA cleaving enzyme (an RNase) and a heme-binding protein called DGCR8 that is required for the function of the microprocessor. The major purposes of this proposal was to express and purify different forms of DGCR8 and to characterize this protein in terms of its heme binding properties (including exactly how the heme is ligated and which amino acids in the protein are required to coordinate to the heme iron to stabilize its binding. Other biochemical studies involved analysis of the aggregation state of the DGCR8 protein and its ability to interact with the RNA substrate (the primary microRNA) of the microprocessor. Key findings included the ability of DGCR8 to aggregate and dimerize. This was consistent with structural studies done by another group (who identified a dimerization &quot;domain&quot; responsible for dimer formation). Analysis of the DGCR8 hemoprotein spectroscopic features was done using a variety of methods, including UV-visible, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), resonance Raman, and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. The UV-vis characteristics of DGCR8 are characteristic of proteins in which the heme is coordinated by two cysteine amino acid residues, in which sulfur atoms (as negatively charged thiolates) bind the iron above and below the plane of the heme iron. The combined spectroscopic approaches supported this assignment and effectively ruled out the possibility of a nitrogen ligand to the heme iron (e.g. from a histidine amino acid). Other spectroscopic studies showed that the DGCR8 heme iron is highly selective for other small chemicals that might displace one or other of the cysteines, and it was found that carbon monoxide (CO) was the only gaseous ligand that effectively displaced a cysteine, forming a distinctive spectral complex. This raises the possibility that CO might be a regulator of DGCR8 function, since this gas is known to regulate a number of biological processes in both higher and lower organisms. Our work revealed several novel features of this enzyme, and we overcame problems with expressing this enzyme (using different length forms of the protein and different types of protein production systems). Binding of RNA substrate to the DGCR8 protein was also achieved, and protein was prepared for structural studies, although groups in USA solved the structure of the protein at an early stage in our project. Overall, our study provided fundamental new data on an important hemoprotein, and work is continuing to provide more detailed characterization of this enzyme. DGCR8 is a crucial enzyme in regulation of protein expression. The data provided in our study (particularly with respect to understanding the heme binding site in the protein) are crucial for studies done by groups worldwide on this important enzyme, and for developing our knowledge of its function and how changes to heme ligation regulate DGCR8 and microRNA processing function.
