{"id":"FE074D38-61D1-4B0A-9068-39BCA2BD714F","title":"The Other Side: Affect and Governance in Northern Cyprus","abstractText":"This anthropological research project is a full-scale study of everyday life, subjectively, space, law, and governance under the sovereignty of an unrecognised and illegal state, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is intended for the completion of a book manuscript. The book will be a study of subjectivity in the context of long-term confinement in a bordered territory and subjecthood under an authoritarian regime. It hopes to make a significant theoretical contribution to anthropology and the social sciences more generally in its study of affectivity in space and the built environment, as well as in legal and state institution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113170/1","grantId":"113170/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-17","fundEnd":"2006-05-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Yael  Navaro-Yashin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
