{"id":"D5DB5D25-2C45-4DFE-AF6D-F0F8278C6134","title":"Extended Knowledge","abstractText":"A great deal of our acquisition of knowledge is dependent upon the assistance of 'external' factors. For example, it can depend on the use of technology (e.g. your iPhone), or on one's social environment (e.g. when one trusts the word of an expert). Nevertheless, it might be held that knowledge is essentially an 'internal' matter. That is, that while one might make use of external resources when acquiring knowledge, such as instruments (the iPhone) or informants (the expert), whether or not one knows is ultimately just down to the individual and their own 'internal' cognitive resources. It is, after all, the individual who is successfully making use of the instrument, and the individual who makes the decision to rely on the information provided by the expert. While such an 'internalist' account of knowledge has for a long time been central to the theory of knowledge, it has come under pressure in recent years, with the pressure coming from several different quarters. \n\nEpistemic externalism holds that factors about which one is completely unaware can have a significant bearing on whether one has knowledge. For example, some epistemic externalists have argued that when one acquires knowledge the belief-forming process used (e.g. one's eyesight) must be in fact reliable, whether or not one is aware that this process is reliable. \n\nContent externalism holds that environmental factors can have a bearing on the content of one's mental states (i.e., what those mental states are about). For example, some content externalists have argued that whether one's thoughts are about a particular substance in the world, such as water, can depend on facts about the chemical composition of the substance in question. Consequently, on this view whether one has knowledge that a particular substance is water can depend on facts about one's environment. \n\nExtended cognition holds that factors which are outside of one's skin can in certain conditions be genuine constituents of one's cognitive processes. So, for example, if an agent and an instrument are related in the right way, then they can potentially form a 'cognitive whole'. Applied to knowledge, extended cognition holds that, say, one's iPhone can in principle be more than just an 'external' instrumental for acquiring knowledge, for it can be a constitutive part of the very cognitive process by which knowledge is acquired.\n\nDistributed cognition holds that in certain conditions--such as in the context of a highly collaborative scientific inquiry--we should think of cognition not at the level of the individual but rather at the level of the group. Applied to knowledge, distributed cognition entails that in certain cases we should collectively ascribe knowledge to a group of agents rather than to the individuals who make up this group.\n\nAll four proposals present a challenge to the 'internalist' conception of knowledge set out above, since in their different ways they undermine the idea that the acquisition of knowledge is primarily due to the 'internal' cognitive resources of the agent concerned. The purpose of this project is to produce, for the very first time, a systematic exploration of these four different ways in which knowledge can be 'externalised'. On the basis of this systematic exploration we will then offer a detailed investigation of two specific ways in which knowledge can be 'extended' that are of particular significance to contemporary cognitive science: extended cognition and distributed cognition.\n\nThe project will draw together an international body of researchers, both early career and established. It will result in a world-class body of research output which will transform the contemporary research agenda in epistemology and philosophy of cognitive science. It will also engage with the public and with non-academic partners, through public lectures, an 'impact' workshop, and via a dedicated project webpage and blog.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011908/1","grantId":"AH/J011908/1","fundValue":"404385","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is still on-going, but we have already had fruitful interactions with educational bodies and with industry, both of whom are interested in the practical ramifications of extended and distributed knowledge. So, for example, in an educational context this is important for understanding how technology and group work should be employed (and assessed) in developing a student's knowledge, which in turn has implications for educational policy.

The main goal of phase one of the project was to offer a theoretical taxonomy of the different ways in which one can 'externalise' knowledge, one that could incorporate the extended cognition and distributed cognition research programmes. This phase is now complete, with a number of published outputs detailing this taxonomy. We believe that there are two principle potential beneficiaries of this research. The first is the educational sector. Extended and distributed knowledge has important implications for how we develop (and assess) a student's academic performance when technology and collaborative interaction is involved. This in turn has implications for educational policy. The second is the commercial sector, specifically with regard to the development of new digital technologies, such as neuromedia.
