{"id":"AACF04B4-2CA4-461C-95CB-99217E3879BF","title":"Population Change, Demographic Uncertainty and Financial Risk","abstractText":"<p>The purpose of this project is to assess economic drivers and economic implications of demographic change and demographic uncertainty in the United Kingdom using appropriate models built round the premise of optimising behaviour by economic agents. The issues we will research are:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Fertility and Fertility Risk: the extent to which historical variations in fertility rates in the UK can be accounted for by variations in the cost of raising children. <br /></li> \n <li>Demographic Risk and Fiscal Uncertainty: the implications of mortality and fertility risk for government borrowing.<br /></li> \n <li>Demographic Risk and the Public Sector: the appropriate public sector handling of fertility and mortality risk, and the question of whether the state is under or over-exposed to it.<br /></li> \n <li>Inheritance as a Means of Spreading Demographic Risk: the extent to which variations in legacies provide a satisfactory means of spreading demographic risk.<br /></li> \n <li>Endogenous Price of Longevity Risk: the pricing of longevity risk in a general equilibrium in the absence of public intervention both in a small open economy, and a closed economy in which old people can protect themselves from mortality risk only at a price that young people are prepared to pay to carry it.</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D001242/1","grantId":"ES/D001242/1","fundValue":"213383","fundStart":"2006-05-02","fundEnd":"2008-08-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Weale","coPersons":["Justin  Van De Ven"],"organisation":"National Institute of Economic & Soc Res","findingsText":" We estimated the extent to which people would rationally want to insure against cohort mortality risk. This suggested that they would not want full insurance. We also showed how governments might manage aggregate mortality risk. Insurance companies selling annuities would find our work valuable. However, the changes introduced in 2014 mean that this aspect of our work is unlikely to be taken forward.
