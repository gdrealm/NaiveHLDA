Within SpiCo, we aim (a) to develop schemes for determining spin-related material parameters in new materials and structures (g-factor, spin-orbit coupling strength) via transport measurements; (b) to develop theory of electron spin dynamics, de-coherence and relaxation in quantum dot and double-dot semiconductor spin qubits; and (c) to find conditions for incoherent and coherent transfer of spin in nano/micro- circuits and methods of detection of spin currents.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D062918/1","grantId":"EP/D062918/1","fundValue":"270502","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Falko","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
