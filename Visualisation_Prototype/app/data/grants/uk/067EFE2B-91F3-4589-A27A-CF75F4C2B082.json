Centre research will consist of new initiatives aiming to rethink the role of risk in academic research and to make it more relevant for the economy at large. The Centre research will be guided by academic principles and rigour, drawn from decision sciences, sociology, evolutionary biology, political economy and computer science, in addition to our core areas of finance, statistics and economics. The focus of the research will be centred around four interrelated themes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Endogenous risk, financial policy and risk forecasting</li>\n\n <li>Computer-Based Trading, High-Frequency Trading and endogenous market crashes</li>\n\n <li>The impact of rules and decision-making</li>\n\n <li>Network risk.</li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002309/1","grantId":"ES/K002309/1","fundValue":"3757470","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Danielsson","coPersons":["Philip  Treleaven","Robert Charles Hancke","Julia Mary Black","Tomaso  Aste","Christian  Julliard","Kathy  Yuan","Jean Pierre Armand Zigrand","Ronald Wayne Anderson","Eva  Micheler"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
