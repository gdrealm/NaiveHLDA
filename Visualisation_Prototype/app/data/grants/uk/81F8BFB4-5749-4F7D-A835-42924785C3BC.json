The most severe criticism has been reserved for social services departments when children have died or been harmed, as a result of child abuse or neglect. This study is concerned with examining the impact of the anticipation of ‘error’ or ‘blame’ on the everyday work of professionals in children’s services. Child welfare professionals have to negotiate complex decision-making activities for which they feel and are held accountable. These may be about safeguarding children for example, or about resource allocations, or aspects of performance management. These competing accountabilities create an extremely complex set of tasks, which are generally poorly understood and over-simplified in both media and policy debates. </p>\n\n<p>This study explores how practitioners and managers manage these demands in their everyday practice. The study involves 2 phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Ethnography (in 4 sites)</li>\n\n <li>Micro-world simulations derived from cognitive ergonomics and based on the ethnography will be developed to explore decision-making and its rationale.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The micro-world will be developed as a generic tool, able to be populated with different samples of cases to be used for a variety of training and management development activities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-166-25-0048-A","grantId":"RES-166-25-0048-A","fundValue":"282520","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  White","coPersons":["David  Wastell","A  Pithouse"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
