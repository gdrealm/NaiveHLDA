{"id":"EAA01A4A-52D9-4CD1-AD61-DD2B5CFD01AB","title":"Drawing over the Colour Line: geographies of art and cosmopolitan politics in London 1919 - 1939","abstractText":"The influence of the Harlem Renaissance - when African-Americans created a revolution in music, art and literature in New York - has become an important element in understanding cultural, social and political change in New York, as well as in European cities such as Paris and Amsterdam in the 1920s and 1930s. \\n\\nLike New York and Paris interwar London played host to the meetings of many intellectuals, students and workers in the realms of anti-colonial, nationalist and Pan-African politics, to name just a few examples. The extent to which the Black and Asian actors who initiated these political and social debates influenced new artistic practices and forms in the city is not yet understood. \\n\\nThis project will recover the lives of Black and Asian men and women who worked as artists and artists' models in London between 1919 and 1939 and seeks to understand the role they played in the changing artistic, social, cultural and political scenes that emerged in interwar London. Examining the archives of art collections as well as personal papers, autobiographies and memoirs, it will reconstruct the historical geographies of these men and women, their friends, colleagues, and the spaces they inhabited. These places included social meeting places in Soho such as the Florence Mills club and social and political clubs such as the socialist International Club in Shoreditch.\\n\\nIn particular the project will ask:\\n\\n1. What was the relationship between artists who depicted cosmopolitan life in their art and Black and Asian activists who were living and working in the city?\\n\\n2. What were the life experiences of Black and Asian sitters? How did the personal relationships between artists and sitters influence these experiences?\\n\\n3. To what extent were activists influenced by artists in the formation and expression of their political ideas? \\n\\n4. How have Black and Asian artists and sitters been remembered and forgotten in public memory and art historiography?\\n\\nWe will produce a number of outputs from the research. In addition to academic papers, two exhibition displays using material from the research will be held. A database of the material recovered will be made available via the UCL Equiano Centre website, and images (where available) provided with contextual information with an online gallery. In addition an online map with the location of people and places (such as art schools and studios, clubs and private homes) will be mapped and annotated as a walk. This will be available to download from the website and will also be given as a guided walk to those who are unable to attend the guided walks in London. \\n\\nBy advancing the understanding of the relationship between art and cosmopolitan identities between the Wars, the outcomes of this research will be of interest to a range of audiences including academics, curators, heritage practitioners and community scholars researching the Black and Asian presence in Britain.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I027371/1","grantId":"AH/I027371/1","fundValue":"159750","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2013-11-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used in various ways, in developing resources for public history and outreach to academic outputs. \n\nThe details of over 600 artworks, artists, and individuals of African and Asian heritage linked with the interwar artworld from DCL have been drawn together and compiled onto a database which will be made public in January 2015.\n\nDrawing Over the Colour Line engaged in several successful planned public engagement outputs during the life of the project. These were:\n? The establishment of Queer Black Spaces, an event which took place in February 2013 exploring queer black history in relation to visual culture. This event was attended by over 100 people\n? Black Bloomsbury, the autumn 2013 UCL Art Museum exhibition of material from UCL special collections and UCL Art Museum curated by the Drawing Over the Colour Line project team\n? The awarding of a UCL Grand Challenge grant to project member Gemma Romain and UCL colleague Debbie Challis (Petrie Museum, UCL) to create a collaborative project and exhibition between the Equiano Centre and the Petrie Museum on the influence of ancient Egyptian sculpture on modernist artists, including Jacob Epstein and Ronald Moody (two artists from the Drawing Over the Colour Line project). This exhibition, A Fusion of Worlds: Ancient Egypt, African Art and Identity in Modernist Britain, took place at the Petrie Museum from 11 March to 24 May 2014\n? The creation of two self-guided walking tours, one on Soho and one on Bloomsbury\n? The creation of postcards of artwork distributed to local libraries and venues in various locations \n? In 2012 running a one-day workshop with AS level students at City and Islington College which included a guided walking tour of Black Bloomsbury, a discussion about the Black presence in London and its with the art world of the 1920s and 1930s, and the students wrote blog posts based upon their encounter with artworks from the UCL Art Museum which feature in DCL. The day resulted in a pop-up exhibition at UCL Art Museum, highlighting the artworks and students writings.

Our research focused on uncovering and analysing the links between the art world and the Black presence in London, concentrating on the diverse and complex hidden histories of artist models of African and Asian heritage whose lives have left a trace in memoirs, archival documentation as well as many artworks. We explored these hidden histories by searching through interwar exhibition catalogues, newspapers such as the Illustrated London News, through auction houses and physical archives including the archives of the UCL Slade School of Fine Art, Hornsey Art School, the Royal Academy, the Royal College of Art and Camberwell School of Art, as well as The National Archives, the Henry Moore Institute, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library, the archives of Yale Center for British Art. We uncovered histories relating to several Indian artists who studied at the Slade and the Royal College of Art, we uncovered visual evidence of artists models of African heritage who posed for students in the Slade School of Fine Art. We also uncovered stories of networks of friendship, romance and political interactions between black interwar individuals (artists, writers, activists, and artists' models) and the art world, including figures such as the Jamaican born activists and writer Claude McKay, the Jamaican feminist, poet and broadcaster Una Marson, the writer and activist Mulk Raj Anand, CLR James, the author of the Black Jacobins, and the Africa American entertainer Jimmie Daniels.\n\n1.

The findings are currently being used by Tate Britain in a spotlight display from 13 October 2014 until 29 March 2015. The display, Spaces of Black Modernism, was co-curated with Tate Britain and the Drawing Over the Colour Line team. A public programme of events around the display began in October 2014 and will continue until July 2015 with a conference for academics, artists, heritage workers and the general public; an event focusing on queer histories; workshops with museums and engaging the wider public with the results that will be made available from a database. This programme is being supported by an AHRC Follow-on funding grant: AH/M003469/1, Black Modernism: Historical geographies of cosmopolitan lives in interwar London.
