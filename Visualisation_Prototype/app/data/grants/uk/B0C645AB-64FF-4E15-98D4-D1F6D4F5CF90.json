Problems arise, however, when the doctor cannot find a disease to explain the aches and pains. The aches and pains alone then become the problem and the aches and pains alone define the disease. These types of aches and pains, that don?t have any known disease as a cause, are called ?functional?. There are many functional pains including fibromyalgia, where patients report feeling bruised all over, and several types of low back pain. These problems are common, accounting for roughly one out of every five visits to a family doctor. The problems are also very difficult to treat with around three out of four patients still suffering from the same aches and pains more than ten years after their first visit to a doctor. During that time the aches and pains reduce quality of life, often prevent or reduce the ability to work and may have other bad effects on health. There is a pressing need for improved understanding and treatment of these functional pains. The lack of any obvious disease in the body to account for the aches and pains has led to an increasing interest in how the brain might respond to pain in these patients. Modern brain scanners allow us to peer directly at the living, working brain and we have developed a series of procedures that allow us to change a person?s pain experience while they are scanned. One surprising finding is that a mild pain that follows a strong pain is not felt as painful. Recently we have discovered that this surprising fall in pain is due a small part of the brain becoming active and somehow blocking further pain experience. We want to know if this small part of the brain is working in the same way in patients with unexplained aches and pains. We suspect that it is not. If we are right, then our studies will provide a way to explain why some patients feel aches and pains even though their body is not injured and there are no signs of disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802156","grantId":"G0802156","fundValue":"204095","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart William Derbyshire","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
