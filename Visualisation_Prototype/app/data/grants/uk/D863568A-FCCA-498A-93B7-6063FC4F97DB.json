Laboratory experiments with cold atoms have realised a step change of\napproximately 1000 times improvement in both inertial navigation and in timing over conventional atomic clocks. These\nQuantum Technologies (QT) are emerging to form a new market that will revolutionise many aspects of our daily lives. Cold\natom based QT devices are now forming the next generation of sensing equipment, including atomic clocks (satellite-free\nnavigation, finance and power synchronisation), gravimeters (military, underground and sub-surface detection) and secure\ncommunications (banking and information exchange).\nEach QT device will require a source of cold atoms. With a conventional approach the sub-systems required for producing\ncold atom clouds typically occupy a large fraction of a laboratory. The creation and subsequent integration of these subsystems\nalso represents a significant time commitment, with experiments often requiring several months to a year before\nachieving a sufficiently optimised cloud.\nThe excessive size and complexity of conventional systems will certainly hinder QT devices from exploring their complete\nmarket potential. Achieving this will require a drastic improvement in the mobility of such systems, requiring them to\nbecome smaller and more robust. This will facilitate QT devices becoming portable, allowing them to leave the laboratory\nsetting and to become technology rather than research apparatus. Furthermore, for QT devices to impact upon a diverse\nrange of markets it is necessary to commercialise and support the creation of a supply chain, driving down costs and\nincreasing reliability.\nThe aim of this project is to enable this through development of an &quot;all-in-one&quot; unit, the FreezeRay, which will be able to\nfunction as the core engine for a variety of cold atom experiments. This will be achieved through advancement of a novel\nall-fibre based laser system and the development of a small form factor vacuum system with limited pumping dependence.\nThe resulting integrated package will then form the centre point for numerous follow on QT devices or experiments.\nTo develop the FreezeRay engine we have formed a consortium of two industrial and one academic partners. The\nUniversity of Birmingham, Cold atoms group possesses a strong background in miniaturisation of cold atom systems,\nthrough novel developments in vacuum and laser systems. UoB will apply their knowledge to the system design phase,\nensuring the design specifications will provide a cold atom source suitable for integration into QT devices. Gooch &amp;\nHousego will apply their world leading expertise in photonics to develop a fully fibre based laser system alongside the\ncontrol and stabilisation electronics. The laser system will employ frequency doubling of a telecom laser source. This allows\nmuch of the system to be based upon telecom technology, reducing cost and improving reliability. e2v will use their strong\nbackground in the development of small, self-contained vacuum cells to create a novel and compact vacuum system which\nthey will then integrate with the laser system. Following completion of the unit, UoB will characterise and evaluate the\nsystem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508238/1","grantId":"EP/M508238/1","fundValue":"35833","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vincent  Boyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
