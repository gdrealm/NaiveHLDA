However many viruses can not be controlled via this route for various technical reasons. Unlike bacterial infections that can be treated with antibiotics, there are currently very few drugs that can be used as anti-virals. We have recently discovered a promising novel route for the development of such anti-viral drugs and our proposal is to develop the tools needed for such a treatment strategy to become a reality. A critical part of any drug development porgramme is an assay to determine the effects of the drug, in this case the ability of our test virsues to assembly correctly. Standard experimental methods for this are expensive, time consuming and impractical. By using a technique called single-molecule fluoresence spectroscopy these problems can be avoided and we will be able to automate the assays allowing high-throughput screening for candidate drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J00667X/1","grantId":"BB/J00667X/1","fundValue":"384019","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter George Stockley","coPersons":["Roman  Tuma","David John Rowlands"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
