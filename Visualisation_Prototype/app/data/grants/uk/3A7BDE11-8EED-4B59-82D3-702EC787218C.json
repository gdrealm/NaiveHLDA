The high beam quality and intensities of ISAC-2 beams are well adapted to transfer studies, and the energies have now reached 4.5 - 5.0 MeV/A, where the shapes of the differential cross sections are characteristic of the transferred angular momentum and the optical model analyses to obtain spectroscopic factors is reasonable and proven.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H003681/1","grantId":"ST/H003681/1","fundValue":"5627","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Claire Boston","coPersons":["Andrew John Boston"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
