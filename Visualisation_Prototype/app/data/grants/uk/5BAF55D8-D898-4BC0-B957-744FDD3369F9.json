{"id":"5BAF55D8-D898-4BC0-B957-744FDD3369F9","title":"Structure-function studies on the mammalian nucleoplasmic reticulum","abstractText":"Animal cells separate their genes (DNA) from the rest of the cell inside a nucleus with a complex boundary dotted with tightly regulated ?border crossings?. In many cells the boundary is a simple spherical shape, but we are increasingly detecting cells in which narrow channels of this boundary fence push into the nucleus and form branches. This unusual structure has been called the nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR) and is attracting the attention of scientists because abnormal cells, especially some types of cancer cell, seem to make a much more elaborate version of this structure.\n\nIn this project we will use state-of-the-art microscopy techniques to follow the lifecycle of the NR in living cells, both normal and cancer cells. We will examine the formation of these channels as well as their inheritance when cells divide, and we will use a special electron microscopy technique that uses the same method as CT scanning patients in hospital to reconstruct these structures in fine detail. These experiments will be done in cells that naturally lack or contain NR. We will then exploit a recent observation that one of the types of drug used to treat AIDS patients causes a huge increase in NR to repeat our studies in cells forced to make new NR.\n\nOur overall goal is to analyse how these structures assemble and move in normal and cancer cells so that we can understand the significance of increased NR in damaged cells, especially cancer cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801917","grantId":"G0801917","fundValue":"402629","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Vaux","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
