{"id":"76DDB081-DAE2-4AEC-A861-494E11687C53","title":"Exploring the conceptual structure of nouns and verbs","abstractText":"<p>Concepts are essential to mental life - they allow us to think about the world, and to communicate these thoughts. Much of psycholinguistic research converges on the view that the meaning of a concept can be decomposed into individual features (eg a tiger has eyes, is carnivorous, etc). Within this framework, the statistical properties of individual features determine how concepts are processed in language tasks. For example, the higher the number of features (NOF) in a concept, and the more highly correlated the features (feature correlation; eg many animals have the features has eyes and has ears), the faster the concept is processed. Moreover, highly distinctive features (eg a cow's udder) facilitate subsequent recognition of their concept. However, most of these claims have been based on data from one type of concept only - concrete nouns. One major class of concepts that has been neglected yet is central to our thinking about the world is verbs. In a series of four behavioural experiments, we aim to examine whether variables that affect how nouns are represented and processed (feature correlation, feature distinctiveness and NOF) apply to verbs as well. The results of these studies will provide the foundation of a more comprehensive model of conceptual knowledge across word classes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E009859/1","grantId":"ES/E009859/1","fundValue":"60460","fundStart":"2006-09-06","fundEnd":"2008-03-05","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorraine Komisarjevsky Tyler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
