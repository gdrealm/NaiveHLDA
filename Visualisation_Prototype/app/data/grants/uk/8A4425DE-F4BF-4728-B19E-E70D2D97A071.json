It is envisaged that the activities and presentations we develop could be used equally well with members of the public. \n\nThis will:\n\n1) Generate interest in space research, and science in general, amongst school children and members of the public;\n\n2) Raise awareness of the impact of space weather and the efforts being taken to further our understanding of it;\n\n3) Use a real rocket launch to capture the imagination of young children and show where studying STEM subjects can lead;\n\n4) Generate increased interest in STEM subjects;\n\n5) Provide a focus and context for the teaching of science and technology curriculum topics (e.g. forces, space exploration, spectrometers, electronics (including Charge Coupled Devices for A level students)).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K002732/1","grantId":"ST/K002732/1","fundValue":"5960","fundStart":"2012-11-14","fundEnd":"2014-02-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Arrow  Lee","coPersons":["Matthew Justin Hills"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
