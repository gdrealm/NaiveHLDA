The nanoantennas are used as an efficient channel for electromagnetic radiation from the far field to the nanometric volume occupied by the single molecule, therefore enhancing its interaction with radiation. This enables functional spectroscopy of single molecules without relying on intrinsic molecular resonances. The rational design of the nanoantenna/molecule interface will be applicable to a wide variety of molecular systems via careful design of the underlying plasmonic resonances. We will focus on single-walled carbon nanotubes as a particularly relevant molecular test bed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H006400/1","grantId":"EP/H006400/1","fundValue":"203061","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan Alexander Maier","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" * Development of optical nanoantennas that can be interfaced with single carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphene for field-enhanced studies of their physical properties via Raman scattering\n\n* Surface enhanced Raman scattering of suspended graphene sheets as an efficient means to characterize hot spots of plasmonic field enhancement via observation of the associated strain in the vicinity of the metal particle\n\n* Development of a easy methodology to enhance the field enhancement of metallic nano * graphene sheets coupled to metallic nanostructures as sensitizers for biochemical sensing Chemicals,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
