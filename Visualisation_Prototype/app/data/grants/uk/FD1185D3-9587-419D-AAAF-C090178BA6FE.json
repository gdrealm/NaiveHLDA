{"id":"FD1185D3-9587-419D-AAAF-C090178BA6FE","title":"Ice NUcleation Process Investigation And Quantification","abstractText":"In this proposal we are seeking funds to take part in a field campaign that we have been invited to contribute to, which has international participants, is multidisciplinary, and will study aerosol-cloud interactions at the Jungfraujoch mountain site in the Swiss Alps in winter 2013.\n\nThis is a cost effective and timely project, building on previous NERC investment. \n\nThe Earth's radiation budget is very greatly affected by clouds, and human-induced changes to the particle loading affecting them, known as indirect effects, are large and highly uncertain. A large part of this uncertainty is the result of poor knowledge of the fundamental aerosol and cloud properties and processes, leading to their poor representation in the current state-of-the-science models. Indeed the IPCC did not have any assessment of the sign, let alone the uncertainty in radiative forcing, which was attributable to the effects of aerosols on ice clouds as they thought that the uncertainties were at present too large.\n\nHypotheses:\n1. That the rapid transitions between ice and mixed phase / liquid clouds are due to aerosol-cloud interactions.\n2. That the number of ice crystals within the clouds observed at Jungfraujoch can be explained by the heterogeneous IN observed at a site upwind of the clouds\n3. That laboratory derived ice nucleation parameterisations, based on surrogates of atmospheric particles (e.g. dust, biological particles, soot) are adequate to explain primary ice formation rates within the clouds.\n4. That the ice-ice aggregation rates derived from the NERC SIMPLEX project (PI: Connolly) can be used to explain ice-ice aggregation in the real atmosphere. \n5. That the secondary ice multiplication is a strong contributor to ice within these clouds.\n\nWe propose to gain further insight into these problems and test these hypotheses by conducting a field campaign followed by extensive data analysis and modelling. \n\nThe field campaign will have several novel facets:\n1. State-of-the-science cloud microphysics measurements, including, 2DS and CPI-3V.\n2. Novel measurements of biological, dust, black carbon, volatile and total aerosols as well as their enrichment within ice particles at the site.\n3. Measurements of ice nuclei using IN counters, both at the site (in-cloud) and at an upwind site.\n4. A proven collaboration with international partners, involving scientists from Switzerland and several institutes in Germany.\n5. Expertise from NCAS instrument scientists in the deployment of instruments into the field.\n6. Measurements of profiles of aerosols and turbulence using lidar at the upwind site.\n\nIn order to interpret the measurements we will use a detailed aerosol-cloud and precipitation interactions model, developed at Manchester as part of the APPRAISE research programme by the PI: Connolly. This will enable us to take the aerosols measured at two sites and use them to test ice nucleation parameterisations in the model and verify them against data from ice nucleus counters and in-cloud measurements of ice crystal concentrations. The model will be used to derive enrichment factors for the different particles. It will also allow us to address the various objectives.\n\nThe data analysis and modelling program will benefit from:\n1. Expertise from NCAS instrument scientists in the analysis of data and derivation of data products.\n2. PDRA: Christopher Dearden who has a range of expertise in modelling cloud microphysical processes using both mesoscale models and detailed bin microphysics models.\n3. PDRA: Ian Crawford who has a range of expertise in field deployment of microphysics probes and interpretation.\n4. Close collaboration with colleagues in the field ice nucleation and parameterisation so that the latest developments can be incorporated into the analysis.\n\nWe feel that there is the potential to make large gains here by bringing together world leading scientists to the same field campaign with similar, but distinct aims.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K006002/1","grantId":"NE/K006002/1","fundValue":"479474","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  It is too early for the assessment of any impact.

Since then we have been investigating a number of important findings from the measurements. The most significant is that the ice crystal concentrations measured in mixed-phase clouds are frequently 1000 per litre at -15C. These are several orders of magnitude higher than expected based on current understanding. Early indications are that these high concentrations significantly affect the evolution of the cloud radiative properties and precipitation from them (we have been using a meso-scale model to untangle these effects). We believe that the reasons for this are an ice crystal multiplication mechanism that, as yet, has not been identified. It is thought that this will be a significant finding for weather forecasts in these and other regions. \n\nOther important findings surround the influence of dust and biological particles on the ice phase. We have evidence to suggest a link between the aerosol particles and the ice phase and are investigating this further.\n\nThe project has allowed for a critical assessment of the calculation of ice crystal concentrations in clouds that are not affected by artifacts such as particle fragmentation on inlets - in contrast to aircraft measurements. Hence, we are critcally evaluating the different techniques and will be publishing these to the scientific communittee, which also involved private sector companies / probe manufacturers. We are collaborating with the Met Office. The key finding they are interested in is whether an improvement in forcasting the conditions is possible by including the aerosol properties or other microphysical phenomena, such as ice multiplication.
