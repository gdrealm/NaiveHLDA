This proposal focuses on uncovering the mechanisms controlling the stability of proteins, particularly in response to two gases, oxygen, and the signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO). We will discover proteins that require a lack of oxygen or NO to become stable. This is important because there are examples of times during the plant life-cycle, and in response to changes in the environment (for example during flooding) when it is essential that plants can perceive a lack of oxygen or NO. This work will uncover the molecular processes that allow plants to respond to gases and provide molecular resources and conceptual frameworks that plant breeders and growers can use to change plant traits and make plants more adapted to climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M007820/1","grantId":"BB/M007820/1","fundValue":"379130","fundStart":"2015-02-16","fundEnd":"2018-02-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Holdsworth","coPersons":["Neil  Oldham"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
