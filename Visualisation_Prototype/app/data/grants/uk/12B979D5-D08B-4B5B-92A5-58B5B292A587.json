The searchable virtual library will bring together, and allow cross-searching of, both the 'official' records of British government in Ireland 1800-1922 (from the EPPI virtual library of enhanced parliamentary papers), and the 'unofficial' testimonies and records of Irish migrants and their families contained in the Irish Emigration Database (IED) for the 18th-20th centuries, and the Narratives of Migration and Return, Ulster (NMR) database of oral history sources for the later 20th century. The integrated resource will offer the public access to an unparalleled wealth of resources for investigating the social, economic and political history of the island in the 'long nineteenth century' and the experience of its internal and external migrants in a longer period stretching from the eighteenth century to the recent past. Users will be able to compare statistical and quantitative information (drawn for example from the officially published census, agricultural returns and emigration reports) with the qualitative evidence for historical experience contained in the public testimonies collected in the great nineteenth-century Irish social inquiries, included in EPPI, and the more private communications featured in letters to and from migrant families in IED and the oral narratives of migration and return that comprise the NMR. The addition of GIS mapping to support the resources will allow sources relating to specific places to be spatially located and linked across time. It is intended that DIPPAM will facilitate and encourage new kinds of research into modern Irish history through juxtaposing and integrating a variety of sources - quantitative and qualitative, official and unofficial, public and private. Migration history, as a central dimension of the modern Irish historical experience and its impact on Britain and the wider world, will be particularly highlighted by bundling the three resources together, but the combined scope of the three resources extends well beyond migration to the structures of society, demography, religion, the economy and political relations that shaped country that emigrants left. DIPPAM will be built around and guarantee the sustainability of these three 'core' resources in the first instance, one of which (EPPI) is no longer supported by its originating institution, and the other two (IED and NMR) have currently restricted accessibility. However it is also intended to be flexible, and to allow the addition of further relevant virtual libraries for Irish history hosted by QUB in the future. DIPPAM will be an essential resource for academic researchers working on nineteenth-early twentieth-century Irish history, on British-Irish relations, and on Irish migration history since the eighteenth century, but it is equally oriented towards a plethora of non-academic users in Ireland and elsewhere who may lack access to research libraries, especially local and amateur historians and historical societies, family historians and genealogists, secondary level schools and tertiary colleges, and heritage officers and facilitators in the museums, archives and libraries sector and in local government. The project will be run in partnership with the Centre for Migration Studies, based in the National Museums of Northern Ireland, to promote its non-academic impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037586/1","grantId":"AH/H037586/1","fundValue":"111768","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The resource is calculated to be of importance to a number of key non-academic user groups, who have been engaged\nthrough the project outreach activities. These groups, are:\n(1) Family historians / genealogists. Family history in NI is supported by voluntary bodies such as the North of Ireland Family History Society (NIFHS) and the Ulster Historical Foundation (UHF). The resources bundled as DIPPAM are very rich in qualitatively high family-history data, particularly in the form of oral/written migration narratives and witness statements to social inquiries. These sources are now searchable by keyword (including name and place). The\nsocial context of family history is enriched by the wealth of other social statistics and evidence (including census\nreports) available through EPPI. The project group has been engaged through direct contact to geneaological organisations (such as the UHF, Geneaological Society of Ireland, and Irish Ancestral Research Association), which have passed on information about DIPPAM to their members and posted links on their webpage of facebook sites. The PI has also discussed linkage to DIPPAM with the development officer of Ancestry.com.\n(2) Local historians. Northern Ireland and the Republic are particularly well-served by a network of active amateur local\nhistory societies, many of which publish their own journals, hold regular public events, and collaborate with local heritage\ninstitutions. These are coordinated by the Federation of Local History Societies, and the Federation for Ulster Local Studies. DIPPAM makes available to amateur local historians a wealth of historical primary sources (quantitative and\nqualitative) on social conditions, crime, political unrest, population, migration, health and welfare etc, searchable by location keyword, to support their individual and collective work on local history. The PI has disseminated information on the resource to FLHS and FULS and directly to over 30 local history societies in Ireland. Members of the project team have made presentations to a number of societies on DIPPAM.\n(3.) Secondary schools / tertiary colleges. History, particularly modern Irish history, retains a strong place in the curricula of\nsecondary and tertiary-level education institutions in Ireland, North and South. Many schools in GB also teach this period of\nIrish history as an OCR A level survey paper. Increasingly, historical education has moved towards practical projects using primary sources. DIPPAM makes accessible to teachers and pupils, in a user-friendly format, a range of primary sources relating to modern Irish history. Records of personal experience, especially testimonies in migration narratives and\nverbatim evidence to social inquiries, will be of particular interest and use in theclassroom environment. The PI has made a presentation on using DIPPAM in the classroom to a workshop for NI history teachers and put information on Irish History Live (http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/irishhistorylive/).\n(4) Heritage institutions. Institutions in the museums, archives and libraries sector, and in local government, frequently have officers charged with curating historical exhibitions and artefacts, and facilitating public engagement with the historical dimensions of their collections and sites. The Centre for Migration Studies, is a DCAL-funded research body located within the National Museums of Northern Ireland, and part of Libraries NI with close connections to PRONI and other heritage institutions and agents within NI and the Republic of Ireland. PI has presented DIPPAM at PRONI and ensured user access there.\n(5) Global Irish Studies users. Irish Studies as an interdisciplinary research and education field is widely dispersed, particularly but not exclusively in countries with a strong Irish diasporic presence. DIPPAM has been promoted to users overseas through contacts with key Irish Studies co-ordinating bodies. PI made presentation on using DIPPAM to American Conference for Irish Studies in USA, 2011.
