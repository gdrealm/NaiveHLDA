The ambition of ClearfLo is to provide integrated measurements of the meteorology, composition and particulate loading of London's urban atmosphere, made at street level and at elevated sites, complemented by modelling, to improve predictive capability for air quality. This ambition will be addressed by establishing new measurement capabilities in London, which will be used for long-term measurements and intensive observation periods, and by analysis and modelling of the measurements to establish key processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H003150/1","grantId":"NE/H003150/1","fundValue":"430685","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings are currently being used to assess aersool lodings for human exposure studies in london.

We have shown that secondary aerosols account for a significant fraction of the submicron aerosol burden and that high concentration events are governed by different factors depending on season. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on an annual basis there is no variability in the extent of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) oxidation, as defined by the oxygen content, irrespective of amount. This result was surprising given the changes in precursor emissions and contributions as well as photochemical activity throughout the year; however it\nmay make the characterisation of SOA in urban environments more straightforward than previously supposed and hence aid applications to determine human exposure to these particles.\nComponents of the organic aerosol fraction are determined using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) where five aerosol factors were identified and attributed as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking OA (COA), solid fuel burning OA (SFOA), type 1 oxygenated OA (OOA1), and type 2 oxygenated OA (OOA2).\nDiurnal, monthly, and seasonal trends were measured for\n25 different aerosol species, due to meteorological conditions, specific nature of the aerosols, and availability\nof precursors. Regional and transboundary pollution as well as other individual pollution events influence Londonâ€™s total submicron aerosol burden. High concentrations\nof non-refractory submicron aerosols in London are governed by particulate emissions in winter, especially nitrate and SFOA, whereas SOA formation drives the high concentrations during the summer. The findings from this work could have significant implications for modelling of urban air pollution as well as for the effects of atmospheric aerosols on health and climate.
