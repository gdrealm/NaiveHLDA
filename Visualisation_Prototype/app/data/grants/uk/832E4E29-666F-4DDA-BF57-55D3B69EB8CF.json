How is the international community responding to piracy and what makes it so difficult to address the problem? This three year research project analyses the international response to contemporary maritime piracy.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on an International Political Sociology approach and contemporary practice theory, the project studies the global governance of piracy and the institutional arrangements in three piracy infested regions, East Africa, West Africa and East Asia. It sets out to understand the consequences of counter-piracy for ocean governance and maritime security strategy, and it attempts to strengthen the profile of maritime security studies in the UK. The outcomes of the project will also be of interest for maritime security practitioners as well as the shipping industry.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008358/1","grantId":"ES/K008358/1","fundValue":"241600","fundStart":"2013-11-09","fundEnd":"2016-11-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  Bueger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
