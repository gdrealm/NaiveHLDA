{"id":"75FF3B61-C073-4CCD-BF0E-B749CE01575C","title":"KSHV infection and immunity","abstractText":"Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) causes certain cancers. In particular, KSHV causes Kaposi sarcoma and lymphomas. Kaposi sarcoma is a tumour found particularly in immunosuppressed individuals. That means this cancer is common in HIV infected individuals and also in those immunosuppressed after organ transplant. Kaposi sarcoma and KSHV provide an ideal opportunity to study the role of the immune system in controlling cancer. We will study how the immune system fights this virus and how KSHV escapes recognition by the immune system. By understanding the immune system?s role in controlling these cancers we can develop new treatments not only for Kaposi?s sarcoma but also for other cancers. Such therapies include vaccines to treat or prevent the development of cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9825083","grantId":"G9825083","fundValue":"1567160","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Boshoff","coPersons":["Frances M Gotch"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
