{"id":"BBA8E427-AFE1-4CA3-AB0B-F5906458633C","title":"Women from Muslim Communities and Politics in Britain and France","abstractText":"<p>This research aims to find out how Muslim women in Britain and France constitute themselves as social and political actors as a result of their interactions within the structural frameworks and political cultures of the two countries being studied. In the West, Muslim women are either viewed through the optic of culture, religion, or both as essentialised figures of oppression and victimhood or they are represented as sexualised ‘others’. Neither of these depictions allows for their empowerment through social or political agency. </p> \n<p>The research explores the way in which the articulation of gender, ethnicity (or ethnicities) and faith impacts on Muslim women’s political participation; how, in Britain and France, these women identify facilitators and obstacles within Islam, their specific ethnic communities and in western majority society in order to negotiate ways of living and acting within the private sphere of family and the public political arena. Britain and France are selected as sites of comparison because these are two major (EU) democracies; traditionally, they constitute subjects of comparison in political science due to differences between their political histories, cultures and institutions; both countries have large Muslim populations and hence offer a vast scope for examining Muslim women’s political participation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E012523/1","grantId":"ES/E012523/1","fundValue":"274500","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Danièle Simone Joly","coPersons":["Khursheed  Wadia"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
