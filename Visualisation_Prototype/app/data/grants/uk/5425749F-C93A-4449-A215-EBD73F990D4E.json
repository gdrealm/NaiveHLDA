Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas and increasing concentrations of this chemical compound in the atmosphere causes climate warming. Understanding the temporal and spatial response of Earth's climate system to changing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is a pressing issue for all of human society across the planet. One way to make such an assessment is to look back into the past and to reconstruct past temperature changes and to relate such variability to records of past atmospheric composition.\n\nDespite the significance of global warming, long instrumental records of changing seawater temperature in the past are not available for all of the geographical regions which interest climate scientists, or such instrumental records do not extend far enough back in time. Therefore, in order to place the most recent instrumental records of seawater temperature change in a longer temporal context, as well as to enable reconstruction of past seawater temperature where instrumental records do not exist, it is important to delve deeper into history by application of what is called a proxy-based temperature reconstruction approach. Elements and isotope ratios of some elements, when incorporated into calcium carbonate biominerals (including corals, mollusc shells and some plankton), have demonstrated potential to be used as the proxy means of reconstructing the magnitude and rates of change of seawater temperatures, for those time periods before the existence of instrumental records and for geographical regions where such instrumental records do not exist. Such an approach has long been applied to low latitude warm-water corals, since they form easily dated annual growth increments, but these organisms are restricted in distribution to the warm low latitudes.\n\nArctica islandica is a marine bivalve mollusc that inhabits those middle to high latitude shelf seas that border the North Atlantic Ocean and individuals of this species have been shown to live for up to ~400 years. Furthermore, this organism (like a warm-water coral) deposits easily identified and dated annual shell growth increments, the composition of which has the potential to enable reconstruction of proxy-based records of past seawater temperature, on a calendar timescale (by counting annual growth increments from a known date of death), for the last few centuries and even for the last millennium (when shells of individuals are cross-correlated using the same approach as is applied to tree rings). However, to be able to generate these proxy-based records of past seawater temperature it is critically important that robust calibrations are derived, which document the strength of the relationship between the proxy measurement and seawater temperature, as well as identifying any limitations with any proxy. This detailed and systematic study will be the first use of specimens of A. islandica, which have already been cultured at constant seawater temperatures in laboratory aquaria, under controlled conditions, to derive calibrations for three novel temperature proxies. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to the development of proxies for reconstructing past seawater temperatures, because such experiments allow for shell growth under controlled conditions. Once these calibrations have been determined the next step, in a follow-up project, will be to generate long time-series records of past seawater temperature change in different parts of the North Atlantic Ocean. Such records then will further climate scientist's understanding of the past and future evolution of climate in a geographical region which is of direct relevance to the UK and western Europe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J012866/1","grantId":"NE/J012866/1","fundValue":"42914","fundStart":"2012-12-09","fundEnd":"2015-12-08","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Leon John Clarke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Manchester Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
