To be used this information must be copied into a related polymer, RNA. Two major classes of RNA product are made. The stable RNAs play key functional roles in several metabolic pathways, including the protein synthesis. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) carry the information that is used to specify the sequence, and therefore the structure, of the proteins. The mature functional forms of all RNAs are generated by complex pathways, which process the RNAs and assemble them into particles together with specific proteins. At all steps in gene expression, accuracy is of prime importance. However, high fidelity is energetically expensive and systems that are very accurate will always be slower and/or consume more energy than less accurate systems. Very frequently biological pathways combine a moderately accurate process with one or more proof reading steps that detect and either correct or degrade defective products. We hypothesise that RNA maturation pathways are continuously monitored by quality control systems, on which we will be focusing. We would like to understand how problems are detected, and how this leads to the destruction of the defective RNAs or RNA-protein complexes. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms governing nuclear RNA quality control. The many steps required for the production of fucntional RNAs have traditionally been studied as independent processes, and each of the participating groups is an expert in one (or a few) of these. To break new scientific ground pooling of expertises, tools and techniques from different fields and model organisms is needed - and this will be provided by the Nuclear RNA Surveillance network.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010656/1","grantId":"BB/F010656/1","fundValue":"218677","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project formed part of the EUROCORES RNA Quality programme. This network aimed to study RNA metabolism using a combination of genetics, cell biology and biochemical approaches in human cells and budding yeast. \n\nEukaryotic cells contain a huge range RNA species, almost all of which are synthesised by post-transcriptional processing. The degradation of nuclear pre-mRNAs and cytoplasmic mRNAs, as well as accurate 3' processing of many stable RNA species, involves the exosome - a complex of ten core proteins with 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. Since the exosome mediates both precise RNA processing and total RNA degradation (in some cases of the same RNA species under different conditions) the regulation of its activity is of key importance and is mediated by multiple nuclear and cytoplasmic cofactors. \n\nA major component of this project was the identification, in collaboration with other participants in the network, of novel cofactors for the exosome. The Tollervey and Jacquier labs jointly published a report on the characterization of a novel RNA quality control factor Mpp6 (Milligan et al. 2008). The Tollervey and Proudfoot labs worked closely together to co-submit two papers describing a novel mechanism in the termination of transcription by RNAs Polymerase I (El Hage et al. 2008, Kawauchi et al. 2008). Of these, the paper by the Tollervey lab made use of reagents provided by the Proudfoot lab. Both of these projects were proposed in the initial application by the Tollervey lab.\n\nThe analysis of other factors that were identified in our genetic screens together with the Jacquier group are still ongoing. The analyses were more challenging than anticipated and required the development of new techniques for determining the location and distribution of modified forms of RNA polymerase II. We anticipate that these analyses will both give significant biological insights and provide tools that are of wide applicability.

We hypothesised that RNA maturation pathways are continuously monitored by quality control systems, on which were focusing. In this project we identified new factors involved in these important quality control pathways. We found these factors genetically in budding yeast, but very closely related proteins are also present in human cells, where they appear to have the same roles. This knowledge is important for understanding how genes expression is regulated and controlled. This basic information is of key importance in understanding how such systems go wrong during infection or disease. A mechanic who fails to understand how an engine normally functions is unlikely to be of much help in the event of a breakdown - and human cells are very much more complicated than car engines! The mechanisms and factors involved in RNA processing and quality, including Mpp6, are well conserved in humans. Since the publication of the Milligan et al. MS there have been several reports by other research groups on the functions and interactions of Mpp6, and the work has been cited 42 times. The work by El Hage et al. has made a significant contribution to the understanding of ribosome synthesis, a topic with substantial medical relevance, and has been cited 66 times.
