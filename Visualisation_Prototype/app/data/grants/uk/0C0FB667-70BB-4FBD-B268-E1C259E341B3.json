Worldwide, the focus of current scientific research is the improvement of influenza outbreak control measures, particularly through the use of public health measures, vaccination, and the development of anti-viral drugs. We have recently identified a novel function for an influenza virus virulence protein, termed the NS1 protein. During infection, NS1 binds and activates a host-cell protein called PI3-kinase. This interaction is an important event in the virus life-cycle, as mutated viruses unable to bind and activate PI3-Kinase do not replicate efficiently. In this project, we will examine the fundamental reasons why influenza virus activates this cellular protein, describe the structural basis of this interaction, and use the information generated to begin the development of novel anti-influenza drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601126","grantId":"G0601126","fundValue":"614197","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Edward Randall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
