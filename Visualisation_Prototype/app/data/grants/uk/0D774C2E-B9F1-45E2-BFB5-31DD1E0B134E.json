Therefore, any means of curbing the spread of its cause, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be actively pursued. We shall analyse the virus-neutralising properties of HIV antibodies in the blood of infected people, and in people and animals immunised with candidate vaccines. Useful antibodies can block HIV infection, whereas harmful antibodies can enhance it. One problem is that the same kind of antibody can act in either way according to the concentration of antibody and a substance called complement in the blood. It is therefore important to ensure that vaccinated persons are not placed at higher risk through enhancing antibodies.\n\nThe outer envelope of HIV carries the ABO blood group of the person producing it. We shall investigate whether crossing the blood group barrier might increase or decrease the chance of HIV transmission. Another blood group substance is Duffy antigen present on red cells of everyone except black Africans and their descendants. Some strains of HIV can dock onto Duffy as a receptor and we shall determine whether this matters in HIV infection and development of AIDS.\n\nThe different surface molecules or receptors used by HIV to gain entry into cells deliver the virus to different places inside the cell which in turn affects the efficiency of infection of different HIV strains. Using artificially constructed viruses carrying reporter molecules signalling their location we shall determine how the different cellular pathways leading to the nucleus can affect the ability of the virus to establish infection in different cell types in the human body.\n\nWe shall link our laboratory-based investigations to data on the course of HIV disease in individuals and on patterns and risks of infection in populations. Moreover, our findings eventually will enable the design of safer, more efficacious vaccines against this deadly virus infection.\n\nMembers of the team frequently comment on progress in HIV/AIDS research in the scientific and lay media - see Progress Report.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8712499","grantId":"G8712499","fundValue":"8224940","fundStart":"1987-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Weiss","coPersons":["Aine  McKnight","Mary  Collins"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
