Cleanliness, functionality and improved technology were all seen as key aspects of good toilet provision. Toilets are currently provided by local authorities, as part of the transport infrastructure (in bus and railway stations), and in cafes, pubs and restaurants. Maintaining these facilities at a high enough standard and making sure that they are not misused can be difficult. Moreover, information about publicly accessible toilets was often missing, difficult to find or out of date. Two major outputs addressed this finding was the first is a citizen-driven website named the Great British Public Toilet Map that aims to encourage local authorities to improve access, including details about availability and opening times. It also aims to involve local communities in decisions that affect their public toilets (http://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk).. The second is a publication, an Inclusive Design Guide to Publicly Accessible Toilets, containing case studies and outlining location-specific problems and potential solutions. \n\nThe research also examined the quality of continence services. Older people identified as important the accessibility of continence services, their relationship with professional staff and how far the impact of incontinence on everyday life was reduced. Professionals identified as important patient education, a welcoming environment and involving patients in decision-making. Continence service managers also emphasised referral pathways, patient assessment regardless of age, individual assessment and investment in service capacity. Ageist beliefs and attitudes about incontinence still needed to be addressed as well as collaboration with other services.\nTwo kinds of assistive devices were developed through the research project: smart underwear that could detect leakage early and a colour change odour detector. The smart underwear was effective and welcomed by clinical evaluation participants but further developments will be necessary during the commercialisation process. The odour detector was thought to be a very good idea by clinical participants but it was difficult to prove efficacy in real life situations because we couldn't ask clinical participants to invite people to sniff them and tell them whether urine odour was present.
