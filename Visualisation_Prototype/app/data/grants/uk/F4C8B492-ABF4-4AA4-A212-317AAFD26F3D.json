{"id":"F4C8B492-ABF4-4AA4-A212-317AAFD26F3D","title":"Determining the Mechanism of Intra-Cellular Retention of Mutant Forms of Retinoschisin in X-linked Retinoschisis","abstractText":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells acts as a quality control checkpoint in the secretion of proteins, preventing the secreting of incorrectly folded or assembled molecules. ER quality control also plays a crucial role in certain disease states (eg cystic fibrosis, emphysema, diabetes) where mutations in single proteins can lead to misfolding and prevention of secretion of the protein and hence loss of function. The X-linked disease retinoschisis is one such disease which results from a lack of secretion of functional protein, retinoschisin, causing splitting of the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in childhood. Over 133 mutations in the gene coding for retinoschisin (RS1) have been shown to be associated with X-linked retinoschisis, the majority being missense substitutions. It is likely that these lead to loss of function as the disease is also caused by nonsense, deletions, insertions and splice-site mutations. Many of these mutations lead to intracellular retention of the mutated proteins presumably through aberrant folding or assembly. Retinoschisis is therefore an excellent example of a disease that is caused by the lack of secretion of a functional protein and provides us with an ideal model to fully understand the mechanisms underlying ER retention of a soluble protein that is associated with a well characterised disease pathology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501600","grantId":"G0501600","fundValue":"254824","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-11-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dorothy  Trump","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
