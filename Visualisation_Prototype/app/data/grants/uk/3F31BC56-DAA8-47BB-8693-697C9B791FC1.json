The social sciences have collectively carried out a wide range of research into social impacts and social equity but take up of this work in transport policy and research has been limited.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the priority is to expose and synthesise the diversity of this work, and consider its applicability to contemporary policy and practice, by holding a series of linked ‘Research into Practice’ events. Each draws on state-of-the-art research and best practices across a wide range of disciplines to identify gaps in knowledge and the appropriate methodologies for addressing these:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Framing the issues - University of Oxford, 14 and 15 September, 2010</li>\n\n <li>Employment and Training - Warwick University, 2 December, 2010</li>\n\n <li>Transport and Health - 17 and 18 March, 2011</li>\n\n <li>Housing and Sustainable Communities - London School of Economics, 21 June 2011</li>\n\n <li>Rural Connectivity - Aberdeen University 3 and 4 October 2011</li>\n\n <li>Final Dissemination - central London, 2 November, 2011</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The project is led by Dr Karen Lucas at the Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford.

There is now a significant and growing number of academics and policy makers with taking an interest in the social aspects of transport across a range of disciplines and policy sectors. However, they are often working and publishing within their own disciplinary siloes and do not have many opportunities to communicate or collaborate with each other. This means that there is limited theoretcial and methodological cohesion and reduced policy impact. \n\n\n\nEquivalent problems are to be found in the policy arena, but other barriers include: lack of understanding of different administrative cultures and structures, different priorities and incentive structures, and different rationale for action and procedures for making business cases. There are also no lasting and robust structures in place to ensure ongoing communication between academia and the policy sector. \n\n\n\nFour potentially fruitful areas for future collaboration have been identified:\n\n\n\n1.Theoretical framing - currently, it is unclear what is meant by a 'social impact' in transport. \n\n\n\n2.Developing relevant methodologies - particularly in terms of how social and distributional impacts can and/or should be measured and valued.\n\n \n\n3.The causes and consequences of lack of travel. - studies should include consideration of dynamic issues and distributional and cumulative effects: how the social impacts of transport arise, how they might accumulate over time, and what opportunities to address the problem may arise at specific points in time (eg changes in personal circumstances, or policy 'windows'). \n\n\n\n4.Modes and range of impacts - current studies of the social impacts of transport are dominated by car use and vehicular traffic, whilst mass transport, such as rail and subway systems and air travel, receives notably less attention, cycling and walking studies have been the exception to this in recent years. Similarly, visual impacts, forced relocation, transport as a social and cultural resource and issues of ethnicity are all currently under-research. More generally across all modes, evidence of distributional and equity effects of different transport interventions remains limited.\n\n\n\nThe project has led to a number of new research collaborations and funded projects. The reports, literature review and data review and cictaions index has already been used by a number of local transport authorities (Merseytravel, Centro, Cornwall CC, Bridgend CC) in support of their applications for the Local Transport Fund projects and in the preparation of their Local Transport Plan 3. Two campaign organisations (SUSTRANS and Campaign For Better Transport) have used the material in their reports on transport poverty and the PI of the project has used its evidence to report to the Environmatal Audit Select Committee's ongoing enquiry into transport poverty. She has also drawn on the evidence of the workshops in her expert advisor to the Department of Transport on social equity issues in transport. Workshop reports and policy briefing notes have been made available for download on the project website and have also been circulated to the 200 network members that were associated with the project. The research has been used within several publications, including book chapters, journal articles and a special issue of the Journal of Transport Geography. It has also been sucessfully used to support an application for an ESRC mid-career fellowship at the University of Oxford to model the relationships between transport poverty and social disadvantage and a jointly funded transport and health PhD fellowship on understanding transport choices at Newcastle University. Much of the workshop material that was produced has also been included within the teaching materials for undergraduate and post graduate courses in the five collaborating Universities who delivered the workshop programme.
