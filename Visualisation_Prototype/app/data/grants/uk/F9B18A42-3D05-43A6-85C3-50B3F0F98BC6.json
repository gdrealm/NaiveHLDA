In groundwater-fed rivers, processes operating in the hyporheic zone (HZ) and its interchange with surface waters (SW) are key drivers of the ecological health of the river. The HZ is the subsurface region beneath, or adjacent to, a SW body where mixing occurs with groundwater (GW). This zone is hydrologically, geochemically and microbiologically complex. Large redox-driven concentration gradients exist across the sediment-water interface. The resulting potential for complete consumption of dissolved oxygen in hyporheic flowpaths 10-100 cm into the streambed creates areas where anaerobic microorganisms dominate microbial activity, which in turn control the bioavailability of redox-sensitive elements such as nitrogen (N) and, indirectly, phosphorus (P). The retention/release of P through interaction between HZ flows and in-river (SW) processes may be particularly important because elevated P concentrations have been linked to increased rates of plant growth, changes in species composition and proliferation of planktonic and epiphytic and epibenthic algae in rivers. Such rivers often fail to meet the standards of the EU Water Framework Directive necessitating the introduction of expensive mitigation measures. These measures can only succeed if we understand the processes controlling the ecological health of the river. This project seeks to unravel these controls in relation to P dynamics in groundwater-fed rivers.The focus in on understanding of the temporal variation in nutrient processes in groundwater-fed rivers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G001707/1","grantId":"NE/G001707/1","fundValue":"579455","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Policy and decision makers can make decisions based on the findings of the project.

A detailed comparison between concurrent nutrient data obtained by the hourly in situ automated monitoring and weekly-to-fortnightly grab sampling reveals a significant information loss at the extreme range of nutrient concentration for routine low-frequency sampling. \n\nThe different biogeochemical export regimes for phosphorus (episodic) and nitrate (chemostatic), revealed by high-frequency data, determine that phosphorus a minimum of hourly sampling is required whereas for nitrate weekly and monthly sampling is adequate.\n\nMeta-analysis of concentration-discharge (c-q) intra-storm signatures revealed dominant hysteretic patterns with similar frequency of anti-clockwise and clockwise responses; different determinands (total phosphorus, total reactive phosphorus, turbidity) behaved similarly. We found that the c-q loop direction is controlled by seasonally variable flow discharge and temperature whereas the magnitude is controlled by antecedent rainfall.\n\nWe show that seasonal and inter-storm succession in clockwise and anti-clockwise responses corroborates the transition in phosphorus transport from a chemostatic to an episodic regime. Our work delivers new insights for the evidence base on the complexity of phosphorus dynamics. We show the critical value of high-frequency in situ observations in advancing understanding of freshwater biogeochemical processes. Our findings provide evidence of uncertainties associated with routine low-frequency sampling carried out by the Environment Agency (EA) and thus can be directly used by the EA to evaluate their methodologies. \n\nOur findings provide evidence of the important role of groundwaters in controlling in-stream nitrate behaviour and thus can be directly used by the EA to evaluate the designation methodologies and the effectiveness of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in England and Wales. \n\nOur findings provide evidence that diffuse phosphorus delivery in groundwater-dominated catchments is controlled by both surface and subsurface transport pathways and thus can be directly used by the decision makers to evaluate existing and plan new mitigation measures.
