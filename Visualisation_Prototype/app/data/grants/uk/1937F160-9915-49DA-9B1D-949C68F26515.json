This requires all sectors of energy generation, transport/distribution, consumption and regulation work together to provide affordable energy and to develop new sources of energy. It has been widely recognised that control and power electronics are enabling technologies for these sectors to achieve the target. Although there are world-leading researchers in the UK in control and power electronics, the majority of the current research activities in these areas are in the US. The proposed sabbatical will enable the PI to work with world-leading US experts in control and power electronics for one year to foster concrete long-term best-with-best collaborations.\n\nDuring the proposed sabbatical, the PI will be working closely with the hosts on bio-fuels, axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines, small nuclear reactors, electric vehicle drive systems, high-density power converters for EVs, grid connection of distributed generation and renewable energy, and parallel operation of inverters. The last one is vital for distributed generation and renewable energy, power systems on ships and aircraft. \n\nThe proposed sabbatical will enable the PI:\n(1) to take the unique opportunities at the Cymer Center for Control Systems and Dynamics, University of California San Diego, for the PI to enter new application areas, such as bio-fuels, axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines and nuclear generators and to further the PI's work on continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and AC Ward Leonard drive systems\n(2) to open new routes to impact for research via accessing the best facilities available at the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Tech, which are not available at the home university so that the research of PI can be broadened and enhanced. Intensive experiments will be carried out at CPES on sychronverters, AC Ward Leonard drive systems and robust droop controllers to increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of these technologies and the CPES Industry Partnership Program will provide excellent commercial opportunities.\n(3) to be immersed in the most vibrant research environments at the host centers and share ideas with the brightest minds in control and power electronics. This enables the PI to work with them side-by-side to foster concrete long-term collaboration relationship with Cymer Center and CPES.\n(4) to give talks at US universities to enhance the reputation and prominence of UK research in control and power electronics, and to network with other leading researchers in the area so that new insights and ideas can be gained\n(5) to gain first-hand experiences from the hosts in how to establish, manage and operate a leading research center that attracts a large number of industrial partners\n(6) to explore and attract funding from US funding bodies and industry via collaborative schemes\n\nThe proposed sabbatical will benefit the PI and his team, the US hosts, other academic researchers in control and power electronics, the industrial companies involved in the research and, eventually, the relevant industrial sectors and the UK economy. It will enahnce the level and quality of collaboration with US academia and industry within the Material, Mechanical and Medical Engineering programme of EPSRC, and help advance the reputation and prominence of UK research in control and power electronics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J001333/1","grantId":"EP/J001333/1","fundValue":"143334","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2012-04-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Qing-Chang  Zhong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
