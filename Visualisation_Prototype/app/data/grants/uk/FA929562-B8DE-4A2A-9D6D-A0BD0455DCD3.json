{"id":"FA929562-B8DE-4A2A-9D6D-A0BD0455DCD3","title":"Biomedical Catalyst â€“ Clinical proof of concept trial of a Kv3 modulator for the treatment of tinnitus","abstractText":"Tinnitus is a chronic, under-recognised condition that affects over 10% of adults, causing significant suffering. There are no approved drugs and current treatments, such as counselling, only help patients to cope with symptoms. This project will provide clinical proof-of-concept evaluation of the efficacy of a novel ion channel drug in patients with tinnitus. AUT00063, currently completing Phase I trials, is being developed by Autifony Therapeutics for the treatment of age-related hearing loss; however, there is a strong scientific rationale to suggest potential for the drug to help control tinnitus. Autifony will work in collaboration with leading tinnitus expert, Prof Deborah Hall, Director and Research lead for Tinnitus aetiology and management at the National Institute for Health Research, Nottingham Hearing Biomedical Research Unit, University of Nottingham, on this clinical trial as a major step towards potentially the first effective oral drug to treat tinnitus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_14094","grantId":"MC_PC_14094","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Deb Ann Hall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
