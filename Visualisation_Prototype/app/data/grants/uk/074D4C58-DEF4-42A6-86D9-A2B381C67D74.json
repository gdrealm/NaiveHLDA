But in order for organisms to utilise nitrate, it must first pass through the lipid barrier of the cell membrane. As a negatively charged molecule, nitrate cannot pass directly through the membrane and a specialised membrane-located protein is required to facilitate its transport. Such a protein is the nitrate transporter, NrtA, a member of a large group of transporters with very diverse specificities called the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). Membrane proteins are difficult to purify and crystallise. Notwithstanding, three structures of bacterial MFS proteins were solved in 2003. These showed that the transporters had similar overall architecture of twelve helical portions that zig-zag through the membrane joined by loops. The helices were packed in such a way that the proteins appear as a 'Mayan temple' shape, flat and narrow on the outside and broad on the inside. The high resolution structures also showed that from the inside, there was an opening or vestibule leading to a constriction probably representing the substrate binding site. This organisation fits well with the mechanism of action proposed many years ago of alternating access. In other words, the substrate binding site is never exposed simultaneously to the inside and outside, and there is never an open pore through the transporters. Rather it is thought that the proteins move like a 'rocker switch' and the observed structures represent a snapshot of the inward facing conformation. However, although it seems that the MFS proteins have a similar appearance and general mechanism, the detail of how different members of the superfamily transport their diverse substrates cannot be guessed simply by comparison. Instead it requires intensive mutagenesis and biochemical analysis to understand how these proteins function. Without such information, although it is possible now to build a 3D model of NrtA based on the known structures of other MFS proteins, we can only guess as to the detail of how the protein transports nitrate. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis coupled with thiol accessibility studies offers an opportunity to obtain structure/function information leading to the generation of a realistic model of the protein. The approach makes use of the chemical reactivity of one of the amino acid residues occurring naturally in proteins, cysteine, which has a sulphur-containing thiol group in its side chain. Individual amino acids in a cysteine-less version of the protein are replaced by cysteine to generate a collection of mutant proteins with a single cysteine at defined positions. Since the thiol group of cysteine is reactive with thiol-specific reagents, it is possible to use the single cysteine mutant proteins to examine the accessibility of cysteine at that position. Reaction of the mutant protein with the thiol reagent can be assessed by following the binding of a radioactively labelled reagent. Accessibility is dependent on the ability of the thiol reagent to reach the cysteine side chain and the availability of water. If the side chain thiol is, for example, buried in the cell membrane, a lipid environment, it will not be accessible. Another factor affecting accessibility is the chemical property of the thiol reagent itself and whether it is membrane permeable or impermeable. Therefore the reactivity of the single cysteine mutants to various classes of thiol reagent can tell us the local environment of that residue. Transporters such as the nitrate transporter, NrtA, are dynamic transmembrane proteins that undergo changes in shape during the transport process. Observing changes in accessibility patterns in the presence and absence of the substrate, nitrate, can give us insight into how amino acids at different positions in the protein move in response to the transport process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012213/1","grantId":"BB/E012213/1","fundValue":"326996","fundStart":"2007-09-07","fundEnd":"2010-12-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Shiela  Unkles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
