Malaysia is an important place to study these issues, since it has one of the highest rates of undocumented workers in the world, yet the daily experiences of these workers and their families are unexamined in the literature.</p>\n\n<p>The research will produce detailed qualitative data on the mobile, urban lives of undocumented children, and will contribute to theoretical and methodological scholarship on the role of children in long-term processes of migration.</p>\n\n<p>The research aims to generate a new theoretical framework for understanding children’s experiences of ‘illegality’, which will be of interest not only to academic researchers but also to NGOs and UN bodies focused on migrant, refugee and child rights.The project’s findings will be communicated in briefing papers, scholarly articles and a book, but also through a website of children’s images and stories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012262/1","grantId":"ES/J012262/1","fundValue":"237329","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Lucy Allerton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
