UCL has considerable strength in these challenge areas, and we are experiencing a significant growth in the numbers of early career researchers contributing to them. This additional investment will would therefore provide an ideal platform to ensure the growth of the highest quality research as well as support the career development of staff. \n\nWithin each thematic area we have identified a subset of research challenges that will benefit from additional investment in the form of small items of equipment. This has been done in close collaboration with individuals and groups working in the area, to ensure that the items requested are aligned with their current needs and have the greatest potential to have maximum impact on their research activities. \n\nThe areas defined in the proposal are: \n- Theme A: Health Technologies (Diagnostics and therapeutics, Medical imaging, Vascular modelling, and Medical physics)\n- Theme B: Materials Science (Materials characterisation, New energy materials, Chemical engineering)\n- Theme C: Novel Information Technologies (Investigation and characterisation of quantum effects, Development of new qubit systems, New wireless networks)\n- Theme D: Future Media (Telepresence and remote sensing)","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031481/1","grantId":"EP/K031481/1","fundValue":"457501","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This UCL-wide award was invested in a portfolio of small (&lt;?10k) equipment items which will enhance our capability in four strategic, cross-disciplinary themes: Health technologies, Materials science, Novel Information Technologies and Future Media. \n\nUCL has considerable strength in these challenge areas, and we are experiencing a significant growth in the numbers of early career researchers contributing to them.
