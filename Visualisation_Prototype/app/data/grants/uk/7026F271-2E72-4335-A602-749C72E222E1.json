It responds to this mistaken threat by attacking the tissue in question with the multiple types of leucocytes (white blood cells) that it has at its disposal. B cells are a particular type of leucocyte that has been shown to pay an important role in the ongoing disease processes faced by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is highlighted by how well RA symptoms respond to B cell-depleting therapy (BCDT) using rituximab, an antibody drug which removes the vast majority of B cells. However, not all B cells are involved the pathology of RA and most are actually helpful and enable us to respond to infection and vaccination. The major disadvantage of BCDT is that it indiscriminately removes most B cells without specifically targeting those that are involved in pathology. In the long term, this puts patients at risk of infection, especially elderly patients, who often have difficulties defending themselves against viruses and bacteria already. Also, for several months after the treatment the patients will not respond efficiently to vaccination. In our work, we have identified a subtype of B cells, which is present in the inflamed joints of patients with RA and produces factors that activate inflammation and joint destruction. They do this by producing two small proteins, TNF and RANKL, which activate other cells to invade the joint and to destroy bone structure. We have also found that some these cells are specifically involved in the autoimmune process, and may be part of the process that starts off the disease. In our most recent work, we have identified a marker protein that is found only on this type of cells. It is called FcRL4. We now plan to develop a new drug, which like rituximab is an antibody that specifically targets FcRL4+ B cells. With this drug we hope to remove just the B cells that are aggressive in disease while the rest of the B cells will be maintained and will be available to defend us against infection. We plan to do this by having a range of different antibodies specific for FcRL4 produced and will then will run a series of experiments to test firstly whether these antibodies can be used to remove FcRL4+ B cells and then secondly choose the best antibodies to test whether removing FcRL4+B cells from samples of patient synovium will effectively reduce inflammation. This work will be done by a dedicated team of medical doctors, scientists and nurses who work together in a new institute built into the New Queen Elizabeth Hospital. We endeavor to involve the patients into our research to help us to understand this devastating disease better and to develop new and safe therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M007669/1","grantId":"MR/M007669/1","fundValue":"474886","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Dagmar  Scheel-Toellner","coPersons":["Christopher  Buckley","Kai-Michael  Toellner","Francesca  Barone","Karim  Raza","Andrew  Filer"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
