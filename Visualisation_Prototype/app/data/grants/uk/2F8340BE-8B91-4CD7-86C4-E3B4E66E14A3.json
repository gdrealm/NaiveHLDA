These range from soups to baby-foods to feed us; paints and coating products to provide robust structural materials; plastics and composites to create many products; and pharmaceutical drugs to fight disease. They share a similar manufacturing method in which raw materials (or reagents) are combined through physical or chemical means, and known as a 'process'. This takes place in a 'process vessel', which is often sealed, under pressure and at elevated temperature. Critical aspects of such processes are efficiency, product quality, energy use and emissions impact. The core aim of this project is to stimulate new sensing products that can enhance these aspects and exploit their markets through licences.The project builds upon our background science and experimental technology, which an estimation of the internal (invisible) distribution of process materials. These innovations harness two principles: spectroscopy - the identification of specific materials; and, tomography - the identification of the distribution of components within the process vessel (similar to methods to 'see inside' human bodies for medical diagnosis). Electrical energy using a 'compressed wide-band' is used, both to give the 'spectral' coverage and to provide fast response to suit dynamic processes. The project aims to provide a demonstration level for specific trial applications; to offer licensees a clear path for onward development into the two product forms: a 'point sensor' form, to identify materials in its immediate vicinity; and a 'zone sensor' form, to identify the distribution of specific materials. Increased knowledge empowers design and/or control to deliver major benefits to process end users: increased productivity and product quality, reductions in emissions and waste products, reduced energy demand and resulting carbon impacts. In illustration we can consider the advantages offered in two product examples. Pharmaceutical compounds are produced using crystallisation processes which are highly variable and can have poor yields such that some batches may not meet tight product specifications. This results in waste of energy, raw materials, and in the costly disposal of the useless out-of specification product. Here a Spec_zone sensor can transform 'process-knowledge' to allow 'smarter control, and gain a major increase in 'on-specification' yield, gaining obvious major benefits. These are very high value products and hence financial business savings can be large. The manufacture of foodstuffs follows a conventional recipe: such as mixing and cooking natural ingredients such as chopped vegetables in water. Unwanted objects in the product such as natural materials such as stalks and large seeds, and unnatural materials such as small pieces of metal or plastic are a possibility. Although these may be unpleasant for adults in products such as soups (but still present a serious 'brand' quality issue for the manufacturer) they may be dangerous if present in baby-foods. It is easy to find metals, using x-ray detectors on a pipeline, but much more difficult to find small objects, such small pieces of plastic or wood which can be detected by the 'wide-band' Spec_point sensor.In conclusion the ability to estimate the presence and concentration of specific materials and their distribution offers major benefits in effective process management. The project will provide demonstrations and concept details to enable licensees to develop future products, based on the Spec_point and Spec_zone concepts. It will include detailed application sectors studies to highlight potential early adopters. It is supported by two instrumentation suppliers who have expressed a keen interest in evaluation, and both have diverse markets and customers who are likely to be involved in evaluations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006095/1","grantId":"EP/I006095/1","fundValue":"164636","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project has benefited from 4 industrial partners: two potential end-user companies, Glaxosmithkline and Johnson-Matthey; and two potential technology licensee companies: Malvern Instruments and Industrial Process Tomography plc (ITS), whose advice and support has been valuable in identifying application sector needs and general industrial opportunities.\n\nUser partners have indicated their potential interest and one (Johnson-Matthey) has published work on outline study on the technology with a special prototype system which implements a much simplified version of the technology provided by ITS [U.I.

Parallel research has explored the 'spectro-chemistry' of materials to identify promising application sectors. This project is based upon technology developed in the UK over the past ~15 years, mainly at Leeds and Manchester. In general terms it applies the concepts which are well known in medical diagnosis using non-invasive 'tomography'. The first examples were based upon X-rays: a narrow beam is passed through an object (typically a human torso). The attenuation along its path is measured by a detector at the opposite side. By moving both beam and detector around the stationary body a large collection of beam attenuation measurements are assembled. A sophisticated 'inverse process' is deployed to estimate the corresponding 2-dimensional (2D) density distribution, for example, in (Computer-assisted tomography) CAT-scanners. The 'grey-scale' image is called a 'tomogram'. This work aims to obtain similar data for inaccessible industrial processes, for example, in pharmaceutical manufacture, where large mixing vessels must be closely monitored to ensure performance and product quality. Here the processes change quickly and the sensing elements must be fixed and based typically on electrical stimuli, rather than X-rays. Since the processes are highly dynamic, image-based information must be generated quickly; typically many image estimates per second. In this specific project a novel energising stimulus is used, designed to excite a response containing 'spectral' information on the material at each point in the process. Thus the resulting 2D image estimate can now be overlaid with an indication of the material at each region (typically usually with a colour-coding scheme). The information provides a unique insight into the behaviour and operation of a process; enabling enhancement of product quality, and reduced energy consumption and emissions. The project has benefited from 4 industrial partners: two potential end-user companies, Glaxosmithkline and Johnson-Matthey; and two potential technology licensee companies: Malvern Instruments and Industrial Process Tomography, whose advice and support has been valuable in identifying application sector needs and general industrial opportunities.\n\nUser partners have indicated their potential interest and one (Johnson-Matthey) has published work on outline study on the technology [U.I.
