Whereas the occupants of other building types might consider raising their comfort temperature thresholds a little in summer and suspend the use of mechanical cooling, NHS patients' well being and safety may well be compromised by higher summer temperatures. In fact the DH and the NHS are hit by a double whammy, the pressure to reduce energy consumption, colliding with the pressure to protect their patients and staff from overheating, the dangers of which were manifest in recent years' summer heatwaves. Innovative low energy design strategies and techniques will be required both for new buildings and, most importantly, for the existing building stock, the 27,701,676 square metres of the NHS Retained Estate. However there are many barriers to the implementation of such innovative interventions in NHS buildings, patient safety being paramount. Worries include the inability to achieve stable temperature control and safe ventilation (the airborne transmission of pathogens is an emerging science as our colleague Dr.Cath Noakes freely admits), the proliferation in the use of medical equipment adding heat to hospital interiors and the mechanics of modern contractual arrangements which place private companies in charge of the Facilities Management of health buildings, which, unsurprisingly, given the penalties they face, are ultra-cautious about adopting change.This project, 'Design and delivery of Robust Hospital Environments in a Changing Climate' (DeDeRHECC), will investigate these conundra to come up with economical and practical low energy refurbishment strategies for existing hospitals. It will derive a closer definition of resilience in the context of an acute hospital and, most particularly, the criteria set for hospital environments for the various categories of space found in hospitals; non-clinical, patient rooms, diagnostic and treatment, even operating theatres. The team is sceptical that these all align into a cherent requirement and will review UK and US criteria. Using four sets of hospital sites drawn from the project's four participating major NHS Trusts, it will 'catalogue' basic hospital building types from this sizeable sample of NHS stock, identify those most frequently occurring, assess their current resilience to climate change and propose appropriate solutions or clusters of interventions for each 'type'. It will model these ideas so that relative energy savings can be quantified and their resilience to warming external temperatures determined. It will cost them. It will calculate the lifetime running costs and energy savings and assess Value for Money. It will also examine the procurement environment in which these innovative solutions need to be delivered, the protocols by which refurbishment projects are designed, approved and implemented. Their delivery will incur risks. The project will take innovative risk assessment tools for change, developed for engineering design, and apply them to these future large and medium scale construction projects. It will develop processes to make the integration of these innovative, low energy interventions into hospital refurbishment projects smoother and more familiar to those who will be delivering them. It will produce guidance and worked examples in text and web form and, most significantly, as a DVD film of participants discussing the challenges, their anxieties, the ideas and how to deliver them. Accompanying animations will communicate the strategies and communications vividly and quickly to very busy people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G061327/1","grantId":"EP/G061327/1","fundValue":"896583","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In depth discussion and information exchange on sustainable healthcare with a significant US healthcare provider.\n\nThis US healthcare provider is about the same size of the NHS and contacted the research team to initiate discussion and information sharing relating to the low-energy remodelling of their substantial estate.\n\nBeneficiaries: Kaiser Permanente\n\nContribution Method: Raising awareness on the part of Kaiser Permanente about approaches to low-energy design and refurbishment.\n\nNHS ProCure21+ 'West Herts Transforms', live project to design and build the new 800 bed Watford General Hospital, the research team is engaged as client side advisors, the procurement document states: 'The Trust is committed to developing a sustainable hospital and is working with Professor Alan Short at the University of Cambridge (See Appendix C for contact details) to bring forward a hospital with very high levels of natural ventilation.
