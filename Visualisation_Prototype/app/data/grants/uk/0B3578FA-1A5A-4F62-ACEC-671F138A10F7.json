Among the most important groups of root-associated microbes in grassland are arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. These fungi form mutualistic symbioses with host plants and are entirely dependent on plant photosynthate for their energy. Despite this, our understanding of how AM fungi and the key carbon cycling activities they undertake respond to global climate change is poor, especially under field conditions. We will test the hypothesis that carbon flux to AM fungi will increase in response to increased temperature and but this will be dependent on water availability. We will further test whether climate manipulation increases the relative importance of AM fungal respiration to total soil CO2 efflux. The proposal capitalises on an existing large-scale transplant experiment in the Swiss Jura, in combination with an in situ 'pulse' of isotopically distinct carbon (i.e. 13C) to provide the first field-based assessment of the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to soil CO2 efflux in response to climate manipulation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I017097/1","grantId":"NE/I017097/1","fundValue":"52721","fundStart":"2011-05-09","fundEnd":"2011-11-08","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David  Johnson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" This proposal undertook the first in situ experiment to test how climate manipulation affects carbon (C) transfer to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal mycelium and ultimately to the atmosphere. We tested the hypothesis that C flux to AM fungi will increase in response to increased temperature and this will be dependent on water availability. We further tested whether climate manipulation increases the relative importance of AM fungal respiration to total soil CO2 efflux. Finally, we predicted that the contribution made by AM fungi to soil CO2 efflux will increase in warmer, drier soils. \n In 2008, intact turfs (0.8m x 0.6m x 0.3m deep) were transplanted from a low-input pasture situated at an elevation of 1400m to four locations; 1) 1400m (control); 2) 1000m, 3) 600m and 4) 400m. This gradient corresponds to respective temperature increases of +0, +2, +4 and +5&ordm;C, and rainfall reductions of 0, 20, 40, and 50%. The experiment therefore provided a proxy for climate manipulation because of the increased temperatures, reduced precipitation and extended growing season at the lower elevation sites. The turfs were placed in boxes which acted as lysimeters to permit collection and analysis of leachates, and were subject to a range of analyses by our collaborators in Switzerland, where the experiment was located. Moreover, the use of the existing experiment enable us to capitalise on a range of other key measurements that are being undertaken routinely at no cost to NERC; this ultimately will enable us to place our data in the context of changes in ecosystem CO2 fluxes, plant productivity and DOC losses in leachates. In addition to our original aims, we made a series of measurements of the cation concentration, total C and pH of soils from the gradient. Our second experiment tested the temperature sensitivity of the soils from the gradient; thus it gave us information about the resilience of the system to climate change. \n\nWe found differences in the total amount of C held in soil according to the depth. For example, as temperatures increased and rainfall decreased (ie at lower altitudes), soil C content also decreased. Thus, climate change was leading to losses of C from these grasslands. This was mirrored by quite large differences in soil pH; for example, pH dropped when monoliths were moved down slope, although the extent of the decrease was not consistent. This may reflect changes in the Ca:Al ratio (data to be explored). \n\nIt was clear that the soils from the different altitudes had markedly different responses to temperature in terms of regulation of CO2 efflux. Soils moved to 600 m (ie a warmer, drier location than the controls at 1400m) respired at greater rates and responded more positively to increasing temperature. These data indicate that the C cycling dynamics are sensitive to climate change. We have yet to analyse the full and extensive set of 13C data from the pulse labelling study but data so far obtained suggested the approach was successful in that we had good incorporation of 13C into plant tissue during the labelling period. However, the data show that there was little 13C was released by external AM fungal mycelium.
