{"id":"B8ACB37A-DFBD-4A2B-92B1-7C2A5672965A","title":"The CHELL : A Bottom-Up approach to in vitro and in silico Minimal Life-like Constructs","abstractText":"This work is directed towards generating artificial objects that have properties mimicking those of biological cells. Specifically we set out to test if it is possible for an artificial cell to imitate a natural cell in terms of responding to biological signals. We do not aim to produce an artificial life-form but rather we seek to evaluate whether some processes (signals) that natural cells use can be imitated by the synthetic cells such that the natural cells are unable to tell the difference. The work will involve the modelling, design, preparation and evaluation of capsule-like structures using a combination of compuer science, chemistry, materials science, with a further focus on potential ethical and social aspects of artificial cellular systems. The cell-imitating capsules will contain chemistries we can use as models of signalling ands metabolism, and will be designed such that we can use the capsules and signals to/from them in 'conversations' and 'imitation games' with real cells.The work is intended as fundamental curiosity-driven investigation and addresses the scientific, societal and ethical aspects of minimal-life constructs, However, there are many potential spin-outs of this work if we show that it is indeed possible to 'talk' to natural cells via artificial capsules. Examples might include 'smart' antibiotics, drug carriers for locally-directed therapies and intelligent materials for tissue repair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026130/1","grantId":"EP/G026130/1","fundValue":"373250","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Findings have been used to integrate new technologies to improve the control over the nanotubes growth, and make them more reliable and controllable  ","person":"Leroy  Cronin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" The original CHELLNet grant lead to the purchasing of our cell microscopy equipment. Grant EP/G026130/1 was continuation funding to develop and explore the discoveries that were made when we applied equipment in an unusual way; to look at POM materials and their cation-exchange reactions under dissipative conditions. Two key discoveries were made, each of which led to a number of publications:\n1) POM (polyoxometalate) based micron scale tubes that can be built from a large variety of different starting materials, can be built into networks and can be controlled in an automated way using laser heating through a multi-touch iPad interface.\n2) iCHELLs - inorganic chemical cells made by interfacial aggregation of a precipitation membrane around small droplets. The iCHELL units (again based on POM materials) were shown to have size-exclusion properties, could be tuned with functionalities such as redox or chirality, and could be 'manufactured' in large populations using a microfluidic platform. These materials have a number of potential roles in: micro-patterning of metal oxides (sensing, electronics, security-marking, coatings), hybrid membrane technology, artificial cellularity, microfluidic device manufacture. Also, we are actively pursuing a number of these areas.\nMicrotube growth from POM and related materials has now been seen by other researchers also..
