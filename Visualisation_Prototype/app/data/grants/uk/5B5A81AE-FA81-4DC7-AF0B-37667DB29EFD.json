{"id":"5B5A81AE-FA81-4DC7-AF0B-37667DB29EFD","title":"Molecular developmental analyses of animal larval development: searching for deep homology","abstractText":"How animals evolve and adapt to their environment is a major theme of evolutionary biology. The patchy distribution of many complex characters (segmentation, coelomic cavities, eyes, central nervous system, etc.) across the animals could be interpreted in two ways: either as resulting from repeated convergent evolution of similar characters for adaptive reasons or as primitive characters that, while maintained in certain groups, have also been lost in multiple lineages. This proposal seeks to differentiate between these two scenarios for two important characters with a puzzling phylogenetic distribution amongst metazoan phyla: a through-gut and ciliated larvae. The platyhelminthes or flatworms are an important group of animals. Some are free living but others are important parasites such as tapeworms and schistosomes (the cause of Bilharzia which affects over 200 million people worldwide). They have a relatively simple body without a through gut (i.e. no separate mouth and anus) nor do they have the internal fluid filled cavities or segmented body plans seen in many other animal groups such as annelid worms (e.g. earth worms) or molluscs. For many years there was an assumption that their relative simplicity was an indication that they separated early from the main branches of the animal tree: many hundreds of millions of years ago and before the evolution of these more advanced traits. Recently it has been established that this view of their relationships to other animal groups is incorrect and that they are in fact relatively closely related to the annelids and molluscs in a large assemblage of animals called the Lophotrochozoa. This relationship implies that they originally possessed the through gut, body cavities and segments seen in their relatives but have lost them secondarily. We want to test this idea directly by looking for genetic traces of these characteristics in their larvae. The larvae of flatworms resemble, to an extent, the larvae of annelids and molluscs (a tiny ciliated swimming stage called a trochophore). We want to test, using genetic markers again, whether annelid, mollusc and flatworm larvae are in fact all inherited from a common ancestor (the progenitor of the Lophotrochozoa) that also had a larva. If so flatworm larvae would be expected to share specific genetic characteristics with the trochophore larvae of annelids and molluscs whereas if the larvae have been evolved independently in annelids and flatworms this would not be the case. This will tell us about the possibility of adding a larval stage into your lifecycle - a very controversial idea - and also inform us about the characteristics of the common ancestor of the lophotrochozoan animals which existed half a billion years ago. Finally we want to use the genetic data we generate in the parts of the project already described to refine our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between flatworms and all the other lophotrochozoan groups. An understanding of these relationships will better enable us to interpret the evolution of the characteristics that interest us.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H006966/1","grantId":"BB/H006966/1","fundValue":"592598","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have published a review paper discussing the potential of the animal we work on as a model for studying polyclad flatworm biology.

We have not succeeded despite having synthesised a large number of probes of developmental, housekeeping and neuropeptide genes with three different haptens and tried many protocols working for other species \n\nDue to the difficulties we have encountered we have used an alternative approach involving the production of antibodies. We have produced successful antibodies against 10 neuropeoptides and several of our genes of interest as outlined in the proposal. \n\nThe main problem encountered with applying our new antibodies in stainings was the difficulty in imaging the three-dimensional lobed larvae of Maritigrella. While the dorsoventrally flattened juveniles of direct developers could be easily imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the tissue attenuation in the larvae resulted in much weaker signal on the parts most distant from the light-receiving objective. To ameliorate this situation, we are using light sheet microscopy on immunostained M. crozieri larvae. We have built our own spim microscope. \n\nWe developed a protocol to produce 'naked' embryos (embryos without egg shell) of Maritigrella and succeeded in following the early development with time lapse microscopy using standard light microscopy. Following individual blastomeres beyond the ca. 40-cell stage becomes difficult due to opaqueness caused by yolk granules and a rather low survival rate of the embryos under the microscope. To solve this problem we have used injection of histone-mCherry mRNA which is readily translated and stably marks the nuclei of dividing blastomeres through developement. We are now using fluorescent light sheet microscopy to record the cell divisions and cell movements in 3 dimensions throughout development (overall 4d microscopy). When complete, this will permit us to examine the blastomere origins of any given larval organ including eyes, apical organ and ciliary band directly aiding us in our principal aim.\n\nDetermining with some certainty the phylogenetic position of the polyclad flatworms within the platyhelminthes is an important task (not discussed in the original proposal). We collected representatives of most larger taxa of free-living flatworms, extracted total RNA, and sequenced and assembled complete transcriptomes. We are collaborating with Dr Christophe Dessimoz (recently appointed to UCL) to use his OMA software to identify large sets of orthologs amongst the platyhelminthes and other lophoptrochozoans for building a phylogenetic tree based on hundreds to thousands of orthologous genes. Initial results are very promising and we can show the transcriptomes are very complete allowing us to build a really impressive data matrix for phylogeny.\n\nGenome sequencing.\nFrom a single starved adult, we extracted about 100 ug of undegraded DNA, which was sequenced in libraries of four different insert sizes (200, 500, 3000 and 7000 basepairs) on 8 lanes (6 paired end and 2 mate pair) of an Illumina Hiseq machine. We initiated collaboration with Prof. Dr. Eugene Myers at the MPI Dresden and Dr. Siegfried Schloissnig at the Heidelberg Institute of Higher Studies for assembly of the Maritigrella crozieri genome. We will shortly publish the results of pour analyses and make available the ~15 platyheminth transcriptomes we have produced during this grant.\n\nOnce complete will make available the complete genome of Maritigrella we have produced during this grant.
