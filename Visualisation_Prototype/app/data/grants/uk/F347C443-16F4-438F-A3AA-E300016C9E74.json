{"id":"F347C443-16F4-438F-A3AA-E300016C9E74","title":"Follow On: 3D Lithography","abstractText":"In conjunction with collaborators at Durham University we have developed a technique for the realisation of fine pitch photolithography over grossly non-planar substrates. The technique has opened-up the potential for many novel applications within the fields of microelectronics and microsensor packaging. We have demonstrated proof-of-principle, have fled a patent in this area and continue to develop the technique. The intention of this proposal is to refine the technology and produce two demonstrators that can be used to attract commercial partners and investors. One demonstrator will show fine-pitch interconnections between the top and bottom of a silicon wafer and the second will show a 3D-spiral antenna.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E502989/1","grantId":"EP/E502989/1","fundValue":"87454","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Luke Seed","coPersons":["Gavin  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" This follow-on grant was to promote technology that we developed on a previous project and attempt to move it towards commercialisation. Whilst we had a number of interested contacts, which we pursued, none of these developed into a commercial activity. We used the ideas internally and used them to help secure more funding to look at other aspects of the problem, building on what we had learned Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
