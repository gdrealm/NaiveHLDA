How do they manage this regime given institutional and political constraints? This project seeks to address these questions by examining seven developing economies in the sterling area. These countries pegged their currencies to sterling throughout the 1950s and 1960s and kept sterling as their main reserve asset. When the sterling-dollar exchange rate changed in 1971 some countries shifted their peg to the US$ while others continued with sterling. When sterling floated in June 1972, more countries shifted to the US$, but not all. When the system collapsed in 1973 these states then had to choose whether to maintain their peg to a floating US$ or &pound;, or to a basket of currencies, or to float independently. This project will compare cases with a variety of institutional structures, explore how regional relationships affect exchange rate regime choice and management, and highlight the role of international political relations in economic decision-making. The research is based on official and private archive records.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D001064/1","grantId":"ES/D001064/1","fundValue":"280223","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Ruth Schenk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
