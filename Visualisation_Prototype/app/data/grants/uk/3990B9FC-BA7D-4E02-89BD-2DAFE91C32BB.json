Provides an understanding of the process of becoming an engaged philanthropist and findings relating to the Journey to Philanthropy outline the benefits of starting small and local and learning about the process of philanthropy before moving to larger giving and more engaged philanthropy. Helps entrepreneurs and philanthropists understand that large scale philanthropy and giving involves more than the redistribution of economic capital - to be an effective philanthropists, entrepreneurs can appreciate the need to invest and leverage other forms of capital including cultural, social and reputational forms of capital. Highlights to role which well informed professional advisers can play in guiding and supporting effective philanthropy.\n\nImpact for wealth advisors and other professionals (Alumni offices, fund raisers; Foundation managers): provides evidence of the need to provide more specific philanthropy and wealth redistribution training to enable wealth advisors to provide better, more informed advice. Findings relating to the UK's philanthropy landscape will be useful in helping professional advisers identify experts and possible partners for collaboration. Highlights the need also for better advice regarding the intergenerational transfer of wealth and philanthropic values. Institutions like JP Morgan are identified as examples of best practice in this respect. The accumulate nature of philanthropy is relevant to informing fund raisers of the benefits of giving something back to philanthropists and the Journal to Philanthropy is helpful suggesting to professional advisers that they might be an appropriate guide to entrepreneurs in this journey.\n\nImpact for policy makers: particularly findings relating to the Journey to Philanthropy help explain the process and key stages involved. Policy makers may be able to encourage more and better philanthropy by providing support for philanthropists at key stages of this journey including possible taxation implications. An awareness of the philanthropy landscape will enable policy makers and governments to be able to identify key players and to approach those more appropriate in helping devise and implement policy which supports more and better philanthropy.\n\nImpact for researchers: highlights the value of applying Capital Theory to the under-researched field of philanthropy; suggests future studies should consider the interplay between and convertibility of different forms of capital. Particularly for entrepreneurship scholars the research challenges the dominant discourse suggesting entrepreneurs do have societal and environmental concerns and often become deeply embedded within those communities they wish to support and towards which they target their philanthropy. Indicates more research is needed on the beneficiaries of philanthropy to understand their experiences of philanthropy and engagement with a wealthy, successful entrepreneur.

Recognising that current involvement of entrepreneurs in philanthropy is not new, Phase 1 of our study sought to understand the historical context of and the roots from which philanthropic endeavours of high net worth contemporary entrepreneurs has evolved. Analysis of the philanthropic activities, impact and outcomes of Andrew Carnegie and other world-making entrepreneurs contributes to an understanding of entrepreneurial philanthropy as a world-making process through which already successful, wealthy entrepreneurs use their power to accumulate more power, extend their social and political influence, and increase their capacity to shape society according to their will. Significantly, our findings challenge conventional definitions of philanthropy as an altruistically-motivated, distributive process and our empirically informed conceptual framework, A Capital Theoretic Model of Entrepreneurial Philanthropy highlights the accumulative nature of a process which benefits philanthropists as well as beneficiaries. \n\nIn phases 2 &amp;amp; 3 we sought to acquire an empirical understanding of the nature of contemporary entrepreneurial philanthropy in the UK. Using publicly available sources, we first constructed a database from publically available sources which we used to analyse the types of entrepreneurs who engage in significant philanthropy including their demographics, the extent and amount of their philanthropic endeavours, the vehicles through which they channel their philanthropy, the communities and sectors towards which they direct their philanthropy and, in addition to money, the other forms of capital (social, human and symbolic) they employ and leverage when engaging in philanthropy. We restricted this database to 100 UK entrepreneurs over the period 2008–2010 all of whom had: made their fortune from business ownership or had used inherited wealth to establish successful businesses and, by 2008, had both accrued a minimum personal wealth of &pound;10m and redistributed a minimum of &pound;1mn of this. Analysis of this complex set of data revealed that most philanthropists were men (88), aged 46-65 (mean = 60), most of whom (94) were self-made. 59 had established a foundation as a formal vehicle for their philanthropy and, of these 16, were established prior to 2000, with the oldest created in 1972. Philanthropic giving is concentration in education and young people and despite 28 having a publicly declared religious affiliation, only 10 directed their philanthropy toward religious beneficiaries. The mean net personal wealth was found to be &pound;268m (likely to have been inflated by 10% who were billionaires). Regarding institutionalized cultural capital (qualifications): only 25 held no formal qualification; 52 had an UG degree and of these, the majority were awarded a Russell Group university as were all doctorates (4); of those holding an MBA (8), 7 were from an Ivy League university, mostly Harvard (7). 39 entrepreneurs were found to have a history of business ownership and/or involvement in several businesses and all were found to share at least 1 relationship with a person of influence (a person holding a position of power within their respective field) with the average number being 3. Findings indicate that these contacts are concentrated in the field of politics (51) and philanthropy (27 contacts). Interestingly, the leaders of all three major UK political parties are identified 24 times, and several high-profile, globally powerful individuals, including Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan, Tony Blair and Archbishop Desmond Tutu were also mentioned. Findings regarding symbolic capital reveal that Entrepreneurial philanthropists (EP) possess significant amounts of numerous types of symbolic capital; 13 knighthoods; 11 CBEs; 13 OBEs, 3 MBEs, 44 Honorary Degrees; 10 Russell Group Fellowships, 3 Beacon Prize Winners; 52 business awards and 8 awards for philanthropy. Collectively, these findings suggest that contemporary UK EPs receive significant public recognition and support our conclusion that philanthropy is an accumulative process which can accrue many and multiple benefits for philanthropists.\n\nLife story interviews (phase 3) with a smaller sample of 30 of these EPs (10 with net worth of more than &pound;100 mn; 20 with net worth &pound;10-99mn) together with 20 depth interviews with their foundation executives, wealth advisors and also policy makers provided rich, detailed insights into the philanthropic activities of contemporary UK EPs and, by developing detailed case studies, we were able to explore in greater detail the findings to emerge from Phase 2. Key findings include: the variety and complexity of motivations for redistributing vast sums of personal wealth; entrepreneurs’ personal reflections on the multiple personal and societal benefits which accrue from their philanthropy; the multiple forms of capital which entrepreneurs draw upon and leverage when engaging in philanthropy - while economic capital is an essential ‘entry ticket’ to world making philanthropy, the importance of cultural (experience and education), social (contacts) and reputational or symbolic capital should not be underestimated. We find that this combination of forms of capital are essential if the philanthropic activities of entrepreneurs are to be significant, affect sustainable societal change and accrue multiple personal and business benefits for EPs. These interviews also reveal much about entrepreneurs’ ‘Journey to Philanthropy’ indicating that entrepreneurs rarely become world making philanthropists and instead start small and local and learn about the process of philanthropy and potential multiple benefits before progressing to both larger scale and more formalised philanthropy involving a vehicle such as a foundation and professional wealth and philanthropic advisers. An additional important finding was what interviews revealed about the scale and scope of the UK’s philanthropy landscape. We find that philanthropy in the UK is at an early stage of development with variable levels of specialised advice and support. For example, many of the wealth advisers we interviewed indicated a need for better training to enable them to provide appropriate, specialised philanthropy and wealth redistribution advice including appropriate tax advice. Throughout our study we also collected data from international comparisons including India and Australia: these provide interesting insights into alternative philanthropic ecosystems and indicate that more research on the effectiveness of the Australian philanthropic ecosystem may be beneficial for encouraging more and better philanthropy within the UK. We have so far disseminated our findings widely, using a number of formats to reach various audiences including research, practitioner and policy communities. Included in this package of dissemination we have: used the CGAP website; written book chapters; hosted an ESRC Festival of Science event; published papers in leading peer reviewed academic journals; hosted and contributed to engagement and impact events with entrepreneurs involved in or planning for philanthropy and also wealth advisors; we have hosted or contributed to workshops with support and intermediary organisations including community foundations. A full list of all conference papers and publications is detailed in the Outcomes section. Throughout the research we have increasingly engaged with and become embedded within Scottish, UK and international philanthropic circles. As a direct consequence of our research, we have offered advice to a range of organisations including Foundation Scotland, the Scottish Government, the Community Foundation for Tyne &amp;amp; Wear and Northumberland, Community Enterprise in Scotland, Social Investment Scotland, Inspiring Scotland and the Scottish Family Business Association. We now sit on the boards of several of these or advisory committees reporting to these organisations including the New Zealand Centre for Social Innovation. At the time of writing, we are working in collaboration with both Foundation Scotland and the Scottish Family Business Association to develop a programme to support entrepreneurial philanthropy in Scotland by providing education on philanthropy and mechanisms for connecting philanthropists motivated to engage in philanthropy. Going forward we intend to continue to use this package of means for disseminating our research across all relevant communities. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
