These partnerships offer local students in Hong Kong the opportunity to obtain an 'international' degree conferred by a UK HEI. They are the newest (and least known) manifestation of a much broader trend towards the 'internationalisation' of higher education globally. </p>\n\n<p>A detailed examination of these partnerships will provide invaluable knowledge about the current and future directions of international linkages between the two territories, as well as offering a significant insight into general trends in the internationalisation of HE. In examining the partnerships, the project will focus particularly upon the perspective of students currently enrolled on a joint UK-Hong Kong degree programme, graduates of these programmes, employers, and HE service providers. The study will employ qualitative research techniques (in-depth interviews) to explore the motivations, expectations and experiences of students and graduates, as well as the views of employers on the perceived 'value' of such international degree programmes. Individuals within HEIs will be asked about expectations on setting up and experiences of running these degree programmes, outcomes to date, and future projections regarding UK-Hong Kong HEI partnerships. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3000","grantId":"RES-000-22-3000","fundValue":"35047","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Johanna Lesley Waters","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
