{"id":"B648F21C-4C88-47A8-8A3D-034653159B1C","title":"Superkingdom","abstractText":"Superkingdom is the third part of 'Hibernator', a trilogy of works connecting myth and science, environmental cues and technological control, the virtual worlds we imagine and the real world we cannot escape. \\n\\nThe Superkingdom proposal draws on the natural woodland environment of King's Wood, Kent to inspire a series of animal 'Show Homes' that will provide a platform to observe and study animal behaviour over the winter months.\\n\\nConsidered as an enclave, a protected area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, King's Wood is an environment surrounded by encroaching urban development. This contention will provide the context for research into the changing habitat and consequent animal displacement and migration within the region of King's Wood. The fellow will develop a narrative of urban-rural / animal-human intersection. \\n\\nThe fellow will research the architecture of animals in particular their achievements in structural form and strength, use of locally resourced materials, ventilation and pest management. These methods will be contrasted to the architecture created by humankind.\\n\\nThis research will inform the design of a series of 'Show Homes' to encourage animals to take up residence. The 'Show Homes' will reflect human authoritarian architecture, fantastical architecture and the architecture created by animals. The structures will correspond with different sites of habitation - the canopy, floor and underground spaces of the forest. \\n\\nDrawing on existing research into the patterns of animals that hibernate, migrate or forage all winter, the forest installation will become a site for the study of animal habitation and behaviour. This study will provide content for a digital moving image work that will reflect the winter ecology of the forest. In contrast there will be a fictional element to the film to suggest changing environmental cues through an influx of non-native species taking up residence.\\n\\nThe 'Show Homes' will be filmed in situ with footage of both their external and internal spaces. The film will combine fictional utopias, dystopias, and dream worlds with architectural follies and notions of the 'new town'. \\n\\nTo further express ideas of displacement and non-locality, the fellow will collaborate with New Zealand based composer Dugal McKinnon who will develop a sound track for the moving image work, using sound recordings from forests in New Zealand, juxtaposing sound and image both geographically and seasonally.\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G009635/1","grantId":"AH/G009635/1","fundValue":"16483","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jo  Joelson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
