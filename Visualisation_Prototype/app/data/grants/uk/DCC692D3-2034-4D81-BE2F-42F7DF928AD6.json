Our initial work, demonstrated that the performance achieved by our energy-efficient FPGA based solution equals that delivered by large, power-hungry high-performance computer clusters. \n\nThe follow-up-fund awa More than 50,000 research groups are engaged in biochemical and other forms of life sciences research activities worldwide, including academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations, as well as biotechnology, pharmaceutical and chemical companies and diagnostic laboratories. LC-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF are the instrument configurations most commonly used in proteomics research. The world-wide mass spectroscopy market was about US$1.3 billion in 2005 and should grow the fastest Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
