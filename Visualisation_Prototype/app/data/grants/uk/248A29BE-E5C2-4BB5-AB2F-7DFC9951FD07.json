{"id":"248A29BE-E5C2-4BB5-AB2F-7DFC9951FD07","title":"A family based trial for primary prevention of type 2 Diabetes in South Asians","abstractText":"Lay summary:Type 2 diabetes is a serious disease. It runs in families, but is mainly caused by being overweight and not being physically active. About 20% of British South Asians have diabetes, compared to 4% of the UK population. Weight loss and exercise programmes prevent diabetes internationally but this has not been proven, either in the UK or in UK South Asians. This research will investigate whether a family-based lifestyle change programme (based on diet and physical activity) will prevent diabetes in people living in families where there is diabetes. This will benefit the population by helping us understand how to prevent diabetes.\n\nWider issues: The Universities involved are active in public engagement in science. The PI (Bhopal) will take primary responsibility for ensuring dissemination of the results via the popular media, through press releases, and interviews with radio and television. Bhopal has a track record of such work. Our links with the community and professionals are excellent, and several of the investigators and collaborators will work to ensure policy makers, practitioners, and the public are directly engaged during the dissemination process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501310","grantId":"G0501310","fundValue":"1077200","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rajinder  Bhopal","coPersons":["Sunita  Wallia","Sarah  Wild","Aziz  Sheikh","Michael  Lean","John  McKnight","Julia  Lawton","Gordon Douglas Murray","John Franklin Forbes"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
