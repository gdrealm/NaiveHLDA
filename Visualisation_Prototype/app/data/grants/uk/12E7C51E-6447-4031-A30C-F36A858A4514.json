To understand our origins and place in the universe we need to understand how planets and stars form. Using a novel sky-survey instrument, which we are building in South Africa, we will search for planets around other stars. Using the latest and biggest telescopes and satellites we will study stellar nurseries where stars are born. We will investigate how they evolve, how they interact with each other, how they interact with their environment, and how they enrich interstellar space with the chemical ingredients from which a new generation of stars and planets will form, and from which, ultimately, we ourselves are made.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D000955/1","grantId":"PP/D000955/1","fundValue":"971364","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Coel  Hellier","coPersons":["Aneurin  Evans","Jorick Sandor Vink","Pierre Francois Maxted","Robin David Jeffries","Jacobus Theodorus  Van Loon"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
