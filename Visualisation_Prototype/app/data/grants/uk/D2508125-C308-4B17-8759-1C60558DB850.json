We propose a school that teach non-mathematician researchers how mathematics and mathematicians work that dovetails with this conference. Students will come from any discipline and learn what motivates mathematicians and drives the way they think. They will meet a wide variety of mathematical concepts and see their application in CS science. Students will produce a poster at the beginning of the school explaining their research area, and poster at the end suggesting the kind of mathematics that might further their work. The conference mathematicians will view these posters at a social event, discuss the students' ideas, and award prizes. Although students cannot become mathematicians in one week, it is intended that they learn how to work with mathematicians. The school will forge a cohort of murually supportive UK CS students, networked to each other and CS students in Europe. Two such schools are planned.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D035120/1","grantId":"EP/D035120/1","fundValue":"62350","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeffrey  Johnson","coPersons":["Robert Sinclair MacKay"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
