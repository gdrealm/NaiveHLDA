{"id":"880CA067-F99C-4B9B-9E55-5D48A635041A","title":"A flexible theory of topic and focus movement","abstractText":"Sentences in discourse are connected by an intricate system of information-structuring devices, such as topic and focus. Many languages have a fronting operation that ensures that the topic or the focus of the utterance is sentence-initial. The main innovation of our proposal is that we claim that topic and focus movement is triggered by the need to create continuous syntactic constituents corresponding to discourse functions. This allows a trivial mapping between syntax and discourse. We also claim that differences between topic and focus are largely extra-syntactic, in particular prosodic, highlighting the role of prosody for interpretation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119403/1","grantId":"119403/1","fundValue":"344707","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  No - neither was this expected for this project, which involved theoretical, foundational research.  ","person":"Adriaan Dirk Neeleman","coPersons":["Michael  Brody"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" It has long been known that word order is affected by such factors as what is emphasised and what the sentence is about. We have found that there are certain cross-linguistic regularities in the effects that these factors have, several of which had not been noted before. In addition, we have developed a simple computational system that captures the observed generalisations and that can function a model for the human faculty of language in this domain. The research is primarily relevant to other linguists. Further research corroborating the proposed generalisations, as well as further development of the theoretical model are in order (some of this work has been carried out or is being carried out).\n\nBeyond linguistics, the research might play a role in work on translation, language education and psycholinguistics Education","dataset":"gtr"}
