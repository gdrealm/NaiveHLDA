Aberrant function of these cells is associated with immunodeficiency (e.g. AIDS) or autoimmunity (e.g. type I diabetes, rheumatioid arthritis). T lymphocytes are derived from blood stem cells and complete their maturation in the thymus, an organ located near the heart that has evolved specifically to provide an environment that promotes T cell development. The developmental stages haematopoietic stem cells pass through as they mature into T lymphocytes have been relatively well-characterised. This has allowed the identification of key regulatory checkpoints that cells must pass through in order to develop further. One of these checkpoints is called beta-selection. In order to pass through this checkpoint cells must generate specific signals which bring about changes in gene expression and allows the cells to divide. The beta-selection signal is also necessary for cells to survive. We have identified some of the genes which are responsible for generating the beta-selection signal. These genes which are called phosphatidylinositol-3- kinases are potential drug targets which are being actively investigated by many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our project proposal is to pursue experiments which will increase our understanding of how signalling by phosphatidylinositol-3- kinases is regulated by cell surface receptors and how this is integrated with upstream and downstream processes. It is reasonable to assert that general principles learned from study of early T lympchocyte differentiation may be reiterated at subsequent developmental stages. Thus, we believe our work on early T cell development may be relevant to processes important for the activation of mature T lymphocytes in health and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F02066X/1","grantId":"BB/F02066X/1","fundValue":"527931","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Turner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":" research underpinned development of anticancer drug application to other diseases Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
