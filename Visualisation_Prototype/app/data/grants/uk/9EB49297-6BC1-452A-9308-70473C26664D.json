In Europe, the Near East, Cyprus and North Africa archaeologists have documented widespread changes in settlement patterns and social and economic behaviour. Traditional interpretations of these changes have favoured regionally specific cultural explanations but increasingly, archaeological and environmental data recovered from excavations of 6th millennium BP sites are supporting and supplementing the growing body of climatic data indicating that the 6th millennium BP was a period of profound and irreversible climatic change. A forum which brings together key contributors to the debate is therefore timely and essential if we are to gain greater understanding of this emerging area of intellectual importance.\\n\\nThe study of past climatic and environmental change and its impact on human societies will become increasingly relevant as we move into the 21st century. Discussion of responses to rapid climatic and environmental change is essentially absent from the debate, yet the past provides us with comparisons which may prove relevant in the future. The geographically widespread climatic and environmental changes evident between ~6000 and 5000 BP provide us with an opportunity to explore the impacts of changes in climatic and environmental conditions on societies which, while remote in time, share many characteristics with historical and modern societies.\\n\\nThe results of this research will thus be of wide interest, not only amongst archaeologists and climate scientists, but also potentially, historians, art historians, human geographers and anthropologists researching modern human responses to environmental change.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039155/1","grantId":"AH/H039155/1","fundValue":"24226","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This work is still ongoing and impacts are not yet fully known.

The work focused on the Mediterranean region and adjacent areas, in particular the regions encompassing modern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Israel, and also northern Africa including the Sahara and its fringes. In all of these areas climate change ultimately resulted in the establishment of drier conditions.\n\n\n\nThe workshops achieved three significant outcomes. First, they enabled us to refine the chronology of environmental changes in this period. Whereas it is increasingly acknowledged that the 6th millennium before present was a period of significant climatic and environmental change, we identified widespread evidence that this period of climatic and environmental transition commenced around 6400 years ago, with a period of severe and abrupt climate change between 5200 and 5000 years marking the end of this transition in many areas. Second, while the overall trend was one of drying, there was considerable variation in how these global changes manifested themselves in the different regions examined. During this transitional period these regions variously experienced abrupt drying, periods of intense rainfall ('deluges') and high winds. Third, the workshops revealed evidence of how people apparently responded to these environmental change, with their responses depending on a variety of factors that mediated opportunities and constraints including culture, environment, technology, population, and resource availability. This allows us to develop models of human-environment interaction that acknowledge the role of climatic and environmental change in the development of human societies without being narrowly deterministic. This work has significant potential for engaging the public in issues of climate change and its impacts on human societies. It can contribute to the wider debate about how people and societies in different parts of the world may be affected by and respond to climate change over the course of the twenty first century. It provides us with insights into how changes in resource availability driven by climate change may impact on human populations and lead to changes in the formal and informal institutions that play key roles in structuring society.
