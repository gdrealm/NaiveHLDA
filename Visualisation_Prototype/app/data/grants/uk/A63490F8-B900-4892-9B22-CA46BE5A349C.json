Being very strong they are able to withstand high loads. Unfortunately, tendons are commonly affected by disease, injuries and wear-and-tear, e.g. inflammatory tendonitis, if not rested can cause chronic pain and breakdown of the tendon tissue. Greater participation in sports and increasing number of older people, has led to a rise in tendon-associated problems. Several treatments are available, but they are not 100% successful. Common treatments include; surgery to stitch ruptured tendon-ends back together, but this can cause scar-tissue leaving the tendon prone to re-rupture. Tendons can also be repaired using tendon tissue that is taken from another site within the patient (autograft), or it can come from a human donor (allograft). However, in both cases the repaired tendon is left in a weakened state, which can lead to later problems. Also, patients who receive an autograft have longer recovery times and increased risk of infection because they now have two wounds; and those receiving allografts similarly have an increased risk of infection and chance of tissue rejection. \n\nUsing a biomaterials approach, we are aiming to provide a new and unique solution for tendon-associated problems. Biomaterials involves the use of approved-materials for implantation. These materials are formed into pre-designed structures, referred to as scaffolds, which imitate the tissue they are to replace. We have designed and developed a scaffold which closely imitates tendon structure and offers several advantages as a new tendon treatment:\n1.Single surgery is required and creates no secondary wounds.\n2.Risk of rejection is significantly reduced.\n3.Load-bearing capabilities reduces patient recovery time.\n4.Scaffold material breaks down at the same rate as new tendon-tissue formation leaving a new and fully repaired tendon.\n\nDuring the last five-years, we have generated positive and encouraging scientific data regarding this scaffold, which includes a short-term preliminary study in mice. With DPFS-funding, we will further investigate the scaffold in this animal model as this will provide definitive results as to whether the scaffold provides good enough load-bearing support and promotes new tendon-tissue formation over time. We will also investigate ?up-scaling? this scaffold in terms of scaffold size and dimensions as this will allow scaffolds to be available in a range of sizes suitable for all patients with tendon injuries. After DPFS-funding we will commence a clinical trial, which will involve patients receiving this scaffold as a tendon treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000788","grantId":"G1000788","fundValue":"869523","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandra  DownesSarah Harriet Cartmell","coPersons":["Jason  Wong","Paul  Mummery","Duncan Angus  McGrouther"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
