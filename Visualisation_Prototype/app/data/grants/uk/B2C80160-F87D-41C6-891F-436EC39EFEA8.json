{"id":"B2C80160-F87D-41C6-891F-436EC39EFEA8","title":"Simplified interferometric method for the characterization of ultrashort optical pulses","abstractText":"We propose to develop a prototype instrument for measuring the electric field of ultrafast optical pulses. This technology has applications in telecommunications, biological imaging, molecular mass spectrometry and TeraHertz radiation sensing as well as in many branches of scientific research. The instrument uses both a novel means for coding phase information about the pulse into a signal that can be measured with detectors of much slower response time than the pulses whose duration is sought (typically in the femtosecond (10.15 sec) regime), and a new method for processing the data to extract the pulse shape. The instrument will have enhanced capabilities compared to those currently on the market in terms of the amount of information provided, size, sensitivity, operating parameter range, rapidity of update and robustness to noise.Duration of Project (months)","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D503248/1","grantId":"EP/D503248/1","fundValue":"56512","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Alexander Walmsley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
