This relative movement is triggered by an elevation of calcium ions in the cytoplasm around the filaments. Most of this calcium comes from a membrane bound organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum within the muscle cell. The channel through which the calcium ions cross the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane is a protein called the ryanodine receptor. When a nerve excites a muscle cell to contract, the ryanodine receptor channel is opened to the flow of calcium ions. The channel must close to allow the calcium ions to be pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum for the muscle to relax. The ryanodine receptor is a huge integral membrane protein making it difficult to study, but the genetics of various human conditions suggest the control of the channel is more complicated than we currently appreciate. Genetic approaches taken in a suitable model system make such difficult subjects tractable.\nOne powerful model system in biological study, with which genetic approaches can be readily pursued, is the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. At a molecular genetic level all animals are much more similar than might have been expected from outward appearances. By studying this nematode worm we have already found out about many important aspects of fundamental biology. Like vertebrates, C. elegans locomotion depends on neural excitation of muscle cells. C. elegans also has a ryanodine receptor, with structure very similar to the ryanodine receptor of vertebrates, including humans, and the control mechanisms will also be conserved.\nThe C. elegans ryanodine receptor will be modified in the same way as in human conditions where the ryanodine receptor of some individuals, susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, appears compromised. The reaction of the worms, with such modified ryanodine receptors, to conditions that cause a problem response in susceptible people will be assessed. A few such worm models have already been constructed to test the approach and some of these do respond to triggering agents in a manner reminiscent of the human condition. This adds support to the validity of using C. elegans as a model for this topic of study. Further models, with different ryanodine receptor variants, will be constructed and the response of all model strains to triggering agents will be fully assessed. The worm models that do not show such reactions will nevertheless be partially compromised and provide a sensitized background state in which additional genetic changes, of direct relevance to ryanodine receptor function, can be revealed. The additional genetic changes are likely to affect proteins involved in controlling the activity of the ryanodine receptor. Therefore, random mutations will be created across the genome in the sensitized strains of C. elegans and mutants which now respond to the triggering agent, dependent on the modified ryanodine receptor, will be screened for. Characterization of the mutations in these mutant strains will identify genes and encoded proteins with roles in control of the ryanodine receptor function that had not been previously appreciated. Identifying novel regulatory mechanisms acting on the ryanodine receptor may well lead to medical treatments for various human medical conditions associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle.\nPrevious studies in C. elegans and mammals have repeatedly suggested a link between ryanodine receptor function and muscle ageing, the decreased capacity for muscle contraction in older animals. The short lifespan of C. elegans has made this species a leading subject for ageing research. Muscle ageing rates will be measured in mutants isolated in the ryanodine receptor compromised background. Similar assays will be applied for other genes previously linked with ryanodine function. Possible subjects for research into delaying muscle ageing will thereby be identified.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00032X/1","grantId":"BB/M00032X/1","fundValue":"396564","fundStart":"2015-01-19","fundEnd":"2018-01-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hope","coPersons":["Marie-Anne  Shaw"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
