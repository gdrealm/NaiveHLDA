{"id":"E9694456-8CA9-4409-A3DB-EE0F24E29A3D","title":"Numerical Methods in Complex Differential Geometry","abstractText":"The project brings together two areas of mathematics. One is connected to Einstein's equations in Relativity. These are very complicated and the search for solutions has been a major problem for nearly a century. The other area involves algebraic equations defining curves, surfaces and higher dimensional generalisations. The project will implement new and elegant numerical algorithms on a computer to find the coefficients in algebraic equations which define good approximations to solutions of certain variants of Einstein's equations, particularly relevant in String theory .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D057590/1","grantId":"EP/D057590/1","fundValue":"172479","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Donaldson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
