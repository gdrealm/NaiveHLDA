VISTA is being built for a UK Consortium of 18 Universities, led by Queen Mary University of London, and is due for delivery to the European Southern Observatory in late 2006 and expected to be producing first science results in 2007. The VISTA Project Office (VPO) is located at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre, and is responsible for managing the technical aspects of delivering VISTA to Chile and commissioning it. The VISTA Principal Investigator (PI) and Consortium Director is Prof Emerson, who needs to be involved in aspects of the VISTA commissioning activities, and in particular to satisfy himself that the components of the system, and the system as a whole, performs to acceptable standards, prior to formal acceptance by Queen Mary, and subsequent transfer to ESO. Emerson also leads the Science Verification phase of VISTA. To enable him to do this for VISTA requires 40% of his time to be bought out for a period of 2 years from Sep 2005 together with associated travel &amp; subsistence expenses of the PI. Further expenses are associated with necessary coordination meetings of the VISTA Consortium to ensure the best planning for exploitation of VISTA, and payment of sundry other costs that will arise in association with the handover to ESO. This is to be funded from the remaining JIF funds already awarded for VISTA. [A matching 40% of Emerson's salary will be provided via a separate application to PPARC using round 2 e-science funds allocatted the the VISTA Data Flow System (VDFS), (as part of the successful VEGA e-science round2 proposal) for which Emerson is Project Leader.]","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D002567/1","grantId":"PP/D002567/1","fundValue":"241242","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Peter Emerson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
