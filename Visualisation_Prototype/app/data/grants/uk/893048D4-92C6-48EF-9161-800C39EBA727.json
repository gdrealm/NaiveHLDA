{"id":"893048D4-92C6-48EF-9161-800C39EBA727","title":"Supported Cell Membranes: The next level in model membrane systems","abstractText":"All living cells are surrounded by a thin membrane that shields and separates the inside of these cells from their surroundings. These thin membranes contain many proteins that transport specific compounds, like nutrients and salt, across the membrane. Some of these proteins actively transport protons across the membrane using the energy that is released from electron transfers. Consequently, the concentration of many compounds is different on the inside of the membrane compared to the outside. These gradients play a crucial role in biology and many reactions in the cell are dependent on it. When we study the structure and function of protein normally located in membranes we often study them in an environment that is different from the membrane. In this proposal we aim to develop a new tool that allows the study of membrane proteins in their natural environment. For this to be achieved, we will place the complete membrane on a specially designed surface that interacts with the membrane. These surfaces can then 'interrogate' the membrane proteins that are involved in the transmembrane transport of charged species (salt) or electrons. By studying these proteins we will learn more about how they function inside their natural membrane. Another important benefit is that the membrane proteins do not need to be purified, but that total membrane extracts can be used. This makes the experimental system relatively easy to prepare and therefore allows intergration in devices such as 'lab-on-chip'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D008131/1","grantId":"BB/D008131/1","fundValue":"177753","fundStart":"2006-05-08","fundEnd":"2009-05-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research grant has not yet resulted in a direct economic or societal impact. However, work done under this grant led to the development of novel biotechnological systems for sensing and panning (in phage display). The sensing technology was further explored with Philips in a BBSRC CASE Studentship (2007-2011), but this did not result in an economic impact. The system is currently used to select biomimetic antibodies against membrane-protein targets,which we are currently exploring with the company MedImmune via a BBSRC CASE Studentship (2012-2016).

Results obtained with this method confirmed earlier studies with hydrophilic substrate analogues, but put these in a 'framework' more applicable to membrane enzymes (e.g., the substrate concentration is defined in 'two-dimensional' units (pmol/cm2 instead of mol/dm3)\n\n2) The experimental system, for the first time, provided a quantitative assessment of the 'flip time' of quinols in the lipid membrane. It takes 0.05 -1 second for a quinone 'head-group' to diffuse to the other side of a lipid bilayer.\n\n3) The novel method provided the framework to immobilise plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells onto solid surfaces and use this approach in the design of a novel biosensor. This work was later continued by an Industrial CASE studentship in collaboration with Philips Research. This study was provided a novel methodology for the study of respiratory membrane enzymes. The technology developed in this study has since been used by other academic research groups. However, as the methodology is technically difficult, new applications have so far (by 2014) only been carried in collaboration with Jeuken (the PI of this award) research group.\n\nThe methodology developed in this award let to:\n1) The study of a membrane-bound hydrogenase, in collaboration with Prof. Oliver Lenz, Technical University Berlin, Germany. This research is funded by a ERC fellowship held by Jeuken and funding from the German government.\n2) A study commenced into respiratory enzymes from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, in collaboration with Prof. Julea Butt from the University of East Anglia. This research has been funded by a new BBSRC award (BB/G007519/1). Other","dataset":"gtr"}
