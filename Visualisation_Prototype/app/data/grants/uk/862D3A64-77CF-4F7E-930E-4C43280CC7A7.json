Supply chain accounting involves using innovative accounting and management control practices to evaluate relationships between an organisation and its customers and suppliers in order to ensure that these relationships create value, are cost effective, and/or meet additional criteria such as labour standards.</p>\n\n<p>Intended outcomes of the project include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>an enhanced understanding of the impact of dominant parties on the employment practices of subordinate parties in supply chains</li>\n\n <li>a supply chain accounting approach that promotes better labour standards</li>\n\n <li>contributions toward the development of global and local commodity chain theory.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The three-year interdisciplinary project uses a multi-method approach, involving:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>a literature review that explores relationships between global commodity chains, supply chain accounting and employment practices</li>\n\n <li>a survey of automotive and textile companies in Brazil and South Africa</li>\n\n <li>case study research within ten supply chains, including documentary analysis and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders.&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The economic and social dimensions of this research should facilitate positive outcomes for a range of stakeholders, but particularly for workers and organisations.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006452/1","grantId":"ES/K006452/1","fundValue":"214802","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pauline  Dibben","coPersons":["Luiz Carlos  Miranda","Phillip  Johnson","Deborah Rosemary  Bonnin","Juliana  Meira","John  Cullen","Geoffrey Thomas Wood"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
