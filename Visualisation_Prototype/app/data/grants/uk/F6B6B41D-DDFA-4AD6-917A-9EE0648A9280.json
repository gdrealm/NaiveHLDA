Treatments that lower the levels of cholesterol have been shown to protect against these diseases, thereby saving lives. This project will look into how we can use a new drug called an antisense oligonucleotide to lower the level of cholesterol in the blood and therefore perhaps to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802469","grantId":"G0802469","fundValue":"604980","fundStart":"2009-08-10","fundEnd":"2011-11-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bernard Chong Khoo","coPersons":["Jonathan Paul Simons","James Stuart Owen"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
