Interestingly, this hormone has now been shown to play a part in adult women in that it is involved in the working of the ovary. In the ovary each month an egg is grown and released. We have found that only those eggs which have got rid of AMH manage to grow. This is important because we have also found that the levels of this hormone are very high in a common condition which causes infertility. We now need to find out why the levels are high in these women and what exactly AMH does in the ovary. We hope that this will allow us to help these women to have better fertility in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700916","grantId":"G0700916","fundValue":"305730","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Mason","coPersons":["Malcolm  Parker"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
