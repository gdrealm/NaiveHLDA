HPIV allows for mesurement of three dimensional velocity vector field maps and is used to characterise complex flow fields. Our current laser system was purchased in 1992 from an EPSRC grant, ref: GR/G55426 entitled Full-Field I.C. Engine Cylinder Flow Measurement using Partide Image Velocimetry and is now obsolete. It is important to note that the new laser will find use in more applications than we can reasonably describe in this proposal. In the three applications we have described the research will allow us to:1. better understand the flow of granular materials e.g. powders and thus prevent blockage in pumping systems and silos;2. design diesel engine combustion systems to be more efficient and environmentally friendly;3. design respiratory drug inhalers to deliver a carefully controlled drug dosage to the lungs with more efficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E032990/1","grantId":"EP/E032990/1","fundValue":"455484","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Halliwell","coPersons":["Graham Kenneth  Hargrave","Colin Peter Garner","Jeremy Michael Coupland","Ricky Darren Wildman","Henk  Versteeg","Jonathan Mark  Huntley"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
