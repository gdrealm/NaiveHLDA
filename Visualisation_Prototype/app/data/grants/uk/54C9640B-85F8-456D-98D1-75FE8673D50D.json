Many such enterprises and their workforce operate informally, outside the protection of national or local regulation, but their operations are critical to the livelihoods of the urban poor. \n\nBased on the assumption that improved access to borrowing will trigger growth among micro-enterprises, development policy has attempted to widen their access to financial services. The past twenty years, and particularly the last ten, have seen a proliferation of micro-finance programmes and providers. Microfinance is now a major supplier of financial services to millions of people in the emerging world. Yet major concerns have emerged about its access and reach, regulation and oversight, and impact on growth, poverty reduction and indebtedness.\n\nThe hypothesis of the research is that poor national and local regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs) limits the accessibility and take-up of microfinance services, and that lack of consumer protection regulations for MFI services inhibits micro-enterprises from innovation and growth. The research is explored through comparative case studies of urban micro-enterprises in economic growth sectors in Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia and India. \n\nThe research objectives are to analyse national and local policies on microfinance provision; the finance needs of micro-enterprises and the sources of finance they access; the availability of microfinance and impact on micro-enterprise growth; issues of consumer protection relating to different finance mechanisms, and the potential for improved policy and practice in financial regulation to contribute to micro-enterprise growth and poverty reduction. \n\nAlthough micro-enterprises innovate frequently, evidence suggests that, even when involved in economic growth sectors, innovations are small-scale and they face significant barriers in business expansion. Two key barriers to innovation and growth are identified: obstacles to accessing capital and other financial services, and the detrimental impact of unregulated services and lack of consumer protection for micro-enterprises. \n\nThe research team has completed four case studies in: Rwanda (Muhanga, Musanze, Kigali); Tanzania (Arusha, Dar es Salaam); Kenya (Kisumu, Nairobi), and Ethiopia (Hawassa, Addis Ababa), completing 836 interviews with micro-entrepreneurs. A fifth case study in India (Ahmedabad) will be completed in January 2015. Data is now being analysed. This research is useful for a range of actors including international agencies supporting growth and development, national governments, microfinance institutions and associations of micro-entrepreneurs.
