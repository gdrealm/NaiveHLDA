Markets are defined by the characteristics of the good being traded, the information possessed by the agents, and the interaction technology. Relationship specific characteristics, such as the geographical localization of the partners and the reciprocal reputation, are generally abstracted away. We model heterogeneous trading relationships by representing the economy as a network, where the presence of a link between two agents is interpreted as anything that allows or facilitates trade. \n\n\n\nThe first contribution of our project is methodological. We provide a general framework to study both the patterns of trade that arise in economies, described as trading networks, and the endogenous formation of trading networks. The model is general and allows for incorporation of a wide range of different forms of trade institutions. The second contribution is the study of two specific models, each belonging to our general framework. The first model studies the trade of an object in a given network when negotiations are conducted bilaterally. The second model studies the formation of trading networks and the extent to which they depart from efficient trading networks under ex-post efficient allocations. The work we have conducted in this proposal has led two research papers. These papers are having influence in the profession and are becoming one of the first outputs in the literature of strategic intermediation in networks. This is a very active area of research at the moment. I have been recently invited to edit an Handbook Chapter on this topic.
