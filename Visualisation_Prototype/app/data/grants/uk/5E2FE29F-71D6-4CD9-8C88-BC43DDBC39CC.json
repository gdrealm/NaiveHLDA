To do this, we will investigate how nanoparticles interact with cells to produce changes leading to toxicity such as the death of the cells. This will involve identifying which genes and proteins in human lung-derived cell lines in culture (i.e. grown in tissue culture dishes) are affeted when exposed to a range of engineered nanoparticles. Nanoparticles will be engineered to vary in a number of key characteristics, such as chemical composition, size and shape. It is likely that the effects of the nanoparticles on the celluls will depend upon the characteristics of the nanoparticles and the cell type. Hence, the information obtained will be of value in helping predict the likely effects of nanoparticles in humans, in the design of potentially less harmful material and in the future evaluation of novel nanomaterials","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801880","grantId":"G0801880","fundValue":"517291","fundStart":"2009-06-22","fundEnd":"2012-12-04","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Boobis","coPersons":["Robert  Edwards","Stefan  Grimm","Teresa Dorothy  Tetley"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
