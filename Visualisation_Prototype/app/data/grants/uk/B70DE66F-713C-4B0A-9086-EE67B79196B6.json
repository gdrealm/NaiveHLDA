Because ageing is a gradual, long-term process, it is very hard to study in the laboratory. However, by looking at premature ageing diseases, we can start to identify key molecules involved in ageing. The best model system we have is the premature ageing disease called Werner's syndrome. People with this syndrome first show signs of early ageing such as grey hair, wrinkled skin and age-related diseases including hardening of the arteries, cancer and diabetes in their teens or twenties, and have a much shorter than average lifespan. Scientists have identified a single region of the genetic blueprint (a gene) which when lost causes Werner's syndrome. This is particularly exciting as it is possible to work out the function of the gene, which is called WRN, in the test tube and to examine the effect of losing this gene on the ageing of human cells grown in dishes in the lab. We now know from these studies that the protein made from the WRN gene acts to cut or unwind unusual DNA structures, preventing such DNA from rearranging itself - a dangerous event that can lead to the cells ageing prematurely or even leading to cancer. Another key aspect of normal ageing is the accumulation of damage in our DNA throughout our lives, so that older people have high levels of DNA damage. Many things cause damage, but perhaps one of the most important is a dangerous form of oxygen made as a by-product of producing the energy needed for life. This energy production happens in the cell's powerhouses, called mitochondria, which have their own DNA. Because the dangerous form of oxygen is made in the mitochondria right next to mitochondrial DNA, it is widely believed that the DNA in mitochondria is very prone to damage. We have discovered that the WRN protein, or a protein that looks very similar to it, is present in the mitochondria. This is a very exciting new finding that suggests a direct link between what we know about premature ageing in people and ageing due to mitochondrial DNA damage. We want to carry out a series of experiments designed to find out whether the protein we see in mitochondria really is WRN. We shall also see whether more WRN goes into mitochondria when their DNA gets damaged, and we shall try to discover the signal that is responsible for sending WRN to damaged mitochondria. If we find a direct role for WRN in mitochondrial DNA repair, this will open up a whole new research field that may in the longer term help in the development of drugs to slow down mitochondrial DNA damage, prevent premature ageing and enhance the quality of life of older people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E016995/1","grantId":"BB/E016995/1","fundValue":"107790","fundStart":"2007-10-29","fundEnd":"2009-01-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have not yet been published.

EXDL2 is highly related to WRN, a protein important in preventing premature ageing. This is a very exciting new finding that suggests a direct link between what we know about premature ageing in people and ageing due to mitochondrial DNA damage. Experimentally decreasing levels of EXLD2 protein in cells makes them very sick, and we see a preferential loss of the mitotic form of EXDL2.\n\nWe believe that this discovery of EXDL2 as an important in mitochondrial protein possibly involved in mitochondrial DNA repair, this may open up a whole new research field that may in the longer term help in the development of drugs to slow down mitochondrial DNA damage, prevent premature ageing and enhance the quality of life of older people. We have applied for further finding to explore the importance of EXDL2 in mitochondrial DNA stability and in the nuclear genomic response to interstrand DNA crosslinks. This has relevance for treatment of age-related disease, mitochondrial disease and genomic DNA damage. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
