Diabetes causes kidney damage through diabetic kidney disease, medically termed Diabetic Nephropathy (DN). Unfortunately, about a third of all diabetic patients will ultimately lose their lives as a direct result of this DN. Identification of factors that contribute to the early development of DN could enable detection of patients most likely to get this disease with the consequence that treatment could be started earlier. Despite currently available treatments aimed at improving blood glucose and blood pressure control, many diabetic patients still go on to develop kidney failure, which, once established, is debilitating and requires expensive and difficult treatments, such as dialysis or a transplant. Although some progress has recently been made toward understanding DN, how and why it develops is still not fully worked out. \nOur research aims to address these issues in two ways. \n1) We have recently found that diabetes causes a build-up of copper to apparently toxic levels in the cortex of the kidneys (the outer layer of the kidney just under the capsule), where it appears to damage microscopic structures (termed glomeruli) that filter the blood and produce the urine. Currently, DN is diagnosed by detecting elevated levels of a protein, albumin, in urine, which occurs because the glomeruli have become leaky. However by the time albumin is detected in urine, extensive and potentially fatal kidney damage has already occurred. In addition, the presence of albumin in urine does not tell us anything about the processes that actually cause damage to the glomeruli. The development of DN in patients is also accompanied by increased copper levels in urine, as well as of two components of the glomeruli, heparan sulphate (HS) (a polysaccharide attached to proteins) and heparanase, an enzyme that breaks down HS. Our recent research indicates that the presence of HS or heparanase in urine may reflect the actual disease process at work. The First Aim of this project is to determine whether measurement of one or more of these substances could be useful for the early detection of DN, so that we might be able to detect patients at an earlier stage of kidney disease and therefore start treatment sooner, since early intervention will save lives. \n2) We have identified an inexpensive drug, named TETA, that binds to the main form of copper ('divalent' copper) present in altered levels in the tissues of diabetic patients and removes it from the body into the urine in a non-toxic form. We think that this copper build-up is the probable cause of glomerular damage in diabetes, leading to DN. TETA has previously been found to be safe and effective for the treatment of patients with a rare form of copper overload (Wilson's Disease). We have undertaken studies in diabetic patients and animals, which have indicated that TETA is safe and effective for lowering copper levels in diabetic patients and can reverse diabetic damage in the heart and kidney. We have recently shown that TETA also restores HS levels in kidney glomeruli in a model of diabetes. The Second Aim of this project, therefore, is to determine whether measuring urine levels of HS, heparanase and other molecules known to be important in kidney function might complement albumin measurements in acting as indicators of the response of diabetic kidney disease to TETA treatment. The ultimate aim of this research is to uncover how TETA restores kidney function in diabetes. In conclusion, our work aims to identify ways of detecting kidney disease at an earlier stage than is currently possible and developing a way, through the use of TETA, to slow the progression of kidney disease. Our hope is that this will reduce the suffering and prolong the lives of diabetic people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L010445/1","grantId":"MR/L010445/1","fundValue":"252451","fundStart":"2014-04-30","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Garth James Cooper","coPersons":["Andrew William Dowsey","Richard David Unwin","Craig Powis Smith","Paul Nicholas Bishop"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
