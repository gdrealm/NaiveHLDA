The concept of Europeanisation provides a starting point, focusing on the development of EU institutions and norms, and their penetration into the domestic political environment. The empirical part of the research investigates the institutional capacity of the European Energy Community (EEC) and the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Partnership (EMEP) for extending EU regulatory and market regimes to neighbouring states. Analysis focuses on the various incentives for participation, the rules with which participants are obliged to comply, and the interaction that takes place between EU and national actors. It also involves examining the domestic political variables that explain how EEC/EMEP rules and norms are introduced into national political systems. Finally, it examines the outcomes of external governance in terms of institutional change (the emergence of market and regulatory institutions); policy change (privatisation and liberalisation); and normative change in the values of central economic institutions. The research uses a combination of methods; analysis of documentary materials, qualitative interviews with key officials, and quantitative data.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F02830X/1","grantId":"ES/F02830X/1","fundValue":"80853","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Andrew Padgett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
