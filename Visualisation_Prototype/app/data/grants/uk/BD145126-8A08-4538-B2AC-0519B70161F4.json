The proposed system is innovative in design in that it has no moving parts and novel in application in that it will enable cell surface contact charges to be monitored simultaneously for a (heterogeneous) population of surface adherent cells. When response to a pre-selected external stimulus (e.g. enzyme substrate) is registered by a specific cellsub-group at the surface, then that cell group provides a preselected panel for further optimisation for a particular receptor or enzyme cascade. It is envisaged that the system will have application in the discovery of environments conducive to a diverse range of bioprocessing and the robustness would lend itself to integration with the bioprocesses for feedback control and bio-optimisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E010857/1","grantId":"DT/E010857/1","fundValue":"208096","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Asim  Ray","coPersons":["Pankaj  Vadgama"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
