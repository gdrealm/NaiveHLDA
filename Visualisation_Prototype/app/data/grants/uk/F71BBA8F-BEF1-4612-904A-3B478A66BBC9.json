{"id":"F71BBA8F-BEF1-4612-904A-3B478A66BBC9","title":"Bridging support for ROSA operations facility in the UK","abstractText":"Energy generated at the centre of the Sun by nuclear fusion flows out to the surface, and subsequently heats the various components of the atmosphere, including the photosphere, chromosphere and corona. This heating often leads to rapid changes in the intensities of spectral lines which are formed in different atmospheric regions. Observing and modelling such rapid changes, which often take place on very short timescales (less than 1 second) are hence vital to properly understand energy outflow in the Sun and how the atmosphere is heated. Unfortunately however, there are few instruments capable of observing the Sun at sufficiently high cadence to reliably detect rapid changes in the atmosphere. In particular, satellite-based instrumentation has not been able to observe the Sun at very high cadence due to telemetry restrictions. \n\nHowever, in 2006 we obtained funding from both the STFC and our host institute, Queen's University Belfast (QUB), to construct a state-of-the-art imager - Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) - capable of observing the Sun simultaneously in multiple wavebands at a cadence of up to 200 Hz. ROSA was successfully commissioned in 2008 on the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) Sacramento Peak in the USA. It was subsequently delivered as a common-user instrument and made available on the DST for an initial 3-year period from August 2009 - July 2012. As part of our agreement with the NSO, the UK received a guaranteed minimum of 20 days per year observing time on the DST during this 3-year period. \n\nROSA provides both unprecedented time resolution (5 milliseconds) and spatial resolution, as we have developed image reconstruction techniques that allow extremely sharp images of the Sun to be obtained with ROSA on the DST. Indeed, we can resolve structures smaller than 100 km in size on the solar surface, which lies at a distance of 150 million km from Earth. This is equivalent to resolving an object less than 1 cm across which is 15 km away. Additionally, the multiple wavebands of ROSA permit up to 7 regions of the solar atmosphere to be observed simultaneously. Hence effectively the whole atmosphere from the low photosphere to the upper chromosphere can be observed and analysed as one coupled system. In particular, ROSA allows the investigation of oscillatory and transitory phenomena at an unprecedented level of detail, either as a standalone instrument or in conjunction with STFC-supported satellite missions. \n\nIt was important for the UK solar physics community to benefit from the STFC investment in ROSA, and fully exploit the guaranteed time allocation on the DST. Modest STFC funding was hence awarded to establish a Support Facility for ROSA operations in the UK, based at QUB. This provides support for all activities associated with ROSA observing programmes by the UK community, including (i) proposal preparation, (ii) observing support at the DST, (iii) data reduction, including the application of image reconstruction, (iv) development and maintenance of a ROSA archive. It has proved to be very successful, with for example 54 days of observing time on the DST awarded to UK proposals since the start of 2010 alone. In addition, in the last 15 months a total of 8 papers on ROSA data have been published or are in press in major international journals, including 6 in Astrophysical Journal Letters, with another 3 under review and 4 in preparation.\n\nRecently, we have renewed our agreement with the NSO to host ROSA for the further 3-year period August 2012 - July 2015. Once again, the agreement includes a provision of at least 20 days per year reserved for UK proposals, and hence we seek a renewal of our funding for the Support Facility. However, we only request funding from August 2012 - March 2014; support beyond this date will be requested in our Consolidated Grant proposal, due for submission in February 2013 with a start date of April 2014.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000667/1","grantId":"ST/K000667/1","fundValue":"50998","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  No research supported on the grant, just support for other UK institutes to obtain data for their research programmes using the ROSA solar imager.
