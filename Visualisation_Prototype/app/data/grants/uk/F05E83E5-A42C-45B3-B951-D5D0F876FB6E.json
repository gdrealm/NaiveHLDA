However, the objective of this research is to investigate how these databases are being used and proposed for the purposes of constructing and knowing whole populations as objects of government. While historically censuses have been the key method, the 2011 Census may be the last according to recent parliamentary inquiries.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The practices constitute what the research calls 'population metrics'. Each identification practice assembles different measurements of subjects - their biographies and transactions - that can be combined and reassembled in myriad ways. It is through the joining-up of these measurements that populations and their performance can be constructed and evaluated. </p>\n\n<p>The project will investigate the kind of knowledge of populations that metrics make visible by compiling and analysing a textual database of recent UK parliamentary inquiries and government consultations on population statistics and government data. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3493","grantId":"RES-000-22-3493","fundValue":"77312","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Evelyn Sharon Ruppert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":" One finding is that 'metrics' is a useful term for capturing the object of knowledge that is constituted when government administrative databases are joined up. It is a performance-based knowledge where transactional categories across government functions serve as registers for identifying and knowing populations such that what counts is conduct (activities in relation to governments). This finding led to the identification of a number of consequences:\n1) Many data assemblages are possible thus allowing for novel and myriad combinations and different populations. \n2) While censuses enact populations as relatively fixed assemblages of biographies that change slowly, metrics enact populations as modulations of transactions.\n3) Since administrative databases are more 'real-time' populations are not stable entities and thus must be tracked and traced.\n\nA second finding is that these methods produce different kinds of subjects of population knowledge. While the census calls forth active subjects to periodically choose and declare who they are, joining up administrative data calls forth interpassive subjects whereby other people and technologies act in their place. With the government decision following the 'Beyond 2011 Project' consultations, the Office for National Statistics is continuing to investigate administrative databases as an alternative to traditional censuses as a source of population knowledge. The project findings provide critical insights about the implications of this alternative beyond technical and surveillance questions. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
