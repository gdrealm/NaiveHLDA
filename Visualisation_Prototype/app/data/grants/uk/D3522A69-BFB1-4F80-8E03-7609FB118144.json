Slumdwellers develop strategies to improve their lot, developed from learning from daily struggles, within a local social and political system shaped by unequal relations of power and status.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The project will involve surveys of households in a few low income communities in greater Delhi, extensive interviews of the range of other actors involved (community leaders, politicians, fixers, local &quot;big men&quot;, managers and frontline workers in state agencies) and archival work.&nbsp; It will initially involve in-depth work in four communities formed largely from past migrations from rural India.&nbsp; This is expected to be complemented by smaller surveys in several other communities in greater Delhi to place the in-depth work in broader context. </p>\n\n<p>The research will provide a deep analysis of the nature and formation of citizenship in marginal areas, and develop practical policy proposals for both state actors and civil society activists.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0520","grantId":"RES-167-25-0520","fundValue":"132210","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Patrick  Walton","coPersons":["Partha  Mukhopadhyay"],"organisation":"Centre for Policy Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
