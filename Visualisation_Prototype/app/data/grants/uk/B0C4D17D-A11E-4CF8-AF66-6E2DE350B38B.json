However, the development and validation of a proxy measurement for field metabolic rate from fish otoliths is likely to be the main finding. Metabolic rate is central to understanding how individuals and popultions interact with the environment - and how they will respond to environmental change. Until now, there has been no reliable way of assessing field metabolic rate expressed by animals in the wild. we have developed and validated a way of measuring this retrospectively from the chemistry of otoliths we are building new research collaborations and applications based on expressed field metabolic rate in the context of environmental change Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
