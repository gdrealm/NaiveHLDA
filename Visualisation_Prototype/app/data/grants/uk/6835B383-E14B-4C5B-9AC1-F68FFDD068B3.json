{"id":"6835B383-E14B-4C5B-9AC1-F68FFDD068B3","title":"Spin Ping Pong - Towards a Quantum Dot spin QuBit","abstractText":"This proposal aims to fabricate a solid state qubit, the quantum computing analog of a transistor. The method employs epitaxially grown quantum dot bilayers (artificial molecules). These can be doped to accommodate one or more electrons which will have a particular spin (up or down). By using an applied electric field the electron can be forced to reside in one dot or the other. This is the basis of a Spin Ping-Pong device. Using circularly polarised light pulses each dot can be addressed individually and spin information written to it. The spin information can be read using linearly polarised light pulses. Doping with two electrons and using the applied electric field to force an electron into each dot allows the spins to interact and perform quantum computation. Such a device with the promise of scalability will be a major step forward in the field of quantum information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H000488/1","grantId":"EP/H000488/1","fundValue":"901314","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Raymond  Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
