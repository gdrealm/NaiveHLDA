A Social Scientific Investigation of the Sport for Development and Peace Sector","abstractText":"This project will investigate the Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) sector. SDP features hundreds of programmes and organizations across the world which use sport as a tool of intervention to promote non-sport goals such as development, peace, human rights and social justice. SDP is an increasingly institutionalized sector: its most prominent international advocates include the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace (UNOSDP) and the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. Other key SDP stakeholders include UK Sport, British Council, governmental departments (e.g. DfID), charities (e.g. Comic Relief), major corporations (e.g. Barclays Bank), sport federations, many non-governmental organizations which coordinate or implement SDP work (e.g. streetfootballworld, Sport and Development platform), and campaigning groups which protest against exploitation or corruption in sport (e.g. Play the Game). SDP programmes have very diverse objectives and scales; the largest initiatives are transnational, involve multiple agencies, and usually aim to meet basic human needs (e.g. peace in war-torn regions).\nDespite its rapid growth, we have limited knowledge of how the SDP sector is structured socially and organizationally; and how different kinds of SDP work are planned, implemented and experienced in diverse cultural contexts. This knowledge is essential if robust policies, practices and strategies for the future development of SDP are to be identified. The project aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing the first substantial comparative investigation of SDP, and by having long-term impact on the sector's development. \nThe project has five main objectives:\n1: To examine how the SDP sector is constructed in social and organizational terms, notably by investigating the different policies, networking, and power relations between SDP stakeholders; and, how the sector may become more effective through new types of partnership. \n2: To examine SDP work through the comparative investigation of three selected fields of major SDP activity: empowering people with disabilities; promoting peace and conflict resolution; and advancing human rights.\n3: To examine SDP programmes, particularly their organization, implementation and user-group experiences. We shall probe how user groups are engaged in planning and implementing SDP work; and, how these and other aspects of the SDP sector develop over time.\n4: To examine comparatively SDP work in five selected locations of major SDP activity: Bosnia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Zambia. We shall explore how SDP work relates to local conditions; whether SDP organizations build ties with other local actors; and, the roles of national and local government in facilitating SDP work.\n5: To produce research findings with major non-academic and academic impacts. Findings will explore, for example, future policies, planning and partnerships across SDP organizations; how to adapt SDP 'best practices' to local contexts; and how to enhance ethical practice in SDP work. Findings will be disseminated through publications, reports, presentations, media outlets and an end-of-grant symposium. \nThe project will:\n- build upon our substantial pilot research on SDP;\n- benefit from our exceptional research access to leading SDP stakeholders and gatekeepers, notably the Commonwealth Secretariat, UNOSDP, UK Sport and many key NGOs;\n- have an international focus, due to the SDP sector's international structure and locations of intervention (notably in developing nations); \n- draw mainly on a sociological approach in regard to research questions, methods, and analysis, while having significant links to anthropology and 'studies' research fields in disability, peace, human rights, development and globalization; \n- apply qualitative methods, particularly fieldwork in the five research locations and interviews with all types of SDP stakeholder (including user groups);\n- run for 24 months.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002191/1","grantId":"ES/L002191/1","fundValue":"332715","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Giulianotti","coPersons":["Peter David Howe","Simon  Darnell"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
