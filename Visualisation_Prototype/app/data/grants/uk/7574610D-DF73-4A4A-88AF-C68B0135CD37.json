Drawing on new empirical evidence and recent conceptual advances in economic geography, this project maps and analyzes historical patterns of regional specialization and industrial location in an economy that was characterized by profound regional differences in geography, incomes, natural and human resource endowments. </p>\n\n<p>The focus is on four key questions with reference to 14 Austrian and 8 Hungarian regions: (1) How did the level and distribution of regional output change over time? (2) How large was the economic potential of the Habsburg Empire and its constituent regions, and how did it change over time? (3) How concentrated was economic activity and how specialized were the regions of the empire? (4) Which explanatory factors account for the observed patterns in regional specialization and industrial location? </p>\n\n<p>Here the research employs an approach that integrates both factor endowment and market access hypotheses in the analysis of how industry and region characteristics interacted. By offering a new assessment of the impact of historical contingency on economic growth and structural transformation in the empire, this research will help explain the comparative growth failure of one of the Continentâ€™s largest economies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1598","grantId":"RES-000-22-1598","fundValue":"37931","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Max-Stephan  Schulze","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
