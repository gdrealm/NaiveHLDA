Almost 300 million individuals worldwide are affected\nby asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is predicted to be the third-leading cause of death by 2020. Drugcontaining\naerosols are the gold-standard therapy in the treatment of OLDs. Drug delivery to the deep lung remains an\nunmet challenge using existing products. A key challenge to be addressed is the requirement for delivery of an aerosol that\ntargets the diseased airways and minimizes throat deposition, the most frequent cause of side-effects from inhalation\ntherapy.\nExisting inhaled therapies have several drawbacks:\n1. Nebulizer formulations are suitable for patients with severe OLDs, but they are expensive, difficult to operate, require\nelectricity and are usually non-portable;\n2. Pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) produce aerosols with a size suitable for targeting the diseased airways\ndeep in the lung, but are difficult to use correctly, are only suitable for delivering small doses, and between 30 - 60 % of the\ndrug deposits in the throat;\n3. Most dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are passive devices where drug is aerosolized under the force generated when the\npatient inhales through the device. OLD patients are often unable to inhale with sufficient force to generate an aerosol\nsuitable for deposition in the target affected airways, rather than in the upper airways;\n4. It is complex to achieve uniformity of dose content and homogeneous lung dosing when manufacturing DPIs, particularly\nfor high dose drugs such as antibiotics. Advanced formulation and device engineering are required to achieve manufacture\nof functional DPI products. Effective devices often require energy input such as electromechanical force, or compressed\nair.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N510087/1","grantId":"EP/N510087/1","fundValue":"138754","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Darragh  Murnane","coPersons":["Victoria  Hutter"],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
