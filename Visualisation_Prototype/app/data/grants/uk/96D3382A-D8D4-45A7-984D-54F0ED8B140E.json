This will greatly improve the usefulness of existing genetic resources Medicago research. The gene network server can be used to carry out analysis for any species and transcriptomic data type so should be useful to the greater plant biology community.\n\nThe new genome sequence will be useful to people carrying out comparative genomic studies in legumes, and those interested in legume natural diversity.
