A cost benefit analysis for oxyfuel plant flexibility in different markets will concentrate around the scope for (a) a flexible oxyfuel power plant to generate additional value (revenue) under a range of representative market conditions and (b) the scope for the corresponding CO2 storage systems to accommodate such flexibility (and possible technical and financial implications for power plant operation). This work will draw on a growing body of experience at Imperial College in this area being built up as part of ongoing DTI and TSEC projects. These financial benefits for flexibility will be compared against any estimated additional investment requirements or increased operating costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F007116/2","grantId":"DT/F007116/2","fundValue":"48571","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Gibbins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
