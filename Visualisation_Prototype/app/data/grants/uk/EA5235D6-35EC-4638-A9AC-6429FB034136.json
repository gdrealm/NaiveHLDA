Much of what people do is based on their conceptions of shared conventions, but these conceptions are often misinformed. Research suggests that we can influence behaviour by telling people what other people do. The study draws upon research on social influence in sociology, behavioural economics, social psychology and social marketing. The three-year project will explore, develop and evaluate this approach in the context of sustainability, using digital technology as a non-invasive interface in three case studies: 1) electricity consumption, 2) active lifestyle and 3) Facebook.People do not consume energy directly but use it in practices such as cleanliness, cooking, and travel. Everyday practices and habits are grounded in taken-for-granted assumptions about 'normal' practices, e.g. that one should wash bedding every two weeks, leave kitchen appliances plugged in and switched on, drive children to school, etc. This sort of behaviour is often not a calculated choice, but taken-for-granted, as an inherent aspect of modern life. This helps to explain why traditional approaches that try to change behaviour by directly influencing attitudes and intentions often prove ineffective. However, studies in several related disciplines suggest that everyday practices are malleable, and can be nudged in a socially desirable direction by subtle forms of social influence. In particular, research indicates that feedback on an individual's level of performance (e.g. electricity consumption) can change their behaviour, and moreover, that this effect is enhanced if supplemented by feedback on the performance of a relevant social group. This project will evaluate this process, using and developing digital technology to facilitate the capture and feedback of individual and social group information in a non-invasive, cost effective and timely manner.The proposed research is extensive and robust, including three case studies chosen for their diversity, their relevance to current social concerns, and the challenges they present both in terms of intrinsic motivation and digital technology. In the electricity consumption case study, a sensor attached to the participant's electricity supply will transmit usage levels to a server, which will relay individual and social group feedback to the participant. In the active lifestyle case study, a specially developed application will monitor the participant's daily activity levels, displaying individual and social group feedback on a mobile device (e.g. mobile phone). The Facebook case study will evaluate the effect of individual and social group feedback in the context of a social network site. Overall the CHARM project will include approximately 800 experimental subjects, with feedback available on a weekly basis over an 8 week period. In addition, all respondents will be asked to complete a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. This quantitative approach will be complemented and illuminated by extensive qualitative research. The feedback provided in the field trials should heighten respondents' awareness, not only of overall performance levels, but also of the underlying practices that constitute these patterns of behaviour, making them more accessible to interview-based research. These practices will be explored in longitudinal ethnographic research with approximately 100 respondents, and in focus groups designed to stimulate and elicit normative discourse. CHARM will provide a detailed understanding of conceptions of 'normal' practices, of their amenability to change, and of the ways in which they can be shaped by social group feedback.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H006966/1","grantId":"EP/H006966/1","fundValue":"920158","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They influenced the design of energy feedback in a large energy utility and also influenced policy making related to the smart meter rollout.

Furthermore, it suggests that feedback should be shown at a level of disaggregation that allows users to relate it to their own practices - for instance, in hourly or half-hourly time periods. By allowing people to analyse the miniutae of their everyday lives, it encourages to apply a moral test to themselves and to reflect on whether they are 'lazy' or not, 'wasteful' or not; this can have a powerful affect on behaviour. \n\nMuch of the literature on feedback suggests the need for formal target-setting if the feedback is to prompt behaviour change; this research suggested that providing people with visualisations of their behaviours often prompts them to set their own, informal targets, and that these might be more effective than targets from an external source. \nKey to the ways in which feedback can provoke behaviour change is increased awareness of the behaviours. The digital tracking of people's steps made them more aware of the steps they took while doing normal activities like shopping and working; this made them value these steps and encouraged them to increase such 'incidental' walking. Similarly, greater awareness of the relationship between household practices and energy consumption provided the understanding necessary to begin to reduce that consumption.\n\n- Behavioural feedback can probably produce short-term reductions in domestic electricity consumption of about 3%. (However, the sample size used in this research (N=320) was too small to test the statistical significance of this effect.) The qualitative evidence suggests that some of this reduction will be sustained in the longer term. \n\n- The provision of social norms feedback may not lead to further reduction in energy consumption compared to individual feedback. ELECTRICITY STUDY - The findings could be used (and have already been used) to improve the design and delivery of consumption feedback in the UK Government's roll-out of domestic smart-meters. The findings are also of relevance to more general attempts to meet the UK's carbon reduction targets, where they suggest that the focus should be on changing practices rather than on reducing consumption per se. The finding regarding the importance of the 'wastefulness' discourse suggests that the use of this discourse might be a powerful trigger for behaviour change.\n\nWALKING STUDY. The walking study points to the importance of a focus on 'incidental' walking for campaigns to increase the activity levels of inactive people. This principle could be applied in public health campaigns such as those run by local authorities and could form the basis of an alternative to eixsiting schemes, which usually involve sending people to gyms and whose effectiveness has been cast into doubt by NICE.
