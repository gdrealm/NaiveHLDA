{"id":"93644A00-CA3F-48BE-BB6B-C55C2A6986B4","title":"Evolutionary ontologies for open agent environments","abstractText":"This project aims to support ontology evolution and adaptation in dynamic, distributed social environments, where actors and their ontologies are not considered in isolation, but within the social fabric determined by their interactions. In this context, we need to provide knowledge representation mechanisms that support this process of evolution, adaptation, and consensus agreement, and consider them embedded in social fabric of agent interactions. The project aims at investigating an evolutionary model of the ontology lifecycle determined by the communication needs of open, dynamic agent environments.The main goals are:(1) To devise an evolutionary model of the ontology lifecycle that accounts for the social dynamics involved in the emergence and adaptation of knowledge in open agent environments.(2) To adapt and reuse ontology and semantic web approaches and tools in order to support the ontology lifecycle in social environments for agents, including the value and the impact of a change in the ontology, in the social network linking an agent with similar knowledge, and the technical and social costs of agreeing on a change.(3) Developments of negotiation mechanisms that support the evolution and adaptation of ontologies in agent environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064287/1","grantId":"EP/D064287/1","fundValue":"213308","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Valentina  Tamma","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
