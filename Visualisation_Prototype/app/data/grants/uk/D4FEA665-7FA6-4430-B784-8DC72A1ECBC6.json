It will also explore how best to diagnose strengths and weaknesses in SFL reading. </p>\n\n<p>The research consists of three related sub-projects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Will examine the nature of the constructs that underly the PISA international comparative studies of L1 reading. </li>\n\n <li>Will study diagnostic measures of L1 reading and how well they are able to predict difficulties in SFL reading, based on the Finnish National Certificates in English. </li>\n\n <li>Will explore the construct that underpins a new test of reading in English as a second or foreign language for academic purposes - the Pearson Test of English (Academic). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On the basis of the findings of the three studies, the research will contribute to the construction of more effective, theoretically sound and useful diagnostic tests of SFL reading. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2320","grantId":"RES-062-23-2320","fundValue":"238656","fundStart":"2010-04-15","fundEnd":"2012-07-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John Charles Alderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
