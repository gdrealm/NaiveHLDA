There are several markets for rechargeable batteries\nand these can the segmented into 1. The 3C or consumer electronic Market, 2. Power tools and applicances 3.\nAutomotives, 4. Industrial including stationary energy stroage. SHARP sell products in all of these markets excepting the\nautomotive market. The sodium ion battery (NIB) is being developed as a low cost alternative rechargeable battery\ntechnology. It is expected that NIB could directly replace lithium ion batteries (LIB) in all of the established and emerging\nmarkets and lead acid batteries (PbA) in the low cost applications. The direct substitution of a highly developed and\noptimised LIB technology for established applications will be time consuming and difficult to displace. SHARP are\ninterested in the emerging markets, such as stationary energy storage, where there is no currently established energy\nstorage technology and the development of new technologies will involve demonstrators and hence new technologies can\nalso be established. This project will focus on developing electrodes for a new NIB technology for longer life and higher\nvolumetric densities specifically for residential and community energy storage systems. In particular for coupling PV local\nrenewable energy generation sources with local energy storage systems. The advantages of this system are to provide a\ngreater self sufficiency to consumers, and to buffer an intermittent energy generation thus providing a greater stablity\nbetween the grid and the property.\nCurrent alternative technologies for stationary energy storage include lead acid batteries (PbA) and lithium ion (LIB). Whilst\nlead acid batteries are significantly lower cost than lithium ion their life-time is significantly lower, therefore the life time\ncosts of these technologies are similar. Sodium ion batteries (NIB)offer a lower cost alternative to LIB however NIB\nbatteries have not yet been commercialised as further development is required to optimise cycle life and performance\nproperties, specifically for the stationary energy storage markets. The addition of graphene into the electrodes is expected\nto improve the electronic transport properties of the electrodes improving the current distribution, the packing density, and\nhence the volumetric energy and performance properties of the cell.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507714/1","grantId":"EP/M507714/1","fundValue":"51741","fundStart":"2015-06-30","fundEnd":"2015-12-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Angus Dryfe","coPersons":["Ian Anthony Kinloch"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
