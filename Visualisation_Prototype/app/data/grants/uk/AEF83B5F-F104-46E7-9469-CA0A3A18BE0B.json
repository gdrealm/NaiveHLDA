The State of Victoria, Australia, decided in 2012 to use our design for the electronic voting system used for their State Election in November 2014. Hence the impact was on public policy and on secure electronic elections. The system provides accessibility for blind, partially sighted and motor impaired voters; voters for whom English is not their first language; and voters out of state and overseas. The verifiability of the system ensures that voters and observers can verify the integrity of the election. \n\nThe findings regarding verifiable voting had an impact on Australian public policy: they were used by the Victorian State Parliament in their decision to proceed with verifiable electronic voting.\n\nThe verifiable voting system software developed within the project has been made available as open source.

Voters can check that their votes have been correctly included in the tally, and anyone can check that the result has been calculated correctly. Verifiability allows voters to have confidence that the system does not have bugs that affect the election, and that it has not been hacked or manipulated. It must do this while maintaining secrecy of the vote.\n\nThis grant has investigated the nature of verifiable voting in the polling place, and has developed the design for a verifiable voting system, which has been implemented for use in the November 2014 State election in the State of Victoria, Australia.\n\nThe project has made a number of contributions to the foundations of verifiable voting. One aspect of this is the formal modelling and analysis of protocols for verifiable voting systems, so that the designs are mathematically analysed to ensure that they are logically correct. \n\nThe basic approach has been extended so that it can handle preference voting, where voters rank the candidates in order rather than simply selecting one. Advances have been made on particular elements of the design. These include a robust and secure concurrent design for the Web Bulletin Board, a component for reliably receiving and publicly posting election information; print-on-demand, which allows ballot papers to be printed on request (at vote time) rather than ahead of the election, in a way that preserves the required secrecy levels; and a method for handling preference voting that scales up to large numbers of candidates, while maintaining the efficiency of the election. \n\nA variety of interfaces have been investigated and the research has discovered some novel approaches, including voting through a surface, and voting using a tablet, the use of authentication codes, write-ins (which are used in US elections).\n\nUser trials and focus groups have been used to identify voters' understanding of the verifiability mechanism. The developed code is all open source (GPL) and can be taken forward by others. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
