Driven by economical growth in the region, deforestation is ongoing, which leads to conversion of primary forest for agriculture and large fires affecting the chemical composition and pollution in the region. At the same time, the most recent generation of climate models suggest that climate change will have dramatic consequences in the region and that the Amazonian rainforest is threatened by drying out as the water balance in the region changes. This not only has important consequences for the region itself. Through so-called teleconnection in the climate system, changes in the functioning of the Amazon rainforest is linked to changes in climate elsewhere on the planet. The Amazon rainforest does not just transport large amounts of water and energy back into the atmosphere, which affect the climate, it also emits large quantities of volatile organic compounds and, probably, ammonia, which react in the atmosphere, leading to the production of oxidants and particles. These particles provide the condensation nuclei for cloud droplet formation which regulate precipitation patterns in the region, change the weather and thus feed back onto the emissions. However, emissions and particle formation mechanisms are currently poorly understood. An understanding of the current emission and air chemistry in the region and its response to changes in meteorological drivers is needed to parametrise these processes in climate models to improve the rebustness of future climate predictions. Previous measurements with the research programme Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) have indicated that the air chemistry in remote regions of the Amazon is one of the least disturbed on the planet, if influences of biomass burning can be avoided. Thus we still have the chance to study the cycling of trace gases and aerosols, their effect on the regional climate and their responses to climatic drivers in a fairly undisturbed environment. This proposed project aims to add UK measurements to two major international field campaigns with up to 15 partner institutes in the remote Amazon rainforest to quantify the emissions of trace gases and aerosols, and their controls, and to study the chemical interactions within and above the tree canopy, with emphasis on the quantification of particle production. The measurements will be used to improve our capability to numerically simulate chemistry and transport of air pollutants in this important region of the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I012036/1","grantId":"NE/I012036/1","fundValue":"374797","fundStart":"2011-08-28","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Until recently, surface / atmosphere exchange fluxes (emission / deposition) of particles could only be derived from particle number measurements (without information on chemical composition) or from gradient measurements, with is an indirect approach, subject to large errors. Under the NERC COSMAS programme we started the development of the first eddy-covariance system for chemical components, based on aerosol mass spectrometry and succeeded in measuring fluxes of nitrate, sulphate and some organic compounds. Following the introduction of a new generation of aerosol mass spectrometer, based on time-of-flight mass spectrometer, we have now completed the development of the next generation flux instrument and associated data processing routines. This has led to a much improved signal / noise ratio and additional capability of measuring fluxes of ammonium, fully quantitative organic aerosol fluxes and providing information on organic aerosol sources. Beneficiaries: The researcher benefited immediately, by being able to conduct research with this setup. Several flux datasets have been acquired and are being processed with the new data analysis package. A prototype has led to two papers and the new system will lead to many more. The scientific findings from the instrument will lead to a much improved understanding of the deposition of aerosols. First results have already led to the revision of the nitrate aerosol deposition velocity in the EMEP Chemical Transport Model, which is underpins European policy on emissions and ecosystem protection.
