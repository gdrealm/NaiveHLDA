The LS constitutes a research resource of great value which has been used in many influential studies. It is representative of the whole population of England and Wales, including those in non-private households, includes all age groups, is maintained through the recruitment of a sample of new births and immigrants, and includes individual level data from four censuses (1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) as well as linked information on births, deaths and cancer registrations. Data from the 2011 census will be linked to the database in 2012-13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to meet confidentiality requirements, the LS dataset can only be accessed within a safe setting located on an ONS site; these are in London, Titchfield (Hampshire) and Newport (Wales). ONS maintains the dataset and issues core documentation. CeLSIUS provides an expert interface to the data. This involves helping users with specification of projects; guiding them through the administrative processes; creating data extracts and running tabulations and analyses; and providing a wide range of training and information resources accessible via the CeLSIUS website www.celsius.lshtm.ac.uk</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I029249/1","grantId":"ES/I029249/1","fundValue":"227525","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily M D  Grundy","coPersons":["Pat  Doyle"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
