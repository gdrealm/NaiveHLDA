Damage tolerance assessments need to determine that adequate margins remain for the\nintegrity of the fuel and the safety systems proper behaviour. For UK existing plants, graphite bricks' cracking is a key\nquestion regarding lifetime management decisions. For the next generation plants, it has an influence on expected lifetimes\nand on investment plans.\nThe objective of this proposal is to gain a good understanding and evaluation of fracture in graphite components by\ncomplementary numerical and experimental approaches. An advanced modelling tool allowing to simulate automatically\ncrack propagation in graphite bricks will be developed and transferred to industry end-users. An innovative experimental\nmethod will be elaborated to validate these models. Uncertainties on the whole core mechanical behaviour will be\nassessed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L504725/1","grantId":"EP/L504725/1","fundValue":"413476","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Justification for safe operation of nuclear reactors Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy Societal,Economic","person":"Paul  Mummery","coPersons":["Abbie  Jones","Barry John Marsden","John Robert Yates","Marc Joachim Schmidt"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Initiation and propagation of cracks in fuel bricks due to internal strain.\nDevelopment of models for behaviour of core of reactor.
