It will do this by consolidating and extending the work of two existing networks that are currently working on these issues from the following disciplinary perspectives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>economic geography/regional studies</li>\n\n <li>workplace/organisational learning. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The members of the network are:</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>Workplace/organisational learning</strong> :</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Professor David Guile (PI) and Professor Lorna Unwin, both Institute of Education, University of London</li>\n\n <li>Professor Bente Elkjaer, Aarhus University</li>\n\n <li>University of Professor Sylvia Gherardi, University of Trento</li>\n\n <li>Professor Monika Nerland, University of Oslo.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Economic Geography/regional studies</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Prof Henrik Halkier, Aalborg University, Denmark (Co-I)</li>\n\n <li>Prof Simone Strambach, Marburg University (C-OI)</li>\n\n <li>Prof Markku Sotarauta, School of Management, Tampere University, Finland</li>\n\n <li>Dr Laura James, University of Stockholm.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project will enable the elaboration and expansion of this nascent interdisciplinary collaboration and will result in new research proposals that will inform innovation and skills policies to support sustainable economic recovery in the UK and other European countries. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019488/1","grantId":"ES/J019488/1","fundValue":"24869","fundStart":"2013-01-21","fundEnd":"2015-04-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Guile","coPersons":["Laura  James","Simone  Strambach"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
