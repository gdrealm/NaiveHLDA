However poor beam quality has so far limited market penetration to a few relatively small niches such as soldering and plastics welding. This project aims to exploit a combination of key technologies held separately by the partner organisations and bring them together to develop fiber coupled diode laser sources with beam qualities good enough to be applicable to broad range of mainstream applications. Specifically this will include a significant increase in the efficiency of current laser based welding processes to the point where they are more efficient than even conventional MIG or other techniques.The main research activities will be 1) Demonstration of prototype energy efficient, high brightness, diode laser (DL) modules at power levels 200-1000W coupled into 0.15mm fibre;2) Development of these modules to prototype standard on a staged basis - allowing parallel work on higher power prototype DL modules; 3) Applications research on DL modules for welding, marking, and cutting. 4) Novel architectures for DL module combination to achieve power/brightness of 4kW into 0.25mm fibre5) Research on energy saving welding processes and applications trials","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/G001618/1","grantId":"TS/G001618/1","fundValue":"149751","fundStart":"2008-10-08","fundEnd":"2012-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project findings have been directly beneficial to the growth of PowerPhotonic Ltd, Dalgety Bay, Scotland who have doubled their staff and diversified their product range, selling now to a world-wide market. Whilst not currently using the research outcome in products, JK Lasers recruited a high calibre UK researcher from this project. In the UK, micro-optical components related to those produced for this project are featuring in new diode pumped laser development, with potential UK manufacturing to secure jobs.\nSimilar optical components are now being incorporated in large European projects, such as the Extreme Light Infrastructure ELI.

Rugby as a successful industrial laser manufacture. The objective was to develop new techniques to combine the light from the many individual diode laser emitters into a single beam delivery optical fibre, at industry-leading levels of brightness. The fourth partner Cranfield University was tasked with understanding the issues of beam quality in laser welding for such beam-combined diode lasers.\nPowerPhotonic Ltd and HWU collaborated to define an innovative free space beam combining architecture that made use of freeform optics manufacture by laser machining and polishing and high-brightness diode laser bars. GSI followed an alternative fibre optic beam combining route. \nTesting of the beam combined sub-units at HWU proved the initial concept to be viable and the programme concentrated on improving the accuracy of placement of each sub-beam in both position and angle to allow direct coupling by a single lense into the optical fibre. The great success was the use of just two microptics plates to correctly direct 38 individual diode beams. This technique is the subject of a patent application.\nMultiple units were manufactured by GSI/JK lasers and further beam combined using wavelength and polarisation combining for a 2kW fibre coupled demonstrator unit. The technology is not currently being exploited by JK Lasers for commercial reasons. However, related micro-optics components are being produced by PowerPhotonic Ltd for general sale, benefiting from the effort put into improving the accuracy of beam angle position of diode laser beams.
