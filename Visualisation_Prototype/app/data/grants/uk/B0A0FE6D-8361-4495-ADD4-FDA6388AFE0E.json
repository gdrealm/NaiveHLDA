{"id":"B0A0FE6D-8361-4495-ADD4-FDA6388AFE0E","title":"The Fat4-Dchs1 pathway: A new regulator of neuronal development and migration","abstractText":"Development of the brain involves the generation of neurons (the major population of cells in the brain) and their migration to their final destination. After reaching their targets, neurons make the connections that will eventually &quot;wire&quot; the brain. This project will determine the role of two proteins called Fat4 and Dchs1 during brain development. Specifically, we will determine how these proteins regulate the generation and migration of newborn neurons. We already know that Fat4 and Dchs1 are essential for human brain development as mutations in Fat4 and Dchs1 in humans result in syndromes characterized by brain abnormalities and intellectual disability.\n\nThe focus of this project will be on one region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ), a thin tissue layer surrounding the walls of the lateral ventricle. This area represents the most prominent source of stem cells, which are able to generate new neurons both before and after birth. Abnormalities in SVZ neurogenesis are associated with cognitive decline, dementia and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. \n\nWe will determine how Fat4 and Dchs1 control the generation of new neurons from the SVZ and their migration to their final destination. We will analyse how SVZ neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation are affected when Fat4 or Dchs1 are not present. We will also clarify why SVZ-derived neurons fail to migrate properly in the absence of Fat4 and Dchs1. We hypothesize that Fat4 and Dchs1 are required to ensure the proper directed collective movement of SVZ-derived neurons. To investigate this, we will use time-lapse imaging of neuronal migration in brain slice cultures and examine abnormalities in neuronal motility and directionality.We will also examine which signalling cascades are triggered by Fat4 and Dchs1 to control the generation and migration of new neurons in the mammalian brain. \n\nOur studies will identify crucial mechanisms in neural stem cell biology, which will not only help increase our understanding of brain development but also help design therapeutic strategies to repair the brain in trauma and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M022544/1","grantId":"BB/M022544/1","fundValue":"480587","fundStart":"2015-10-05","fundEnd":"2018-10-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philippa  Francis-West","coPersons":["Giovanna  Lalli","Michiel Albertus Basson"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
