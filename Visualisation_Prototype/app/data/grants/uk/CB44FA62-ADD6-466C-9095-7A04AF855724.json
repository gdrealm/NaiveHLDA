Joint action effects on working memory and attention","abstractText":"<p>The project examines how attention and working memory interact when two people are jointly performing tasks. Previous work has shown that information held in working memory can influence attention; for example it is difficult not to attend to an irrelevant item in a display if we happen also to be holding that item in memory.<br /><br />The planned studies will assess whether this link between working memory and attention holds not only for the information that one person should use to perform a task, but also to the information that a partner might use, if two individuals perform a task together. This will be tested by having two people perform tasks where they must hold items in memory and then search for another target.<br /><br />The experiments will test whether the information held by person A also influences attention in person B, and whether this depends on the degree of competition or co-operation in the task. The experiments will track eye movements to measure overt attention and the neural bases of these effects will be examined using functional brain imaging.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1330","grantId":"RES-062-23-1330","fundValue":"279393","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalie  Sebanz","coPersons":["Glyn  Humphreys"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" The project developed a new methodology for examining how joint action between two individuals (performing a common or parallel tasks) modulates their memory and attention. We have shown that irrelevant information being held in memory by one person can modulate the joint actor's attenton - even when the memory stimuli are not relevant to the subsequent attentional task. This joint memory effect is itself contingent on the group relationship between the individuals - increasing when individuals are part of a common group. The work shows that joint action can strongly modulate attention even when the information being coded is not task relevant - providing evidence for strongly automatic influences in combined action scenarios. The work is basic science - providing proof of principle for the automaticity of joint action effects. However, since the specific effects are constrianed by the experimental procedure, the work is less relevant to real-world applicaitons. The grant has led to two publications to date and a set of other papers are currently being prepared for high quality journals. We have disseminated the work at five international conferences.
