{"id":"195E4DA0-839B-4909-AD26-38B5D1E5C8A8","title":"Greek Myth and Roman Lives in the Art of Roman Italy","abstractText":"The aim of this research project is to investigate the representation of Greek mythological narratives in the visual culture of Roman Italy, focussing on the period 50 BC-AD 250. Through exploration of the appropriation and reuse of Greek myths in Roman art the research will contribute to two current fields of scholarly enquiry: the ways that borrowings from Greek art took on new meanings in a Roman context, and the broader questions of how the Romans responded to the cultures they encountered, especially that of Greece, and how Roman imperial culture developed in Rome and Italy during this period. The project is one of cultural history, investigating the role played by the visual within the development and experience of Roman cultural life.\\n\\nThe specific aims of the research project are to investigate the representation of myths in domestic and funerary art across a range of media (painting, reliefs, sculpture) to see which themes appear in different contexts and to explore the responses that these images invited from their viewers. In particular, it will suggest that myths could work in three separate but interlocked ways. They suggest access into a fantasy world of Greek culture, as an escape from daily life, while simultaneously providing an impetus for displays of education and cultural knowledge from those who were viewing them. They could also act as examples for the fates of men - either as moral warnings or, in a funerary context, as consolations for the bereaved. In disentangling the various responses that the images provoke, the project aims to illuminate our understanding of the complex ways in which Greek culture was adopted and adapted for Roman life. \\n\\nThe primary audience for this research project will be among scholars of the ancient world. However, in its focus on the use of visual culture to express individual responses to life and death, and for the expression of self-representation, it will also contribute to a wider understanding of the importance of art in expressions of identity and status. As a study of cultural appropriation and the development of identities drawn from separate cultural traditions, it can also have implications for modern multiculturalism.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E002986/1","grantId":"AH/E002986/1","fundValue":"18189","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Zahra Louise Newby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
