{"id":"4BF02C61-2482-47F1-9E96-62E6F7DCCE1E","title":"ICT Perspectives (an ICT Next Decade proposal)","abstractText":"This project will provide new ways of viewing EPSRC's ICT (Information and Communications Technology) portfolio to enable researchers, EPSRC staff and other stakeholders to better contribute to ICT strategy.\n\nThe project is divided into two main stages. The first will develop new 'Perspectives' on the current portfolio based on existing 'Grants on the Web' data, the second will use spinout workshops to kick-start the use of the Perspectives and provide feedback on best practice from cross-ICT meetings.\nIn the first phase we will use text mining and simple visualisation techniques to provide 'at a glance' overviews of the portfolio in the form of word-clouds or similar intuitive presentations. All terminology will be derived from the community, either from the grant summaries and titles or by canvassing the community directly. The 'at a glance' views will also provide the top level of an intuitive navigation system which will allow users to rapidly drilldown to project and investigator descriptions using the natural structure inherent in 'Grants on the Web' and derived using text mining.\n\nAs well as being viewable on the web these Perspectives will also be available as a set of standalone materials and associated tools for ICT strategy and Network workshops. They will provide an accessible overview of the portfolio and its natural structure. The latter will be presented in interactive dendrogram form to allow easy partitioning for scoping more detailed workshop breakout sessions.\n\nThe second phase of the project will focus on networking. Six 'spinout' workshops will be organised by open call that will make use of Perspectives' materials and tools to facilitate brainstorming and road-mapping type activities. Meetings that bring together two or more Networks will be especially sought.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I038845/1","grantId":"EP/I038845/1","fundValue":"186602","fundStart":"2011-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The tools have been used by EPSRC, ESRC, MRC, AHRC, BT, InnovateUK and many networks of academics.

The data mining is used to discover the latent structure of, connections between, research projects of projects funded by NSF and UK's Research Councils (EPSRC, ESRC, BBSRC, NERC, AHRC, MRC, and STFC).\nBoth of the major outputs are already having major impact. \nReseachPerspectives.org provides topic modelling, data mining and visualisation of 180,000 UK &amp;amp;amp;amp; US grants. This software is now being ported to EPSRC internal project and is viewed daily by many research organisations.\nWell-sorted.org is a pre-meeting tool that helps experts suggest and remotely structure research ideas BEFORE the meeting. Since release in Jan 2014 it has been used twenty major meetings of 20-80 stakeholders. Users include EPSRC, AHRC, MRC, ESRC, RCUK DE, BT and Innovate UK. Both ReseachPerspectives.org and Well-sorted.org are in constant use for a wide range of activities. The main mechanism for dissemination is attendance and/or use at Research Council network and strategy development meetings. In the last couple of months this increase has been exponential in nature, requiring us to automate some of the manual procedures.\n\nThese approaches solve generic problems and are applicable to almost all sectors.
