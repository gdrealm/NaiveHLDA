This would allow us to effectively target preventative measures or treatment at those at highest risk. However, for many diseases this is very difficult to do, and our estimates of an individual s risk are very uncertain. One way to improve prediction is to incorporate genetic information, since we know that much of the variation in risk between individuals is attributable to genetic factors. So far attempts to do this have been concentrated on genetic variants which cause relatively large increases in risk; however, we know that there are relatively few of these, and many more variants of small effect. Thus most of the variation in risk between individuals is due to many genetic variants, each of which has taken alone a rather small effect on risk. To account for this we need to incorporate many more genetic variants into our predictive models. It is not clear how to do this; the objective of this grant is to develop improved ways of making predictions that incorporate information on many genetic variants simultaneously, and to assess the improvements that such models give relative to current predictive tools. The methods will then be applied to three diseases (breast cancer, coronary heart disease and pre-eclampsia).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801414","grantId":"G0801414","fundValue":"436857","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Whittaker","coPersons":["Liam  Smeeth","Julian  Peto","Claudio John Verzilli","Maria  De Iorio","Clive  Hoggart","Juan P  Casas","Aroon Dinesh Hingorani","Steve  Humphries"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
