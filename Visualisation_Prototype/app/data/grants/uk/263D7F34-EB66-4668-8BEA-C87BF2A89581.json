{"id":"263D7F34-EB66-4668-8BEA-C87BF2A89581","title":"Multiscale Computational Tools for Optogenetics","abstractText":"Optogenetics is a new tool in which light-sensitive ion channels ('opsins') are genetically inserted into cell membranes. This allows for the precise spatial and temporal optical stimulation of excitable cells such as neural ensembles, as well as modulation of signalling cascades, and has numerous applications which are only beginning to be explored. Apart from becoming a key technology for neuroscience and deconstruction of brain circuits, applications are rapidly emerging throughout biology: e.g. control of cardiac cells, sensing and monitoring cellular activities, optical control of cell signalling pathways, using light to destroy proteins and cells [1] etc. The field of optogenetics has the potential to be one of the most important new techniques for many years and it was declared the Method of the Year for 2010 by Nature Methods [2]. \n\nThere are several families of opsins, each of which has unique temporal and spectral properties. There is a substantial effort to characterize opsins for each cell population, and a continual drive to improve their efficacy. While the effect of an opsin can be quantified at the level of individual cells (e.g. neurons), it currently remains practically impossible to experimentally test each opsin for each cell type or biological system of interest. This significantly limits the effectiveness of optogenetics as a biological tool.\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop multiscale computational tools for optogenetics. Firstly, we will develop a tool for characterizing opsins, allowing us to link from the underlying biophysical photocycle that defines kinetic model of opsins (molecular-complex scale). Consequently this will allow us to obtain a functional understanding of each opsin and hence guide not only opsin choice for a given system, but potentially also guide opsin development. Secondly, we will build software to transform the biophysical model into computational formats for use in commonly used neural simulation tools. This will be done at the levels of single cell/compartment and cell networks. This will allow the inclusion of realistic models of optogenetics in existing simulations, allowing the use of virtual opsins to identify the correct experimental opsin choice. Together, these tools will improve the use of optogenetics as an effective and refined tool, enabling its potential to transform the biological sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L018268/1","grantId":"BB/L018268/1","fundValue":"146934","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  N/A, project started very recently  ","person":"Konstantin  Nikolic","coPersons":["Chris  Toumazou","Simon Ross Schultz"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" In this project we are developing multi-scale computational tools for optogenetics.
