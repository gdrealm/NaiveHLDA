{"id":"29E7D2E6-DF7A-442C-AC99-DC2F036E6A58","title":"Development and optimisation of downstream processing for next generation biotherapeutics","abstractText":"In recent years there has been rapid development of a &quot;Next Generation&quot; of protein-based therapeutics, yet the need remains for new manufacturing processes that can deliver these at a price healthcare providers can afford. For the first time these new therapies can safely modify a patient's DNA, or harness the body's own immune system, to treat inherited diseases, neurological conditions, and cancer. However, to achieve this clinical functionality the complexity and size of the therapeutic protein has increased. This has meant that existing purification technologies have been unable to be applied effectively in this new application. This project aims to build on existing collaborations and feasibility data to develop new purification tools and strategies that can be applied across a range of next generation biotherapeutics to enable their cost effective manufacture delivering novel therapies to patients at an aceeptable price for healthcare payers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N013395/1","grantId":"EP/N013395/1","fundValue":"363241","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Gilbert Bracewell","coPersons":["Tarit K Mukhopadhyay"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
