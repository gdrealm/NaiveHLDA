Nature 435: 268-70). But this is about stem cells and their environment, not rainforests and wellies, and reflects the growing interest in the concept that stem cells occupy 'niches' in our tissues. The idea is similar to ecologists thinking of plants and animals living in niches in the environment that surrounds them. Most importantly, it presumes that the way stem cells behave depends on information and support they receive from their niche. Understanding how this information and support is imparted is critically important to current attempts to manipulate stem cells to produce specific cell types that could be used to treat, particularly, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Our work has identified molecules expressed on the surfaces of nerve cells as they develop which seem to be able to trigger nerve cell precursors - which are not the stem cells themselves but direct descendents of those cells - to become mature nerve cells. In this project we aim to find out what signals are sent to the cells when these events are triggered, and we also aim to find out whether these molecules, or their close relatives, can also trigger stem cells to begin the process of making nerve cells or their precursors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D014867/1","grantId":"BB/D014867/1","fundValue":"281054","fundStart":"2006-07-18","fundEnd":"2009-07-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Furley","coPersons":["Graham  Leggett"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
