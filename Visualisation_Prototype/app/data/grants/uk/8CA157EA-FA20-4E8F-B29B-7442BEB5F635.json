The cells that form the endothelium are named endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, replacing damaged ECs has been recognised as a potential therapeutic option for cardiovascular disease but identification and availability of appropriate cell types has been a major limitation. Based on the remarkable recent discovery, human fibroblasts or other somatic cells have the potential to initiate a reprogramming process and become pluripotent. This is a method based on the forced-expression of four reprogramming transcription factors, which are able to transform any differentiate cell back to the pluripotent stage. These cells are named induced pluripotent stem cells and hold a great potential for regenerative medicine. As these cells are pluripotent, they are also able to differentiate towards any cell type within the body and be used for cell therapy. Indeed induced pluripotent stem cells are able to differentiate to ECs and in theory could be a great cell source to treat cardiovascular disease. Although, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells to derive ECs may preserve a great potential for personalised medicine and vascular cell therapy, the main restriction is the risk of these cells to develop tumors as they are in a pluripotent stage. \nTo overcome this limitation, recently, a new paradigm of direct conversion of one differentiated cells to another has been proposed. In this regard, we have asked the question whether it would be possible to bring a differentiated cell type to a transient state where it could be easily directed to another desired cell type like ECs, without reaching pluripotency. To this end, we adapted a method to generate partially-induced pluripotent stem cells by overexpressing the 4 reprogramming factors to human fibroblasts for short periods of time. Importantly, these cells did not form tumours and clearly displayed the potential to differentiate into ECs when they were stimulated with specific growth factors and cultured in appropriate conditions. This new approach is named direct reprogramming and holds an enormous potential for regenerative medicine. However, the efficiency of direct reprogramming is very low because the underlying mechanisms remain totally unclear. Studying the mechanisms underpinning this process should permit for improvements in reprogramming methods and generate fast and efficient direct reprogramming strategies, which could be used in future clinical applications to benefit specific-patients' groups. \nIn this study I will elucidate the mechanisms behind direct reprogramming of ECs in order to establish homogeneous populations of differentiated cells to be used in regenerative medicine to treat vascular disease. In particular, we hypothesise that the direct reprogramming towards ECs is a two-step approach. Initially, the four reprogramming factors activate specific gene regulatory networks related to ECs, which will respond to specific stimuli such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and will allow the induction of EC specific markers (second step). This study will elucidate for the first time the mechanisms of direct reprogramming towards ECs providing novel data which will support that direct reprogramming is a two-step process. This study holds the promise to uncover the underlying mechanisms of direct reprogramming which could be expanded to other cell lineages beyond EC reprogramming. Importantly, this work will also establish the potential of reprogrammed ECs to restore EC function and promote perfusion of ischemic tissue in appropriate research animal models. Together, these findings may establish the therapeutic reality of reprogrammed ECs which would have transforming consequences for regenerative and personalised medicine.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M003221/1","grantId":"BB/M003221/1","fundValue":"383387","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2017-12-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andriana  Margariti","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
