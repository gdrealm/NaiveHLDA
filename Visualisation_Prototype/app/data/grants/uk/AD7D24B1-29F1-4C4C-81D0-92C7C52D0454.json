Social forms of engagement are also seen as key domains to study in a variety of fields of research on learning. This proposal is for a three part seminar series to examine the efforts, outcomes and further potential for social interaction and learning in museums and galleries. The proposed seminars will explore this focus both from perspectives of theoretical scholarship and from work undertaken on museum exhibition and programme design. The overall objectives for the seminars are to exchange understandings, experience and questions regarding the design and implementation of social engagement at exhibits, and in programmes and research studies. The benefits of this exchange will be to generate insights into effective methods as well as identify needs and key questions that warrant further research for both the museum and academic communities. The overarching themes of each seminar will be:\\n\\n1) The social impact/affordance of an exhibition and display\\n2) The use of technology and the implications for social use in galleries\\n3) Controversy in the museum and its contribution to dialogue and debate in galleries","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E500234/1","grantId":"AH/E500234/1","fundValue":"12435","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2007-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Osborne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
