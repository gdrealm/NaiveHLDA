The project will involve adapting recent methodology by the applicants for the analysis of single time series trajectories, to develop the coherent analysis of multiple trajectories observed in a given spatial region. From these advances, summaries of regional spatial structure will be proposed, as well as methods for assessing the uncertainty inherent to such summaries. In particular, as a testbed, such will be implemented for regional sets of oceanographic observations from the Global Drifter Program, which contributes to providing deeper understanding of ocean circulation and its impact on climate change. The main scope of this proposal is therefore to test the feasibility of aggregate statistical analysis of the spatial information contained in multiple sets of trajectory observations. It is an ambitious research project which, if successful, would open the door to a wide set of applications such as ecology, oceanography and traffic management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L025744/1","grantId":"EP/L025744/1","fundValue":"43606","fundStart":"2014-06-28","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sofia Charlotta Olhede","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
