{"id":"663CBC33-A39C-46F0-BC88-38D722A790AF","title":"The RESCUEicp decompressive craniectomy study","abstractText":"Trauma is the commonest cause of death in patients under the age of 40 with head injury implicated in at least half the number of cases. Following injury the brain swells within a rigid box (the skull), resulting in increased pressure, reduced oxygenation and cell death. Our research (an international multi-centre randomised study - www.RESCUEicp.com) aims to determine whether patients with severe injury will benefit from an operation (decompressive craniectomy) which involves removing part of the skull bone to relieve pressure. Patients with raised pressure are randomised to receive either the operation or on-going medical treatment. The study has now recruited 126 patients from 22 centres in 8 countries out of a target of 600. The overall aim of the study is to determine whether this type of surgery reduces disability and mortality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601025","grantId":"G0601025","fundValue":"1000320","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Hutchinson","coPersons":["Peter  Kirkpatrick","Barbara Jacquelyn Sahakian","Andreas  Unterberg","Gordon Douglas Murray","Franco  Servadei","Martin John Buxton","John Douglas Pickard","Eckhard  Rickels","Graham  Teasdale","Ivan  Timofeev","David Krishna Menon","Juan  Sahuquillo"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
