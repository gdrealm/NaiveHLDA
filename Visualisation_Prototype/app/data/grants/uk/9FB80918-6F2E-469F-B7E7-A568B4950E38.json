The aim of this research is to build upon the outcomes of the PI’s Director’s Impact Fellowship to address current debates about the implications of environmental change for the restoration, management and interpretation of publically accessible designed landscapes of high cultural value. \n\nThe research will build on the outcomes of an established working partnership between the Director’s Impact Fellowship and the National Trust, and develop those with two related RECN projects(‘Local places, global processes’ and ‘Anticipatory histories of landscape and wildlife’), in a collaborative, teamwork research model of wider application for deploying arts and humanities perspectives on environmental change.\n\nIt will examine how a designed landscape can be conserved and displayed when there is no longer the economy and labour which once sustained it and explore the ways in which the mentality as well as materiality of this past landscape can best be communicated effectively to the visiting public.\n\nIt will take advantage of the topicality of the design, the bicentenary of its 1812 design by Humphry Repton, undertaking new archival, library and field research to situate the designed landscape of 1812 within a broader context of estate management of the time, to rethink Repton’s 1812 design in a way which will both raise its profile at Sheringham as a major example of landscape architecture and place it in a longer and wider environmental history of the site and within longer histories of environmental change: local, regional, national and global. \n\nIt will examine the values and narratives of environmental change which shaped the original design process, its symbols and story lines, compare the way the Repton landscape at Sheringham is interpreted and managed to examples of his work on the groun describe how a designed landscape can interpreted as lived in, worked on and moved through as well as looked at. \n\nThe project will deploy an understanding of Sheringham’s history to engage with the development of the National Trust’s policies and practices on conservation, heritage and learning, particularly in regard to coastline and woodlands. \n\nThe project will produce a series of related outcomes: a small public exhibition at Sheringham Park in July 2012, an academic conference at the University of East Anglia exploring the restoration and interpretation of designed landscapes for public understanding, a scholarly article on the practical and interpretative issues arising from the research on Sheringham, and a landscape and environment trail around Sheringham Park weaving together key locations and views on the Sheringham estate with their environmental and landscape histories. \n\nFurthermore research materials will inform a chapter of the book Living Landscapes and feature on the companion website, as well as being made available for a new edition of the National Trust catalogue for Sheringham Park. \n\nAll project members involved in the collaboration will benefit from the research and from the inter-disciplinary process involved in its undertaking. \n\nThe National Trust team of employees and volunteers will also benefit from their involvement in the project, in learning from the methods of conducting landscape history and engaging with visitors that will be employed by the research team.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K50273X/1","grantId":"AH/K50273X/1","fundValue":"79903","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-11-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It has strengthened links between NT &amp; AHRC, the exhibiiton has been popular &amp; the installation in place beyond its projected deadline.

We were able to do so through teamwork with our NT partners, academic colleagues and the studio we commissioned. We achieved the aim of raising the profile of Repton at Sheringham in a key commemorative year. Our resources are available on the website &amp; published article.
