{"id":"BCCAA810-F3F7-456E-83AD-ABC75A4CFAA0","title":"A phylogenomic approach to dating an ancient insect lineage","abstractText":"Aphids, thrips and lice are pests of agricultural and medical importance but the evolution of this diverse group of insects is poorly known. How are these plant and animal parasites related to one another? When did these parasites originate? These are the questions this project will investigate. The recent advances in DNA technology combined with the decreased costs of these methods make it possible to gather a large amount of DNA data to elucidate the relationships between these insect pests. We are also able to develop new analytical methods that can deal with the huge amount of data generated. As a result, we will now be able to reliably determine the origin and evolution of this important group of insects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015720/1","grantId":"BB/F015720/1","fundValue":"344606","fundStart":"2008-03-15","fundEnd":"2011-06-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Used by other researchers, no direct impacts matching categories below  ","person":"Roderic  Page","coPersons":["Mark Lyon Blaxter"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":" We designed a microarray chip for the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, which is available from the shared space on the Agilent eArray website. This chip was designed from the data generated during the project and will enable researcher to gain a better understanding of insecticide resistance in this important pest of rice.\nWe developed software (TreeRipper) for the conversion of images of phylogenies into formats that are amenable to phylogenetic analyses.
