{"id":"EDA8E21D-917D-4628-B3E9-55F6FE4CFFB3","title":"Workshop on Computational Aero-Acoustics for Aircraft Noise Prediction","abstractText":"An IUTAM symposium will take place at the University of Southampton from the 29th to 31st March 2010. It will be of three days duration and will focus on Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) with particular application to aircraft noise.The necessity and urgency of reducing the environmental impact of air transport, including the impact both of noise and emissions, underpins the current workshop. This is a major technology challenge in pursuit of environmentally acceptable commercial aviation and a critical issue for the continued health of the aviation industry in the UK and elsewhere. The availability of affordable and convenient mass passenger air transport depends on the development of new technologies to reduce noise and increase fuel efficiency.The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers, developers and users of CAA from academia, research institutes and industry for the purpose of assessing the current capabilities of CAA for aircraft noise prediction, reviewing the extent to which CAA has been validated, and discussing emerging techniques and their potential impact on CAA.A group of 40 experts and early career researchers, drawn from industry, academia and research establishments in the UK, Europe and North America, have been invited to participate. The workshop will be fully residential and the attendees will be accommodated at the venue for the duration of the meeting. This will permit a very full programme including evening discussions. There will be no parallel sessions and every participant will have the opportunity to give a presentation.The target audience for the workshop is the aeroacoustic research community, and noise specialists in the aircraft industry who are involved in aircraft noise prediction. The workshop will result in an agenda for further research and development in CAA which will accelerate the use of CAA in designing the next generation of quiet fuel efficient aircraft. The content and outcomes of the workshop will be communicated by publishing electronic proceedings freely available to researchers in industry and academia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H048324/1","grantId":"EP/H048324/1","fundValue":"36470","fundStart":"2010-03-08","fundEnd":"2010-08-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Reducing noise emissions from aircraft engines is crucial to the well-being of residents around airports and to the competitiveness of the UK aerospace sector.\n\nThis workshop has helped develop a consensus between academics and industrialists working in the field of aircraft noise concerning the areas of future research that should be tackled to push forward the state of the art in prediction methods for aircraft noise.

Additional participants were also selected to contribute to the discussions on specific topics, bringing the total number of participants to 58. These included established researchers, promising early career researchers and industry panelists. There were no parallel sessions. The programme was organised under four subheadings; Jet noise, propagation and liners, turbomachinery noise, and airframe noise. At the conclusion of presentations on each subtopic, a discussion took place in which all of those present joined with an industry panel to comment on the material presented and to formulate a collective response to four general questions. These were:\n- To what extent does CAA contribute to aircraft noise prediction at the present time?\n- What constraints, if any, limit the application of CAA to aircraft noise prediction?\n- What research is needed to expand the role of CAA in aircraft noise prediction ?\n- What impedes industry take-up of current and future CAA prediction capability?\nEach plenary discussion was led by a rapporteur who produced a short summary of the discussion.\n\nOverall, the material which was presented at the symposium has emphasised the large discrepancies which exist between the relative effectiveness and utility of CAA methods in different areas of aircraft noise prediction. In the case of (tone) source and propagation models for fan noise, the subject is quite advanced and close to robust application in engine design. In the case of jet and airframe noise, the obstacles to the application of CAA are more substantial. Many are associated with limitations of current computer performance, but these also disguise associated problems involved in handling the very large quantities of data which would occur if such calculations were possible. A common thread running through all of the applications is the need for better validation data against which the effectiveness of CAA methods for aircraft noise can be evaluated.\n\nDrafts of the symposium papers were provided by the authors before the event and made available on the web site of the symposium to facilitate discussions during the symposium by providing early access to the papers. Final versions of the paper were received within a month after the symposium. These proceedings will be published in electronic form by Elsevier as the first issue in the newly created &quot;IUTAM e-procedia&quot; series. In addition to the 31 contributed papers, the proceedings also include a foreword and commentary summarising the discussions of the three plenary sessions held during the symposium. The presence of industrial participants during the symposium means that they benefited from the technical discussion, and developed a better vision of the current research activities in aircraft noise prediction.\n\nThe outcomes of the plenary discussions during the symposium were reported in the proceedings published online and are available without subscription.
