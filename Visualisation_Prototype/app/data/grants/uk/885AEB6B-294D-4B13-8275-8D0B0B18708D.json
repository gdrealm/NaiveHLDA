According to this view, frictions limit arbitrageurs' ability to exploit price discrepancies, driving asset prices away from fundamentals. A relevant role in this respect is played by liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>The liquidity of an asset captures the ease with which the asset can be traded. Several factors, such as transactions costs, asymmetric information or search costs, impinge on liquidity. Recent contributions point to the fact that the liquidities of different assets display comovements and vary across time. As a consequence liquidity risk (the risk that liquidity worsens when investors need to trade) affects asset prices. In view of the events related to the subprime crisis, extreme manifestations of the impact of liquidity risk abound. On May 6, 2010 several US-based equities and equity products experienced a sharp price and liquidity decline followed by a rapid recovery, giving raise to the so-called “Flash Crash.” Similarly, at the peak of the subprime crisis the markets for several, traditionally liquid, securities disappeared. In this project the PI investigates liquidity comovement across markets and over time, stressing the role of prices as conveyors of information for market participants.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4653","grantId":"RES-000-22-4653","fundValue":"65595","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Giovanni  Cespa","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
