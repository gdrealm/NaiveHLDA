Consider the new Familial Homicide offence in the United Kingdom, in which both caregivers can be prosecuted for a child's death even if one caused the death while the other allowed it by not intervening. 'Cause' and 'allow' may indicate different intentional meanings yet the legal outcome is similar for both. Problems may arise if the psychological reality of how jurors reason about intent does not correspond to this legal logic.<br />&nbsp;<br />This research has planned a series of randomised controlled trials to examine jurors' thinking about intent in such contexts. The key research question is whether jurors' use of intent to attribute responsibility and punishment aligns concordantly with the instructions of the 'cause or allow' offence. Thus the research presents a pioneering legal empirical investigation not only because it investigates the theoretical role of intent in the psychology of legal thinking, but because the empirical analysis of how these thinking processes are affected by legal information may enable surgically precise evidence-based evaluation for contemporary law change and review.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G018219/1","grantId":"ES/G018219/1","fundValue":"70281","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michelle  Cowley","coPersons":["Denis  Galligan"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
