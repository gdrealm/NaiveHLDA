{"id":"625CD117-F704-4D58-BC9E-9946A59065D1","title":"The Value of Public Domain Works","abstractText":"<p>In a copyright sense, the public domain covers materials that can be used without seeking permission from rights holders. This project will foster collaboration between policymakers, academics and the UK media sector to improve understanding of how the public domain might generate value: for producers, consumers, and the enrichment of UK society. Project co-funders the Intellectual Property Office have called for activities to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Map the nature of works available in the public domain and the frequency of their use</li>\n\n <li>Analyse the role of public domain works in direct and indirect value creation for UK firms</li>\n\n <li>Assist UK media companies in developing business models that draw benefit from public domain material.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This 12-month program addresses each of the above aims through a series of planned activities. First, an interdisciplinary conference will solicit perspectives on appropriate methodologies for evaluating public domain works. Three research activities will then take place: qualitative case studies generated in consultation with media SMEs, a quantitative study of public domain materials in Kickstarter media projects, and a multiple case study analysis of open source video game projects. A hothouse event for media businesses, in summer 2014, will initiate new business model generation around public domain material.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008137/1","grantId":"ES/K008137/1","fundValue":"39720","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Kretschmer","coPersons":["Kristofer  Erickson"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
