{"id":"D78A9D57-E328-4F5E-8EB9-086F9E416D99","title":"North-Eastern Heritage Partnership","abstractText":"The aim of this project is to develop a series of workshops and masterclasses on a range of topics to help support and develop community-driven initiatives to research the history and heritage of the North-East of England. The topics of these sessions will include practical organisational matters (publication;archiving) and research skills (using historic archives; recording historic buildings; palaeography). A central element of this training will involve the chance to experience archaeological fieldwork as part of the University's major excavation project at Binchester Roman fort. The precise range of courses to be delivered will be assessed following a training needs analysis carried out as part of a dayschool held early in the project. These will be delivered by a range of university staff drawn from academic departments (Archaeology; History), and other sections of the University, including the University Museums and the Library Special Collections. The sessions will be held at both the main university campuses (Durham and Stockton), and other appropriate locations. \n\nLocal community groups will be particularly encouraged to utlise the wide range of archives and resources held by Durham University. These include the local studies collection held by the library, as well as the extensive collection of archives, including documents, maps and photographs. Other resources include archaeological equipment available for use by local groups, as well as regionally significant museum collections. The programme of workshops will be supplemented by a website providing additional material, as well as hosting a wiki and blog to encourage collaborative work between the University and the Community. The project will conclude with a second day-meeting which will provide the participants to meet with Durham academics and other local groups in exploring ways further collaborative research projects might eb developed in the future.\n\nThis project is intended to build on the extensive existing community heritage engagement activities being carried out across the University, building on existing partnerships with local groups including the Durham Local History Society and the Architectural and Archaeological Society of Durham and Northumberland.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013595/1","grantId":"AH/J013595/1","fundValue":"17278","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2013-01-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Andrew Petts","coPersons":["Sarah  Price","Adrian  Green","Craig  Barclay"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
