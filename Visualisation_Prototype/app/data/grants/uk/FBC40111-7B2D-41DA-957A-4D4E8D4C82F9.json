The secure protection of sensitive information, is increasingly a major challenge. The pervasive use of mobile and wireless communication with increased bandwidth and service diversity is also creating challenging security loopholes and requirements. The security of individuals within society is a major issue ranging from assault of citizens in public areas, to terrorist attacks. Security in the commercial sector, airports etc has seen the deployment of increasingly sophisticated access control for example using biometrics, intrusion detection and CCTV. Here the integration of information security and people security technology is necessary to make this a reality e.g. the integration of sensors, connected through secure communications with novel user interfaces such as advanced face recognition. All of these important applications require major innovations, covering many aspects of technological expertise and demand an integrated approach to meet emerging and future requirements. \n\nCSIT is already internationally recognized as performing state-of-the-art research in a number of key areas. These include: \n\nData Security Systems - Use of encryption technology, low power cryptosystems for RFID, PDAs etc. and watermarking of digital content. \n\nNetwork Security Systems - Protection of the network and network infrastructure against attack from viruses and intrusions. This will investigate novel hardware architectures to allow speeds of up to 100Gb/s - sufficient to meet the demand of the internet well into the next decade and beyond. \n\nWireless Enabled Security Systems - Development of a range of novel sensor technologies over a wide frequency band e.g. health monitoring, body worn antennas, cellular radio front ends and millimetre wave imagers for e.g. explosive detection.\n\nIntelligent Surveillance Systems / development of video analytic algorithms for automated event detection, profiling objects and development of data mining tools for analysis of annotated data.\n\nA key aspect of the Centre is the commercialisation of the research through a dedicated team of commercial and business development staff. this includes mechanisms such as spin outs, licensing, knowledge transfer partnerships and contract research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004379/1","grantId":"EP/K004379/1","fundValue":"50803","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Data Security Systems (DSS) research team at CSIT has been involved in research into next generation security architectures for over a decade and has made significant advances in the development of novel high-speed and resource-constrained encryption/authentication architectures in addition to physical attack techniques and countermeasures. Recent research achievements have included a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) solution that can be used to uniquely identify an electronic device and thus, verify its authenticity and detect whether it has been tampered with or cloned. CSIT's lightweight PUF technology is lower in cost than previous techniques and suitable for highly resource-constrained devices. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware chip comprising this PUF design has recently been fabricated to verify its operation.\n\nBeneficiaries: Consumer\n\nContribution Method: Provided a working example of how research in physical unclonable functions can be exploited in a real application Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Transport Cultural,Economic","person":"John Vincent McCanny","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
