{"id":"B1A8A8CF-CC80-4D52-8AB8-AF887FF5C5A1","title":"Reconstructing intersubjectivity: Adaptation and identity in informal care relationships which have been disrupted by aphasia","abstractText":"<p>People with aphasia can have difficulty producing and receiving communication which can make everyday activities difficult thus necessitating assistance from informal carers such as friends and family. The aim of the research is to study how people with aphasia and their close informal carers adapt to aphasia both in terms of practical everyday issues and in terms of identity. The research asks: What strategies are used by people with aphasia and their informal carers to compensate for the aphasia? How do people with aphasia and informal carers adapt to their new roles? These questions of adaptation and identity are further complicated by the aphasia itself which disrupts communication between the person with aphasia and the informal carer. The methodology used will be in-depth interviews with people with aphasia and their informal carers and observations of people with aphasia and their informal carers working on a joint task. The analysis will be mainly qualitative and will focus upon identifying problems of everyday activity, communication and identity and the various strategies of individual and inter-personal adaptation. The outcomes from the research will be disseminated to people with aphasia and informal carers, to health care professionals and academics.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2473","grantId":"RES-000-22-2473","fundValue":"84257","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alex  Gillespie","coPersons":["Joan  Murphy"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
