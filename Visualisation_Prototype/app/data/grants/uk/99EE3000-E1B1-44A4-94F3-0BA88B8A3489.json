Community policing stems from this concept and is about building trust and respect between the community and the police. Since 1989, the UK has been involved to a greater extent in peace support operations within post-conflict states. Yet there is little available information available today within the academic and public domains on the subject of international policing (both from the historical and contemporary perspectives) and the role of the UK police. </p>\n\n<p>This research project will gather material about UK international policing in the past two decades (1989-2009) through oral histories conducted with police who have been involved in peace support operations including Kosovo, Bosnia, Georgia, Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan. The focus of each interview will be upon one key element of police reform: community policing. </p>\n\n<p>This research will enable important conclusions about ongoing and historical issues linked to international policing, and will also feed back to the police themselves and to the general public.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H029435/1","grantId":"ES/H029435/1","fundValue":"78715","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Extensive discussions with the Police Service and other Security bodies regarding overseas missions have been conducted - unfortunately remarkably few of our suggestions appear to have been taken on board by UK Police bodies who often seem to regard themselves as expert and superior.

UK police have participated in a range of peacekeeping, capacity-building missions and ad hoc overseas missions. Briefly the research findings of the project to date have:\n\n\n\n1. Captured the scope of international policing assistance across the UK and undertaken an initial mapping of the users and providers within the public and private sectors\n\n2. Demonstrated the extent of fragmentation in the user and provider delivery services across UK police and government \n\n3. Provided an in-depth perspective of the role of UK police internationally: the perceptions of UK police by international police, furthering the understanding of the UK police 'brand' as developing from policing styles and systems through the historic context of the 19th and 20th centuries\n\n4. Allowed a further understanding of the export of UK policing styles (in particular community policing) within a range of international policing missions, its perception by local police (e.g. field trip to Kosovo in May 2010), by 'other' international police and the extent to which UK police found community policing to be a successful policing approach within the context of democratic police reform and one that brought the police of the world together\n\n5. Shown the skill-base of UK officers prior to and on return from mission\n\n6. Further developed the concept of Reverse Capacity Building (RCB) within a national context. The initial findings support the view that international missions enhance the skill-base of police which could benefit officers' careers, 'home' constabularies and the wider public community\n\n7. Additionally it has demonstrated a lack of corporate memory across UK police and government of the lessons learnt from international policing and the need to capture the experiences of officers deployed overseas. Policy development work undertaken with UK police (commencing May 2010) has continued through to the present and will continue in the future. Collaborative activities with ACPO IA, NPIA International and the Security and Justice Group (Stabilisation Unit) come at an important time with the future restructuring of UK police within a new professional police organisation. With the intended further professionalisation of international policing services, these research findings will provide a useful Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
