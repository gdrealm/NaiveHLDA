These molecules have unique properties (such as base-pairing) that make them ideally suited to their role. It is now clear that some synthetic nucleic acids (or XNAs) can also store genetic information, enabling a number of potential applications, based on the chemical properties of the individual XNAs.\n\nOur goal is to further develop TNA (threose nucleic acids) as a genetic material with a view to developing a TNA genetic system that can be introduced and maintained in vivo, in bacterial cells.\n\nThere are many challenges to introduce a stable genetic element into a cell that is not based on DNA; a number of conditions must be fulfilled for that to be achieved: \n1. The genetic element and its precursors cannot be toxic to the cells and should be maintained isolated from the cell machinery. \n2. Precursors must be readily assimilated by the cells but not interfere with the their metabolism. \n3. The genetic element has to be replicated in vivo, so as to be maintained as cells divide. \n4. The genetic information in the XNA system must be of use to the cell, otherwise it will be lost.\n\nTNA is poorly incorporated by natural enzymes specialised in DNA synthesis and it is not expected to interact with other cellular enzymes. As such, TNA is not expected to be toxic or interfere with cellular metabolism. Further separation between TNA and natural systems will be achieved by adapting a genetic element from a bacterial virus for controlled replication in cellular conditions. Viral replication in bacteria occurs independently from the main bacterial genome and relies on few cellular machinery components, further isolating the TNA element from the cell.\n\nAlthough TNA synthesis has been demonstrated, currently available polymerases are too error prone. Using rational design, high-throughput assays and directed evolution, we will optimise polymerases for improved TNA synthesis and to obtain TNA replication.\n\nTNA maintenance in vivo, in addition to the replicase and a stable genetic element, also requires efficient precursor uptake and a link between TNA information and cell survival. TNA nucleosides can be efficiently taken up by bacterial cells but require further activation, converting them into the appropriate polymerase substrates. We will engineer enzymes capable of activating the TNA nucleosides in vivo, minimising the cost of synthesis while delivering an additional layer of regulation. \n\nWe will also engineer viral enzymes capable of converting TNA information into RNA, thus making use of the cellular machinery and natural information processing pathways to link TNA information to proteins. By introducing an essential gene in TNA, only cells capable of accessing that information, that is, converting it to RNA using the engineered enzymes, will survive. \n\nEstablishing an XNA element in vivo should give us great insight into the origin of life and into how to define life itself. It will establish a platform for the development of therapeutic agents based on TNA and a safer transgenic organism - a contained organism dependent on the continuous supply of synthetic precursors and encoding information inaccessible to natural organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010221/1","grantId":"BB/N010221/1","fundValue":"384441","fundStart":"2015-10-19","fundEnd":"2018-10-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vitor  Pinheiro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
