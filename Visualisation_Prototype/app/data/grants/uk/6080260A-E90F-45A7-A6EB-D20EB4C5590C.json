Notably, charities began to actively market the ‘purchase’ of a commodity as a form of donation whereby the ‘donor’/ buyer received a tangible product in return for their gift. Engaging with developing consumer cultures, charitable organisations were able to negotiate what we now call compassion fatigue and, to generate income for causes without necessarily tapping into a moral or sentimental mentality.</p>\n\n<p>The exploitation of the desire to consume became, during the period under study, a pivotal ‘technology of compassion’ in the armoury of multiple British charitable organisations competing for donors. This hypothesis is located within an historical context where, first, philanthropy for domestic causes (poverty was the most common cause) increasingly competed with appeals for global disasters and, secondly, a vast expansion in print and consumer cultures enabled charities to develop innovative strategies in pitching for donations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3166","grantId":"RES-062-23-3166","fundValue":"284073","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie-Marie  Strange","coPersons":["Bertrand  Taithe"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
