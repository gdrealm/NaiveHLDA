Renal Ischaemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney failure and renal damage following transplantation, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, and posing a significant burden on the healthcare system. IRI can be defined as the tissue damage induced by the restoration of blood flow following an ischaemic event, and is induced by a cascade of biological processes, the exact nature of which is still not fully understood. Despite extensive research and several therapeutic approaches undergoing clinical trials, to date no consistent clinically acceptable means of attenuating IRI is available. \nRecent advances in polymer chemistry allowed to engineer synthetic glycopolymers - GPs, polymers which display sugar units onto macromolecular scaffolds - with 'bespoke' size, valency, and orientation of their lectin-recognition motifs.\nCell receptors rarely act as isolated entities, but rather tend to function as part of multireceptor complexes. With their enhanced avidity, coupled with their ability to span over multiple cell receptors, multivalent ligands - i.e. functional polymers - are emerging as very valuable probes to interrogate complex processes and address fundamental biological questions. Within this context GPs could potentially play a pivotal role, if they could be designed that engage selectively specific lectin receptors.\nThe proposed research builds on a preliminary study where we have shown that a novel class of GPs can selectively engage the Mannose Receptor (MR, CD206), a carbohydrate-binding receptor predominantly expressed by selected populations of macrophages, dendritic cells, non-vascular endothelium, and kidney mesangial cells. Importantly, we have also shown that MR appears to be implicated in the development of IRI and that MR-binding GPs can attenuate the extent of tissue damage caused by reperfusion following an ischaemic event.\nResearch objectives. In this work we therefore propose: \n1) to engineer a family of MR-binding GPs with tuneable ability to engage MR and with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles; and 2) to identify the biological mechanisms by which MR-binding GPs prevent IRI by a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches focussing at both investigating prophylactic and therapeutic attenuation of IRI, and GP-mediated modulation of motility, differentiation and activation of key MR-expressing cells, e.g. macrophages. \nPotential applications and benefits. Devising a means to attenuate or minimise IRI represents a significant unmet clinical need that could produce substantial healthcare and economic benefits. A major hurdle to the development of effective therapies for the management of IRI is the incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to reperfusion tissue damage. \nSuccessful completion of this work will allow not only to identify structure-function relationships of our new family of GPs within an ischaemia/reperfusion context, but also to utilise this knowledge to develop a 'chemical prototype' of a new class of therapeutics for the management of renal IRI.\nFrom a biomaterials perspective, better understanding of the details by which IRI develops and how multivalent probes that intersect specific biological pathways can attenuate reperfusion damage may produce important insight into clinical applications of multivalent carbohydrate-presenting materials. \nMoreover, although focussed on renal IRI, the outcome of the proposed research could potentially have implication on the management of IRI in other organs, such as liver, and heart following myocardial infarction and subsequent reperfusion. Additionally, in preliminary work we have also shown a role for MR in tubular damage due to other aetiological factors- such as a drug toxin (folic acid), indicating that the outcome of our research might not be restricted to IRI, but also have implications in a wider range of clinical settings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M02251X/1","grantId":"MR/M02251X/1","fundValue":"458480","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Luisa  Martinez-Pomares","coPersons":["Alan  Salama","Giuseppe  Mantovani"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
