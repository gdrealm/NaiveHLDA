{"id":"10037D32-9370-41D0-946D-7F0453590EB5","title":"Oxy-hybrid Power Cycle with Advanced Heat Recovery Network","abstractText":"The invention inolves an advanced heat exchange network to enable a new oxy-hybrid power cycle that intrinsically produces a pure stream of carbon dioxide ready for use or compression and transport for storage. In order to meet the UK's 80% CO2 emission reduction target by 2050, and recognising the UK's continuing reliance on gas fired power generation, a substantial technology evolution is required over conventional technologies. This project will exploit advanced heat transfer technology and heat integration in the form of an unfired supercritical boiler providing all the steam required for a new oxyhybrid turbine cycle for electricity generation. This technology is capable of eliminating the energy and capital cost penalties associated with the introduction of CCS. The plant can be adapted with further features that will improve its power output and efficiency over a wide range of loads.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505845/1","grantId":"EP/L505845/1","fundValue":"73808","fundStart":"2014-02-24","fundEnd":"2015-02-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research finding to date have been used within this project in the development of an advanced oxy-fired cycle which is being patented by the industrial SME partner.

However, the finding are in the area of the development of a high efficiency gas-fired power plant cycle using novel turbomachinery with an integrated gas recycle. This project is still in progress and so the finding are incomplete. However, the information generated to date is being used in further proposals to expand the scope of research to reduce the risk of demonstrating the technology. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
