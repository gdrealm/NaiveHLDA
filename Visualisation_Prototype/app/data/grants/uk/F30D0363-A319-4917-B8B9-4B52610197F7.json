However, different parts of the body respond differently to hormones, and one reason for this is that enzymes are present in tissues that can change hormones between active and inactive states. Thus an enzyme that activates a hormone will cause high levels of hormone action in that part of the body and this occurs independent of any change in circulating hormone levels. Our group has expertise in the workings of these enzymes and we now believe that they may be involved in causing human disease. Obesity and osteoporosis (thin bones), are major health hazards affecting up to 20% of the population. Breast and prostate cancers are also leading causes of death in the UK. In each case there are examples of hormones being important in causing these diseases, but in the majority of cases, hormone levels are normal within the blood. However, we have shown that an alteration in enzymes within key tissues such as cancers, fat and bone tissue may affect local hormone levels and contribute to the underlying disease. Importantly, new therapies that specifically target these enzymes may offer exciting future treatments for these common diseases. This research group will combine expertise to further define the role of a series of enzymes responsible for hormone action. In doing so, we believe we can make significant head way into the causes of, and therapy for, cancer, obesity and osteoporosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0100729","grantId":"G0100729","fundValue":"345982","fundStart":"2002-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Stewart","coPersons":["Martin  Hewison","Neil John Gittoes"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
