We know from studying climate change after previous ice ages, that species all over the temperate parts of the earth adapted by shifting their geographic ranges, following where the climate led them. We also have evidence that numerous species are shifting their ranges now, but most do not seem to be &quot;keeping up&quot; with the climate. \n\nThe problem is that natural (or seminatural) habitat for the majority of species is now rare and highly fragmented compared to the era before agricultural intensification and industrialisation. When a species' habitat is restricted to a tiny fraction of the land area, it becomes very difficult for it to invade new territory at the cool edge of its range: it could easily get stuck in isolated fragments of habitat and eventually go extinct as the climate becomes unsuitable. This is a major stimulus for conservation organisations and governments to recreate and restore habitats in order to reconnect potentially isolated populations. However it is unrealistic to suppose we could restore the areas of some habitats to their prehistoric levels. For example, in the UK woodland used to be the dominant habitat. To provide effective conservation of biodiversity in the UK, we need to make informed decisions about (a) how much woodland is enough to preserve the majority of species and (b) how to target woodland creation where it will be most beneficial in allowing range shifting to occur. We also have to find a way of proceeding when we don't know all the factors that limit each species' distribution now (factors ranging from temperature and rainfall to interactions with other species), and cannot reliably predict the direction and distance they will need to shift. \n\nThis piece of research will assist this decision-making by finding a general-purpose strategy for habitat creation that will work for most species in most landscapes. We will test a number of strategies - all in the form of a numerical rule for deciding, given an existing landscape, which land parcel to choose next for conversion. As examples of existing landscapes we will use real landscapes in the UK, with habitat information from our project partner Forest Research and from the satellite derived &quot;Land Cover Map 2007&quot;. We will judge the strategies based on simulations of animal and plant species invading the landscape (assuming they start from a small population at any one edge). The variation in traits of our simulated species (e.g. habitat specialism, reproduction rate and dispersal ability) will be based on the variation observed across all species for which data exists. We hope that this will produce results that are representative of the whole community, rather than focussing just on a few well-studied species. We will also include genetic information in our simulations - genetic diversity is an important, and sometimes overlooked, aspect of biodiversity, and one which may be dramatically reduced as the population passes through habitat &quot;bottlenecks&quot; during range expansion.\n\nBased on the simulation results we will be able to rank the landscapes both in terms of the proportion of species that survive, and the proportion of genetic diversity that survives in these populations. Our results will be useful to planners and conservation organisations, but also to any land owners who are interested in creating habitat to benefit wildlife. The ranking tool we will develop will be able to estimate the future value of a proposed habitat patches (e.g. areas of woodland) to biodiversity, and therefore strengthen the case for acquiring and maintaining the best sites when there are other competing demands on land use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J008001/1","grantId":"NE/J008001/1","fundValue":"319474","fundStart":"2012-05-21","fundEnd":"2015-11-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Justin Mark Travis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" In this project models are being developed to help understand how species will respond to climate change. In particular, we are interested in determining how well species with different characteristics will be able to change their distributions under climate change when they exist on landscapes that have been heavily fragmented by human activities. The models we are developing are individual-based simulations. We have pubished a simulation platform called RangeShifter (Bocedi et al. 2014) that provides a user-friendly interface for researchers and stakeholders to develop their own scenaio modelling. An important initial methodological finding from the early stages of this project is that choices that we (and others working with similar modelling) make regarding the spatial resolution at which we represent key processes and patterns can have a major influence on the predictions that we make (Bocedi et al. 2012; Heikinen 2014). An interesting theoretical finding is that under certain conditions, evolution of a species' life-history strategy (for example how well it can disperse between habitat patches) may effectively 'rescue' a species from extinction by enabling it to better track the changing climate (Henry et al. 2013). Governmental and non-governmental organisations interested in managing landscapes for connectivity and permeability are already interested in the potential for using the approaches we are developing to test, in-silico, the likely outcomes associated with alternative management scenarios. Through the project, we are organising meeting with a range of stakeholders to ensure that software development proceeds in a direction that enables to tackle the pressing applied questions that they are concerned with at the same time as enabling us to progress theoretical understanding. Wehave released a software package, RangeShifter, that is freely available for use, and we have already run 6 workshops introducing users to the softwares potential (2 in UK, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Belgium, 1 in Canada and 1 in USA) with further events planned, including a workshop at the joint BES-SFE meeting in December 2014. Developing a broad capability within the community for using this model will enable the progress made in this project and prior to this project in relation to individual-based simulation of eco-evolutionary dynamics to be exploited in terms of informing the management of landscapes to better protect biodiversity under multiple anthropogenic drivers. We are already working with partners in the UK and abroad (both in Europe and Canada) to begin using the software developed to explore the potential impact of alternative future management scenarios on biodiversity outcomes. This is already resulting in collaborative publications, with one paper published recently with colleagues from Finland (Heikinen et al. 2014) that explored the range dyanamics of a butterfly of conservation concern, and another resulting from local collaboration at Aberdeen accepted for publication that uses RangeShifter to simulate thy spatial dynamics of American mink invading Scotland. Ongoing work with colleagues in Belgium and Italy that exploits RangeShifter is also nearing publication. If we can continue to have the capcity to provide support for the software then we anticipate it will become a leading and much used tool in the field of spatial ecology and landuse planning.
