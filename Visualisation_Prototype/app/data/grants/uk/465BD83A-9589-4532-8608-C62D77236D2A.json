Current vaccines available for Bluetongue are not considered to be safe enough for widespread use. Our laboratory has developed a replication defective (DISC) virus that can be used safely as an alternative BTV vaccine with none of the existing issues. In order to commercialize this vaccine a number of optimizations are necessary. In particular, the stability of the specialized cells which support the growth of the vaccine virus will be optimized. Moreover, to ensure that the DISC virus does not change with time, we will monitor for potential changes in the growth of the virus, expression of virus proteins and genome. The optimal storage conditions for vaccine and number of dose required will be determined in sheep to ensure that protection afforded is maximized.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021342/1","grantId":"BB/J021342/1","fundValue":"137479","fundStart":"2012-09-10","fundEnd":"2014-02-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Polly  Roy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
