{"id":"E0CCC0AE-5B1E-443B-8FF0-2C48A0093782","title":"Developing a meaningful account of the acquisition of the English past tense.","abstractText":"<p>On the whole forming the past tense in English is predictable (add '-ed') but there are many exceptions that children need to learn (go-went, think-thought). The frequency of the verb, its meaning, and its sound pattern influence children's production of errors. However these factors are not well understood, and they change as children grow up.</p>\n\n<p>In this project, an investigation of the eariiest stages of past tense acquisition in English will be carried out using two tasks that encourage 2-5 year-olds to produce past tense forms. The data will be analysed with reference to a wide range of<br />frequency, sound and meaning properties of verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Analysing all of these factors in a single study will provide a much more accurate picture of the acquisition process than is currently available, and allow evaluation of current theories of past tense acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>A database documenting the children's performance on 300 different verbs and categorising the verbs on a large number of established and new properties will be made available to the research community. This database can then be used to<br />form the basis for future research on English typically-developing and language-disordered populations, and to inform research on other languages.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a computational model of past tense acquisition will be produced using the data from the study to improve understanding of how the various verb factors interact to influence production of the past tense. This model can then be used to evaluate possible intervention programmes before they are used by speech and language therapists.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3062","grantId":"RES-062-23-3062","fundValue":"267801","fundStart":"2011-06-15","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna  Theakston","coPersons":["Anna Marsaile Woollams"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
