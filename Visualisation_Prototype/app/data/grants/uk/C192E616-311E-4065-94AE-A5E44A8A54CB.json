Two major signal transduction pathways, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), coordinate the activity of S6Ks in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, mitogens, metabolites and nutrients. In an activate state, S6Ks translocate to discrete cellular compartments/multienzyme complexes, where they interact with and phosphorylate diverse substrates implicated in the regulation of translation, RNA processing, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell growth and survival. A growing body of evidence links S6K signalling to various human pathologies, including diabetes, ageing and cancer. \nIn mammalian cells, there are two isoforms of S6K, termed S6K1 and S6K2. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has been reported for both isoforms of S6Ks, but their nuclear functions are not well understood. This grant application is based on our novel findings which imply the role of S6K2 in the regulation of transcription. We provide the evidence that S6K2 possesses an AT-hook DNA-binding domain at the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, which mediates specific interaction with DNA. We also found that the activity of S6K2 is induced by direct interaction with DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, mutational studies of the AT-hook motif revealed its importance in the regulation of S6K2 pro-survival signalling. \nTo further advance these original findings, we propose to study molecular mechanisms of S6K2-DNA interaction and an alternative model of S6K2 activation upon DNA binding by employing a range of biophysical, biochemical and cellular approaches. Our efforts will be also focused on exploring a cooperative mode of interaction between S6K2 and transcription factors in targeting promoter and enhancer regions of a specific set of genes, implicated in the regulation of S6K2-mediated cellular processes. Mammalian cell models and xenograft studies in nude mice will be employed to study the role of the S6K2 AT-hook motif in the regulation of transcription, ribosome biogenesis, cell survival and growth. It is expected that the proposed study will give deeper insight into nuclear functions of S6K2 and its implication in the regulation of transcription. Unique features of the S6K2-DNA interaction are not only of academic interest, but may also provide novel insights applicable to drug development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L010410/1","grantId":"BB/L010410/1","fundValue":"474300","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  To strengthen our ongoing S6K anti-cancer drug discovery program, which we run in conjunction with UCL Business and Johnson&amp;amp;Johnson.

This grant was initiated in the beginning of 2014. Our research during this period was mainly focused on studying the mode of interaction between S6K2 and DNA, as well as investigating the mechanism of S6K2 activation by DNA binding. We found that recombinant S6K2 interacts preferentially with A/T-rich duplex oligonucleotides when compared to G/C-rich duplexes. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that phosphorylation of the KKSK motif, which is adjacent to the A/T hook DNA binding motif, reduces the interaction between S6K2 and DNA. Using in vitro kinase assay, we showed that S6K2 activation by DNA binding is strongly inhibited by Distamycin A (an AT-selective minor groove binder), but not Chromomycin A which binds preferentially to GC-rich sequences. We are now in the process of identifying by mass spectrometry the site(s) of S6K2 autophosphorylation induced by DNA binding. We anticipate that the outcome of our findings can a) advance our understanding on the mode of regulation of protein kinase by DNA binding; b) provide an insight on the development of novel small molecule inhibitors/anti-cancer drugs with the potential to block S6K2/DNA interaction and subsequently the activation of pro-survival signalling in cancer cells.
