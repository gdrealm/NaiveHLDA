Patients occupy one of the largest numbers of acute hospital bed days of any patient group (2.6 million per year), and the disease consumes between 4-6% of NHS expenditure (approx &pound;2.8 billion) with costs projected to rise 30% by 2010 as life expectancy and survive rates increase. \n\nTreatment options are limited (clot busting drugs like rt-PA or aspirin) with less than 2% of stroke patients receiving rt-PA since it must be given within 3 hours of stroke for safety reasons, and patients must have a brain scan first to rule out brain haemorrhage. \n\nrt-PA is very effective in patients where brain damage has not fully evolved. In the first few hours after stroke, injured but potentially salvageable tissue (penumbra) can be saved by rt-PA. Penumbral tissue can be identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but current techniques underestimate penumbra size. If a rapid, more accurate MRI technique was available, more patients could be treated and recruitment into clinical trials to study new therapies, improved. This proposal describes development and validation of such a technique and provides preliminary MRI data from animal models and man.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700439","grantId":"G0700439","fundValue":"224167","fundStart":"2008-03-10","fundEnd":"2011-03-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iseabail Mhairi Macrae","coPersons":["William Matthew Holmes","Keith  Muir","Willy  Gsell","Christopher  McCabe","Celestine  Santosh","Barrie  Condon"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
