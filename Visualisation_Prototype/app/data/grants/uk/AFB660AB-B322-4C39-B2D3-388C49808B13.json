The activities will mostly consists in the design of one of the two near-IR spectrographs currently planned within HIRES. The project will support also the development of the grating mosaicing concept (which can be used for all HIRES modules), to investigate the benefits and potential of AO, and to explore the wavelength calibration options (by exploiting Laser Comb-like concepts).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002873/1","grantId":"ST/N002873/1","fundValue":"156221","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roberto  Maiolino","coPersons":["David Felix Buscher","Christopher Allim Haniff","Didier  Queloz","Ian Robert Parry","Martin  Haehnelt"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
