The development of an advanced and dependable data analytics infrastructure will enable the effective and efficient monitoring of Dengue fever outbreaks in Brazil. Dengue is an endemic problem in many Brazilian areas where public health assistance is inefficient. The Brazilian public health system cannot meet the demands of these areas due to the resources scarcity, which calls for developing trustworthy mechanisms to support efficiently decisions about the areas that have priority on resource allocation. This software infrastructure can be reused in the future in other developing countries suffering from Dengue outbreaks. The monitoring infrastructure will provide its data analytics capabilities through a unique software architecture that can be used through several mobile platforms and social networks. This infrastructure can only be developed through collaborative research with the leading UK researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026388/1","grantId":"MR/M026388/1","fundValue":"46675","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2016-08-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Romanovsky","coPersons":["Paolo  Missier"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
