{"id":"9892F2FC-1CD7-4584-A2D1-6F2FE7054D1B","title":"Building Capacity in Visual Methods","abstractText":"<p>This initiative runs for three years and aims to support the training and development of researchers across the social sciences at all stages of their career. There are two levels of provision. The first level targets researchers inside and outside academia and from a broad spectrum of social science disciplines. Participants of this course will be postgraduate students, contract research officers, research method trainers and mid-career academics with little or no experience of visual methods. In addition researchers from non-academic and applied research communities and social science researchers working in the voluntary and private sectors will find the first level particularly useful. The first level of the training programme comprises of two two-day ‘Introduction to Visual Methods’ workshops each year. </p> \n<p>The second level is aimed at more experienced visual researchers seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge who are looking to develop particular expertise in cutting edge visual methodology. The second level comprises of two one-day ‘Visual Research Methods Festivals’ each year. </p> \n<p>This dual level programme is delivered through face-to-face workshops, course materials and online via e-learning and will take place at venues north and south of the United Kingdom. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-035-25-0023","grantId":"RES-035-25-0023","fundValue":"78609","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Prosser","coPersons":["Katherine  Wall","Sarah  Pink","Mark  Birkin","S  Pearson","Jennifer  Mason","Gill  Valentine","Ruth  Holliday","David  Gauntlett","Charlotte  Bates","Susan Aisha Walker","Caroline  Dyer","Rob  Walker","Marcus  Banks","Steven Edward Higgins"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
