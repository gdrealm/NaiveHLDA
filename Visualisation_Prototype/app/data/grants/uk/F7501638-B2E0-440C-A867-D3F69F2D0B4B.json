Our recent data indicated that a cell membrane-anchored protein degrading enzyme termed, MT1-MMP, plays an essential role in cartilage erosion in RA. We hypothesize that specific inhibition of MT1-MMP can be a potential RA treatment. We propose to address this by assessing the effect of MT1-MMP inhibition in RA progression in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in transgenic mice that express a dominant negative inhibitor of MT1-MMP. We will also analyze the effect of a MT1-MMP-specific inhibitory antibody in mice with CIA. Completing the proposed work would establish MT1-MMP as a novel therapeutic target of RA treatment, which may lead into development of novel RA therapy in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802007","grantId":"G0802007","fundValue":"813915","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Yoshifumi  Itoh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
