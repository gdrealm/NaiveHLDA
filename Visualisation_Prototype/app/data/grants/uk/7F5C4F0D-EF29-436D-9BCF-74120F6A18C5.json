A wide range of additional science is possible using the 5000 fibre multi-object spectrograph required for this experiment, including studying galaxy formation and evolution, galaxycluster surveys, the structure of the Milky-Way galaxy and Galactic archeology.\n\nIn order to undertake the proposed survey, a US-Europe China collaboration has come together with the aim of constructing a 5000-fiber spectrograph that will initially deploy on the Mayall 4m-telescope. The key science goals represent a field in which the UK has world leadership and strong scientific interest, built up through STFC support for participation in the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.\n\nThis grant provides development funding for two key areas of hardware development where the UK has internationally regarded expertise - the optical corrector, and the fibre system, and will retain UK involve","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J004847/1","grantId":"ST/J004847/1","fundValue":"52774","fundStart":"2012-02-23","fundEnd":"2013-08-22","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Peter Doel","coPersons":["Ofer  Lahav","Filipe Batoni Abdalla"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
