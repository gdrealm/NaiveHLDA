{"id":"BB217603-DDED-482E-866B-B28544CD3A1E","title":"PREDEX - Predictability of Extreme Weather Events","abstractText":"This collaborative interdisciplinary project will deliver and apply new mathematical complexity methods for quantifying the predictability of extreme events in complex dynamical systems. Our new tools will specifically help three European Weather Services improve their capability to forecast extreme weather events (e.g. catastrophic windstorms) - a rapidly emerging real world challenge expected due to anthropogenic climate change. The questions we address are: 1) What are the deterministic time limits of predictability for extreme weather events?2) How can we use emergent dynamical patterns to enhance predictability of extreme weather events?3) What is the role of spatial scale interactions in the physical processes leading to extreme weather? Our approach is based on properties of the atmospheric system which are dynamical (evolve in time, with relevant timescales ranging from hours to years) and emergent (arise from the nonlinear interaction of physical processes having different spatiotemporal scales). The project is strongly grounded on mathematical and physical sciences and is designed around collaboration with meteorology and weather forecasting operational services. The project investigators provide a unique combination of world-leading expertise from different disciplines: atmospheric and climate sciences, the mathematical theory of dynamical systems, the statistical theory of extreme events. Knowledge exchange will be built on strong existing working relationships with three European National Weather Services: the Met Office, the Met \\'Eireann and the KNMI. Members of these Services will be involved in steering the project towards real-world applications and monitoring the achievements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I019146/1","grantId":"EP/I019146/1","fundValue":"158379","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The aim of the research is to predict extreme events.

For weather models of low and intermediate complexity, the PREDEX project developed new theoretical approaches to predict extremes and statistics of recurrence. In this set up an extreme event is characterized by a climatic observable on the system (such as wind speed, or energy) exceeding a critical value. In the model set up, the weather system evolved according to a deterministic rule, such as differential equation or discrete iterative map, but exhibiting chaotic behaviour. A significant outcome of the project was the realisation that the statistics of extremes could be understood in terms of the geometry of the underlying chaotic attractor: the (fractal) subset of phase space for which the system converges to as time evolves. \n\n\n\nAs part of the PREDEX project, a theoretical formula was established between the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor and the tail index of the probability distributions that govern the extremes. Such a formula may be of practical interest, especially to those working in weather/climate who wish to quantify extreme risk. \n\n \n\nFor certain weather models, and for certain specified (extreme) events, progress within PREDEX was made on determining the set of initial conditions that are most likely to lead to an extreme event within a given time frame. The underlying problem here is to determine whether extreme events are more (or less?) predicable relative to other specified weather events. A finding is that the predictability of extremes depends formally on the observable and weather model under consideration. Potential uses include: providing modelling tools to assist those who work in the prediction of extreme events. The focus on PREDEX has been within low complexity weather models, but the tools developed would equally assist those who work on the prediction of extremes in economics and finance. In other contexts, the findings of PREDEX may assist policy makers in land management, security and environment (such as in flood defense). \n This research is of interest to those who want to quantify the statistics of extremes using mathematical modelling. The underlying questions this research explores include: How frequently do extreme events occur? If an extreme event occurs, how long do we have to wait until it occurs again? Are extreme events easy (or hard) to predict? If the evolution of the process (in time) is given as a mathematical model, then the PREDEX project gives methods to measure the typical statistics of extremes as time evolves.
