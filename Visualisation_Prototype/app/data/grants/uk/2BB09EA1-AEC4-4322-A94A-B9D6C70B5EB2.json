{"id":"2BB09EA1-AEC4-4322-A94A-B9D6C70B5EB2","title":"Re-negotiating the Social Contract in the GCC: State-Business Relations and Reforms in the Oil-Rentier Gulf Monarchies","abstractText":"<p>This project concerns the dynamics and implications of the socio-economic transformations in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states over the last decade. It focuses especially on the evolution and position of the business communities in these countries, their relations with 'state' and regime, and their perceptions of and roles in the economic and political reforms attempted. By the same token, it investigates the impact of these reforms on state-business relations and the composition of the business communities.<br /><br />The projectâ€™s methodological contribution lies both in its comparative approach and its emphasis on the social meanings and perceptions of actors. This approach, through first-hand interviews and collections of primary documents,gives a voice to the actors themselves and will contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which policy in the GCC states is formed, negotiated, transformed and implemented by multipleinterests.<br /><br />At a wider level, investigating state-business relations in the Gulf monarchies throws light on: the role of the economic elite in the liberalisation/consolidation of authoritarian regimes; the social changes occurring in this region, where new generations call into question the inherited social models; the dynamics of economic liberalisation processes as studied in other regions and contexts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012696/1","grantId":"ES/J012696/1","fundValue":"417191","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  N.a.
