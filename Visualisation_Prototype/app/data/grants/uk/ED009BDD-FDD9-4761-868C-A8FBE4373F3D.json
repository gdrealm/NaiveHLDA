It is this simple atomic architecture which makes graphite so easy to deposit when gently rubbed against another surface because the layers are free to slide over one another. It was discovered recently that this process even produces single atomic layers, i.e., tiny flakes of carbon which are only one atom thick. This flat allotrope of carbon is called graphene and has created enormous excitement since its discovery. It exhibits a remarkable number of new electronic, mechanical, and optical properties relevant to a wide range of device applications and fundamental research questions. The electronics community is particularly attracted to graphene because it combines high mobility, high transparency, and the ability to carry very high current densities. Recently the UK's meterological standards agency, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), has shown that graphene can be used at low temperatures and at high magnetic fields as resistance standard as it shows the quantum Hall effect with very accurate plateau in the Hall resistance. Graphene is not yet competitive with the semiconducting material currently used to calibrate resistors, however, probably due to the level of disorder. The first objective of this project is to use low temperature scanning probe microscopy and chemical functionalisation to characterise and then reduce the disorder in these layers, thus improving the precision of the quantisation. In addition, the results of our characterisation should help those who grow the graphene layers to develop techniques for producing better quality material. Graphene's ability to conduct electricity cannot be switched on and off unless it is patterned so as to have widths less than 5 nm, so at the moment it is unsuitable for applications such as transistors in digital electronics. However, bilayer graphene, which consists of two layers one above the other, can be made insulating using a vertical electric field. The second part of our project aims to exploit this behaviour to control the path taken by electrons as they travel through graphene. In particular our aim is to channel electrons down small conducting pathways and into electron traps, known as quantum dots , where they are localised. Then, using high frequencies we will clock single electrons through the dot one at a time. The effect is to produce a current that is equal to the charge on the electron times the frequency that we clock them through the dot. This opens up the possibility of producing a well defined current that could be used as a standard for calibrating scientific instruments and for making very precise measurements of the fundamental constants of nature. In addition, because we are defining our quantum dots using the electric field from metal electrodes, the confinement potential should be very smooth and the scattering of the charge carriers off this potential should be specular. As a result, electrons will go through narrow channels without back scattering. This behaviour has not been seen in graphene yet, probably because devices designed so far have rough edges and a great deal of disorder with complex scattering properties. By using the bilayer gated devices we should be able to get rid of this scattering and increase the spin lifetime in graphene quantum dots, thereby opening up the tantalising prospect of using pencil lead as the basis for a quantum computer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029575/1","grantId":"EP/I029575/1","fundValue":"349806","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The National Physics Laboratory (the UK standards laboratory) is using the information regarding disorder in graphene layers to improve their graphene based Quantum Hall resistance standards devices.

The aim of the grant was to use a low temperature scanning probe to map out disorder effects in graphene layers with a view to improving their use as a resistance standard. We were able to use a low temperature scanning probe that works at 4K to locally change the carrier concentration under the tip and then scan the tip over the sample while it was at high magnetic fields in the Quantum hall regime. Graphene is a two dimensional conductor and when placed in a magnetic field it results in the bulk of the sample being insulating and the edges conducting, with current running one way along one edge and the opposite way along the opposite edge. Using the scanning probe we were able to show that these edge channels were forced round regions of the sample that had layers of graphene two atomic layers thick. These bi layer regions act to scatter the edge states out into the bulk. This is important information for those growing this material on a silicon carbide substrate as these regions act to produce back scattering and a reduction in the accuracy of the quantum Hall resistance value used to calibrate resistors.\n In addition we wanted to investigate if graphene could be used to create a current standard using graphene quantum dots. We were able to fabricate a graphene double dot and pump single electrons through the device one at a time up to a frequency close to 1GHz. This creates a well defined current I =ef where e is the charge on an electron and f the driving frequency. this work resulted in a paper in a high impact journal. We have identified a disorder mechanism in graphene layers grown on silicon carbide. This will identify ways to improve the quality of the material for many electronic applications. The first application is likely to be in its use as a resistance standard in the worlds standards laboratories. It has been predicted that this material may also be used for high frequency electronic devices and improving material quality is very important for this to be realized. \nIn the double dot devices we were able to show single electron manipulation at high frequencies in double graphene quantum dots with dimensions around 100nm. This shows potential for use as a current standard for calibrating low current measurement devices. It is also possible that these devices could be used in advanced quantum computing applications where manipulating single electrons at high speeds is required.
