Chemical synthesis is at the heart of the research into these issues as it can deliver the complex compounds required to overcome these challenges. The synthesis of the complex molecules on which we all depend is increasingly a balance between cost and benefit. There is an urgent need to develop novel methods to access these compounds that maximises our resources whilst reducing the overall cost of the process. Finding clean and efficient methods for the formation of added-value compounds from simple low cost starting materials is one of the major challenges facing chemists and chemical engineers. One approach to overcome these challenges that is used extensively in all areas of contemporary synthesis is catalysis. A catalyst is a compound that lowers the energy required to effect a chemical reaction leading to more mild and efficient processes. To overcome some of the challenges associated with complex molecule formation, our research develops a clean, mild and efficient method for the formation of valuable compounds called amides from an underutilised chemical feedstock by using catalysis. Amides (RCONH2) are utilised extensively in the study of biological process as well as in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and polymers. Unfortunately, traditional methods for amide formation produce a significant amount of by-products and waste. Reducing the amount of waste produced during amide formation is the number one problem facing the pharmaceutical industry as recently highlighted at a roundtable discussion of leading scientists.\n\nOur research seeks to catalytically activate nitriles to avoid the use of wasteful reagents and lead to a more efficient synthesis of amides. Nitriles are a functional group that contain a carbon-nitrogen triple bond and are used for a variety of carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions. These sorts of transformations are vital for the synthesis of the range of chemical, pharmaceutical, and raw materials on which our society depends. In addition to providing improved access to these important compounds, this method will ultimately benefit the economy, environment and the day-to-day quality of life of the general public by making important compounds readily available at decreased overall costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J003298/1","grantId":"EP/J003298/1","fundValue":"99711","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason Eliot Camp","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
