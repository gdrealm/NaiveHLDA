In particular, we will explore through surveys and focus\ngroups what motivates participants to get involved in local energy initiatives, and which barriers to engagement may exist.\nWe will observe the impact on energy consumption and behavioural changes that result from participation and specifically\nown-use/local use of local generation.\nWe will analyse consumption data from before and during the trial with a view to establish any demand reduction, flexibility\nand carbon impacts that can be attributed to specific interventions as part of this project. Furthermore, our surveys will\nexplore public perceptions on the desirability of different measures to better understand which of them have potential to be\nrolled out on a larger scale and where additional incentives or considerations need to be explored to ensure that demand\nresponse can be provided willingly and to the benefit of participants.\nWe will work closely with other project partners to establish important balances between behavioural demand responses\nand areas in which flexibility can be provided through other means, such as storage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507209/1","grantId":"EP/M507209/1","fundValue":"33551","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Josephine Darby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
