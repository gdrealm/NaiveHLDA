The Partners worked together to develop common understandings of the issues through secondments of university researchers to the partners, through participant observation of the policy making process, and through action research. Results were published in a report (North and Barker, 2011 available at www.lowcarbonliverpool.com) and presented to an audience of some seventy local policy makers in February 2011. The report's recommendations were welcomed by our local partners who felt it and associated consultations provided a &quot;strong evidence base&quot; which &quot;helped catalyse a coalition that is determined to ensure that Liverpool creates the conditions that enable the city to reap the rewards from such an approach'&quot;. Research findings framed a new understanding on the need for Liverpool to develop on a more sustainable approach, which were written into local strategic documents including Merseyside's Local Transport Plan:\n&quot;The project helped to provide a platform for taking forward key themes around reducing carbon emissions from transport whilst supporting sustainable economic growth, where walking, cycling and public transport are the modes of transport of choice, and where long distance trips by motorised transport are minimised.&quot; \nThe Primary Care Trust who provided funding for a Strategic Policy Officer based at the Chamber of Commerce. \n After the launch a wider range of partners emerged who established a new multi-agency Green Partnership which was formally launched in July 2013 and which &quot;gave the project an immediacy and potency it would otherwise have lacked. This wider group continued to use processes of co-production to research the advantages of the European Green Capital bid process to catalyse low carbon policy making at the urban scale. The bid process &quot;became a motor for focussed action and engaged a whole range of institutions and public and private bodies with the project&quot;. Our research included an analysis of the experiences of previous Green Capitals and other examples of good urban practice. It included an audit of Liverpool's environmental performance, which was presented in March 2013 and identified four areas of poor performance (recycling levels, cycle lanes, use of green cars, and water metering) which were widely discussed in the city. The partnerships work and the associated debate influenced the establishment of a Mayoral Commission to accelerate progress and performance in this area. \nThus impact can be demonstrated through: \n(1) Catalysing local discussion and debate reported in the local media, including eight events involving between 50 and 100 delegates from the public, private and community sectors which discussed and analysed the issues in a city where climate change had not been a priority and in a sceptical political environment with the result that: \n&quot;socially innovative approaches to the creation of sustainable economies and communities have not been side-lined but have retained strength and potential as a pathway to growth and economic opportunity.&quot; \n(2) Improved partnership working. The report's key recommendation, that Liverpool look to &quot;improve the alignment of programmes, processes and awareness&quot; was accepted. The co-production process has been owned by partners in what they saw as an &quot;interesting and innovative journey&quot;. The impact of Low Carbon Liverpool has not just been excellent university research accepted by and then adopted by partners: they have welcomed the ability to explore ideas that at first felt uncomfortable, which challenged conventional wisdom. Low Carbon Liverpool has provided a &quot;trusted, neutral space for the improved alignment of programmes, processes and awareness&quot; with the university fulfilling the role of facilitator and trusted arbiter, Partnership working \n&quot;has helped break down silos and bureaucratic boundaries which hindered a holistic approach. There is now greater possibility of 'joined-up' thinking and compatible and coherent action with more intellectual 'osmosis' between institutions, especially through the engagement of the public sector with the private and academic knowledge base within the city.&quot; \n(3) The adoption of the project's proposals, including the methodology for working up a bid to be a European Green Capital (b) the audit of the city's environmental performance and (c) the creation and launch of the Liverpool Green Partnership to take these issues forward in concrete ways.
