{"id":"660DA5F5-DCFC-4E97-95AC-92548CE9C728","title":"Overcoming the Limitations of Allograft in Impaction Bone Grafting for Revision Arthroplasty","abstractText":"The replacement of lost bone is a major clinical and socio-economic need, particularly in the fields of revision arthroplasty, spinal and trauma surgery. Often, a lack of sufficient host (own or autogenous) bone precludes the universal use of autogenous bone while the use of donor (allogeneic) bone carries risks of rejection and infection. Bone marrow contains stem cells (skeletal stem cells), which can be isolated and can be readily expanded, while retaining their ability to form a variety of tissues like bone and fat. \n\nGiven the demographic challenge of an ageing population, the development of strategies to exploit the potential of bone progenitors which can give rise to cells of the osteogenic lineage, offers a compelling approach to augment bone formation to replace or restore the function of traumatised or degenerated bone. \n\nWe propose a unique programme to create a living composite of bone progenitor cells and a synthetic scaffold together with a new innovative process for placing the synthetic polymer scaffold and cells in the hip cavity ( a process of vibration impaction bone grafting)that can be applied in orthopaedic applications requiring new bone stock. We will show in this work the ability of bone progenitor cells together with an optimised synthetic scaffold and an innovative vibration impaction process our ability to augment bone formation in impaction bone grafting. To prove our concept, we will use a standard clinical orthopaedic procedure called femoral impaction grafting wherein a new prosthesis is needed to replace a degenerated hip implant and needs bone stock.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802397","grantId":"G0802397","fundValue":"462159","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Oreffo","coPersons":["Douglas Graham Dunlop","SM  Howdle"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
