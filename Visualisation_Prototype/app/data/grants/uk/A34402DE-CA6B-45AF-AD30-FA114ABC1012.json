Although each disorder has its own\nunique issues in relation to such trials, there are shared themes across the different\ndiseases that would benefit from greater discussion and interaction between experts in\nthe field. This working group will bring together experts in presymptomatic studies of\ngenetic Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease,\nParkinson's disease, prion disease, motor neuron disease and the spinocerebellar\nataxias. The groups will identify the key shared themes including trial design, the use of\nsurrogate endpoints, regulatory perspectives, academic-industry partnerships,\nrecruitment and registers, ethical considerations, and support for participants in trials.\nThrough a series of face-to-face workshops and webex meetings the group will move\nfrom sharing individual disease-based perspectives to producing cross-disease\nguidelines for trials in presymptomatic neurodegenerative disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M501724/1","grantId":"MR/M501724/1","fundValue":"27451","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Daniel  Rohrer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
