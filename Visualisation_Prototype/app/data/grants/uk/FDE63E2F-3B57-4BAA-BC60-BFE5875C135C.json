We believe, however, that it is possible, and desirable, to present and explain even the most advanced concepts in physics using a strong narrative, with a storyline that is likely to appeal to, and engage, children in the crucial 9-14 age group. We have incorporated this philosophy into the 'Pocket Professor, a television series in which a holographic projection of a real scientist takes a couple of young inquisitive teenagers on a voyage of discovery through the Universe, exploring and explaining such difficult concepts as the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics and their consequences, and demonstrating that the Universe is indeed a wonderful place where unexpected, counterintuitive and exciting phenomena abound. The goal of the project is to produce a highly professional pilot television programme in partnership with the award winning production and animation company Optic Verve, together with a set of twelve additional storyboards for a full television series for general broadcast on children's television. The programmes will use the most advanced animation and filming techniques, to blend live action with realistic animation, each programme focussing directly on a single physics concept.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D507227/1","grantId":"EP/D507227/1","fundValue":"81470","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was an exercise in public engagement.
