Typical signals in general / such as those detected by a radio / may be encoded in terms of their amplitude (amplitude-modulated - AM) or frequency (FM), and until recently it was assumed that it was changes in the concentration (amplitude) of these signalling proteins that were important. Recently we have shown by studies in single cells that the signals in one of these pathways, the so-called NF-kappaB pathway, are oscillatory and that it is the frequency of these oscillations that seems to determine the downstream response. However, there are many other signalling pathways in a cell, and what is also unknown is the extent to which different signalling pathways are coupled to each other. Many years ago, anomalies in the orbit of Neptune led to the recognition that they must be caused by the presence of an unknown i.e. unobserved planet (Pluto), and calculations allowed astronomers both to predict the orbit of the unknown planet and thus to discover it observationally. This recognition that interactions between two dynamical systems A and B allows one to infer the presence of functional interactions solely by looking for the effects of B on A provides a novel and powerful tool that we wish to exploit here. This is because interactions between nonlinear systems oscillating respectively at A Hz and B Hz causes the production in pathway A of 'beat' frequencies of (A plus/minus nB) Hz. Since these frequencies can be measured with high precision, we seek to develop and exploit this idea for the determination of functional interactions between signalling pathways whose 'natural' frequencies of oscillation differ. This will be done both computationally (by studying a computer model of the NF-kappaB pathway, which we shall extend) and experimentally. A specific focus will be on interactions with a related and important pathway called the p53 pathway, which is modified in a large percentage of human cancers. The result will be a novel set of tools with which we can determine the interactions between signalling pathways by looking at their frequency components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010748/1","grantId":"BB/D010748/1","fundValue":"247402","fundStart":"2006-05-08","fundEnd":"2010-02-07","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Richard White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
