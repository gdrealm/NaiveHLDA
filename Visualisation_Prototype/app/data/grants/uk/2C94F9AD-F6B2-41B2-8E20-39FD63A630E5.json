These fields encompass studies of our Sun and Solar System, and Stars (including the evolution of both single and binary systems, i.e. two stars orbiting around one another) and the role played by stars as tracers for our understanding of the wider Universe. \n\nA key uncertainty in our knowledge is the role of binarity in the evolution of stars, and the interactions of one star with another during their evolution. In this case, at different times, material from one star can flow onto the other (and sometimes vice versa), and more rarely two stars may collide to produce a single more massive object or sometimes a gigantic explosion called a supernova. Such stellar collisions are called mergers, and they lead to objects with unusual chemical composition which contain a 'fossil' record of the two stars' joint history or (in the case of a supernova) to an object with short-lived properties that can be used to probe the most distant parts of the Universe. \n\nA second area of our research on stars concerns the measurement of stellar magnetic fields, and the impact of magnetic fields on a star's evolution. The reason why some stars are magnetic, and others less so, remains a mystery, and our work aims to provide reliable data with which to compare the different ideas. A third is the origin, evolution and fate of the most massive stars in the Universe. Their evolution is dominated by powerful stellar winds. Do such stars explode disruptively at the end of their lives, or do they ultimately collapse to produce black holes; and, in either case, what is the effect of the stellar wind on neighbouring stars and the nearby star-forming regions? This work will significantly advance our understanding of stars.\n\nOur work on the Sun - our nearest Star - has implications not just for understanding stars generally but also for how processes in our Sun's visible atmosphere produce the observed phenomena that ultimately leads to heating of its million-degree Corona and the formation of the Solar Wind. The Sun is a variable star showing a dominant roughly 11-year cycle of magnetic activity between episodes of sunspot maximum and minimum. It is currently observed continuously by a fleet of spacecraft, and our detailed observations from instruments onboard these spacecraft (which cover a very wide range of wavelengths) are designed to improve our understanding of the physics of the Sun's atmosphere and the mechanisms by which it produces occasional massive outbursts of mass and energy. Some of these outbursts have huge power, and can lead not just to the visible appearance of aurorae in the Earth's upper atmosphere but to potentially damaging effects on spacecraft and large-scale power systems on Earth. The variable magnetic activity of the Sun has broad implications for Earth's place in the near-space environment.\n\nLastly, we seek to understand the origin of our planetary system, and the evolution of the small bodies - comets and asteroids (and their debris) - within it. We will study the newly discovered populations of small satellites orbiting the giant planets, for example Jupiter and Saturn, to test theories of the origin of our Solar System. We will also investigate the detailed processes by which comets decay into meteoroid streams, debris from which may occasionally cross Earth's orbit to produce the well-known phenomenon of a meteor shower - the burning up of small pieces of cometary material in the Earth's atmosphere. Not only are there interesting scientific reasons to study such objects and their interrelationships with each other in the Solar System, but the study of Earth's near-space astronomical environment has important practical benefits, leading to better understanding of the distribution of small bodies on near-Earth orbits and the time-variable risk of collisions with the Earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J001082/1","grantId":"ST/J001082/1","fundValue":"306052","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Gerard  Doyle","coPersons":["David  Asher","Apostolos  Christou","Jorick Sandor Vink","Simon  Jeffery","Gavin  Ramsay","Stefano  Bagnulo"],"organisation":"Armagh Observatory","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
