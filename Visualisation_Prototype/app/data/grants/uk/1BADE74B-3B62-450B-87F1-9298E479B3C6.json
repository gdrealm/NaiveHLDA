In particular, we formulate a hybrid procedure starting from a long-wave perturbation of the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problems on cross-section for the equations in plane and antiplane elasticity. Two types of cross-sections are studied analytically, including an elliptic and rectangular one. The derived low-dimensional equations will be applied to the analysis of trapped modes in waveguides with shape imperfections. The project is inspired by the theory and practice of non-destructive evaluation and also has potential applications in the optimal design of advanced structures. It generalizes previous considerations of the co-authors and the visiting fellow in the area of longwavelength asymptotics and elastic trapped modes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H021302/1","grantId":"EP/H021302/1","fundValue":"16128","fundStart":"2009-12-14","fundEnd":"2010-12-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Evgeniya  Nolde","coPersons":["Julius  Kaplunov"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
