Control over one's own body is a limiting basic case. Agency thus involves both physical events and subjective experience. Is this experience a post hoc reconstruction, or a specific cognitive content of our intentions? We explore this issue in two sets of experiments measuring how sense of agency depends on underlying sensory and motor events. Subjects freely choose between actions producing different visual feedback effects. Subliminal primes before action, and random insertion of involuntary movements are used to modulate sense of agency, testing reconstructionist theories. Other experiments clarify the role of subjective time in predictively linking actions to effects. We suggest that agency makes subjective time coarser, more quantized, so as to bind effects of actions to the intentions that precede them. The results clarify the sensorimotor basis of this key aspect of our sense of self.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1571","grantId":"RES-000-23-1571","fundValue":"182990","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Haggard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
