{"id":"EE8927FA-D08B-41DE-B680-FD11179C7D4E","title":"Real Time Highly Realistic Computer Graphics","abstractText":"This proposal aims to fund the Direct-Trace algorithms and their library to allow using Ray-Tracing for Real-Time 3D computer applications. Ray-Tracing is a technique that can provide more realistic 3D effects, and the grant will provide a proof-of-concept for the new technique and its extensions, following research supported by a previous EPSRC grant and a patent filed on the technology. Prior funding has helped discovering much faster techniques for Ray-Tracing and the objective is to port these techniques to a much faster platform (i.e., a Graphics card) to speed it up. This will allow for use of Ray-Tracing in real-time dynamic applications such as 3D games, the movie industry, or Physics simulations. There is a great opportunity for the first sustained real-time implementation of Ray-Tracing, as Ray-Tracing can provide much higher realism for 3D Graphics and games in particular.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005870/1","grantId":"EP/I005870/1","fundValue":"82713","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin  Mora","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
