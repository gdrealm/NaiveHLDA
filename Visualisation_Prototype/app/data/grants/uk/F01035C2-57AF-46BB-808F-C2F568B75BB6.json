It will do so by establishing a wide network of partners from a variety of sectors including UK and African universities, NGOs, educational managers and coordinators, practitioners and government staff in Kenya, Malawi and Uganda.<br />Foremost, the project will build on the current collaborations between the University of Birmingham, the University of Cambridge, the International NGO Sightsavers and specialist education communities in the three target countries, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>The project will draw on existing primary research to address a number of issues around the current educational support available for children and young people with disabilities with a particular focus on visual impairment in three countries (Kenya, Malawi and Uganda). The key purposes are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>increase local stakeholdersâ€™ capacity to understand, interpret and use primary research</li>\n\n <li>facilitate the development of a co-created research agenda in each and across the participating countries. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ultimately, our goal is to strengthen the capacity of our local partners allowing them to set their own research agendas and inform the development of effective education systems.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002078/1","grantId":"ES/L002078/1","fundValue":"36678","fundStart":"2013-11-30","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This is still a live project so we are still working internally.

Working closely with the three countries, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda, and using social media as a communication platform, has helped to identify areas of strength and weakness when discussing research research design, methods and dissemination. We plan to disseminate the three working papers (one for each country) with significant number of audiences across the East African region and with user groups such as international non-governmental organisations working in the field of education and disability.
