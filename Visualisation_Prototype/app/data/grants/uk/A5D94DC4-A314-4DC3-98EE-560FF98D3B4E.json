{"id":"A5D94DC4-A314-4DC3-98EE-560FF98D3B4E","title":"Visiting Fellowship: Multiferroic Thin Films","abstractText":"The aim of this proposal is to develop lead-free piezoelectric thin films and periodically nanostructured multiferroic thin-films with an artificial crystallographic superstructure. These will be used in sensor devices based on magnetoelectric coupling. To accelerate the research in this area we propose to bring Dr Valant to the to work in the group (Centre for Physical Electronics and Materials) for a period of a year, during which we will prepare the groundwork for a full proposal to both EPSRC and to the Framework programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D061970/1","grantId":"EP/D061970/1","fundValue":"85197","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Alford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
