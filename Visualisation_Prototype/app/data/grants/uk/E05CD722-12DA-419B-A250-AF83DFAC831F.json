The grant is needed to better understand the Grid market and to focus the technical programme to meet this market's needs. This will significantly improve the chances of successful exploitation of the Performance Prediction Tool. Case studies and industrial applications of this project will be provided in partnership with industrial project partners. This proposal is timely in that it addresses the need for continued development of infrastructure support for Grid computing in the growing market for Grid-based business solutions.The problemThe solution - technical + commercial","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005826/1","grantId":"EP/G005826/1","fundValue":"90332","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Karim  Djemame","coPersons":["Alison  Marshall","Peter  Dew"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" A tool was developed to help system administrators choose the most efficient compute resources to run their applications They have been taken forward by EDS (now HP) on behalf of Rolls-Royce Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
