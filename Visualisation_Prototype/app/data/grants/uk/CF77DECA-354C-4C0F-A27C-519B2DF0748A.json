{"id":"CF77DECA-354C-4C0F-A27C-519B2DF0748A","title":"Dynamics of Spin-VCSELs","abstractText":"We propose to investigate the dynamic properties of optically injected spin-polarised, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). In general spin-polarised lasers offer many attractive advantages, including enhanced intensity and polarisation stability as well as a reduced threshold current, and they have potential applications in cryptographic communications and reconfigurable optical interconnects. Moreover the nonlinear dynamics of optically-injected semiconductor lasers has been a fertile research topic for many years and the benefits are now emerging in stable injection-locked sources with very high bandwidths as well as in potential applications in encrypted communications systems based on chaos. However, the novelty of this proposal lies in combining the hitherto disparate fields of spin-polarised VCSELs and optical injected lasers, examining particularly the effects of polarised optical injection on the nonlinear dynamics of spin-polarised lasers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G012458/1","grantId":"EP/G012458/1","fundValue":"254609","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Henning","coPersons":["Mike  Adams"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" The effects of polarised optical injection in VCSELs have been studied experimentally and theoretically in order to investigate phenomena such as polarisation switching, bistability, limit cycle, period doubling and chaos, and to seek novel effects.\n\nOptically-pumped spin-VCSELs based on dilute nitride semiconductors at the telecom wavelength of 1300 nm have been experimentally demonstrated for the first time and their behaviour analysed experimentally and theoretically.\n\nThe spin flip model has been applied to polarised optical injection in conventional and spin-polarised VCSELs and the results compared with measurements where possible. This research could be used to aid the study (experimental and theoretical) of spin-VCSELs, both solitary and when subject to polarised optical injection. \n\n\n Tunable high-frequency oscillations have been discovered in 1300 nm spin-VCSELs under continuous optical pumping. These are of interest for exploitation as tunable sources for possible use in radio-over-fibre systems. There is also the potential for other high-frequency and high-speed device functionality based on these devices. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
