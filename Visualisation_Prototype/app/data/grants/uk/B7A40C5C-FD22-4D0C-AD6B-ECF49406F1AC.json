At the end of the study the waiting control group will receive the most effective intervention. </p>\n\n<p>The interventions will be given by teaching assistants and the groups will complete reading, language and cognitive measures before the 20 week intervention and on three occasions during and after the intervention. </p>\n\n<p>The results of the study will be disseminated to local teachers and speech and language therapists through seminars and workshops.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D005310/1","grantId":"ES/D005310/1","fundValue":"439743","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As per our original proposal, we held 4 seminars focusing on different aspects of reading comprehension. The invited experts differed only slightly from those proposed. The presentations in each seminar spanned theory and practice; there was an interactive poster session in which early career researchers presented their work and a discussion session bringing out practical implications. \n\nTopics were as follows:\n1: Theoretical, empirical and educational perspectives on reading comprehension \n2: Language skills and reading comprehension.\n3: Working memory and text comprehension.\n4: Interventions to promote reading comprehension.\n\n5. The participants.\nEach seminar was attended by researchers, practitioners, graduate students, teachers , teacher educators, and policy makers from local authorities as well as from the National Primary Strategy and DCSF. We also welcomed a small number of researchers from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Australia, Brazil, India.\n\nThe breakdown was roughly similar for each meeting: 50% academic researcher; 25% graduate students; 12% early career researcher; 12% practitioner/policy maker.\nThere was a range of disciplines; psychology, education, speech and language therapy, educational psychology, computer science, educational policy.\n\n6.
