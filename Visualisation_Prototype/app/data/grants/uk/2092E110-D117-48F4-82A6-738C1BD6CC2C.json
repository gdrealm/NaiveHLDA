Thus it is suitable for study as a culture, or better, as a constellation of cultures. Its value is cultural as well as practical. Mathematics is an expression of the human capacity to transcend our material interests and find satisfaction in exercising our intelligence. Further, mathematicians assess and direct research in mathematics using standards and values that are embedded in their research culture. However, the cultural benefits of mathematics are hard to disseminate because appreciation of mathematics requires relatively detailed understanding (compared with fields like the discovery of exoplanets, where the results can be given with little or no technical apparatus). This raises a third theme: the cultural standing and reputation of mathematics. It is a long-standing goal of UK governments to raise attainment in numeracy and STEM disciplines. A major obstacle is the reputation of mathematics among students as forbiddingly difficult and remote. \n\nThis project will host three conferences. \nThe first (Easter 2012) will explore and map the variety of and connections among contemporary mathematical cultures. These can be research cultures, but may also include practitioner cultures (e.g. among engineers, economists, social scientists, etc.) and mathematical cultures among instructor and student groups (e.g. primary/secondary/tertiary teachers, school pupils, mathematics students at all levels). \n\nThe second (Easter 2013) conference will articulate and classify mathematical values. What do mathematicians mean when they use terms such as 'deep', 'elegant', 'explanatory', etc.? What is the rational structure of the deliberations mathematicians use to reach value judgments? This conference will build on the first conference by referring these questions to the various mathematical cultures identified at that first event. \n\nThe third conference (September 2013) will discuss mathematics in public culture. Amongst other topics, it will explore the question &quot;why should I study mathematics?&quot;. This third meeting will build on the first conference by identifying the contributions from and audiences in the various mathematical cultures. It will build on the second conference by drawing on the articulations and explorations of mathematical values. \n\nThese meetings will be recorded and edited for publication on the project website. The project will invite to all three conferences (and pay reasonable expenses for) individuals whose interest might be thought to lie solely in the final meeting (such as mathematics popularisers and science journalists). \n\nAt every conference there will be space in the programme for postgraduate students to present their work (if they are in parallel sessions, they will not be timetabled against established researchers) and funds to support their attendance.\n\nThe network will be managed by the Principal Investigator, aided by an administrative assistant who will organise the meetings, coordinate publication of the outputs and develop and maintain the website. \n\nThe PI will share responsibility for inviting participants, judging abstracts of proposed talks and choosing contributions to the outputs with a panel consisting of:\n\nProf Jeremy Gray, Professor of the History of Mathematics (Open University)\n\nDr. Matthew Inglis, Lecturer (Maths Education Centre, Loughborough University); Honorary Research Fellow (University of Notts); Royal Society Worshipful Company of Actuaries Research Fellow. \n\nProf. Benedikt L&ouml;we, Universitair Docent (Universiteit v.

A disconnect between the meaning of mathematics in the cultures of mathematicians, and the meaning of mathematics in school classrooms. We have already secured funding from ICSU (Eu30k) to develop a research project on Cultures of Research Training, i.e. to investigate and ameliorate the cultural barriers to participation in mathematical research. \nThere is much more to do on the cultural significance of mathematics in schools. \nThere are some promising leads re. the place of mathematics in cultural understandings and narratives of risk, both in the lay population and among finance and actuarial professionals.
