Jones, LJMU)","abstractText":"The project incorporates two types of mathematical models for dynamic macro-cracks in structured media. Surface breaking cracks of finite size and subjected to a dynamic loading generated by a time-harmonic oscillation of temperature will be considered. This is related to the phenomenon of thermal striping which occurs, for example, within the cooling contours of nuclear reactors or in the mixing zones within piping systems due to the appearance of surface breaking cracks. The depth of such cracks is greatly dependent on the frequency of the external thermal oscillations. The first type of structures will involve truss-like lattices where flexural deformation can be neglected. The second type refers to macro-cracks in frame-like elastic structures incorporating bending of elastic links around the macro-crack. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of interaction between the macro-crack and micro defects modelled as imperfect spring-like junctions within the lattice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018239/1","grantId":"EP/H018239/1","fundValue":"249248","fundStart":"2010-04-30","fundEnd":"2013-04-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Samuel Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
