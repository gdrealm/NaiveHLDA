The EPRG, led by Professor David Newbery, is now one of the world's leading research groups in energy economics. </p>\n\n<p>The objective of this application is to continue our current active programme of dissemination and stakeholder engagement for the year after the end of the grant to maximise the impact of our extensive research activities. We will be organising three major stakeholder conferences. We will also continue our active engagement, via the EPRG's Energy Policy Forum, with Ofgem, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Committee on Climate Change and leading energy companies. We will continue to respond to consultations and other invitations to participate in discussions. Finally, Professor Newbery will continue to publish working papers and articles arising from the research programme and to speak around the world at the various conferences and seminars. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-189-25-0155","grantId":"RES-189-25-0155","fundValue":"74580","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael G Pollitt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
