To address this issue, experiments are planned in which participants will name pictures and simultaneously carry out an easy or a more difficult working memory task or a tone discrimination task. The difficulty of selecting the picture names from the mental lexicon and of generating the associated phonological forms will be varied by presenting the pictures together with prime words which will be related to the picture name in meaning (cat-dog) or in phonological form (dot-dog) or will be unrelated to the picture name. The primes will be presented for only 50ms and preceded and followed by pattern masks (###) so that the speakers cannot compare them to the picture names. Based on earlier research, both types of related primes are expected to facilitate object naming. If lexical selection and/or phonological encoding processes require central processing capacity, the difficulty of the working memory task should affect the size of the priming effects, and the performance in the tone discrimination task should depend on the type of prime.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028512/1","grantId":"ES/F028512/1","fundValue":"81374","fundStart":"2008-01-15","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antje S  Meyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
