At each seminar, leading experts will share their experience of lessons learnt from specific reforms in European countries to inform policy makers in England as they embark on a series of reforms intended to improve the performance of the NHS and the health of the English population.</p>\n\n<p>The project brings together academics and practitioners to facilitate knowledge transfer, networking and research collaboration at a time when the English health system is preparing for major reform. It also offers learning opportunities for LSE Health staff and PhD students.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J001090/1","grantId":"ES/J001090/1","fundValue":"9810","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Thomson","coPersons":["Rachel  Irwin"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
