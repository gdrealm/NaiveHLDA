It is debilitating, affects 3 million people in the UK, and is the 5th leading cause of death (25,000 deaths in the UK/year). It is the only chronic disease with a rising death rate. UK COPD costs are estimated at &pound;3.2 billion per annum. Annual NHS costs are &pound;900M, 50% of which are due to unscheduled hospital admissions due to deteriorating symptoms. Better disease management would reduce this disease burden, but currently no treatments prevent disease onset or halt progression. \n\nCOPD is a chronic inflammatory condition, where the continued presence of excessive inflammatory proteins and cells in the lung cause damage. Smoking cigarettes is the most important risk factor, but only 15% of smokers develop COPD, and the disease runs in families, suggesting there are genetic factors that predispose towards COPD. Inflammation and lung destruction continue even after smoking cessation. This is poorly understood, but we believe that COPD patients have abnormal immune responses that drive disease even after noxious stimuli (cigarette smoke) have gone. Presently we cannot predict who will develop COPD or if all disease features are caused by the same underlying immune problem. It is vital to understand this, as it will help direct new treatments.\n\nNeutrophils are white blood cells crucial for fighting infection. They leave the blood, moving (migrating) accurately to areas of infection, where they ingest bacteria, killing them with an arsenal of proteins contained within the cell. These proteins cause damage and inflammation if they are released in the body's tissues. Neutrophils contain genes that control the cell by dictating what proteins are expressed. These proteins could be enzymes, controlling chemical reactions within the utrophil, or structural proteins, controlling how they move. \n\nNeutrophils are central to COPD. COPD patients have many neutrophils in their lungs and the chemicals neutrophils release can cause the characteristic lung damage. Our data show that neutrophils from COPD patients are defective, migrating less accurately than cells from healthy subjects or people with other lung diseases and ingest less bacteria in models of infection. This is important, as inaccurate migration and reduced bacterial clearance could lead to more lung damage and poorer outcomes during infections; both of these are thought central in COPD. We have shown this harmful cell behaviour is due to increased activity of a protein enzyme called phophosinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Abnormal PI3K signalling may be the cause of altered COPD neutrophil behaviour and correcting this may offer a new treatment in COPD.\n\nWe wish to investigate the molecular signals and identify the relevance of injurious neutrophil behaviour in COPD, using neutrophils isolated from blood and lung secretions of COPD patients, those at risk of developing COPD (family members of COPD patients) and healthy volunteers. This will determine how prevalent the defective neutrophil behaviour is across all the differing features of COPD, and whether you can predict who might develop the disease by assessing their neutrophils. We will then identify the cause of the defective neutrophil behaviour, by studying the activity of structural proteins and enzymes (and the genes that control them) within COPD neutrophils, using our extensive preliminary data and knowledge of cell signaling to focus our experiments. \n\nIdentifying the specific cause of defective neutrophil behaviour will allow us to form new targeted treatments for COPD, improving the health of patients with the disease. It may also allow us to predict who is most at risk of the COPD, developing a screening tool, helping to inform people about their lifestyle choices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L008335/1","grantId":"MR/L008335/1","fundValue":"231499","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Sapey","coPersons":["Janet  Lord","Alison  Condliffe","Alice  Turner"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
