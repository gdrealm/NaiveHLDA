{"id":"7B74E050-F6CD-44CD-8253-D4DEB883F2A7","title":"OSI - One Step Interconnect for Thin Film PV Modules","abstractText":"The market for photovoltaic (PV) modules has expanded dramatically from 6.4GW in 2009 to 37GW in 2013. PV demand is\npoised for explosive growth to reach 49GW in 2014, and is forecast to reach up to 100GW by 2018. This end-market\ngrowth is projected to increase annual PV module revenues, which are forecast to reach US$50 billion in 2018. Despite\nbeing severely hampered by overcapacity and declining operating margins during 2012 and 2013, the PV industry still grew\n34% over this two-year period. Thin film PV has approximately a 10% market share and has inherent cost advantages,\nespecially in the development of utility scale installations. As part of the manufacturing process, it is necessary to\ninterconnect gridded areas of the PV module to form long series connected PV regions. In this project, the interconnect will\nbe achieved using a new laser ablation/inkjet process that works at speeds of up to 3m/sec. This will radically change the\nway modules are produced by reducing complexity and cost of manufacture. The sales target for this new process is\n&gt;$10m per annum with attractive ongoing sales of specialist inks. The primary objective is to develop the OSI process and\nmaterials for semi-transparent perovskite for Building Integrated PV glazing applications, a very promising market. The\nsecondary and tertiary objectives are to develop the process and materials for CIGS and CZTS, respectively.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508433/1","grantId":"EP/N508433/1","fundValue":"217757","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Mike Walls","coPersons":["Jake  Bowers"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
