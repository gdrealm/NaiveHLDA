These circuits have many functions ranging from; perception, movement and memory. How the circuits perform their tasks is largely due to the type of receptors they posses, their morphological structure and who they are wired with. This complex wiring of neurones makes the brain the most complex organ however; the way it works can be simplified into two opposing forces; excitation and inhibition. Neurones which work via chemical synapses are excited by excitatory pyramidal cells using neurotransmitter glutamate and are inhibited by inhibitory interneurones releasing the neurotransmitter, GABA that acts on GABA receptors. Under or over activity of these 2 opposing forces have been implicated in neurodegenerative (e.g. epilepsy and Parkinson?s disease) and psychiatric diseases (e.g. anxiety and schizophrenia). The proposed research is to provide a better understanding of how the homeostatic balance of inhibition and excitation is achieved. \n80% of cells in cortical regions consist of the pyramidal cell family while inhibitory interneurones consist of 6-7% of cells in cortical regions. Interneurones fall into different sub families, which are diverse in their morphology, neurochemistry, electrophysiological properties and the type of GABA receptors they posses. The interneurones make synapses with pyramidal cells and other interneurones to regulate and fine tune pyramidal cell activity, thus preventing over excitability of the network. This study is very important since not only will it provide valuable information on interneurone physiology, pharmacology and morphology but will also provide insight on neuronal subtypes which may be selectively affected in a particular disease states. The outcome of this research has direct relevance to human neuropathology, since it will allow us to design drugs to target specific pathways in the brain to treat neurological disorders, including depression and anxiety, which impact significantly on UK citizens, i.e. 1 in 4 adults may experience a mental health problem in any given year. Depression alone is thought to be the second most costly illness worldwide (Murray and Lopez, 1996) by year 2020, representing the biggest global economic health burden after heart disease. The treatment for such disorders include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, which act through GABAA neurotransmitter receptors, making the GABAA receptor a prime target for the development of new drugs and improved selectivity of existing ones.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501263","grantId":"G0501263","fundValue":"324566","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Afia Begum  Ali","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Pharmacy","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
