The intention is for our audience, whilst engaged emotionally in the personal challenges of both astronomers, to perhaps consider {consciously or even subconsciously} the concept of Time and Space. \n\nThe character of Jess also offers a contemporary insight into the Herschel legacy which undoubtedly enriched the study of later astronomers and cosmologists. The premise of the play is that Caroline's concern for the astronomers of the future was a passionate driving force that fed into the rigor and exactitude of both her observations and her charts.This theme of Past and Future is fundamental to the play: we learn that Jess' daughter, in the midst of the Arab Spring, has become an intern at the new Library of Alexandria - and so the memory of Hypatia {350AD to 415AD}, the very first female astronomer, also ripples through the piece. \n\nUltimately by linking the role of women through the ages with the study of the universe, we hope to show that the search for understanding and truth is the meeting point for all women, men, scientists and artists, and that this meeting point deepens our experience of the world we live in and nourishes the human psyche; that the challenges of the female astronomer are relevant to all women\n&quot; the audience choked on the bared emotions and the wonderment of people seeing deep space for the first time&quot; The Guardian, John Vidal on STELLA'S performed reading in May 2012. \n\nOur tour includes Greenwich Theatre, The Old Market in Brighton, The Mill at Guildford's Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, The Rose Kingston, BT Studio at Oxford Playhouse and Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough. At present, we are touring to eleven venues, with an expected total of twenty performances and an audience total of 2,320. \n\nHowever if funding is achieved from the STFC, we will be able to expand STELLA'S tour considerably; we hope to play at least two festivals this Summer and already have strong interest from theatres for the Autumn.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000229/1","grantId":"ST/L000229/1","fundValue":"11530","fundStart":"2013-04-29","fundEnd":"2013-06-19","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Siobhan Mary Rose  Nicholas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Take the Space","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
