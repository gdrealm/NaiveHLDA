Leading researchers and students at the beginning of their careers will be able to meet and benefit from the exchange of scientific ideas, leading to new research developments in areas as diverse as efficient computer network simulation and targeted design of drugs with attendant benefits for human and animal health. Despite addressing different application areas the scientists involved use similar mathematical methods deploying stochastic simulation and differential equations. This event provides a unique opportunity for crossover and cross-fertilisation of research ideas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013361/1","grantId":"EP/F013361/1","fundValue":"20432","fundStart":"2007-09-16","fundEnd":"2008-02-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The joint meeting of QEST and CMSB served the UK academic community by providing a unique scientific occasion for a gathering of participants from the computer science and systems biology communities. Given the wide range of topics encompassed by the joint meeting, we noted a high level of interest from the quantitative methods communities, and additional interest from those interested in other aspects of the biology/computer science interface.\n\nBeneficiaries: The event proved to be particularl  ","person":"Stephen  Gilmore","coPersons":["Jane  Hillston"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
