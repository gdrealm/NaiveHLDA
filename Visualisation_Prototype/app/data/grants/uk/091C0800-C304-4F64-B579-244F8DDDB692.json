Well known symptoms include hearing voices or other hallucinations. These symptoms can be treated, to some extent, with existing medicines. But there are other problems: patients have disorganized, slow thinking; they have poor concentration, and poor memory. This means that patients with schizophrenia often cannot organize their everyday lives. Drugs that would improve the thinking and memory abilities of patients are much needed. To invent new drugs requires understanding the brain circuits needed for thinking and memory. We and other researchers believe that a specific type of brain cell has gone wrong in schizophrenia, and that these cells are not wired up properly. This type of cell usually says no to other cells. But more than just saying no, these are master command cells; they say no to many thousands of other brain cells all at once. Patients with schizophrenia may have faulty command cells that do not properly say no. Using genetically altered mice, we plan to model and study the master brain cells and learn how they work. We hope that our research will one day lead to better drugs that help patients improve their memory and thinking.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601498","grantId":"G0601498","fundValue":"463162","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Wisden","coPersons":["Peer  Wulff"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
