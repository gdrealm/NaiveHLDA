{"id":"F9B3F50D-1C76-4AE3-95C9-390D4B2DD034","title":"Motherhoods, Markets and Consumption","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this series of six one-day seminars was to develop a network of established scholars, career young researchers and users working on, and interested in, the intersections between Motherhoods, Markets and Consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars were supported by a website, a mailing list and email announcements targeted at various list-serves. Because the theme of the series throws up a diverse range of social, cultural and political questions, we explicitly set out and accomplished to engage researchers working in disciplinary fields in the social sciences, the arts and humanities, and the sciences. Our discussions were also informed by cross-cultural insights, thus enabling us to think about how cultural diversity informs the social and cultural life of contemporary families.</p>\n\n<p>Career young researchers were actively stimulated to partake in the seminar activities in practical and intellectual ways, by active inclusion in debate, networking and through participation in a post-graduate colloquium. Users from GOs, NGOs and the private sector participated as audience and speakers, and are currently contributing towards different dissemination activities. Work achieved during the seminar series is now finding a way into journal publication, an edited book and the website will be converted into an archive.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0517","grantId":"RES-451-26-0517","fundValue":"18564","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pauline  Maclaran","coPersons":["Stephanie  O'Donohoe","Lorna  Stevens","Lydia  Martens","Margaret Kathleen Hogg","Linda Marie Scott"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
