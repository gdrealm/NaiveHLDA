The network included theoretical linguists on the one hand, and experimental and developmental psychologists and computer scientists on the other. All disciplines gained from sharing theoretical and empirical paradigms. For example, linguists benefited from robust data that can decide which theoretical account is correct in cases where the evidence cannot be decided by intuition and reflective introspection. Similarly, psychologists of language benefited from having new linguistic phenomena to study, and fine-grained theories to account for them, as provided by linguists.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the network funded two kinds of activities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>participation in prestigious international conferences that would give early-career researchers the opportunity to present their work, receive feedback, and networking opportunities</li>\n\n <li>linking formally with the pan-European Euro-XPrag network, and helping UK-based early-career researchers to attend academic events organised by Euro-XPrag</li>\n\n <li>creating an electronic portal that informed the wider academic community of advances in the area of experimental pragmatics, with particular emphasis on UK-based activities by early career researchers.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H008039/1","grantId":"ES/H008039/1","fundValue":"29716","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Napoleon  Katsos","coPersons":["Richard  Breheny","Nausika  Pouscoulous"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
