Quantitative data suggests that levels of violence against teachers are on the increase but little is known about the affect that this violence is having on the daily work life of teachers. </p> \n<p>The research plans to fulfil a number of aims, such as establishing the extent of violence occurring among teachers and examining what types of ‘violent’ incidents they experience including verbal and physical attacks. It will identify the concerns that teachers have about the risks they face in the day to day role and how it affects them. It will also examine how schools and dealing with these issues. What polices and strategies are in place to help teachers who experience violence and examine teachers views about recent attempts by the government to change discipline policies within education. This will be achieved using, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups in schools in North London and Hertfordshire. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E009530/1","grantId":"ES/E009530/1","fundValue":"79357","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Denise  Martin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
