{"id":"C174FF89-815A-4ECA-97EE-9594C8EC984A","title":"MIXED LUBRICATION, WEAR AND CONTACT FATIGUE OF ROUGH SURFACES","abstractText":"Full-film hydrodynamic lubrication is an ideal which is rarely achieved in practice. In most practical rolling/sliding contacts such as those in gears, bearings and replacement human joints the roughness of the surfaces plays an important part in their lubrication, wear and surface fatigue. In gears, for example, the combined roughness of even the best quality ground surfaces is usually of the order of the oil film which can be generated hydrodynamically. A similar situation occurs in roller bearings at low speed or high temperature and in replacement human joints because of the low effective viscosity of the lubricant. This leads to a lubrication regime which has been loosely described as mixed (meaning a mixture of hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication), or more specifically as micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (micro-EHL) in which high ripple pressures occur and colliding asperities on the two surfaces act as individual, transient elastohydrodynamic/solid contact encounters. This project addresses two important engineering consequences of mixed lubrication: (1) mild wear/wear particle generation, and (2) near-surface rolling contact fatigue/micropitting. Much progress has been made in numerical modelling of micro-EHL, but such analyses, if they are to be of practical use, must now be developed to include the detailed behaviour of solid contact events in terms of a wear model. The project will therefore produce an analysis of contact duration, traction, adhesion, flash temperatures and particle removal. The second major development required, in order to advance the study of near-surface distress due to fatigue, is the effect of initial plastic deformation of asperities during the crucial running-in phase when machine surfaces are brought into heavy contact for the first time. This will include a detailed treatment of plastic deformation, permanent set and residual stress field of asperity features.Our specific objectives are to:1. Develop a consistent mixed hydrodynamic/solid contact treatment for real surfaces which includes the detailed modelling of transient dry asperity contacts.2. Develop a model of mild wear particle generation based on the detailed friction, adhesion, deformation and temperatures occurring at transient contacts.3. Produce a model of near-surface fatigue, relevant to the phenomenon of micropitting and rolling contact fatigue, which includes the permanent set and residual stress field obtained from elastic/plastic contact analysis.4. Carry out controlled experiments under realistic engineering load and speed conditions to validate each of these modelling developments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G06024X/1","grantId":"EP/G06024X/1","fundValue":"423043","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"R W  Snidle","coPersons":["H P  Evans"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" The technical outputs from the project are described in detail in the journal and conference papers listed. Further papers which flow from the work are in preparation and these will be added to ROS for this grant as they appear. The main findings of the work are summarized as follows.\n\n\n\nThe overriding aim of the work has been to develop a better understanding of the phenomenon of micropitting which is a serious form of surface distress in gears currently used in wind turbine gearboxes.\n\n\n\nA robust new and unique fully-coupled elastohydrodynamic solver for the analysis of rough surfaces under micro-elastohydrodynamic and mixed lubrication conditions has been developed for application to the real tooth contact conditions in transmission gears.\n\n\n\nThe solver predicts the time-varying pressure loading of tooth surfaces and using these data it has then been possible to carry out simulations of the fatigue damage accumulation in representative volumes of the two tooth surfaces in rolling/sliding contact.\n\n\n\nFatigue analysis reveals shallow zones of high predicted damage which is consistent with the observed appearance of micropitting wear in gears.\n\n\n\nFatigue damage predictions have been compared to actual micropitting performance in experiments carried out on gears by our colleagues at Newcastle University. These comparisons explain the different micropitting performance of gears prepared by two different grinding processes (generator and form grinding).\n\n\n\nDuring the project new avenues of research related to the micropitting problem have been developed. The issue of the residual surface stress field set up during the crucial &quot;running-in&quot; phase of gears, and its effect on subsequent fatigue behaviour, has been investigated by carrying out simulations of elastic/plastic contact of gear tooth surfaces using both finite element and semi-analytical techniques. Using these techniques it is now possible to incorporate the resulting residual stress and deformation fields in the lubricated contact/fatigue damage simulations.\n\n\n\nExperimental work aimed at understanding mixed friction in gear contacts has progressed following extensive modifications to a two-disc rig. Results of this work will appear in the near future. The value of the research is its contribution to the reliability of gears in transmissions such as those in aerospace and wind turbines. In this respect the work should be of interest to the non-academic community from the point of view of safe transport and reliable energy supply. The research has and will be exploited principally by the gearing industry. This has been assured by our participation in an ongoing British Gear Association (BGA) research project on &quot;Understanding Micropitting&quot;. Regular 3-monthly meetings with industrial members of the BGA project ensure that exploitation will occur. \n\n\n\nThe research leads to a much greater awareness of the role of surface finish in determining the fatigue performance of gear teeth and this will definitely influence the way gear manufacturers control finish in the future. \n\n\n\nIt is expected that the findings on the mechanism of running in of surfaces will also encourage greater use of supplementary finishing following grinding to ensure the minimum degree of plastic deformation during the initial running in phase of gears during which damage may occur and be the initiator of micropitting.\n\n\n\nA very important application where exploitation will take place is that of wind turbines which currently suffer from micropitting of the main power transmission gears. We have been invited to two meetings at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in USA during the period of the grant to contribute our expertise to solving this specific problem, and this collaboration will continue.\n\n\n\nFurther exploitation will occur as a result of a recent agreement with NASA Glenn Research Centre for joint work on aerospace gears whereby one of our research students will spend periods at NASA as part of his project on gear durability.
