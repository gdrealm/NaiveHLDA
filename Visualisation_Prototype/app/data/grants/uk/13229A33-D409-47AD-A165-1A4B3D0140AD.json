{"id":"13229A33-D409-47AD-A165-1A4B3D0140AD","title":"EPSRC High Value Manufacturing Catapult Fellowship Centre","abstractText":"This proposal aims to establish a pioneering EPSRC High Value Manufacturing Catapult Fellowship Centre, with the purpose of serving the UK's advanced manufacturing research community in selection, creation, management and growing a network of about 16 flexible term academic Fellowships spread across the seven HVM Catapult Centres (HVMC). These Fellowships will open new gates for all UK based academics to engage with the Catapult centres, and help implant new scientific ideas into the rich manufacturing base. EPSRC HVMC Fellowships would differ from the standard EPSRC fellowship schemes by offering a unique knowledge exchange network between the academia and the industry, through High Value Manufacturing Catapult centres. \n\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is uniquely positioned to lead and coordinate the centre's activities, with two well-established academic HVM Catapult Centres, AMRC with Boeing and Nuclear AMRC offering their groundbreaking model and experience in engaging academics with a strong industrial partnership base. The centre will be supported by all seven HVM Catapult Centres, and HVMC Chief Technology Officers will form the Steering Committee of the centre, and a part of EPSRC HVMC FC Forum. The fellowships will enable academic staff to spend 6-month research visits in either one or more HVM Catapult centres spread flexibly between 1-4 years. \n\nThe establishment of EPSRC HVMC FC will be strongly aligned with the following aspects of the EPSRC strategy:\n\n- Key cross-cutting objective of Manufacturing the Future Challenge theme for 2011-2015 is to work in the UK Innovation Landscape by having joint strategy and investments with other key agencies in research funding and policy, and\n- Key strategic goal for EPSRC for 2011-2015 is to deliver impact. HVM Catapults are ideally positioned to accelerate the implementation of university-led innovations and to promptly bridge current industrial needs with novel scientific knowledge.\n\nIn addition, a closer engagement of the UK academics with industrially led research centres will shape their novel research concepts into applicable technologies throughout high-value manufacturing sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L017121/1","grantId":"EP/L017121/1","fundValue":"995080","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Samuel TurnerAlma  Hodzic","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
