{"id":"FF25C42A-EAFF-491D-A7E8-2ECCC748BA4B","title":"COMMERCIALISATION OF SATELLITE-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION DATA FOR LONG TERM DISASTER RECOVERY","abstractText":"The commercial opportunity being pursued through follow-on funding is bringing to the market a new class of systematic and independent monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data that meets the need of the key stake holders such as the national governments, international donors and NGOs. The proposed follow on project will use the outcomes of EPSRC project 'Indicators for Measuring, Monitoring and Evaluating Post-Disaster Recovery' (EP/F015232/1), where a suite of twelve Performance Indicators spanning core recovery sectors were extracted from high-resolution satellite imagery. The prototype M&amp;E datasets resulted from pilot testing the recovery performance indicators in the cities of Ban Nam Khem, Thailand after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and Muzaffarabad, Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake. The Recovery Project Team delivered the following research outcomes: (1) a transferrable methodology for monitoring and evaluating post-disaster recovery using satellites; and (2) a range of data representations, e.g. GIS maps, graphs, bar charts, tables for displaying the recovery information. The main objective of the follow on project is to: (1) identifying and developing database structures and data packages that suit the needs of aid agencies with different geographic foci and scales of operation; and (2) identifying and developing delivery protocols that suit the workflow of aid agencies, taking into account the fact that different data in different forms are required at different operational stages. These aims will be achieved by engaging the end user community to robustly test the prototype indicators within operational situations, and thereby fine-tuning them into a commercial M&amp;E data offering.Monitoring and evaluating (M&amp;E) progress made on the ground is a fundamental requirement for aid projects that provide assistance to long term recovery. An investment in data that enables donors to provide accountability to stakeholders will allow more efficient agency intervention. It will ultimately improve project outcomes by impartially assessing whether objectives are being met at key stages during the lifetime of a project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028609/1","grantId":"EP/I028609/1","fundValue":"139538","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Hector RamageTORWONG  CHENVIDYAKARN","coPersons":["Keiko  Saito"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
