Face matching of unfamiliar people is surprisingly inaccurate, so it is important to identify methods to improve it. We will test a cross-section of the public to identify people particularly skilled at face matching. We will then observe how they compare faces, recording the eye movements they make, and ask them about the strategies they use.</p>\n\n<p>Training will be developed which includes both explicit strategies to be used and implicit training through “oculomotor demonstration”, which involves showing the trainee a dynamic mapping of an expert’s gaze mapped onto the faces being inspected. Previous research in other perceptual tasks has suggested that oculomotor demonstration can improve the rate of learning. The effectiveness of this simple technique may be because people innately attend to other people's gaze to understand what in the environment those other people consider important. We will test whether such training is more effective than previously developed training and whether the effects last for up to one month.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J002925/1","grantId":"ES/J002925/1","fundValue":"49256","fundStart":"2012-08-28","fundEnd":"2013-08-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project consisted of the development of a face-matching skill test, efforts to find differences between skilled and unskilled face-matchers, and an evaluation of three methods for training face matching. One of the training methods was specifically targeted, as it was a new method that involved having trainees observe the way a skilled matcher inspected faces. The trainees were shown where the matcher fixated on the images of the face-pairs in the training stimuli. It was hoped that this observation would be a form of implicit training. By the end of the funding period, the project found no strong evidence that the new method was better than the other methods. There was, however, some promising weak evidence that in some limited cases it would be better. For full understanding of these cases, our research is continuing even today. \n\nThere has been no societal or economic impact of the project, because the training method was not particularly effective.  ","person":"Anne Patricia Hillstrom","coPersons":["Lorraine  Hope","James Douglas Sauer"],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":" FINDING 1: The core scientific impact was that, contrary to previous work in related fields, modelling good inspection behaviour (i.e., showing the eye movements of skilled matchers) is not necessarily a better training method than those previously used. Inspection modelling is no better or worse than other training methods. This is of interest because (a) we believe this is the first test of the method that tried to improve performance on a task that was already practiced by observers, (b) this is one of the first tests of the method that trained with one set of stimuli and tested with another set of stimuli (and hence our evaluation of the training method was more rigorous than most past evaluations), and (c) there is to date no particularly effective method to train face matching whereas there are many jobs in which it would be helpful to have an effective training method. \n\nFINDING 2: We found some evidence that for a set of face-pairs that was relatively easy to judge, inspection modelling improved performance better than the other training methods, and that the improvements generalised to other relatively easy matching trials and endured for at least three weeks. This finding needs to be replicated because of weaknesses in the evidence.\n\nFINDING 3: We have developed a test that is unusual and useful in that faces differ considerably in terms of superficial characteristics and documented age. \n\nFINDING 4: We learned that accuracy in matching faces does not vary consistently with the difference in age between the faces. Our stimulus set was small enough that this will require replication, but there was no hint of an effect of age difference on matching accuracy. \n\nFINDING 5: We replicated some previous findings about differences between experts and novices in the way they do their work (experts thought longer before starting to inspect) and in their confidence about their behaviour (experts were more aware of whether they were accurate). The principle way to take our results forward is to continue pursuing ways to train face-matching. The method we were keen to test - modelling of inspection - needs to be tested more rigorously by lengthening the amount of training and by giving feedback to people about their accuracy. The most promising result (successful training of relatively easy comparisons) needs replication. If it proves reliable, we need to understand why the training method worked for easier comparisons but not for more difficult comparisons. \n\nIf modelling of inspection is unsuccessful for face-matching, after this extension of research, it is worth pursuing why the method works for other tasks but not for this one.\n\nOutside of academia, there are many sectors that need to check people's identities by comparing two photographic identifications or comparing one photographic identification with a live person. These sectors are identified in the next question. Once a successful training method is identified, it should be conveyed to all of these sectors.
