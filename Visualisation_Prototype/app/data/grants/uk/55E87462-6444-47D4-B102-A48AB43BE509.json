For example, when combining two independent pieces of written evidence that point toward the same conclusion, people are often no more convinced than with a single pieces of evidence alone. However, this effect depends on the details of how the evidence is presented: if the same evidence is given in a perceptual task, then people are more convinced by the additional piece of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>This work will investigate the differences between cognitive and perceptual tasks of information integration, in order to develop a unified understanding of what drives people to combine information correctly or incorrectly. A variety of tasks will be explored using a common set of stimuli and manipulations in order to determine whether the change in combination rules are due to the cognitive or perceptual nature of the stimuli, more experience with the perceptual task, or participants having particular assumptions about how the information arises. In addition to evidence combination, these tasks will be used to explore how people combine risk and reward and how they combine probabilities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004948/1","grantId":"ES/K004948/1","fundValue":"272819","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2016-09-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have just finished the first year of a three-year project, and we have accomplished the impact we expected to accomplish at this stage. Currently our impact has been the education of participants in our experiments about the decision-making fallacies we are studying.

","person":"Adam  Sanborn","coPersons":["Neil  Stewart"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" We have just finished the first year of a three-year project and are on track with our research plan. We have initial findings that indicate that people show more complexity in their decision making than researchers commonly assume. Investigations into simple decision-making paradigms find that behaviour is often best accounted for by simple rules of thumb. In the case of information integration, tasks in which people need to combine two sources of information such as the evidence given by two eyewitnesses, the most commonly cited rule of thumb is averaging of information together. This combination rule is inappropriate in many situations.\n\nWe have examined in detail two tasks for which evidence of an averaging rule has been found. While overall trends show support for combining information through averaging, a closer look shows that participants display much more complex behaviour. They show trial-to-trial variability that is consistent with flexibly using a set of combination rules, some of which are quite complex. \n\nWe will continue this research project by further investigating the combination rules that people use and using this knowledge to identify the tasks that encourage people to make better decisions. We have just finished the first year of a three-year project, so we have not yet put our findings in a position to be used by others. As our project develops, we expect that our findings would be of use to a broad range of fields concerned with decision-making. One of the effects we are studying, the dilution effect, has been directly implicated as a source of poor decisions in law and accountancy. Another of the effects, the conjunction fallacy, has been directly implicated in poor gambling decisions. We anticipate that by better identifying interventions that can improve decision making in these areas, that the government, professional organisations, and charities can use this information to promote better decision making in these areas.
