While this view of caste has been significantly revised by recent scholarship (reincorporating power, politics and colonial influences), religion is still central to strategies of protest and claims to equality. Historically, religious action against caste subordination took the form of conversion to non-Hindu religions, especially Christianity. Today, a large proportion of India's 25 million Christians are ex-untouchables or Dalits, many living in India's southern states. The question this research asks is: what today is the significance of religious identity among south Indian Dalits, and what is the role of Christianity (its thinkers, social activists, movement leaders, and international networks) in the articulation of alternative Dalit identities and in new forms of socio-political mobilisation?\\n\\nThis question requires the examination of three interrelated processes: (1) the 'dalitization' of the Christian churches, (2) the rise of Hindu nationalism, and (3) the spread of international human rights discourse. Investigation into these ideologies (theologies), institutions and social movements is matched by field research into the village-level processes through which ordinary people engage with them, and on the subjective experience of caste discrimination, religious vocation and social activism among Dalit priests and the religious\\n\\n(1) It took decades for the demographics of the Christian churches (a large Dalit majority) to be expressed theologically and institutionally; but from the late-1980s, Christianity was a context for articulating Dalit rights, a new religious politics and Dalit theology, which honoured an 'outcaste culture'. This collaborative research examines how the churches generated Dalit protest and produced cultural resources for social change -- theologies, arts, political ideologies, or social movements -- which have had an important influence on wider Dalit politics. It focuses on the Catholic Church and Jesuits who have been a source of innovation and reaction in Tamil society for 400 years. \\n\\n(2) Christian Dalit activism takes place in a largely Hindu society and amidst the rise of Hindu nationalism which vilifies the Christian minority as colonial, foreign and anti-national, interpreting resistance from the margins (from Dalits or tribals) as 'Christian aggression' arising from internationally planned proselytism. Is the Church's affirmation of its social base (and political support) in subordinated groups a response to this threat? What (in different interpretations) is the relationship between the church and secular Dalit politics?\\n\\n(3) Making the church Dalit also internationalised Dalit issues, linking caste discrimination to a UN discourse on racism and human rights. This raises questions about the effect of a new discourse of Dalit human rights (and rights-based approaches to disadvantage) in re-connecting religion and development. As Dalit Christians turned Liberation Theology into Dalit Theology, European donor NGOs began to re-frame development objectives in terms of Dalit rights. This research examines the consequence of NGOs drawing the identity politics of caste and religion into development\\n\\nThe linked processes of Dalit politics, Hindu nationalism, and NGO discourse on human rights come together in the everyday experience of Tamil villages. Taking advantage of a re-visit to the multi-caste religiously plural locality that was the site of field research in 1982-4, changes in religious and caste identities (and their interaction) are examined over 25 years; asking how the potential for violent polarization of people on the basis of caste and religion is locally diffused in socially and religiously divided communities.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F007523/1","grantId":"AH/F007523/1","fundValue":"81229","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Apart from its research outputs, the project has forged a productive relationship with Jesuit scholar and dalit activist Co-researcher Fr Selvaraj Arulnathan (SJ).

But understanding how even one tradition of Christianity has become part of modern emancipatory projects involves a long and intricate history that bring out of contradictory trends, and an ethnographic depth that refuses simple or facile explanations based on notions of trans-historical Christian universalism.\nAsking about the role of religion in social transformation raises what turns out to be one of the most important issues of this research, namely the conditions under which ‘religion’ itself came to be a significant category of action (separate from politics and culture) in south India. The account here begins not, as usual, with the colonial transmission of western ideas of ‘religion’ along with Protestant missions, but with an older pre-colonial Jesuit mission encounter in the early 17th century. (It becomes clear that Jesuit ‘religion’ produced the secular — the realm of caste, politics and culture — even before the colonial secular produced religion as we understand it today). The research then traverses a four-century history which leads, by way of significant colonial and postcolonial transformations (and unexpected turns), to contemporary Dalit activism and politics. It became clear that while the separation of ‘the religious’ and ‘the civil’ (or cultural) first allowed Jesuits to accommodate Christianity to caste hierarchy, the later expansion of a domain of ‘Christian religion’ apart from caste created the space for Dalit political action in south India, long before civic or constitutional rights became the basis of Dalit public action. \nAlong the way this research offeres significant insights into, inter alia: the historical production of categories of ‘religion’ and ‘culture;’ religious gifting and the organisation of precolonial Tamil plains; the impact of Jesuit thought on western scholarship on India (the incorporation of Brahmanical conceptions of ‘traditional’ India as the basis of Orientalist scholarship, colonial administration and later anthropological writing); the mutual influence of Tamil religiosity and popular Catholicism; the social and semiotic effects of Christianity; alternative theories of caste; the importance of saint festivals to the political mobilisation of Dalits; the roots of contemporary dalit activism; the emergence and polarisation of religious identity under the influence of Hindu nationalism and Pentecostal fundamentalism; or the local defusion of potential caste and religious conflict and violence.\nApart from its research outputs, the project has forged a productive relationship with Jesuit scholar and dalit activist Co-researcher Fr Selvaraj Arulnathan (SJ). As well as contributing to my understanding of contemporary Dalit activism and adding experiential and biographical depth to it, Fr Selvaraj has himself produced a series of research outputs (including a PhD thesis) on contemporary Dalit activism and offered a comparative field-based ‘empirical philosophy’ of Black activism in the United States This work has been shaped by our interactions. Following this research collaboration, Fr Arulnathan has been appointed as Head of the Dalit Unit at the Indian Social Institute (New Delhi) from where he has begun significant initiatives in support of research and Dalit activism. Our collaboration involves on-going reflection on religious action and Dalit rights campaigning.\nAmong the findings of this research project are the following:\nThe separation of ‘religion’ and ‘culture’: The south Indian Jesuit mission in the early 17th century introduced a tripartite distinction between true faith, idolatry and a residual sphere of ‘culture.’ This arose from the requirement that indigenous (Tamil) social life be parsed into the civil (or cultural) that could be joined to Christian faith, and the idolatrous that had to be rejected. This also involved a dual ‘semiotic ideology’ (Keane 2007). In the realm of ‘culture’ signs and referents were separable, so that Christian meanings could be given to exiting signs, whereas in idolatry they were indexically fused. These distinctions would have enormous significance: first, in allowing missionary experiments in signification and the ‘accommodation’ of Christianity to existing semiotic and social forms (especially caste hierarchy), and second, in secularising caste order so as to in-build negotiability, change and eventually cultural critique. These twin effects would unfold over 300 years. \nChristian reproduction of indigenous orders: Missionary Christianity is often regarded as a modernising force disrupting existing social and representational systems. But the Jesuit tradition which would in the late 20th century become a source of Dalit radicalism, cultural critique and social movements, first developed by becoming a part of, and reproducing, Tamil socio-political and religious systems. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the structure of mission was preceded by syncretic saint cults (one of which has been examined in detail) located within regional sacred geographies. Incorporated into the mission structure and patronised by Hindu kings, Catholic saints were the focus of public worship that took Tamil temple form. Worshipped as royal personages and protectors in their royal seats or kovils (Tam: temple), saints were a focus for elaborate systems of service, gift and honours which articulated caste orders, economic rights and political connections. Later, under conditions of colonial rule and competition (with Padroado and Protestant missions), Jesuits oversaw further elaboration of schemes of ranked caste (an effect usually attributed to British administrative interventions such as the censuses or systems of recruitment, Dirks 2001). Up until the late 20th century, social power was produced locally through Catholicism which provided a ritual mechanism for the ‘fabrication’ of rural caste orders. Emphatically, caste was not a Hindu religious institution, but could take Catholic form. Moreover, Jesuits secured jurisdiction over parishes and the affiliation of diverse castes of Catholics at the expense of the systematic subordination and exclusion of their ‘untouchable’ (Dalit) converts.\nReligious co-existence rooted in the organisation of popular religiosity: A popular Catholic imaginary and practice was produced through a combination of inference from missionary teaching and Tamil forms of religiosity. The popular Catholicism described in tei project is a dynamic social field not a stable synthesis. In this, the exclusionary demands of missionary Christianity are negotiated, sometimes ‘doubled and disturbed’ (Bhabha 1994) in mimetic forms, and made socially viable in terms of relationships of caste and across religion, so as not to demonise the gods of one’s neighbours. The research has examined closely the distinctive modes of cultural invention (the conception of divinity and separation of ritual spaces) through which this is accomplished, and which lay the foundation for religious co-existence over two centuries\nThe social and semiotic effect of Christianity: While reproducing forms of social power and religiosity, Jesuits brought distinctive Christian elements which (often in combination with other historically specific factors) contributed to changing social orders and establishing the conditions for radical change. Among the traceable social effects:\n• Catholics produced more universal and deterritorialised forms of caste belonging;\n• a Christian ‘secularisation’ of caste placed limits on the naturalisation of inequality, and made caste a more clearly public and political institution more about power than person, or a matter of public display and so subject to public contest and negotiation. Christianity introduced a relativizing (against transcendent truth) self-distancing, sociological awareness into social forms in Tamil villages. \n• Christianity had semiotic effects with important implications. Catholic religion taught that the actor and the act, caste and occupation, substance and code were separable, and introduced a sharp distinction between individual sin and other life effects (impurity, ‘bad time,’ inauspiciousness) in a manner that contrasts recent ethnographies of Hindu caste. Converts thus strained way from the ‘indexical contiguities’ (emphasised in these ethnographies) which merge the moral and the material. Thus the exchange of substances (ie matters of purity and pollution) was unimportant to the making of moral persons. Two things followed: first, while Tamil Catholics retain socially significant caste-dividing ritual structures at life-transition and other rituals, these are hollowed out of specific meanings; second, Christians are shown to have acquired capacities for symbolic manipulation which make ritual meanings negotiable or introduce new interpretations. This latter is of particular importance to Dalits: \no Dalits participating in church sacraments were more able to treat exclusion as polluted persons as arbitrary and symbolic of their inferiorisation as labourers and servants rather than substantially connected to or an index of their persons;\no the capacity for symbolic manipulation underlies village level re-negotations in the context of servitude, as well as a contemporary Dalit cultural politics, Dalit theology and Dalit anthropology that honours and outcaste culture in public celebrations of Dalit arts of liberation.\nDefusing the radical implications of Christian conversion: For long periods (in fact, two centuries) the potentially socially disjunctive influences of Christianity did not effect social changes for Dalits. This was not only because of continuing unequal relations of power, but also because of cultural mechanisms of reconciliation between Christian universalism and particularistic caste and religious practice. Christianity was organised by Jesuits as a ‘religion apart.’ Caste was secularised in order that it could be accommodated to Christianity (preserving the social prestige of Christianity in Indian society without provoking sanction from the Church hierarchy). Until comparatively recently, Jesuit adaptations were so as to prepare the basis for Tamils to engage with Catholic religion beyond the social (explicitly adopting a Brahmanical model of devotional religion in relation to continuing social obligations). This produced a ‘dual moral world’ and separated contexts of, on the one hand, participating in Catholic religion and, on the other, a Tamil ‘being in the world’ (Daniel 2000). Even in the 1980s, this separation ran through everyday Tamil Catholic life protecting the Christian space from both syncretic merging and social challenge.\nThe creation of an historically contingent domain of Catholic religion: The Jesuit mission under colonialism turned ‘outworldly’ Christianity (modelled on the devotional sect) into a Catholic religious domain and ecclesiastical power. ‘Catholic religion’ in this sense was the achievement of missionization not its premise. It was the outcome of historical processes that have to be traced, including the purification of categories and fields of action. It was Jesuit operations within existing orders that produced this ecclesiastical domain. Jesuit command of ‘Catholic religion’ was the outcome of contests with kings, village heads caste groups and displayed in idioms of kingship and rule. By the 1930s these contests had turned kovils (centre points of various rights and honours) into churches (ecclesiastical domains), village festivals into Catholic devotions from which Hindus and caste honours were progressively eliminated. \nCatholic religion and Dalit political space: The shifting boundary between ‘religion’ and ‘culture,’ and the consolidation of an ecclesiastical domain of Catholic religion (progressively disembedded from village institutions), opened a political space for Dalits in the 20th century in which social rights and honours could be claimed as Christians. The research shows how saint festivals were crucibles of Dalit politics through which Dalits acquired widened networks and organisational skills long before public protest over civic rights and public access in the 1960s . Tracing the historical experience of different Dalit castes in the same locality, the research shows how Protestant Christianity offered a parallel but quite different basis for Dalits to contend with subordination and to develop a ‘capacity to aspire’ (Appadurai 2004). It also traces the inter-relationship between post-Independence political and especially economic change (1960s-80s) and the cultural effects of Christianity in order to demonstrate the significant, but never independent, contribution of religion to specific social change.\n‘Caste Hindu’ vs ‘Dalit Christian’— the discursive construction of caste as ‘Hindu’ and a new politics of Christianity: In the 1990s different streams of Dalit Christian experience were brought together with other Dalit cultural movements and intellectual currents, including Dr B.R.Ambedkar’s wider vision and his turn to Buddhism, and a revival of interest in the Dravidian and Tamil Dalit leaders who in the early 20th century contended with Indian nationalism. The cultural politics of this Dalit ‘renaissance’ initially enhanced the significance of Christianity by conceiving caste specifically as a Brahmanic Hindu institution and religious conversion as an idiom of protest against a civilization and a state increasingly defined by its democratic majority as ‘Hindu.’ This was a new ideological departure, but it introduced a disjuncture within Dalit movements between the discursive framing of caste (as Brahmanic religion) and the social experience of caste (as agrarian domination).\nA rising Hindu nationalist steam in Indian politics in the 1990s moved the conception of Christianity contained in the opposition of Dalit Christian vs Caste Hindu still further in this direction. Politically influential Hindu organisations conceived of Christianity as their anti-national threatening ‘other,’ provoking, anti-conversion legislative initiatives alongside anti-Christian violence. In the Tamil south, however, religious politics reverted to the caste politics in which it was rooted. The protest against the anti-conversion laws took the form of Dalit movement-led demonstrations underlining the importance of conversion as an idiom of resistance within a Dalit political agenda, rather than as the Christian minority resistance to the Hindutva threat. \nChristian resources for Dalit politics: Even though Tamil Dalit movements did not produce ‘Christian’ or ‘Dalit Christian’ as a focal political identity, Christian institutions (seminaries, NGOs, training centres) nonetheless provided the organisational and pedagogical resources, the mass mobilization and the ideological, theological and cultural work that underpinned a Dalit renaissance. \nPersisting discrimination (not Christian ethics) the driver of social action: The Catholic Church was itself central to the rise of Tamil Dalit movements; but not because of its Christian critique of Hindu caste society. Rather it was a persisting contradiction between the Churches universal ethics and caste particularism — its ‘dual morality’ — that broke out into a radical movement for Dalit Christian liberation among its angry and humiliated Dalit members and priesthood led by Dalit Jesuits. More widely too, it was the enduring experience of Dalitness rather than of Christianity that has driven both social movements, cultural innovation within the churches. It was the dynamic politics of caste in the Church (not Christian castelessness) that made it a crucible for a stream of Dalit activism that has been powerfully influential on the wider Dalit movement in the state (expressed in religion, social movements, cultural invention, dalit NGOs and networks, and increasingly party politics).\nDalitness has become definitive of Indian Christianity. The route to universal Christian truth today has to pass through the suffering and ‘brokenness’ of the Dalits (despite attempts by some Church leaders interviewed to return caste to the realm of the secular and protect the Christian spiritual). Any Christian theology of transcendence that ignores this reality — including earlier Sanskritic Hindu-Christian dialogue — has become deeply suspect. \nChristian cultural politics of Dalitness. As Dalitness was centralised in theology, Christian centres and agencies began to produce a distinctive ‘Dalit culture,’ celebrated for instance in festivals of Dalit arts, or expressed actively in struggles over land or other resources. This culture making, drawing on a Christian emphasis on the manipulation of symbolic meaning, is shaped by exercises in re-signification, symbolic reversal (forgetting and remembering) applied, for example to formerly stigmatised drumming, dance forms or beef-eating. But such cultural production has its limitations. On the one hand, activists point out the futility of celebrating dalit drumming and dance moves on the stage when the same actions still enact their subordination in villages — re-signification is a matter of power. On the other hand, Dalit culture ‘produced’ by Christians faces the question: whose culture is this, as different dalit castes compete to occupy the ‘liberative’ but now contested space of ‘Dalit.’ Intellectuals from some groups with their own ideological projects turn the key role of Christianity back on itself, claiming that it is the dominant Christian Paraiyar (caste) traditions that are made definitive of the space such that dalit culture is Paraiyar culture, dalit art is Paraiyar art, even that Christianity is Paraiyar religion.\nShifting centre of Dalit activism from Christian dalits to Dalit political parties. Churches (Catholic and Protestant) are engaged in a complex cultural politics, but the centre of Dalit political struggles has shifted to emerging Dalit political parties (prominently the Liberation Panthers) which now draw to their fold Christian dalit activists from NGOs and movements. This leaves several dalit Jesuit leaders disillusioned by the compromising, pragmatic, fissiparious logic of electoral politics that marginalises untouchability as a critical issue, and instead turns instead to electorally tactical inclusive ideologies such as Tamil nationionalism.\nInternationalising Dalit rights: If Dalit Christian liberation is provincialized into complex Tamil caste politics, Dalit Christians themselves are now prominent in ‘globalizing’ dalit interests through scale-jumping participation in international fora including those that place caste within a UN discourse on racism, slavery and human rights. Being Christian and participating in the universalist language of Christianity allowed collaboration with other universalist languages in politics or human rights within which caste discrimination could be understood; and acted upon given the institutional structures and audiences offered by global Christianity. This, of course, has provoked resistance, not only from Hindu organisations who delegitimize Dalit campaigns against ‘Indian racism’ as Christian aggression, western proselytism and cultural appropriation; but also from the Indian state which resists the internationalisation of the ‘internal’ matter of caste through alignment with discourses of race or human rights. In both cases, Dalit Christians acquire publicity and symbolic importance as India negotiates is cultural representation in a global space still dominated by the Christian United States.\nHow do these broad trends in activism and Christianity impinge upon Tamil village communities divided by caste and religion? A return visit in 2009 to such a Tamil village first studied in 1982-4 helped draw some key conclusions:\no While Christianity is ‘Dalitized’ in the seminary, it appears ‘globalised’ in the village. Christian practice is disembedded from structures of caste, and diversified into religious styles reflecting various streams of global Christianity, whether Catholic or Pentecostal. \no While now more universal, separate and in principle ‘othering’ of Hinduism, Christianity is not however to any greater extent the basis of social identity or division (even if communalist connections and discourses are manipulated in local disputes). The ‘grid’ of caste allows a certain freedom from the social implications of religious polarisation. Research again confirms that Christianity has been a means to negotiate or modify but never to replace caste belonging. \no Today caste in the village presents a paradox. While evidently declining in significance in everyday social relations, caste is more than ever asserted through caste fronts, forums and political parties. The ethics of caste remains ambiguous. Caste discrimination is publicly proscribed and stifled prejudice perceived (especially by Dalits) as indicative of caste persisting as an‘internal’ state of mind, while others (more often non-Dalits) regard caste as an ‘externalised’ effect of state policy. The weakening of caste might be viewed as the result of active struggle (a Dalit view) or as the passive effect of modern times (an upper caste one). Caste may be lamented as the loss of village community, or dismissed as politics. One thing generalised is what was at first a Christian ‘secularisation’ of caste: a reflexive awareness of social conventions and the re-inscription of various roles and technical services in the idiom of the market disconnected from vestigial public models of castes.\no Regardless of its erasure as a scheme of service and public order, caste reappears in village life as private social capital essential to negotiating access to higher education and employment, or to ‘opportunity hoarding.’ This reinvents the Catholic Church as mediator and allocator of chits for today’s honours and aspiration over which there are caste struggles comparable to those earlier ones over ritual ‘honours’ at the saints’ festivals.\no Struggles around resources (education, land, water etc.) often articulate the language of caste division or religious difference. And yet this kind of mediated (ie media-driven) discourse, common at the state level, does not produce violent conflict locally. The dominant ‘communalising’ discourse, and the ‘demotic discourse’ through which everyday disputes and relations are negotiated, are kept apart by means of adept inter-translation by village youth activists or Dalit movement leaders in ways the research describes (cf. Baumann 1997). This means that a new caste and religious associationalism (including new religious congregations) appear in villages in the absence of any more general politicisation of caste or religion, enhanced tension or conflict. Earlier forms of caste and religious incorporation (‘hierarchical incorporation’ of Hindus and Christians of different castes) are not replaced by castes or religions ‘substantialised’ or ‘ethicised’ into conflicting interest groups, as so often represented, but rather by lose, strategic associations or ‘sets’ claiming equal shares in the public realm, mobilising support for individuals in dispute or seeking the rewards of healing and renewal from religious association.\no Finally, this research reveals a local capacity to manage the threat of antagonistic social difference by negotiating between absolutist religious or caste discourses (various modern fundamentalisms) and the demands of everyday life in community, so as to avoid disturbing rupture or conflict. This depends upon a dual discursive capacity, or a facility to move between incompatible meanings, morals, and modes of signification, which it is argued has been acquired historically by Christians living in caste society and working out the reconciliation of everyday social life and the potentially (socially) perilous demands of exclusivist Christian faith. The principal outputs of this research, especially the chapters (2-4) of The Saint in the Banyan Tree, establish in considerable historical and ethnographic detail the significance of Christianity in the renegotiation of caste and in the rise of Dalit social movements, politics and cultural identity in south India. This meets the central objective of the project. \nFurther exploration of the material generated by this project remain, especially in four areas, namely the opportunity \n• to explore and use discursive evidence (from interviews) to further describe different perspectives among the dalit Christian activists, clergy and non-dalit Church leaders;\n• to make further use of village-level survey data available to identify gender, age and caste-disaggregated views on ‘untouchablity,’ discrimination, and changing caste relations and new associationalism among Dalit villagers;\n• to make further use of interview material and documentary sources (compilations of reports, minutes etc) from Dalit and Christian NGO leaders, and represenatives of international donor organisations supporting a dalit rights perspective; and finally\n• to work with Fr Selvaraj, drawing his review of Tamil writing, additional village-level interviews and exploration of different streams of contemporary Dalit activism into collaborative writing.
