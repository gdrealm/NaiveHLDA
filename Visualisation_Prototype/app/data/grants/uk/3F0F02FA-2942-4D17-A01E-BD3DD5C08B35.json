However, HCPV chips - due to their higher energy flux - generate considerable amount of waste heat which lowers their energy conversion efficiency. Novel microscale water cooling systems (i.e. microfluidic chips) can effectively regulate the photovoltaics cell temperature, thereby enhancing the cell energy efficiency. Additionally, the heat extracted by the coolant can be reused in: \na. Food and Pharmaceutical stage: to run an absorption refrigeration unit (where evaporation of a working fluid causes cooling) for food preservation and storage of vaccines, that require considerable energy use.\nb. Water: membrane based water desalination processes to make saline water suitable for domestic and agricultural use \nc. Fuel: for efficient production biodiesel \nIntegrating water cooled HCPV systems with one or more of these waste heat recovery technologies can have major positive impact on water, energy, food, healthcare and environmental challenges faced by Brazil - this is very well-aligned with the 'Food energy water environment nexus' theme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M029573/1","grantId":"EP/M029573/1","fundValue":"50371","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stavroula  Balabani","coPersons":["Manish K.
