However, research on CSR in emerging/developing countries and research on SMEs has tended to operate in silos. The purpose of this series is to bring together the mainstream, developing country and SME-CSR literatures into the same arena and create an environment for exchange and cross-learning between these sub-disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>The main aims of the proposed seminar series are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to assess the current state of knowledge on CSR among emerging/developing country SMEs</li>\n\n <li>to re-examine the predictors, outcomes, moderators and mediators in the CSR-SME relationship</li>\n\n <li>to create an environment for effective exchange and cross-learning between different sub-fields on this topic</li>\n\n <li>to explore how the positive social and environmental impact of SMEs can be maximised.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The seminar series will bring UK-based experts together with experts from emerging/developing nations. One seminar will be held in Botswana to coincide with the Africa Academy of Management 2014 conference. Other seminars will explore topics such as SMEsâ€™ within supply chains, governance frameworks for SMEs and social entrepreneurship.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000393/1","grantId":"ES/L000393/1","fundValue":"20966","fundStart":"2014-01-03","fundEnd":"2016-01-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jedrzej George Frynas","coPersons":["Jyoti Manohar Navare","Laura  Spence","Jeremy Warwick Moon","Judy  Muthuri"],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":" Not applicable this year.
