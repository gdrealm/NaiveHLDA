The project adopted a mixed-methods design to investigate the reasons for and consequences of informal politics, combining theory-guided empirical research (quantitative hypothesis-testing; qualitative process-tracing; single-outcome study), normative evaluation and policy-recommendations. \n\n\n\nIn close collaboration with Professor Adrienne H?ritier (European University Institute), the following findings have been generated to date:\n\n\n\n1. The statistical analysis of all 797 co-decision procedures between mid-1999 and mid-2009 shows that decision-makers &quot;go informal&quot; for functionalist reasons (to accommodate a high number of negotiators, legislative workload and complexity), and because they are socialised into inter-institutional norms of cooperation. Against our theoretical expectations, policy-type, media attention and the Council Presidency's priorities show no explanatory power. \n\n\n\n2. The preliminary analysis of seven case studies, based on 31 in-depth interviews with key decision-makers and primary documents from the legislative process, supports the statistical findings but suggests political urgency, decision-timetables and negotiators' personalities as additional explanations for the use of informal politics.\n\n\n\n3. The single-outcome study of the European Parliament (EP)'s response to informalisation shows that the regulation of fast-track legislation is highly contested. Adoption of the 2009 rules was possible only because a critical number of early agreements (EAs) coincided with a wider internal reform agenda; the former increased the visibility of powershifts and reputational costs, the latter allowed package deals and the strategic use of norms. Challenged legitimacy and intra-institutional discontent seem to be the EP's price for empowerment and efficient co-legislation. \n\n\n\n4. To evaluate the democratic consequences of fast-track legislation, standards of legitimate decision-making were derived from normative theory. Evaluation varies with the standard applied; informal politics leaves formal representation largely in tact, increases efficiency and fosters accommodation, but challenges deliberation and accountability. This challenge is particularly acute where an informal decision is not preceded or followed by public debate; balanced representation in the informal arena is not guaranteed; pre-decisions are rubberstamped; and procedural rights are de facto curtailed. \n\n\n\n5. The normative standards and empirical findings subsequently informed policy-recommendations on the EP's 2012 review of its 2009 rules of co-legislation. Given Parliament's role as a guarantor of EU legitimacy, recommendations put a premium on inclusiveness and transparency, and suggest a set of rules designed to maintain efficient negotiation for technical proposals, facilitate effective decision-making on urgent files, and strengthen the overall legitimacy of the EU's legislative process. Since their introduction in 1999, first-reading agreements have increased dramatically, accounting for 77% in the current legislature. Considering that the European Parliament (EP) was empowered to make EU legislation more inclusive and transparent, this trend puzzles scholars and practitioners alike. As exemplified by the 2009 House of Lords Report on Codecision and National Parliamentary Scrutiny, by EP President Martin Schulz' 2012 inaugural speech, and by the on-going reform of Parliament's Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
