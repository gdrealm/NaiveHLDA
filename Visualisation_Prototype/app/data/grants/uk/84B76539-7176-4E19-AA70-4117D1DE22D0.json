Demonstrated benefits include high levels of user satisfaction, reduced behavioural\nand mood problems, delayed admission to residential care, lower levels of caregiving-related\nstress, higher carer competence, and improved collaboration between care and welfare organizations.\nProject partners in the three countries will utilise strategies and tools developed in the Netherlands\nand adapt them to country-specific requirements, establish a group of appropriate organizational\ncollaborators in each country, develop an implementation plan and toolkit, implement MCSP, and evaluate\nthe programme in a controlled trial in terms of its impact on the behaviour, mood and quality of\nlife of people with dementia and carers, its cost effectiveness as a result of changes in use of other\n(more expensive) services, such as hospitals and residential care, and psychotropic medications. An\noverall evaluation will draw together findings from the three implementation countries to develop\nrecommendations for successful implementation of the MCSP across the EU and beyond.\nThe project will be carried out over a 36 month period. In Phase One (M1-18) activities will focus on\nestablishing an initiative group of relevant organizations and user representatives in each country,\nexploring pathways to care and potential facilitators and barriers to implementing the programme, and\ndeveloping country and context-specific implementation plans and materials. In Phase Two (M19-36)\ntraining will be provided to organizations and staff, after which the meeting centres will be established\nand evaluated for impact, cost-effectiveness, user satisfaction and implementation process","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00920X/1","grantId":"ES/L00920X/1","fundValue":"314116","fundStart":"2014-03-14","fundEnd":"2017-03-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dawn  Brooker","coPersons":["Shirley Barbara Evans","Simon  Evans","Karan  Jutlla","Martin William Orrell"],"organisation":"University of Worcester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
