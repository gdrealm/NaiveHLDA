{"id":"DF5550FD-263E-4ED7-80E5-2A22A5016A36","title":"Critical Edition of a Middle English Prose Text of the Passion and Resurrection of Christ","abstractText":"This project is a critical edition of a previously unpublished Middle English narrative of the passion and resurrection of Christ, translated from two popular Latin texts, the Meditations Vitae Christi and the Gospel of Nicodemus. The Meditations, an effective account of the passion, reflects late medieval devotion to Christ's humanity. The Gospel of Nicodemus is concerned with the resurrection and contains the legion of Christ's harrowing of hell. The narrative also draws on other legendary material, and in direct contravention of fifteenth-century restrictions on translation the Bible in to English, incorporates portions of the gospels into narrative.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112588/1","grantId":"112588/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"William  Marx","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wales, Lampeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
