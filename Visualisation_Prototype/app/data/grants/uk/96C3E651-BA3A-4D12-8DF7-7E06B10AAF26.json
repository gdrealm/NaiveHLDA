{"id":"96C3E651-BA3A-4D12-8DF7-7E06B10AAF26","title":"Novel signalling pathways regulating nociception","abstractText":"Pain is something that everyone experiences at some point in their lives, and for many it is a constant burden which prevents them from engaging in a normal lifestyle. Most pain is experienced or &quot;sensed&quot; by the brain as a result of signals sent to it from nerves throughout the rest of the body. Thus a nerve with endings in a fingertip can relay information to the brain that the individual has touched a hot surface. This allows the body to withdraw the finger before too much damage is inflicted. Unfortunately, in some conditions (e.g. chronic pain) the activity of these distal nerves may become spontaneous leading to debilitating conditions whereby pain is experienced over long periods of time without any external stimulation. Such pain is very hard to treat but even harder to bear. Therefore, a major aim for researchers is to develop means of pain relief that would enable patients to have a normal, active lifestyle. Currently available approaches are effective in preventing some types of pain, but generally are poor in treating chronic pain and, in addition, often have major downsides (e.g. addiction, concomitant loss of sensation, paralysis). Our project is designed to investigate the usefulness of a new approach to the treatment of pain, which can bypass many of the problems associated with current therapies.\n\nAs is the case with some current approaches, our plan is to focus on the signals which are relayed from the ends of pain-sensing nerves to the brain. These signals are brief electrical impulses which pass along the sensing nerves and the level of pain sensed by the brain depends on the number and frequency of these impulses. The impulses arise from the synchronised activity of a group of proteins located in the outer layer or boundary of the nerve. These proteins allow passage into and out of the nerve of specific, electrically charged atoms, and the flow of this charge is sufficient to trigger similar activity in adjacent parts of the nerve boundary - in this way an electrical &quot;wave&quot; propagates from nerve ending all the way to the brain. It is a very rapid process, initiated normally by something like a hot surface, or a sharp object but in some diseases these impulses can be generated without external stimulation causing pathological pain. There are drugs currently available which can stop these impulses completely: local anaesthetics, for example, can block one of the proteins responsible for the electrical waves and are commonly used for minor surgery and dental treatment. These are extremely effective in blocking pain, but they block all sensation, leaving the patient numb for some time. Numbness is a problem in itself: not only is it uncomfortable, but one can damage a numbed region without realising it. \n\nOur novel approach to the control of pain is to target two alternative proteins which control the formation of electrical impulses in peripheral nerves. Regulating their activity will, instead of blocking impulses in an all-or-nothing manner (as is the case with local anaesthetics), cause a more subtle yet effective dampening of activity so that the individual will feel relief from pain without much numbness. Through the control of these proteins, nerves will be less able to generate the impulses associated with pain, but no block of the impulses will be imposed. We plan to regulate these two proteins in a co-ordinated manner by interfering with chemical events within the nerves which normally regulate their activity - by blocking or enhancing such events, we can &quot;tune&quot; the protein activity - and hence control the activity of the nerve, without stopping its activity altogether. Our ideas will be tested and refined at the level of individual nerve cells, and then developed for testing in controlled experiments involving pain sensation in living animals. Only through such a strategy can we develop this new approach to treatment of pain in patients and reduce the problems associated with current treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K021303/1","grantId":"MR/K021303/1","fundValue":"650485","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Peers","coPersons":["Nikita  Gamper"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
