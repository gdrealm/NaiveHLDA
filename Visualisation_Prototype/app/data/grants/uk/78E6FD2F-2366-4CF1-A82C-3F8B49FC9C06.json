Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) has resulted in very rare episodes of limited person-to-person transmission but has not adapted to humans. Another avian influenza virus (H7N7) caused a large number of, mostly mild, human infections in the Netherlands in 2003 and also demonstrated some ability for limited person-to-person transmission, but was successfully controlled by extensive culling of poultry flocks. The swine H1N1 influenza virus that emerged in 2009 successfully adapted to humans, caused a pandemic, and is now firmly established as a human influenza virus. Another swine-origin virus (H3N2v) has been transmitted occasionally from pigs to humans in the U.S. since 2011 but has not managed to switch hosts and become established in the human population. The ongoing avian influenza A(H7N9) outbreak that was first detected in China in February 2013 has caused more than 130 human cases at the time of writing, and shows some evidence of adaptation to humans. \n\nA central question that arises when an animal influenza virus crosses the species barrier and infects humans is the probability that the virus will adapt to humans and cause a pandemic. Despite much research, the barriers that must be overcome for animal influenza viruses to stably adapt to humans are still not fully understood. Assessing the public health threat of H5N1 and other animal influenza viruses requires a fuller understanding of what currently constrains the ability of animal influenza viruses to infect humans and to transmit between humans. \n\nThe characteristics of influenza viruses that are associated with adaptation to humans have been studied in detail. However, the human-host characteristics are much less well studied. Around one third of all human H5N1 cases have occurred in clusters, and 50 of the 54 H5N1 clusters reported as of March 2009 were comprised entirely of blood relatives. We and other authors have concluded that this familial clustering and other aspects of the epidemiology of H5N1 suggest a role for host genetic factors.\n\nTo test our hypothesis that host genetic factors may play an important role in restricting susceptibility to H5N1, we conducted a study to look for human genetic factors that might be associated with an increased risk of getting H5N1 infection. We studied 65 people with H5N1 infection (cases) and 2,910 people without H5N1 infection (controls) and found a variant in one particular gene (TRPM8) that was more common in cases compared to controls. We went on to study the effect of this gene on H5N1 infection in cells in the laboratory and in mice. We found that this gene did indeed affect the ability of the H5N1 virus to replicate in cells and to cause disease in mice. \n\nThe aim of this new research is to futher determine and characterize the role of the TRPM8 gene in susceptibility to infection with H5N1. We will do this by (1) gathering samples and analysing the genetic code from human H5N1 cases in Indonesia to test if the genetic variant is also present this independent set of samples, (2) fully sequencing the whole TRPM8 gene in cases and controls to identify precisely which genetic variations may be responsible, (3) exploring how different influenza viruses bind to the protein produced by the TRPM8 gene, and (4) further assessing the role of TRMP8 in H5N1 infection in mice.\n\nThis research is important since the results will provide new information on the adaptations necessary for animal influenza viruses to succesfully infect humans and may also provide a new target for drugs to prevent or treat influenza infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L008599/1","grantId":"MR/L008599/1","fundValue":"279010","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter William Horby","coPersons":["Martin Lloyd Hibberd","Richard  Webby","Steve  Gamblin"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
