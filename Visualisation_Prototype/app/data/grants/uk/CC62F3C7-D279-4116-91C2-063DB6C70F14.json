Building upon the findings of the TLRP Literacies for Learning in Further Education (LfLFE) research project (<a href=\"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/lflfe\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.lancs.ac.uk/lflfe</a>, Ivanic et al. 2007)&nbsp; this project seeks to extend that work by focusing on one particular aspect of literacy for learning; literacy for assessment in the further education context.</p>\n\n<p>The project is located in and extends theoretically the situated view of literacy practices developed in the New Literacy Studies (NLS). This project builds on NLS to explore literacy practices as assemblages of micro-practices and artefacts, that is, enacted rather than simply situated, drawing selectively upon actor-network theory (Latour 2005). </p>\n\n<p>The research will be multi-stage and multi-method and use an ethographic approach. </p>\n\n<p>It will focus on the assessment practices in two subject areas in one Further Education college. Two courses at different levels will be followed through the use of documentary analysis, observation of classroom assessment practices and indepth interviews and focus focus groups with lecturers and students. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, this project will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify the literacy in assessment practices in further education. </li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribute to our understanding of students' literacy careers</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribute to the understanding of literacy practices within educational contexts.</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp; Contribute to theory within New Literacy Studies.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3315","grantId":"RES-000-22-3315","fundValue":"80786","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Finding have been used to inform the curriculum design of a new undergraduate degree programme and development of two further masters level programme.

Some students from both curriculum areas found certain literacy practices to be a barrier for them when considering studying at higher levels. It was found that some of the more academic type literacy practices did discourage some students from engaging in higher level study that they needed in order to compete in the job market. It was also found that some of the simulated practice orientated literacies were not very useful in terms of preparing the students for the literacy demands of employment in the relevant sectors. Our finding can be put to use by educationalists designing curriculum and assessment practices. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
