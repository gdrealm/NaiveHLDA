{"id":"B7E03A7F-F4AD-446B-8403-5C28ED2109D5","title":"The Network for the Centres of Doctoral Training (CDTs) in Energy","abstractText":"In 2009 the RCUK energy programme invested ca. &pound;60M in energy doctoral training by establishing 12 Energy Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs). This is a major investment in the education of over 600 young people and, collectively, it has put the UK in a strong position internationally in having an innovative and coordinated programme to provide the highly trained personnel to drive the low carbon economy. These Centres now form a significant component of the RCUK Energy Programme. The vision for the proposed Network is to capitalise upon this investment and maximise value in support of EPSRC's three clear goals: Delivering Impact, Shaping Capability and Developing Leaders. The Network will also provide a mechanism to integrate the energy CDTs with other components of the RCUK energy programme, in particular the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC).\nThe aim of the proposed Network is to maximise the quality and benefits of the training programmes through coordinated activities. Further, it will collectively raise the external profile of the CDTs, both with industry and internationally in a manner which is supportive of the RCUK energy brand. The proposed Network will provide added value by achieving the following objectives: \n(i) Effective coordination of training activities across the CDTs through a number of measures including common training and summer schools; \n(ii) Maximising the impact of local, school and public engagement activities already planned or delivered by the CDTs through the sharing of best practice, quality materials and by collaborating at high profile events. \n(iii) Coordination of the 12 CDT Directors, providing a forum to shape grand challenges in energy research and to discuss key issues such as the development of future energy research leaders and the progress of the CDTs. \n(iv) Maximising the impact and value of existing industrial engagement in the energy CDTs, ensuring that UK industry understands the CDT model, knowledge exchange andthe international programme for the promotion of the CDTs model.\n\nThrough coordination it is our aim that the network will maximise the value and impact made by the RCUKs investment in these Centres. A key role of the Network will be to stimulate collaboration between the Centres both in terms of taught activities where we plan to promote the sharing of resources and opportunities for joint student teaching but more importantly in research. We hope to promote centre research collaboration and joint cross-centre supervision of students. Our planned Grand Challenge Sandpits are designed to bring the academic expertise residing in the different Centres together so students at different Centres can work together on large Grand Challenge projects which will make significant impact when all the research findings are pulled together. The Network, through the stimulation of cross-Centre collaborations will help to maximise the value for the UK from the investment it has made in these Centres. \n\nThe relationships between the Centre Directors and Centre Managers that are put in place through the activities of the Network should ensure that the cooperation and close working across the Centres continues beyond the lifetime of the Network Grant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I036494/1","grantId":"EP/I036494/1","fundValue":"174749","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To facilitate engagement with the energy industry the Energy CDT Network gained Learning Affiliate membership of the Energy Institute (EI). The EI is the professional body for the energy industry and addresses the depth and breadth of energy and energy systems, complimenting the large energy research portfolio of the Network. As a Learning Affiliate of the EI the Energy CDT Network was promoted through EnergyZone a dedicated area for energy education and careers. Furthermore, an article was featured in EI Future Skills 2012 and 2014 publication. The Network was able to provide all CDT students with the opportunity of free membership to a professional body offering access to events, training and career information and opportunities. To further support development of CDT students the Network worked with the EI and Engineering Council to develop an appropriate route of professional development. A number of CDTs already have experience in gaining accreditation for professional development programmes and others were able to learn from their experiences.\nIn 2013 the Energy CDT network partnered with the EI and the Midlands Energy Graduate School to launch a programme of careers webinars. Each webinars was themed with relevant invited speakers and students were invited to question in person or via email or Twitter. The format allowed students to watch the webinar live online, watch a recording or to attend a meeting room where the speaker was either located or the webinar was being broadcast. Up to 4 locations could be used as 'hubs' to show the live broadcast but most students wish to watch the recording or online stream.
