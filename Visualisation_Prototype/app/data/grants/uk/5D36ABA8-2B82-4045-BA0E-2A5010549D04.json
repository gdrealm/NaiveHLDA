By comparing these groups we aim to show:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>the many variables affecting recruitment under the primary conditions dictated by violence and extra-legality when the size, the military strategy, and the goal of the groups are substantially different;</li> \n <li>how, despite those differences, common patterns can be identified.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>These groups differ in their aims, structures and constraints. Nonetheless they all share the need to find trustworthy, loyal and competent members in a context in which – given the insurgent or extra-legal status of the organisation – information does not flow freely and alternative mechanisms need to be implemented for the recruitment process to take place. Little is known about such mechanisms since the majority of research on recruitment has focused on members’ motivations without questioning the process prior to the selection itself, thus accounting for only one side of the recruitment process. Crucially, this project will also observe the role of those who set the parameters and select members from a pool of potential recruits.</p> \n<p>The expected outcomes of this project are: three articles in peer-reviewed journals or a book in which the analysis of the data collected will be published and a workshop to discuss the research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0131","grantId":"RES-061-23-0131","fundValue":"311778","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather  Hamill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
