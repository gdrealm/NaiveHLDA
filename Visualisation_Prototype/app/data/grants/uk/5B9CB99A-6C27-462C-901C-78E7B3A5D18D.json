Understanding and improving health from a comprehensive gender perspective.","abstractText":"Everyone has the right to a chance of a long life in good health, no matter whether they are a man or a woman, rich or poor. However, globally men (in both rich and poor countries) experience a higher burden of disease and have lower life expectancy than women. Much of this difference is due to men's risk-taking behaviours: they drink more alcohol, smoke more tobacco and drive more dangerously than women do. Some of this is driven by gender - i.e. the social rules and norms that tell each and every one of us what is appropriate behavior for men and women in all societies. \n\nMuch of the current research on gender and health focuses mainly on women and girls and their health-related risks. We believe it is very important to understand and address the issues that globally place men more at risk of illness, disability and early death. This is important not only for the health of men, but also for women's health too - for example, there is increasing evidence that young women in many countries are now beginning to drink and smoke at similar rates to their male peers. There is also evidence that men's risk-taking impacts negatively on women's health and wellbeing.\n\nWe plan to establish and strengthen a network of researchers, practitioners and health advocates, who are engaged with studying and acting to improve the health of both men and women around the world through a better understanding of gender and health issues. Over a period of 3 years, researchers and campaigners in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Americas and Europe will come together to deliberate and identify solutions to improve the health of populations in different parts of the world. These ideas will be shared and debated with both policy makers and the communities of men and women whose health outcomes we are hoping to improve. \n\nSeminars will be open to a wide variety of participants, and at least half the time the seminars will be web-based and hence available to all. We will communicate the outputs from the seminars through websites and social media, and hope that in doing so we can raise awareness that gender affects the behaviours, risks, and health of everyone, not just women and girls.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M00256X/1","grantId":"ES/M00256X/1","fundValue":"29525","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Hawkes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
