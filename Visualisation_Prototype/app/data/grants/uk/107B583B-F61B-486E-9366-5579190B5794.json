When these enzymes are inappropriately activated inside the cells of the pancreas (breaking down this organ and its surroundings) we have the disease Acute Pancreatitis. About 20000 people in the UK develop pancreatitis every year, and currently there is no known cure. Life-threatening complications occur in about 25% of the cases and the mortality is about 10%. We have recently shown that abnormal changes in the calcium concentration inside the pancreatic cells causes activation inside these cells of the digestive enzymes. It is therefore essential now to understand how the abnormal Ca2+ signals can be generated in order to prevent this happening. Pancreatitis is often triggered by bile flowing back into the pancreas or by alcohol. We plan to investigate the mechanism by which pancreatitis is initiated by these agents through the use of realistic models. We shall study both the intact pancreas from normal and genetically modified mice and rats as well as isolated human pancreatic acinar cells obtained from surgical procedures for cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8801575","grantId":"G8801575","fundValue":"4281440","fundStart":"1989-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ole Holger  Petersen","coPersons":["Alexei  Tepikin","Oleg  Gerasimenko","John  Neoptolemos"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
