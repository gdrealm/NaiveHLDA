The damage is carried out by white blood cells called T cells. We will study why CD8 T cells (the type of killer cell that normally defends the body against infection) that can damage the insulin-producing cells of the body develop and how they become active to cause diabetes. In a mouse model of diabetes, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, we have found that cells recognising insulin may be very important in the early damage to the insulin-producing beta cells. We will carry out a series of experiments that will inform us as to how these CD8 T cells that recognise insulin are regulated naturally to try to prevent them from attacking the beta cells. If we can understand why the cells develop and how to turn them off, this will be important in the future design of immunotherapy that could prevent diabetes and help to protect transplants and replacement cells producing insulin. Furthermore, results from understanding how these cells develop in diabetes may be of benefit in understanding more generally why cells of this kind develop and cause problems in other autoimmune diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901155","grantId":"G0901155","fundValue":"555719","fundStart":"2011-01-04","fundEnd":"2014-02-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Florence Susan  Wong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
