{"id":"0B2A6CE6-9BE4-4F35-8ED9-E3ED171A873B","title":"The Arab Role in the Cultural History of Zanzibar 1840-1930","abstractText":"The research leave will allow the selection, analysis and preparation for publication for the first time in a single monograph of a large body of new primarily archival material describing in detail the Arab role in the development of Zanzibar as a new seat of learning and cultural centre in East Africa. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there had been a restricted urban cultural tradition in Zanzibar. As Zanzibar emerged as a new commercial and political centre in East Africa, Arab and Swahili cultural and intellectual life developed as a consequence of indigenous efforts and an influx of scholars from Oman, the Hadramawt and the Indian Ocean; Zanzibar became significant in the intellectual renaissance of these societies through the vibrant cultural life of their diaspora. These scholars developed a network of fertile relations with their homelands, the East African littoral, the Comoros, Algeria, Mecca and Cairo. With Swahili functioning as the lingua franca, Arabic survived and prospered for many as a language of political, religious, social and cultural status. Features investigated will be the impact on Zanzibar of the wider Arab renaissance in Egypt and the Levant: contacts with Egyptian ulema and other Arab intellectuals; the influence of Egyptian and Syrian journals on Zanzibari intellectuals; the introduction of printed books; the development of Arabic printing after 1875, its vital role in disseminating Ibadi literature and laying the modern scholarly foundations of Ibadism; the Arabic element in the birth of journalism in East Africa: al-Shanba, al-Najah, al-Usbu'iya, etc.; the publication of books by Zanzibaris in Egypt and elsewhere; the role and works of the Ibadi and Shafi'i ulema and local literati in the intellectual and literary renaissance; the creation of new cultural institutions and societies: libraries, theatre, cinema, Zanzibar Book Club, Arab Association, etc; the development of popular culture from indigenous, Arab and foreign roots: the evolution of taarab music under Egyptian influence from an exclusive court music to a popular phenomenon, the Sultans' bands and Beni bands, other cultural manifestations, the Arab dimension of Islamic feast days (siku kuu, Muharram), the saints' days (mawlids), Nairouz ceremonies, the Arab aspects of dance (ngomas) associated with these and other events, etc. \\nThis study, the first dealing with the Arab contribution to the cultural scene, should be of interest to scholars and students of East Africa and the Arab world and should provide a useful textbook for these fields. Omanis and Yemenis are increasingly concerned with the activities of their diasporas, and Zanzibaris have a growing desire to know more of their country's rich cultural past. Parts of the study may be translated subsequently into Arabic and Swahili, making it accessible to a much larger audience. The study responds to an upsurge of international academic interest in Zanzibar, the Swahili coast and Islam in Africa.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004997/1","grantId":"AH/E004997/1","fundValue":"30811","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2008-01-16","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip Charles  Sadgrove","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
