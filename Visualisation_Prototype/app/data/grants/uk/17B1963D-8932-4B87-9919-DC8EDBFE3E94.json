This is an original topic that has not yet been treated as such, to the best of my knowledge, as the principal focus of any other book. This may seem surprising, for so much has been written on the political activities of intellectuals in France. Indeed, such activities have generally been seen as a constituent component of the French intellectual's activity. But, as Stefan Collini has recently noted (2006), 'the fact that intellectuals have often occupied a highly visible and noisy role in political discussion in France does not mean that they were necessarily more influential than elsewhere, if by that is meant playing a part in determining actual policies.' This book explores those moments when certain intellectuals have been drawn into the policy process, and the different forms taken by their engagement (from becoming a minister or ministerial advisor to heading up a commission or writing a one-off report). It investigates the conflicts and tensions that emerged, and the results that were achieved. The task of assessing the part that intellectuals have played 'in determining actual policies' is less straightforward than it might appear, on account of the complex nature of the policy process and of the often deferred appropriation of intellectuals' input. In order to address this challenge, I construct a framework based on the political scientist John Kingdon's 'multiple streams' model of policy development (which analytically separates out the study of ideas as such within the 'policy' stream, while explaining how these can link up with developments in the streams of 'politics' and of perceived social and cultural 'problems'). I explore the concerns about political manipulation which have commonly deterred French intellectuals from participating in governmental policy processes, and also concerns voiced by policy experts that generalist intellectuals are ill-equipped to pronounce on complex policy domains. But I also explore the extent to which intellectuals have a valuable and even necessary role to play in the policy world, precisely insofar as they are able to bring general perspectives to bear that go beyond expertise in this or that policy sector.\\n\\nThe study's principal historical focus is the Fifth Republic (1959 to the present), but it reaches back to previous periods as and when this is necessary for a full understanding of the issues. Its thematic focus is on policy problems relating to culture in a broad sense, and that cut across the administratively discrete domains of cultural, media and educational policy. One such problem is laicity, and I explore how intellectual authority has been mobilised in constructing and legitimating a framework designed initially to challenge religious belief but more recently to mediate between incompatible belief systems. A second such problem centres on the long-standing struggles around the definition of a common educational curriculum, in which the recourse to public intellectuals has constituted one strategy in attempts to arbitrate between the claims of different disciplinary lobbies. A further cluster of problems revolves around programmes of cultural democratisation. Intellectuals have played prominent roles in defining and contesting the contents and general legitimacy of such programmes, and also in assessing the implications for established patterns of cultural transmission of new technological developments such as television and the internet from perspectives that are not available to technical and economic experts.\\n\\n\\nThe research broadens our understanding of the potential political influence of intellectuals, and provides insights into the ways in which public policy can be inflected by agents who are not routine inhabitants of the policy world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F014589/1","grantId":"AH/F014589/1","fundValue":"21647","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Neil Ahearne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
