The event was extremely successful and engaged a live audience of 300 extra-CERN Geneva locals, 10,000 international online viewers (5,000 from UK) and was covered by international media outlets. We now intend to expand the LHComedy vehicle in the UK through the creation of a live, interactive comedy show, LHComedy: UK, aimed at exposing GCSE student/teacher/parent and general public adult audiences to the scientific method and cutting edge research. \n\nThe show has several key aims:\n\n1) Introduce the scientific methodology \n\nMany forms of scientific outreach concentrate on explaining aspects of high level science, but few explain the scientific process itself. UK Government research shows that approximately a third of the general public say they do not understand the scientific methodology of hypothesis testing, analysis and peer review [http://tinyurl.com/o6r4dvj]. This is a significant barrier preventing the general public from engaging with science. In addition, the UK Key Stage 3 (GCSE) exam board physics specifications now include a principle focus on teaching students &quot;how science works&quot; [http://tinyurl.com/ky8mmd4]. These specifications can be difficult and tedious to teach using traditional methods and require a more interactive approach. We intend to introduce audiences to the scientific methodology and engage them with activities that are exciting and amusing, allowing them to &quot;learn by doing&quot; and guide the outcome of each show. Understanding the scientific method is essential if GCSE students are going to continue to persevere with physics.\n\n2) Allow CERN affiliated scientists (and professional science communicators) to interact directly with audiences\n\nThe popularity and impact of communicators like Brian Cox, Dara O'Brien and shows such as The Infinite Monkey Cage indicate that getting large demographics to engage with science means making the people presenting the scientific information sociable, approachable and relatable. Combining science and comedy, and allowing active CERN affiliated scientific researchers and professional scientific communicators to interact directly with audiences, not only creates excitement and offers significant gravitas to disseminated material, but also counteracts the negative stereotypes of physicists e.g. by presenting female physics role models. We can also challenge the &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; stereotype of physicists as anti-social. Combined with making science more relevant, fun and appealing, this helps to draw the next generation to career paths in scientific research (at the pivotal GCSE stage). Experiential learning is also particularly effective for engaging students in under-performing schools.\n\nIn addition, the project challenges CERN affiliated researchers to explain their work and lifestyle in an engaging and entertaining manner. This improves their communication skills and provides an element of training.\n\n3) Legacy and sustainability\n\nThe LHComedy project has created an on-going two way discussion between active CERN scientists and professional scientific communicators/comedians. We aim to continue this partnership so that novel ways of disseminating scientific information can be suggested and discussed by both sides. \n\nThe structure of the proposed new show (see following sections) can also be repurposed to explain the scientific method with reference to advances in any other science. We hope to produce a show that inspires spin off performances. \n\n4) Impact assessment\n\nSeveral vehicles have attempted to use comedy to engage audiences with high-level science. However, there is little evidence as to its efficacy. We will collect thorough online and live audience feedback to help fill the gaps in the existing literature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001974/1","grantId":"ST/N001974/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2015-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Suzanne  Sheehy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
