Discourses of subjectivity in an Imperial age","abstractText":"In this study the authors (Professor Richard Alston and I) explore subjectivity as debated in a cluster of historical and literary discourses emerging from mid-first-century to early-secondary-century AD Rome. In our attempts to understand a society whose fragmentation enabled or demanded divers' ideological choices, we draw upon present day reflections on selfhood while at the same time uncovering processes of self-analysis, notably by tracing individuals' reactions to moments of crises or uncertainty. We propose a model for extensive collaboration between modern critical thinking and classical text which challenges pedigreed division between the classical and modern (post-Cartesian) selves.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112743/1","grantId":"112743/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-04-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Efrossini  Spentzou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
