{"id":"6F7BE22D-DD13-49B9-B0EB-EEDC71CE98F0","title":"EPSRC/VCE Strategic Partnership: Green Radio","abstractText":"There is a need on environmental grounds to reduce the energy requirements of radio access networks. From an operator perspective, reduced energy consumption translates directly to the bottom line - lower Operating Expenditure (OPEX). These are the key drivers of the Green Radio programme. Both wide area public networks (traditionally cellular ) and local area private networks (traditionally wireless LAN ) will be considered, recognizing that the structure of a Green Radio Network may differ from today's radio networks. Thus in essence, the specific objective of the Green Radio programme is to investigate and create innovative methods for the reduction of the total power needed to operate a radio access network and to identify appropriate radio architectures which enable such power reduction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G06041X/1","grantId":"EP/G06041X/1","fundValue":"339487","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Martin Armour","coPersons":["Joe  McGeehan","Kevin  Morris","Angela  Doufexi","Geoffrey Stephen Hilton","Mark  Beach"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
