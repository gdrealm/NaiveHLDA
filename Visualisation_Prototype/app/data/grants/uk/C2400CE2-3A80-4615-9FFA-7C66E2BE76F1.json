{"id":"C2400CE2-3A80-4615-9FFA-7C66E2BE76F1","title":"Molecular basis and manipulation of mariner/Tc1 transposon DNA integration","abstractText":"Transposons are segments of DNA that can move from one place to another in their host's genome. The movement of these DNA segments around genomes is orchestrated by a transposase protein encoded in the transposon itself. This enzyme cuts the DNA out of its original location and pastes it into a new site. This cut-and-paste property is being exploited to develop biotechnology tools for scientific research and medical applications. Learning more about how transposases move DNA will enable scientists to understand how to better control these enzymes and thereby speed the development of transposon tools. The mariner/Tc1 family of transposons is particularly widespread, being found in insects, plants, and animals including humans, and there is evidence that they can move from one host species to another over evolutionary time. This family is unusual in that all the elements are pasted into specific, but very short sequences of DNA comprising just two DNA bases. This proposal is aimed at discovering how transposases from this family choose this sequence and how they insert the transposon DNA into their target. To do this we will obtain a molecular snapshot of the Mos1 transposase in action at the DNA integration step of the transposition process. This will involve solving an X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme bound to both transposon DNA and target DNA. We have already solved structures of the enzyme and transposon DNA at earlier stages in the transposition process. The results of biochemical experiments will support and validate our findings. Having gained this detailed molecular understanding of the transposition machinery, we propose to engineer the transposase so that it can be directed to insert transposon DNA precisely where it is required. The ability to control the enzyme, based on a thorough knowledge of its three-dimensional structure as well as its chemical mechanism, should be of enormous benefit to developing gene therapy applications of this family of transposons, where precise control will be essential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J000884/1","grantId":"BB/J000884/1","fundValue":"313687","fundStart":"2012-04-27","fundEnd":"2015-04-26","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Two papers that utilise a DNA integration assay we have developed were published early in 2014. \nWe have presented our recent results at scientific conferences in 2014 and these are being prepared for publication in 2015.

We have met our key objective by solving the crystal structure of the product of the DNA integration reaction. It reveals that a base-flipping mechanism stabilises the product of cut-and-paste Mos1 transposition. Transposase mutants confirm key amino involved in target DNA sequence recognition. \nThe DNA integration assay developed in the course of this work has been applied in two other projects. One of these revealed that the anti-retroviral drug Raltegravir can inhibit Mos1 transposase, but the related second-generation drug Elvitegravir cannot. The grant is still on going. We are further investigating the DNA base-flipping mechanism in solution as well as the order of molecular events. Our results will facilitate engineering of the transposase (and closely related enzymes) to alter the DNA sequences into which mariner DNA transposons can be integrated. Targeted transposases or conversely non-specific transposases could broaden the biotechnology applications of DNA transposition. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
