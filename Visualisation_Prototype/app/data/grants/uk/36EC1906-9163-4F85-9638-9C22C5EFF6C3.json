One group of cells that are really important in co-ordinating your body are nerve cells. A single nerve cells can integrate all sorts of information, decide what to do with it, and then instruct another cell to carry out a task in response.\nIt is difficult to exaggerate just how important are a set of nerve cells that are found in a small region of your brain, called the hypothalamus. Nerve cells here are responsible for maintaining your constancy: your temperature, weight, mood, to name but a few. They act by controlling other cells in a tiny gland just next to them ? the pituitary gland. Cells in the pituitary gland release hormones in response to messages sent to them from hypothalamic nerves.\nDespite the huge importance of the hypothalamus, we know very little about how it forms in the embryo. Why do we want to know this? It is because the nerve cells that are found in the adult hypothalamus are actually born in the embryo. If we can understand how they develop normally, then we can hope to understand how they go wrong in disease and disorders. We may even be able to use stem cell technology to create new hypothalamic nerves.\nMany of the questions that we wish to address in this proposal deal with the basic development of the hypothalamus: how do specific cell types arise within the hypothalamus?; how do early embryonic cell types underpin the later cells in the hypothalamus?; are the different regions of the later hypothalamus already set aside in the early embryo?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501618","grantId":"G0501618","fundValue":"1307310","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marysia  Placzek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
