The research project would shed light on the grammar of two dialects which are the products of a language contact situation. For four hundred years or more, a dialect of Old Norse was in contact with dialects of Scots in the Northern Isles. During this period (15th - 19th century) Scots gained currency as the language of Orkney and Shetland, while the local dialect of Old Norse gradually went out of use. Sometime during this period, local dialects of Scots formed in Orkney and Shetland, incorporating words and structures from the Old Norse dialect. The research project which the scoping study is preparing for, aims to develop a database (corpus) of naturally occurring dialect texts from Orkney and Shetland, which would be digitally searchable. This corpus would then be available for researchers to use as data material for investigating the linguistic structures of the Orkney and Shetland dialects. Grammatical investigation of the Orkney and Shetland dialects would then hopefully enable us, in the next instance, to shed light on the language contact and shift and answer such questions as: When did the Scots dialects of Orkney and Shetland consolidate - based on the presence of relict forms from older stages of Scots? Can we trace any Old Norse or Middle Norwegian influence on the grammar of the Orkney and Shetland Scots dialects? Can we find grammatical structures in the Orkney and Shetland dialects which have developed independently of Scots and the local Old Norse dialect?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011592/1","grantId":"AH/J011592/1","fundValue":"13265","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It has created awareness in the local community about the history and unique features of Orkney and Shetland dialect, valorising these dialects in communities where speakers have traditionally been taught in schools that their way of speaking is not 'correct'. I have been invited to speak in local primary schools, community groups and community events, such as the Orkney International Science Festival, and to interest groups such as Shetland ForWirds.

The project identified available and suitable texts in libraries and archives, explores technical solutions, and conducted a research review, identifying research gaps. Provided further funding, the next step will be to technically implement and build the corpus and make it available to other researhers.
