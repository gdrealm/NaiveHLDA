{"id":"7845E3EE-3219-4C90-951D-ABA7C7039BD3","title":"Microwave assisted catalytic treatment of agricultural waste water (MICROCAT)","abstractText":"Aim of MICROCAT is to enable reuse of at least 3% of the total global blue water used in agriculture (70% of 600Gm3/yr),\nsaving globally 17,000ML/day. A multi-functional surface advanced textile material (ATM) with filtration, ion-exchange,\ndisinfection and ambient temperature catalytic capability will be coupled to microwave technology to provide superior\nenhanced remediation of agricultural waste water for re-use in crop production and agricultural processing.\nDeliverables: Combine microwave energy to the catalyst treatment system (highly innovative) to significantly increase\ncatalyst efficiency by at least 5-folds, double the surface area and efficiency of ATM by developing novel textile structures,\noptimise nanocoating process to reduce costs by 20%, with adaptation to scale-up for manufacture and optimise system\nprocess parameters in field trials to meet regulations for water re-use. Microwave assisted catalysis is a platform\ntechnology with potential to treat currently untreatable wastewaters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K50418X/1","grantId":"EP/K50418X/1","fundValue":"144272","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Used in the production at industrial scale of our catalyst for wastewater treatment.
