This is due to the brain using sugar (e.g. glucose) to fuel all of its activities. However, because it cannot generate glucose itself, it depends on being provided with this fuel by other tissues in the body. The brain's dependence on glucose - it's cells, neurons, don't function properly without it - brings with it the need for a sophisticated machinery to sense glucose concentrations and to adjust whole body glucose levels accordingly. Although we understand that neurons in a brain site called the hypothalamus are very important in these glucose-sensing and -adjusting mechanisms, we lack fundamental knowledge of these processes. Furthermore, these mechanisms fail in response to recurrent bouts of very low glucose levels or chronic high levels of glucose, however we do not understand why neurons de-sensitize. Our proposal therefore aims to identify the basic machinery underlying hypothalamic glucose-sensing and corresponding adjustments to whole body glucose levels. On a wider level this research makes an important contribution to a key biological question: How do neurons adjust their function to response to varying fluctuating signals? We have recently identified a hypothalamic protein, CRTC2 (CREB regulated transcription co-activator), that links glucose-sensing with appropriate activation of specific genes. We also found that the genes CRTC2 controls are very important in the regulation of food intake. Our aim is now to demonstrate CRTC2's key role in the hypothalamic mechanisms adjusting whole body glucose levels. We hypothesize that glucose-dependent CRTC2-mediated changes in hypothalamic gene expression underpin the neuronal response to adjust glycemic state. We will work on several different experimental levels to investigate the function of this protein. On a cellular level, we will assess in which subset of neurons CRTC2 is found; physically hypothalamic neurons all look alike, but they express different proteins and perform very different functions. Furthermore, we can assess exactly which genes CRTC2 controls; by comparing the activation of CRTC2-dependent genes at different glucose levels, we can identify which glucose-dependent genetic 'program' CRTC2 controls. By performing these experiments with recurrent bouts of low glucose or chronic high levels of glucose, we can identify which aspects of this genetic program fail when neurons de-sensitize to glucose changes. Together with identifying the cell-type CRTC2 is found in, these experiments identify the neuronal processes that are activated by varying glucose levels. Finally, we will assess the physiological functions these CRTC2-dependent genetic programs bestow on particular hypothalamic areas. By rendering CRTC2 unable to be regulated by glucose changes in genetically modified mice, the genetic programs run by CRTC2 cannot be controlled properly and allowing us to study the consequences on whole-body glucose levels in these mice. Our work will thus create significant insight into the hypothalamic processes engaged to maintain glucose homeostasis in the body.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020381/1","grantId":"BB/I020381/1","fundValue":"364184","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  - public engagement: we have reported our findings at different events (please see 'engagement activities')\n- we are still in the process to generate and make available our gene expression data for other parties to use.

We are now in the process of identifying the exact genes that are dysregulated. \n- We found profound sexual dymorphism in the glucose-sensitivity of hypothalamic genes; while male hypothalamic candidate genes are regulated by hypoglycemia, female genes are not. We are now in the process of identifying mechanisms for this sexual dymorphism. \n- We have developed novel techniques to prepare high quality samples for gene expression regulation assessment (ChIPSeq) from very small subareas of the hypothalamus. This technique now allows us to assess gene expression regulation at various metabolic states downstream of a host of transcription factors and modulators.\n- We have generated novel genetically modified mouse models that further allow us to characterize the physiological function of genes that are regulated by the glucose-sensitive transcription factor CRTC2 by expressing a mutant form in specific areas of the hypothalamus. Indeed these mice have reduced body weight and we are in the process of characterizing their glucose homeostasis phenotype. Once we have assembled the glucose-dys/regulated transcriptome, we will upload our data on a public database for this kind of data. It can then be mined by other researchers. \nIn addition, identifying hypothalamic genes that are dysregulated by either chronic hypo- or hyper-glycemia has the potential to uncover novel therapeutic targets and guide improved, future therapeutic design in diabetes and may thus be of interest to the therapeutics industry.
