{"id":"F21EDEAC-8C9A-4C2D-8B3A-1FA256554B55","title":"Genetic clinical and ENdocrine Predictors of treatment Outcome in Depression (GENPOD)","abstractText":"There are now a wide range of antidepressants used to treat depression in primary care, but the two main types influence the neurotransmitters serotonin (5HT) or noradrenaline. We plan to investigate whether there are genetic, clinical or hormonal predictors of response to these two main types of antidepressant. We plan to carry out a clinical trial that will randomise people with depression to either of the two antidepressants. The antidepressants are equally effective overall, but it seems that some patients get better on one type and some on the other. If we can find out what predicts response it will help to target treatment and also understand more about how these tablets work. It might also help to provide a classification of different types of depression.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200243","grantId":"G0200243","fundValue":"635201","fundStart":"2004-02-23","fundEnd":"2008-05-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Lewis","coPersons":["Stafford Louis Lightman","Ania  Korszun","Timothy James  Peters","Deborah  Sharp","Philip John Cowen","David  Nutt","Michael Conlon O'Donovan"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
