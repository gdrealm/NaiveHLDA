We examine many ways in which such technologies embed themselves within existing or new social, professional and business practices and thus transform travel.</p>\n\n<p>This Project therefore aims first, to understand how non-transport technologies have impacted and are impacting especially indirectly upon travel, and second, to understand how practices and time-space patterns of activity could be (re)shaped by various new technologies so generating lower carbon alternatives. Focus will be upon likely future developments and scenarios within work, retailing, leisure, food and ageing.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J007455/1","grantId":"ES/J007455/1","fundValue":"197557","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Urry","coPersons":["Glenn  Lyons"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
