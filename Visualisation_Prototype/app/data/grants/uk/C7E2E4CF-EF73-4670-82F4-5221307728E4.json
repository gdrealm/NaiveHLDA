{"id":"C7E2E4CF-EF73-4670-82F4-5221307728E4","title":"SUSSP66 International Summer School in Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics","abstractText":"This proposal is for partial (&lt; 25%) funding of an international Summer School on 'Ultrafast Nonlinear Optics' aimed at young researchers in the final years of their PhD or the early years of post-doctoral research. It is planned to host around 70 students from Europe and North America with 12 lecturers from Europe and the USA, giving 36 lectures over a 10-day period. The School is being organised in the Scottish Universities Summer Schools in Physics (SUSSP) series. Other funding for the School is in place from SUPA (the Scottish Universities' Physics Alliance) and SUSSP. Previous SUSSP schools were eligible for substantial support from either NATO (as an Advanced Study Institute), the EU (under FP 6 and earlier) or EPSRC / STFC / EPS (under a joint MoU which lapsed in 2008), however these forms of support are no longer available to SUSSP66. To be financially viable SUSSP66 must therefore recover the balance of its costs from student registration fees. In this context, we wish to maximise the benefit of the School to the UK by securing partial support from the EPSRC to provide 50% bursaries for 20 students from UK research groups. The registration fee is 950, so this support amounts to 9500. We also request the full costs of 4 UK lecturers at the School, amounting to 6720, guaranteeing a strong UK representation amongst a group of distinguished international lecturers. Finally we request project-specific costs of 3500 associated with the running of the School. After the addition of required investigator staff costs, the total cost to the EPSRC will be 20987 (26233 FEC).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H023232/1","grantId":"EP/H023232/1","fundValue":"21300","fundStart":"2010-08-15","fundEnd":"2011-02-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Derryck  Reid","coPersons":["Henry Thomas Bookey","David  Townsend"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
