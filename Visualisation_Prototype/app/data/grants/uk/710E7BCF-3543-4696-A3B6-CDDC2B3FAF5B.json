{"id":"710E7BCF-3543-4696-A3B6-CDDC2B3FAF5B","title":"Caste, Class, and Culture: Changing Bahun and Dalit Identities in Nepal","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to carry out a comparative, socio-historical study of two of Nepal’s largest, most significant, and yet understudied, caste groups, namely, Bahuns (Brahmans), ostensibly the most successful group, and Dalits (ex-Untouchables), the most disadvantaged, excluded, and ‘backward’ group. Through a combination of ethnography and quantitative methods, the researchers will examine exactly how patterns of disadvantage and exclusion, on the one hand, and achievement and success, on the other, are produced and reproduced. The three main aims of the study are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to document and analyse the linked social histories of Bahuns and Dalits</li>\n\n <li>to document and analyse their changing identities</li>\n\n <li>to examine the role of cultural predispositions in educational and occupational achievement and to attempt to explain how such dispositions and outcomes are created and change over time, with particular reference to geographical mobility (migration).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>While the primary focus is the Bahun and Dalit population of the target villages in west Nepal, local Chhetris and Gurungs will be included in the quantitative survey for comparative purposes. The study will also be conducted in migration destinations in Nepal, India, and the Middle East.
