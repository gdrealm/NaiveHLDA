One of the most striking examples of unquestionable popularity of modern networking technologies is the Internet with its diverse applications in research, business, education, and entertainment. The need of rapid development of reliable and resource efficient multi-processor environments initially fuelled intensive studies of centralised parallel algorithms and architectures. However, more recently it became very apparent that real life network scenarios (due to their specificity) require more distributed and very often asynchronous computation and communication models.The Colloquia on Structural Information and Communication Complexity (SIROCCO) focus on the relationship between computing and communication, i.e., the study of those factors that are significant for the computability and the communication complexity of problems and on the interplay between structure, knowledge and complexity. The Colloquia provide an opportunity to bring together specialists interested in the fundamental principles underlying all computing through communication. Good examples of the areas where the interplay between complexity and communication takes place are: communication complexity, information dissemination, routing protocols, distributed data-structures, models of communication, network topologies, sense of direction, structural properties and computability, topological awareness and metric information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D060354/1","grantId":"EP/D060354/1","fundValue":"12824","fundStart":"2006-05-31","fundEnd":"2006-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Leszek Antoni Gasieniec","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
