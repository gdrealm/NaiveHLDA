There is a pressing need to develop new potential therapies, because there are few medicines useful in the final stages of heart failure. To prevent from or treat this disease, keeping the surviving heart cells healthy is very important. One option to achieve this is amplifying the naturally-occurring protective mechanisms that are activated in the body during stress. All organisms have such systems that protect themselves from injury such as infection or environmental stress. Recently it has been shown that certain molecules leaked from dead cells can sound an alarm in the situation of tissue injury. DNA from damaged cells is one of these. I have found that DNA administration reduced energy consumption of the heart, subsequently enhanced its tolerance to injury. Interestingly, this newly-found protective mechanism is brought about by a protein on the heart cells which was previously thought to produce a harmful effect to the heart cells by the immune system. This study aims to clarify the molecular mechanisms and further understand the nature of DNA-mediated heart protection by using established models and latest research technologies. Results obtained will lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for heart diseases. Also, it is plausible this self protection mechanism could be operative in other cell types, like brain cells, so likely opening new research areas. Altogether, this proposal certainly has a strong potential to impact on both basic and medical science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000461","grantId":"G1000461","fundValue":"323091","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Yasunori  Shintani","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
