{"id":"A0D2FC79-406D-4AD8-8A12-64E9831AFBDF","title":"EPSRC-GSK Chair in Sustainable Chemistry","abstractText":"We seek support from EPSRC strategic funds to secure the appointment of a high profile academic from overseas to establish a new Sustainable Processing of Chiral Molecular Materials research group at the University of Nottingham. The group will be a key part of the University's strategy and plans to establish a Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Chemistry in collaboration with the UK based pharmaceutical company GSK. The centre will build upon the University's existing strengths in Green Chemistry, multi-disciplinary links between Chemistry and Engineering, and strong links with industry to generate a critical mass of world-leading research capacity in the emerging discipline of Sustainable Chemistry. The new research group will be housed in a unique Carbon Neutral Laboratory (CNL) and will help address key global challenges within Society and Industry including lowering carbon footprint, optimising energy usage, reducing waste and conserving precious resources such as water and metals. This work will contribute towards several of EPSRC's challenge themes. The group will be led by Professor David Amabalino (currently at CSIC-Barcelona) and will explore novel sustainable processing routes to chiral molecular materials for use in energy and medicinal applications in a multi- and inter-disciplinary collaboration across Schools in the Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine and Health Sciences at Nottingham, and with leading academic collaborators.\n\nFunding is requested for 50% of the salary costs of the new appointee alongside key resources to establish and pump prime the research programme. This includes two 5 year postdoctoral fellowships together with consumables, equipment and associated costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M005178/1","grantId":"EP/M005178/1","fundValue":"1114550","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2019-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  LicenceSaul  Tendler","coPersons":["Martin  Schroder","Trevor Richard Farren"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
