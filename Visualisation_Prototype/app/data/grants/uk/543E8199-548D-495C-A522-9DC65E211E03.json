Whilst the precise cause of most types of glomerulonephritis is unknown, most are due to an abnormal immune response in which the immune system attacks and damages the kidney. The risk of developing glomerulonephritis is determined in part by inherited (genetic), factors but few of these have been identified. In order to investigate these genetic factors, and to develop new approaches to treatment, an experimental model of glomerulonephritis has been developed in our laboratory. By cross breeding a rat strain resistant to glomerulonephritis with a strain that is susceptible, two genetic areas have been identified that are highly likely to carry genes that confer susceptibility in the experimental model. Further selected breeding of these strains will allow us to narrow the genetic areas sufficiently to begin a search for genes related to the development of glomerulonephritis. We will examine selected genes for changes (mutations) that might explain this difference. The identification of these genes will improve our understanding of susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in the experimental model and will provide candidate genes to be investigated in human glomerulonephritis. Knowledge of these genes may lead to improved new therapies in patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400116","grantId":"G0400116","fundValue":"255555","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Herbert Terence Cook","coPersons":["Charles D Pusey","Timothy  Aitman"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
