The importance of behavioural synchrony lies in its ability to support the formation and maintenance of social bonds: Being &quot;in synch&quot; with others boosts interpersonal rapport, connectedness, trust and cooperation; being out of synch with others thwarts these outcomes. To date, most research on synchrony has been directed toward documenting its outcomes (eg, liking, perceived similarity, cooperative success).</p>\n\n<p>The funded research will provide insight into when and why synchrony promotes these outcomes, yielding the first comprehensive account of synchrony. Synchrony will be manipulated and measured in a variety of ways: manipulated, for example, by having multiple participants nod in time to musical rhythms, tap their fingers in time to visual &quot;pulses&quot; presented on a computer screen, or march in time to auditory pulses; and measured, for example, by recording the relative timing of participants' finger taps or by tracking the timing and trajectories of participants' movements.</p>\n\n<p>The research will demonstrate that behavioural synchrony imbues even neutral targets (concepts, people) with positivity; facilitates attention, perception, and memory; and changes individualsâ€™ representations of themselves and others to be more similar and more closely linked in memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J01236X/1","grantId":"ES/J01236X/1","fundValue":"328005","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kimberly  Quinn","coPersons":["John  Cacioppo"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
