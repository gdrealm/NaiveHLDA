By contrast, popular protests, movements, and insurrections in English towns have been greatly ignored. This project will (1) systematically search through sources, printed and archival, for incidents of popular insurrection in English towns, circa 1200-1450; (2) compile a database of these incidents according to type of revolt, date, duration, places, leaders, ideology, modes of communication and more; (3) analyse the data quantitatively and qualitatively, with comparisons to the history of English peasant revolts and to popular movements on the continent. Finally, the project will seek to understand the interplay and shifts in patterns of late medieval revolt, from movements that sought concrete political and economic objectives, to those that were more religiously inspired, attacked marginal groups (such as the Jews) and sought supernatural or millenarian ends.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2339","grantId":"RES-000-22-2339","fundValue":"82740","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Samuel  Cohn","coPersons":["Matthew James Strickland"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
