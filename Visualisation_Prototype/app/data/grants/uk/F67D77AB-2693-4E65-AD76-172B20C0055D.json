{"id":"F67D77AB-2693-4E65-AD76-172B20C0055D","title":"Randomised controlled trial of habit-based advice for weight control in general practice (The 10TT Trial)","abstractText":"Most weight-loss programmes aim to encourage people to adopt healthy diet and activity habits. However, changes to lifestyle are known to be difficult to keep up, and tend to slip over time. Psychological research shows that repeating a behaviour in a consistent context can result in it becoming a habit (i.e. automatic). This research will test a treatment programme that uses theories of habit-formation to help people to maintain changes in their eating and activity behaviour over the longer term. The habit-formation approach has successfully helped overweight people to lose weight and keep it off in a small-scale trial with volunteers. This research will test whether it can help larger numbers of people recruited through GPs surgeries, and establish whether it could be cost-effective if it were adopted more widely within the NHS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802027","grantId":"G0802027","fundValue":"903991","fundStart":"2010-03-22","fundEnd":"2015-03-21","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Wardle","coPersons":["Helen  Croker","John  Stapleton","Irwin  Nazareth","Stephen  Morris"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
