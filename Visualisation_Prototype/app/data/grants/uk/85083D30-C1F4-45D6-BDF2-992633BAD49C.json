{"id":"85083D30-C1F4-45D6-BDF2-992633BAD49C","title":"Acute dendritic cell responses to TLR ligands","abstractText":"Several important cells in our immune system collaborate when we are infected with a microbe or when we are vaccinated against one to activate an ?immune response?. In most cases the first cells to encounter the invader or vaccine are so called dendritic cells (DC). These cells act as messengers which ferry a processed form of the microbe or vaccine from the site of vaccination to the specialised sites in the body where other immune cells, particularly lymphocytes, are waiting to be activated. The coming together of dendritic cells and so called T lymphocytes is a key event that ultimately leads to elimination of the invader and/or to the creation of a ?memory? to allow a faster response to the same insult in the future.\n\nMany immunologists believe that better understanding of the biology of dendritic cells will help in the design of new and better performing vaccines. We are working on the early events that occur when dendritic cells encounter foreign material whether it be a vaccine or the actual pathogen. We have found that DC ?wake up? from a resting state when they sense bacterial or viral products and boost their ability to capture and process foreign material so that they can better display it to T cells. We are also studying intriguing structures called podosomes that are thought to be relevant to the journey that dendritic cells make out of the tissues towards their encounter with T cells. We have been studying the detailed biochemical signalling events that are triggered in dendritic cells by microbial material and how podosomes might be involved in aiding migration of dendritic cells. We think that more detailed knowledge will allow vaccines to be designed that are taken up more efficiently by dendritic cells and which boost their migration from the tissues to the sites where collaborations with lymphocytes take place.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701272","grantId":"G0701272","fundValue":"2222270","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin  Watts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
