{"id":"7390969F-5B72-49B2-BBBC-E39084F2644D","title":"Using reaction time tasks to address fundamental questions about theory of mind","abstractText":"<p>“Theory of mind” is the ability to reason about mental states such as beliefs, desires and intentions, which is essential for explaining and predicting behaviour. Most of our knowledge about the nature of theory of mind processes comes from studies of typically and atypically developing children, or studies of adults with brain damage or mental illness. </p> \n<p>The proposed work will study typical adults, using a newly-developed response time paradigm. Four sets of experiments, we will address the following questions: <br /></p> \n<ol> \n <li>Is belief reasoning automatic? </li> \n <li>Is belief reasoning “fast” or “slow” in comparison with desire reasoning or formally similar non-theory of mind processes? </li> \n <li>Are the truth values of beliefs necessarily encoded alongside belief contents? </li> \n <li>How specific is the content of an attributed belief?</li>\n</ol> \n<p>By addressing these questions the proposed work will also establish the use of response time methods as a new way of studying theory of mind. This work will be of relevance to psychologists and neuroscientists studying theory of mind in adults, children and other species.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1419","grantId":"RES-000-23-1419","fundValue":"96149","fundStart":"2006-05-08","fundEnd":"2008-05-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"I A  Apperly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
