{"id":"4BFD88F6-B2CB-4277-87C7-D9EC9ED3F73A","title":"Multi-scale and multi-phase modelling of mechanical and physiochemical interaction in human corneas","abstractText":"This application is seeking a short-term support to promote interdisciplinary research on human corneas and to develop research collaborations between engineer, biological scientist, and ophthalmologist. The combined skills of this unique team enable it to successfully tackle a challenging problem which can potentially improve the lives of thousands of patients. The principal objective of the project is to develop a multi-scale and multi-phasic computer model for the human cornea to determine the biomechanical deformation of in vivo corneas resulting from tissue cutting and removal. The model will be used to predict astigmatism induced by a tunnel incision in the sclera, such as is used for cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. The outcome of the proposed research not only can provide a better understanding of the corneal mechanical structure, function, and response to the biological changes but also will help us to provide a more complete design template for the next generation of ophthalmic biomaterials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902218","grantId":"G0902218","fundValue":"78293","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Long-Yuan  Li","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
