However, infections associated with such devices are an important problem affecting more than 100000 patients, and with costs to the NHS of hundreds of millions pounds, per year. These device-related infections arise because bacteria can form colonies, called biofilms, on the surface of the device. Biofilms are difficult to eradicate with antibiotics and the device often has to be removed to treat the infection. It has been known for some time that polymers of sugar-like molecules, produced by the bacteria, are important for the production of biofilms, but more recently bacterial proteins have also been implicated. We have been studying proteins that are found on the surface of Staphylococcus aureus (and also MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteria that cause many device-related infections. We have discovered how protein molecules on one bacterial cell might be activated to attach to the same protein but on different cells, thereby allowing the bacteria to clump together in colonies. We will use a variety of techniques to determine the structure of these protein-protein complexes. In particular, will determine the high resolution structure of the interaction surface and use this to start the search for small molecules that might block the interaction and lead, in the longer term, to new drugs or device materials that would reduce the incidence of these painful, debilitating, costly and life-threatening device-related infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001063","grantId":"G1001063","fundValue":"409646","fundStart":"2011-02-21","fundEnd":"2014-07-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Robyn Potts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
