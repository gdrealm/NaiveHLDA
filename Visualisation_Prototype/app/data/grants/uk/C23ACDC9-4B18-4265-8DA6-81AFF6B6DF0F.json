{"id":"C23ACDC9-4B18-4265-8DA6-81AFF6B6DF0F","title":"WEAVE: The WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer","abstractText":"WEAVE is a concept for a new wide-field, high multiplex spectroscopy facility for the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope(WHT). WEAVE will equip the WHT with a new medium/high spectral resolution dual-beam optical spectrograph (R=5000/R=20000) that will be fed with up to 1000 simultaneous fibre-optic feeds from a new 2 degree field of view prime- focus instrument. The same spectrograph can also be fed with a large single fibre-based integral field unit (IFU) with a 3x2 arcminute field of view, or with up to 30 small, individually deployable IFUs, each with a 10x12 arcsecond field of view. The main scientific objectives for WEAVE are spectroscopic follow-up of the GAIA catalogue to sample the dynamics and chemical evolution of the Milky Way at faint magnitudes and large radial distances; to study galaxy evolution at modest redshifts (z&lt;0.4) using resolved kinematics of up to 100,000 galaxies with complementary neutral hydrogen observations from the APERTIF instrument at Westerbork, and to study the evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe and test theories of Dark Energy by means of follow-up observations of the LOFAR medium deep wide-field radio imaging survey.\nThis proposal covers the second stage of Oxford's work on the fibre positioning system for the Preliminary Design Phase of WEAVE with the primary objective of developing the complete positioner concept and the interfaces between the positioner system and the telescope top-end ring structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K005103/1","grantId":"ST/K005103/1","fundValue":"69539","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Dalton","coPersons":["Ian John Lewis"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
