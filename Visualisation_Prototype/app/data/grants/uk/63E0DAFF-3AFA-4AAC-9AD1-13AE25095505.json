They occupy every conceivable niche in the environment and they are incredibly diverse in the ways they can survive and thrive in even the most difficult places. They are major players in most of the key cycles that keep our planet clean and fresh. They inhabit our bodies and the friendly bacteria in our guts help us digest food and protect us from disease. Bacteria are also some of the most deadly disease-causing agents. For all of these reasons, we need to understand the fundamental properties of bacteria. Bacterial cells differ from our own in possessing a tough outer shell called the wall. This critical structure protects the cells from damage and prevents the cell contents from bursting due to the high inside pressure they like to maintain. TA particularly interesting feature of the wall is that it needs to be enlarged to accommodate cell growth, whilst at all times remaining intact. Because the cell wall is critical and there is no equivalent structure in human cells, the wall is also the target for the best of our antibiotics. Despite its importance, our understanding of the wall and how it is made remain rather poor. The object of this project is to study the properties of the wall in a well characterized bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, which is very amenable to experimentation. We wish to identify all of the factors that are needed to make a wall and study how they work, from the whole cell, right down to the molecular level. The knowledge that emerges will have important implications for our understanding of wall synthesis in all bacteria, and it may help us to find new antibiotics that will help to keep disease agents at bay.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G015902/1","grantId":"BB/G015902/1","fundValue":"3201600","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  At this stage, impact has not been assessed but will be at the end of the project.
