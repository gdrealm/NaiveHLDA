The nutritional benefits of fish consumption have a positive link to increased food security and decreased poverty rates in developing countries. Fish, particularly produced through aquaculture, is commonly cheaper than other animal feed, and can be consumed by lower income individuals. Fish also contains much higher protein levels, as well as other important minerals and vitamins. Increased availability of fish can mean better health and a more diverse diet.\nUndoubtedly promoting and maintaining fish health is paramount for enhancing fish production.\nExtensive research has shown that microbes that reside in the intestine have important roles in maintaining and promoting the health of the host. They can breakdown some food materials to some essential nutrients and vitamins important to maintaining immunity, health and well-being of the host. The microbes also protect the gut from colonization by pathogenic bacteria. \nThe identity of fish gut microbial composition and how they can be influenced by environmental, dietary and developmental factors is in its infancy. There are carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish which naturally select specific diets. We do not know if their digestive physiology can adapt to consume commercial feed. This knowledge is important of formulation of appropriate feed to avoid digestive problems.\nIn this project, a group of scientists knowledgeable in nutrition, intestinal physiology/microbiology and intestinal adaptation to dietary change aim to assess the impact of i) habitat (farms), ii) fish species of different dietary habits, iii) diet and iv) fish maturation, on the microbial populations that reside in the fish intestine.\nThe intestinal content of 1) adult carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish obtained from different locations (farms) and 2) fry of the same species, grown under controlled conditions and maintained on different defined diets, will be used. Using modern technologies, the precise composition of microbial populations, and the nutrients they produce, will be determined. Other bodily parameters such as growth, food conversion ratio, and gut morphology will be assessed.\nAnticipated outcomes are: \nProving information on microbial populations that reside in intestines of herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous fish.\nIdentifying contributions of environment, diet and fish species on the composition and activity of gut microbes.\nGaining knowledge on the responses of predominant microbial populations to environment, diet, host and developmental signals.\nImpact: Characterization of gut microbiota during fish maturation and in fish with different dietary habits will allow scientifically-based feed (feed supplement) formulation to enhance selective gut microbial populations that promote fish growth, health and productivity.\nBenefits from this research are to:\nFish: The correct diet will maintain and promote fish health and welfare, prevent disease and increase productivity.\nThe public: Increasing availability of fish means better health and more diverse diet.\nSociety and Economy: Contributing towards wealth creation and economic prosperity. Commercial aquaculture has the potential to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\nR&amp;D investment from global business.\nThe commercialisation and exploitation of scientific knowledge, leading to interaction with industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M026531/1","grantId":"BB/M026531/1","fundValue":"248622","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Soraya  Shirazi-Beechey","coPersons":["Iain Stuart Young","Neil  Hall","Andrew Robert Cossins"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
