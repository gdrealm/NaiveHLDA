This can often lead to products different from those obtained using usual chemical reagents and heat. Unfortunately, photochemistry is no easier to control than thermal chemistry and often a mixture of producs are obtained. Coherent control aims to use the electric field generated by a laser to direct a chemical reaction. This can be done by using a specially shaped pulse of laser light. How to shape the pulse is a technically difficult problem. How this pulse brings about the control is a theoretically difficult problem. The proposed research is to set up a network of researchers to discuss and solve these problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D070651/1","grantId":"EP/D070651/1","fundValue":"15458","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Fielding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
