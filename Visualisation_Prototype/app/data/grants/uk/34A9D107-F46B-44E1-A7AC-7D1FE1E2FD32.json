{"id":"34A9D107-F46B-44E1-A7AC-7D1FE1E2FD32","title":"Historical grammar of the Neapolitan dialect","abstractText":"The project sets out to describe, compare and analyse a broad range of phonological and, in particular, morph syntactic structure in the various historical stages of the Neapolitan dialect, a previously little-studied Romance variety, bringing together traditional philological and dialectological scholarship with the state-of-the-are in linguistic analysis. The final output of the project will be a one-volume monograph tracing the phonological and morph syntactic development of Neapolitan from the 13th century to the present-day, together with a number of accompanying journal article reporting on, and developing further where relevant, particular findings presented in the monograph.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112648/1","grantId":"112648/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-03-26","fundEnd":"2006-06-25","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Adam Noel Ledgeway","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
