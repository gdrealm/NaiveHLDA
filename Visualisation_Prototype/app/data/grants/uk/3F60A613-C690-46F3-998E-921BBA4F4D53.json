These are special particle interaction that are very well predicted by the Standard Model of Particle Physics, while being very rare; therefore any enhancement is a clear evidence for new physics; if there is no evidence, then new physics models can be constrained and refined. The output of the research is been used to constrain physics models and is being combined with other measurements from different research in the field. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
