{"id":"52BA523A-569D-4F83-BE27-F763FADB16B2","title":"Next generation Y analogue for treatment of obesity","abstractText":"Obesity is a very common disease. Over 1 in 4 people in the UK are obese. Together, these diseases afflict 300 million people and cause an estimated 3 million premature deaths a year. We need a new, cheaper and adjustable treatment for obesity that acts to reduce appetite so that patients can lose weight.\n\nPeptide YY (PYY) is a hormone that the bowels make in response to eating. PYY naturally suppresses appetite. We have developed a new medication called Y3394 based on PYY which can be injected under the skin in patients, and which acts to reduce appetite (and therefore weight).\n\nIn this project, we are aiming to study the safety of this drug in healthy volunteers, and to check how long the drug stays around in the blood stream. We will also make preliminary measurements to understand if this drug can cause these volunteers to lose weight. In this way we are developing Y3394 as a new treatment for obesity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L013088/1","grantId":"MR/L013088/1","fundValue":"3953800","fundStart":"2014-05-31","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen R Bloom","coPersons":["Tricia Mei-Mei Tan","Deborah  Ashby","James Stephen Minnion"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
