{"id":"4BFE4CB1-FCD6-465F-9B14-FB5D67DEA608","title":"Intertemporal Labour Supply in an Implicit Contract Model: An International Comparison of Micro Data Estimates","abstractText":"<p>The standard model used by economists to explain an individual’s lifetime hours of work decision has performed poorly when tested. This failure has resulted in the development of many alternative views on this decision, and this project will examine the specific alternative that views the hours’ decision in a consumption insurance framework. This viewpoint has done well when tested and this research project has three specific goals to extend the empirical testing of it. First, it will explore functional and statistical issues associated with using this framework which ensures conclusions are not an artifact of a particular structure used. Second, most research uses an individual decision-making framework but this project proposes to extend the analysis to the family decision-making context, representing a significant extension on the existing literature. Finally, data from the United Kingdom and the United States will be used, so there is an important international comparison component to this project. In conclusion, the value added of this project is that outputs will add significantly to the international evidence on a theory of how labour markets operate in industrialized economies, and will have direct and indirect effects on theoretical and policy debates.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004209/1","grantId":"ES/D004209/1","fundValue":"43380","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin Towns Reilly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
