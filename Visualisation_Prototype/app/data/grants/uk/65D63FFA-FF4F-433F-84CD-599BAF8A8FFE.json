The Institute is recognised internationally for its remarkably strong track record in delivery of novel biological therapies for eye disease and stem cell therapy in particular (e.g. first-in-man gene therapy, stem cell therapy for ocular surface disease, stem cell therapy for advanced Stargardt's, stem cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration [AMD] on target for 2013). An in-house cytometry facility with state-of-the-art equipment for analysis and sorting of stem and progenitor cells will to help to maintain UCL Institute of Ophthalmology as a world leading world centre for ocular cell transplantation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L012758/1","grantId":"MR/L012758/1","fundValue":"674615","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Raihan Ali","coPersons":["Peter John Coffey","Julie Theresa Daniels","Gloria Astrid Limb","James W.B.
