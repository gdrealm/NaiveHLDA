The Surrey group leads a continuing programme of studies at ISOL facilities which complements measurements at the Fragmentation Recoil Separator at GSI. Two major experiments to investigate a) the proton single-particle orbitals below the Z=82 closed shell by detecting isomeric decays in 201-205Au and b) measuring the shapes of the 184-194Pb ground state. These experiments have been approved by the International PAC at CERN-ISOLDE and are scheduled for running in 2007. The experiments will make use of two experimental setups we have already established at CERN-ISOLDE. Bridging resources are requested in order to retain UK strategic leadership in this area. In particular no postdoctoral support is available to be allocated from the UK to support the setting up and running of these scheduled experiments, but this is vital to maintain UK leadership. Support for academic travel and some technical assistance is also needed. Support is also requested for a visiting researcher, Dr.M. Gorska, whose expertise in Shell Model calculations for doubly closed shell nuclei is vital for the interpretation of the first experiment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/F000707/1","grantId":"PP/F000707/1","fundValue":"200884","fundStart":"2007-11-07","fundEnd":"2010-02-06","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Zsolt  Podolyak","coPersons":["Philip Malzard  Walker","Wilton  Catford","Patrick Henry Regan","William  Gelletly"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":" The main findings:\nA range of experiments were run at CERN-ISOLDE:\n(i) identification of single-particle orbitals in 205Au: the Surrey-led experiment was performed in 2008. Results were published in a Phys. Rev. C article, with a second one in preparation. The beam intensity during the experiment was orders of magnitudes below the expected one, therefore the experiment will be repeated. It is scheduled for 9-11 September 2010.\n(ii) experiment to measure the shapes of the Tl isotopes using the Total Absorption Spectrometer developed by the Valencia-Surrey collaboration. The decays of 188,190,192Pb into Tl were studied, with the data being analysed by the Valencia group.\n(iii) Magnetic dipole moments of high-K isomeric states in Hf isotopes. Experiment performed in 2008. Due to problems with the radioactive beam, parts of the experiment was repeated in 2009. Longer lifetimes needed.
