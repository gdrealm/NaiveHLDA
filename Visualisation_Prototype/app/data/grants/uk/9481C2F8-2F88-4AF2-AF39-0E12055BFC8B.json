{"id":"9481C2F8-2F88-4AF2-AF39-0E12055BFC8B","title":"MASTER - Proposal for providing work to continue activity of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) 2009 - 2014","abstractText":"UKERC's over-arching aim is to provide, and communicate the outcomes of, high-quality energy\nresearch to inform the actions that government in the UK and other stakeholders must take to ensure that\nthe energy sector moves forward along a path compatible with climate policy goals, energy security, the\nwider international framework and environmental, social and economic needs.\nThe case for support for a second phase of the UK Energy Research Centre focuses on three areas of\nactivity: a) an interdisciplinary, whole systems research programme with an increasingly international\nfocus; b) capacity building activities through interdisciplinary PhD training and support for early career\nresearchers; and c) a range of knowledge exchange activities aimed at disseminating knowledge,\nreinforcing the cohesion of the UK energy research community, connecting it effectively with stakeholder\ngroups and enhancing links with international energy researchers.\nThe research programme is framed by a cluster of research and scientific challenges responding to a\nrapidly changing energy agenda driven by environmental and security concerns. The challenges are:\ndriving systemic change in the energy sector; managing environmental impacts; and enhancing energy\nsecurity and resilience. The challenges will be met by drawing on competences within four research\nthemes, each interdisciplinary in character and each led by a senior UK researcher. The themes are:\nEnergy Demand; Energy Supply; Energy and Environment; and Energy Systems. In addition, a\nTechnology and Policy Assessment function will conduct in-depth reviews of difficult topics within the\nenergy domain, building on the systematic review approaches developed in Phase I. We propose\nmechanisms for defining and commissioning a flexible programme of research which will develop in\nresponse to emerging needs and will engage a much wider range of researchers who can contribute to the\nenergy agenda.\nThe principal capacity building mechanisms will be an interdisciplinary studentship competition, an\nannual summer school and support for the &quot;SPARKS&quot; early career network.\nKnowledge exchange will be delivered through: a) a continuation of the Phase I communications function\ntargeting the media and opinion-forming groups; and b) a more tightly specified Networking function,\nunder whose auspices we will operate the successful Meeting Place function; maintain and develop, with\nan increasing emphasis on roadmapping activity, the UK Energy Research Atlas; and use mechanisms\nsuch as meetings, newsletters and the website to operate the National Energy Research Network (NERN)\nin order to connect the UK energy research community both internally and with other stakeholders in the\nUK and overseas.\nWe propose that a core partnership of six institutions will be led by the Executive and Research Directors\noperating from the Headquarters at Imperial College. The governance structure which operated under\nPhase I, comprising the Supervisory Board, Advisory Board and Directors' Committee, will be\nstrengthened by creating a new Research Committee comprising both members of the core consortium,\nmembers of the wider community and other stakeholders. This will oversee the flexible programme of\nresearch and the studentship competition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G007748/1","grantId":"NE/G007748/1","fundValue":"18529300","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"John  Loughhead","coPersons":["Terry  Barker","Jim A Halliday","John  Barrett","Robert John Lowe","Jacquelin  Burgess","Paul  Ekins","Jim  Skea","Carol Mary Turley","Robin  Wallace","Nick  Jenkins","Goran  Strbac","Jillian Leigh Anable","Kevin Miles  Hiscock","Mel  Austen","Nick  Eyre","Andrew  Lovett","Geoffrey Paul Hammond","Catherine Hilary Mitchell","Neil  Strachan","Robert  Gross","Ian Julian  Bateman","Robert Kerry  Turner","Alan James Bond"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
