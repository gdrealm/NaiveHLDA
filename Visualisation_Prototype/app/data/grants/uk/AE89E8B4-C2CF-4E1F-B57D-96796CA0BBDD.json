Primary cilia function to help cells sense their environment and are linked to molecular pathways which communicate changes in the extra-cellular environment to other cells. Primary cilia play a role in many different systems and are important for sensing both the external environment and maintaining homeostasis (equilibrium of the bodies systems) within the organism. For example, on the surface of cells responsible for smell, odour receptors are located at the primary cilia; furthermore they are essential for vision as photoreceptor, the cells type at the back of the eye which detect light, have a specialised primary cilia structure. Primary cilia are also found on the surface of cells lining tubules in the kidney where they detect the flow of fluid. Unsurprisingly compromised primary cilia structure and/or function can cause disorders such as blindness and kidney disease. Recently it has also been recognised that defects in primary cilia function may be linked to much more common health problems such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Thus it is important to fully understand how primary cilia work and the processes involved in their construction and maintenance. This application aims to elucidate such processes. Proteins are the essential biological molecules that build the machines which allow the body function. Most proteins work in multi-protein complexes. Clues as to which proteins may play a role in primary cilia function have come from a range of experimental techniques including models of disease and screens that have attempted to define all of the proteins present in motile cilia (another type of cilia which have a different internal structure and perform different functions). Members of a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones have consistently been identified as important for normal cilia function. Molecular chaperones help other proteins perform their functions. One key cellular role of molecular chaperones is to help other proteins assemble into multi-protein complexes. I hypothesise that molecular chaperones are important for assembly of such multi-protein complexes in primary cilia. This proposal aims to identify which molecular chaperones are present in primary cilia and define their roles. Molecular chaperone do not function in isolation, but work together in molecular 'machines'. Multiple components of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone machine are predicted to be present in primary cilia and it is on this molecular chaperone system that we will focus. To find out more about the Hsp70 molecular chaperone machinery and understand what it does in primary cilia we will perform a comprehensive series of experiments. These will identifying which molecular chaperones are present in primary cilia, where precisely they are located in the structure, which proteins they interact with and what happens to primary cilia when they are absent. Completing these goals will advance our understanding of the cellular roles of molecular chaperones. It will also identify proteins which are important for primary cilia function; some of these may be important for human disease and/or represent targets for therapeutic intervention in human disease such as obesity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E009824/1","grantId":"BB/E009824/1","fundValue":"291936","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2010-04-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research has formed the basis of further research projects for my group and has been of use to other academics.

This includes responding to chemical cues from other cells. This process of detecting extracellular signals, conducting them into the cell and activating a response constitutes cellular signalling. Understanding how cell-signalling systems work is important as problems with these complex communication networks cause human disease.\n\n\n\nThe majority of mammalian cells have a hair like structure called the primary cilia that helps to coordinate the activity of specific signalling pathways. Primary cilia protrude from the surface of cells into the extracellular environment, detecting chemical signals from other cells. This function is analogous to acting as a cellular antenna. The importance of primary cilia is underlined by the fact that genetic mutations, which lead to aberrant cilia function, result in syndromes with a broad range of clinical phenotypes. These include retinal degeneration, cystic kidney disease, obesity, skeletal abnormalities and neurosensory deficits. There is also evidence that primary cilia function is disrupted as part of the disease mechanism in common conditions such as cancers.\n\n\n\nIn this project we investigated how primary cilia respond to stressful stimuli in the cellular microenvironment. We also looked at whether a group of proteins that are important in the cellular response to stress, known as molecular chaperones, play a role in cilia maintenance and function. We discovered that in mammalian cells and fish embryos elevated temperatures resulted in a rapid loss of primary cilia and attenuation of cilia mediated signalling. The biochemical pathway that controlled the loss of primary cilia was identified as dependent on a protein called HDAC6. This protein has the ability to alter the stability of microtubules, which are a key structural component of primary cilia. In cells that had previously been exposed to a period of elevated temperature rates of cilia resorption were reduced. Molecular chaperones are upregulated after heat shock so we hypothesised that this implied a role for molecular chaperones in primary cilia maintenance. We found an important chaperone, called Hsp90, was localised in cilia and its inhibition resulted in cilia loss. In the cytoplasm of unstressed cells Hsp90 is known to exist in a complex with HDAC6. Immediately after heat shock Hsp90 levels were reduced in remaining ciliary axonemes. We hypothesise cilia resorption serves to attenuate cilia mediated signalling pathways in response to extracellular stress and that this mechanism is regulated by disassembly of an HDAC6/Hsp90 complex. Overall the work suggests that cells are able to tune cilia mediated signalling in response to a changing cellular microenvironment. It may also help explain changes in cilia-mediated signalling under pathological conditions.\n\n\n\nWe also identified a number of other molecular chaperones that potentially play a role in the primary cilium. This was a basic science project and at this stage it is difficult to see how the findings can be used in a non-academic context. Primary cilia are lost when cells divide. Thus the presence of a primary cilium is believed to act as a checkpoint for cell cycle progression. This suggests primary cilia play a critical role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. This means there is a great interest in studying the mechanisms that mediate cilia length change and resorption.
