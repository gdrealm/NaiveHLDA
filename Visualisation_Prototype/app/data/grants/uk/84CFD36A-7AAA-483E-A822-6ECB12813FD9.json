We have recently found that gold nanoparticle-catalysed oxidations proceed via formation of highly reactive free radical intermediates. The proposed reserearch aims to detect free radicals in other related processes. We will use spin trapping and EPR spectroscopy to determine the structure and quantity of the radicals formed. The information obtained will help us develop greater understanding of the mechanism of catalytic reactions, and the factors which affect the yield and selectivity in these reactions. The results of the proposed research will ultimately help optimise nanoparticle-catalysed reactions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001629/1","grantId":"EP/E001629/1","fundValue":"271920","fundStart":"2006-11-15","fundEnd":"2009-11-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Victor  Chechik","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
