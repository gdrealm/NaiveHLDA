{"id":"D36D2BB1-DFA8-4101-9D11-F2EF1309BE62","title":"The Beijing Olympics, new media and identity in contemporary China","abstractText":"<p>The organisers of the Beijing Olympics have designated the 2008 Games the ‘high-tech Olympics’, emphasising their role in national ‘informatisation’ – the promotion of new media, information and communications technologies throughout the country. Both the Olympics and new media have also been linked by the government to the formulation of present and future national identities.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on new media such as digital television, the internet and mobile telecommunications, this research investigates the impact of government discourses and new media on the construction of new Chinese social, political and cultural identities through the mediated event of the Beijing Olympics. The Olympics are often associated with a heightened sense of unified national identity and the Beijing Games will play a crucial role in defining how China is understood in coming decades both in China and throughout the world. Yet, contemporary Chinese society is diverse and divided with contending social, cultural and political identities in play. New media, with their tendency to fragment audiences and personalise media use, play a key role in this process.</p>\n\n<p>This research will investigate the tensions and contradictions between the unifying agenda of the 2008 Olympics themselves and new media practices that mobilise such contending identities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2637","grantId":"RES-000-22-2637","fundValue":"62486","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Latham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
