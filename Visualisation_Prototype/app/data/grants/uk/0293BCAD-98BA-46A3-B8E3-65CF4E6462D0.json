{"id":"0293BCAD-98BA-46A3-B8E3-65CF4E6462D0","title":"Unruly Relations: Politics, Poetics and Visual Culture in Peru, 1923-1933","abstractText":"The years 1900-1933 represent a fundamental period of Peruvian intellectual history which saw the continuity of a process of reconstruction and the founding of an intellectual and cultural tradition after the country's defeat in the Pacific War {1879-1883). But these years were also marked by intense conflict generated by longstanding divisions and new rivalries. A postwar generation of intellectuals and artists, led by Jose Carlos Maricltegui and galvanized by leftwing ideology, sought representation in the fields of politics and art, and participation in the process of reconstruction initiated by a conservative oligarchy. New ideas about politics and the arts raised their awareness of the cultural diversity and fragile sense of nationhood in Peru, and the need for a new project of nation-formation, and a shared cultural memory. They also gave rise to divergent political and artistic practices and projects. Though cut short by military dictatorship in 1933, these projects left an important legacy for future intellectuals and artists, opening numerous political and artistic pathways for them. These paths would consolidate a multifaceted Peruvian intellectual and cultural tradition, and revive calls for a cultural project of reconstruction in the 1960s.\n\nThis research examines the sociopolitical and cultural circumstances, and new conceptions of politics and the arts, which shaped diverse male and female political and artistic practices, projects and interpretations in this formative period of Peruvian modernity. It also assesses the ways in which led to the development of an intellectual tradition and a shared, or 'mestizo', cultural memory. There has recently been new academic interest in the Peruvian avant-garde and 'lndigenismo', a movement concerned with the question of Indian identity. But there has been little, if any, research, and none in English, on the connections between contextual conditions and conceptions of politics and the arts in Peru at this time. There has also been little analysis of how these conceptions produced myriad political and artistic practices, projects and interpretations, or of how these contributed to the forging of a common intellectual and cultural consciousness, and to nation-building. The main aims and objectives of my research are:\n\nAn analysis of the sociopolitical and cultural circumstances and conceptions of politics and the arts which gave rise to a variety of political and artistic practices and projects, and interpretations of the problems of cultural diversity and identity, particularly between 1923-1933.\n\nA comparative analysis of a range of these practices, projects and interpretations.\n\nAn assessment of the particular contribution of 'lndigenistas' and female intellectuals to these developments.\n\nAn evaluation of these practices, projects and interpretations in terms of the creation of a common intellectual and cultural consciousness, and a project of nation-formation.\n\nAn appraisal of this period's legacy for consolidating a multifaceted Peruvian intellectual and cultural tradition, and reviving calls for a cultural project of reconstruction in future years.\n\nThis work will produce a monograph, an article and a conference paper. Visual material will be incorporated into a CD-ROM and into webpages. These will be shown in seminars and conferences through PowerPoint, and will also be available on the Internet. Additionally, this study will feed into a new undergraduate module and postgraduate seminars on the avant-garde in Latin America. This research brings together and builds on work previously carried out on political and artistic developments in Peru between 1900 -1933. It achieves this by examining the connections between these formations and by assessing the emergence of a heterogeneous intellectual and cultural tradition. It sets out a new way of thinking about this decisive period of Peruvian intellectual history which will benefit academics and students today.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501393/1","grantId":"AH/D501393/1","fundValue":"18178","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2007-02-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Melisa  Moore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
