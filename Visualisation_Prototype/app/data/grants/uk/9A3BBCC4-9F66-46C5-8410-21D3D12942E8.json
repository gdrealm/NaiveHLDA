The Identification of best market opportunities, based on a market survey conducted on behalf of Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence, will be highlighted.Phase 2: Starbon scale up and use in catalytic transformations of fermentation broths: this includes the preparation of larger amounts of Starbons and modified Starbons. As well as material characterisation (porosimetry, FTIR, SEM and TEM analysis), simple and rapid application tests such as adsorption studies will be developed to ensure quality control of the product. These materials will be utilised as catalysts for the conversion of fermentation broth products (esterification, hydrogenation and oxidation reactions) to platform molecules. Liaise with prospective buyers for the commercialisation of this product. Intellectual MeritStarbons, a novel class of mesoporous carbonaceous materials, prepared without the use of templating agent obtained from native polysaccharides will be produced. The optimised Starbon preparation method will provide a route to reduce production costs and scale up the process for the commercialisation of this product. This research provides environmentally benign, efficient (no template required), non toxic and low cost route to applications of mesoporous carbonaceous materials in catalysis. This will be achieved by using expertise of materials chemistry and novel polysaccharide science at York and utilising fermentation broths from BioAmber, Agricultural University of Athens, University of Patras and Satake Grain Processing Centre at the University of Manchester.Broader Impacts of the Proposed Research:1. Utilisation of waste polysaccharides would both create a use for this unwanted resource and reduce production costs. 2. The development of catalytic processes for the conversion of molecules from fermentation broths to high value platform molecules would be of benefit to both the University of York and would also add additional value to the energy, biochemical research and industry sectors.3. The materials community will benefit by further research in natural products and in particular, biomass-based materials are used for higher technology applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H027858/1","grantId":"EP/H027858/1","fundValue":"145105","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James Hanley Clark","coPersons":["D  MacQuarrie"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" It is possible to scale-up the production of Starbon materials to commercial volumes (100s of KG).
