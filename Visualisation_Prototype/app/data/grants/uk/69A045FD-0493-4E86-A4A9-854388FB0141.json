These individual differences are controlled by the combined effects of a number of different genes and the particular environmental influences encountered by the animal. Animal breeders have used such genetic variation between animals to select improved breeds with particular desired characteristics such as reduced fatness or improved disease resistance. However, until recently there has been little understanding of the individual genes and the metabolic pathways that control variation between individuals. Over the past few years molecular genetic tools have been developed that have helped start the process of investigating the genetic control of trait variation. A recent development has been the application of 'genome-wide association studies' (GWAS) which attempt to locate genes influencing particular traits by identifying associations between the trait and the inheritance of genetic markers spread across the genome. A key development has been that of genotyping 'chips' that facilitate the automated simultaneous analysis of tens or hundreds of thousands of a particular type of genetic marker called a 'single nucleotide polymorphism' (SNP). Analyses in which up to 1 million SNPs are genotyped across several thousand individuals to identify associations between individual SNPs and a trait of interest have been widely applied in studies of human populations to identify genes associated with disease. More recently the same approaches have started to be applied to populations of pigs, chickens or cattle. This has been both to understand the genetic control of traits of economic and welfare importance in livestock and to enable the application of genomic selection tools that enhance the breeders' ability to select the best animals for breeding purposes. Although GWAS have been successful in identifying new genes and pathways controlling trait variation, the now extensive experience gained in studies of human populations suggests that only a minor proportion of the genetic variation can be identified in this way. This seems to be because the methods of analysis used are not effective at identifying genetic variants that only have a small influence on the trait or that are rare in the population. We have recently developed a new approach to analysing data from GWAS that by combining information from a number of adjacent SNPs has been more effective at identifying regions in the genome that may contain several variants of small effect. The purpose of this project is to extend this approach further by using information on 'haplotypes' - the particular combination of genetic variants carried by an individual in a short region of the genome. This should provide a more complete description of an individual's genetic make-up and hence allow analyses that have greater ability to detect genes contributing to variation in particular traits. We will develop computer software that allows these analyses to be performed effectively and test the performance of this new method using artificially generated data, where we know the true nature of the data. We will also demonstrate the analyses in comparison with other approaches in the analyses of real data from pigs, poultry and human populations. The successful completion of the project will provide data analysis methods that make better use of GWAS data from existing and future projects. This will make an important contribution to our understanding of the control of variation of economic and welfare importance in livestock and hence help breed robust and healthy animals that have minimum impact on the environment. The same methods can also be used to analyse data on disease and other traits in human populations and so contribute to our understanding of human health and disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J002844/1","grantId":"BB/J002844/1","fundValue":"262563","fundStart":"2012-05-24","fundEnd":"2015-05-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Simon Haley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" We have shown that we can use data from genome-wide association studies in a more effective way to identify genomic regions affecting complex traits in humans, livestock and other species.
