{"id":"84EDD163-D3AC-4851-89A0-3CB20754EB59","title":"The Literature of Shetland and Orkney","abstractText":"The project is a collaboration between the Shetland Museum and Archive, the Orkney Library and Archive, and the University of Edinburgh. It will draw on the AHRB-funded research of the Principal Investigator into the history of Shetland and Orkney literature, and the literary record of visitors to the islands, to explore and illustrate the significance of this research in a wide public context.\n\nThe PI will work in close collaboration with an archivist from the Shetland Museum and Archive to provide the content and thematic structure for the first ever exhibition of Northern Islands literature, provisionally entitled 'Shetland and Orkney: Writing from History'. The exhibition will draw on printed material and sound recordings from the Shetland Archive and Orkney Library, and artefacts from the Shetland Museum and Orkney Museum, to illustrate the social development of literature in the islands and explore its relevance to readers and writers in the islands today.\n\nThe project is guided by three related principles. We aim to develop and deepen understanding of the significance of the archival holdings by bringing together the written word with historical images and objects. We further aim to extend and enhance public understanding of a literary history that has been sometimes neglected or forgotten, for both a local and a wider audience. Thirdly we seek to bring together academic researchers with contemporary creative writers to form partnerships that will work together to explore the nature and significance of island writing from the late eighteenth century to the present day.\n\nIn order to draw these principles together, the project will develop into two complementary directions. We will explore the history of Shetland and Orkney writing by setting literary texts in their social and cultural environments. Original printed books and magazines will show how the texts were published; artefacts from daily life will illustrate the social settings of the texts; listening posts and mp3s will give the texts local voices; illustrations and paintings will bring to life authors, characters and settings. At the same time we will explore the relevance of writers from history for contemporary poets and novelists and use historical writing to inspire new work. Eight creative writers from the islands will work together with academic researchers to discuss a piece of literature from the earlier period and will create original work in response. The outcomes will be published on the website as a downloadable file.\n\nThe project will take place over a full year. An opening workshop, 'Pentland Crossings', will bring researchers and writers together in Edinburgh to share ideas about island writing in a public workshop. The researcher-writer partnerships will then start to create a written discussion which will be archived, edited, and made available on the website. Mid-way through the project, the Orkney partnerships will participate in 'Creative Journeys', a public event in Stromness to explain the project, discuss its creative value and read selected work-in-progress. A small exhibition of Orkney literature will take place at the Orkney library. An education programme will engage school students with the literature of their locality and encourage their own creative responses. The major exhibition will run for six weeks in the Shetland Museum at the end of the project. The opening of the exhibition will be accompanied by a day of talks and round-table discussions with an educational focus, and the end of the exhibition will see a more informal forum to celebrate Shetland and Orkney writing with readings of the outcomes of the writer-researcher partnerships. The website and selected items from the exhibition will then pass into the ownership of the Shetland museum, giving the museum a new additional literary focus, and the project an on-going life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005065/1","grantId":"AH/K005065/1","fundValue":"91774","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Shetland Museum and Archives have mounted a major exhibition on the history of Northern Islands writing, some of which has been transferred to their permanent collection. Four Shetland schools made videos based on the literary culture of Shetland and used the teaching packs created from the project. 8 poets collaborated with researchers for knowledge exchange, resulting in a new book of poetry. This book is now being used by Education Scotland's representative for Orkney and Shetland to promote Scots in schools. BBC Scotland requested interviews from members of the project to introduce new strands into their arts programming. The partnerships between researchers and poets are feeding into new creative writing, and two poets from the project have been asked to participate in a similar scheme, directly modelled on the Writing the North partnerships, in Canada. The project site has been embedded as a link by VisitScotland (Scotland's tourist board).
