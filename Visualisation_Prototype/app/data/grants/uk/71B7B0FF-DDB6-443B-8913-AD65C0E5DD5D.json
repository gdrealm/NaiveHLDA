{"id":"71B7B0FF-DDB6-443B-8913-AD65C0E5DD5D","title":"A UK-China partnership for energy and materials recovery in steelmaking","abstractText":"In 2013 approximately 110 Mt &quot;waste&quot; slag was produced worldwide at temperatures of 1650 oC containing ~25% of FeO,\nmaking it a potential source of energy and raw material. This work aims to combine and implement two concepts developed\nin the laboratory to industrial steelmaking. The first is to convert the thermal heat of the slag into hydrogen (from water),\nwhich can be used to lower the in-house C footprint or exported externally as a fuel. Secondly the valuable metal oxides\nare recovered for in-house re-use and lower raw materials usage or exported for other purposes. Both concepts are based\non controlling the gas atmosphere. The project aims toat developing fundamental knowledge on the slag structure and its\nevolution as function of gas atmosphere and temperature (WP1 and WP2) and based thereupon, design and build an\nindustrial test-reactor for carrying out the process (WP3). If implemented worldwide, it is envisaged that the process, if\nsuccessful, could save over $3,300 M based on the BOS steel produced in 2013. In addition, the recovery of heat and\nvaluable chemicals contributes to a more green and energy and raw-material resilient steel industry.\nThe Warwick group will lead on the development of the integrated heat-materials recovery process, completing scale-up\ntrials to recover both the thermal energy (producing syngas fuel) and valuable metal elements in oxide forms (e.g. Fe3O4\nand Fe2MnO4). They will also be involved in WP2 - providing support for materials recovery and WP3 - advice for the pilot\nplant trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507829/1","grantId":"EP/M507829/1","fundValue":"234788","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sridhar  Seetharaman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
