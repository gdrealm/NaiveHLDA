Their manufacture is a growth industry with worldwide production exceeding 150 million tons per year. The most commonly used feedstocks are fossil fuels, with around 7% of worldwide oil and gas being consumed in plastics manufacture. Such resources, although technically renewable, are estimated to be depleted in the next hundred years. Aside from the problems with petrochemicals sustainability and supply, they are becoming increasingly costly. The disposal of waste plastics is also of concern as the majority go into landfill (where they are bulky and pervasive); the recycling of commodity plastics has also recently suffered an economic collapse. There is a clear need for home-compostable plastics which derive from renewable (but inexpensive) resources for commodity applications (packaging). Such materials are also of great interest for medical applications, provided they degrade to metabolites. The proposal focuses on the polymerisation of carbohydrates, derived from lignocellulosic biomass, to give highly functionalized and rapidly degradable plastics. Lignocellulosic biomass derives primarily from non-food crops such as fast growing trees (e.g. poplar or willow) or from grasses (e.g. switch grass). This proposal will use lignocellulosic biomass (i.e. it will not rely on crops such as corn or sugar beet) as the feedstock for plastics production. This is important because it will not deprive poorer communities of essential food crops. Specifically, the feedstocks will be D-glucose, a carbohydrate derived from both cellulose and hemicelluloses, which in turn constitute 55-85% of the plant mass. Such carbohydrates are highly attractive feedstocks for chemicals production as they are abundant, inexpensive and highly functionalised. They are also cost competitive with common petrochemicals and solvents. The plastics prepared in the proposal are 100% degradable and compostable, ultimately they are broken down in soil or in the body to give naturally occurring by-products. The new materials are targeted for use in a variety of applications, including being used in compostable packaging, in particular they will facilitate the disposal and home-composting profile of currently commercial degradable plastics. Furthermore, the degradation of the new materials will be exploited for specialized medical applications. Specifically, we will study the use of the polymers as scaffolds in tissue rengeration; the key advantage of the new materials are the unusual physical properties they display and the ability to fully degrade them in the body. The proposal will involve overcoming key technical barriers to the widespread production and use of the new materials. The new technologies to be developed include developing the preparation, properties, degradation profile and end uses/applications of the materials. The proposal involves collaborations between four academic groups across various discplines (Chemistry, Materials, BioEngineering and Biology at Imperial College London and in Chemistry at Nottingham University) and with two companies (Uhde Inventa Fischer and Bioceramic therapeutics).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00713X/1","grantId":"EP/H00713X/1","fundValue":"140749","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Katherine Williams","coPersons":["Molly  Stevens"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" The 'plastic age' dominates to such an extent that it would be difficult to imagine life without them.

Furthermore, the degradation of the new materials was exploited for specialized medical applications. \n\n\n\nThe follow on funding enabled us to investigate and overcome key technical barriers to the widespread production and use of the new materials. In particular, we focussed on the scale-up of the preparation of the monomers and polymers from D-gluconolactone and S,S-lactide. We developed highly efficient and scalable chemical syntheses which enable production of multi-gram quantities of the products. We have developed the chemical synthesis so that we can vary the quantity of carbohydrate incorporated into the polymer, so as to produce materials with upto 25% (by weight) of carbohydrate. We have thoroughly investigated the properties of the new materials, including their thermo-mechanical properties, water contact angles and degradation kinetics. We have uncovered a relationship between the quantity of carbohydrate incorporated in the polymer and the degradation rate: the more carbohydrate is added, the faster the degradation rate. This enables us to tune and control the degradation of poly(S,S-lactide): a feature of use for both commodity plastics applications and more specialized medical applications. We have successfully processed the materials into both films and spun fibres. The materials have been evaluated as matrices for tissue engineering, where they show superior properties to poly(S,S-lactide) in terms of both cell viability and growth. \n\n\n\nThe follow on funding has also enabled us to explore various opportunities for collaboration and exploitation of the intellectual property generated. We have initiated a collaboration with Leeds University (to extend investigations of polymer scale-up) and are in negotiation with a number of companies, including a contract with RepRegen to explore medical applications for the polymers. As part of the funding, a collaboration with Nottingham University has been established to explore novel processing and applications for the polymers. The new polymers have a range of potential applicaitons. An area of considerable promise is as new materials for medicine. In particular, we have established that the polymers have suitable properteis for use in tissue engineering and as vectors for controlled release. We are working with an SME on the medical applications for the polymers.\n\nThe polymers are also potentially useful for commodity applications, including in packaging. Here, the accelerated degradation and enhanced mechanical properties make these polymers attractive candidates for packaging applications where a renewable raw materials (cellulosic) and degradation are desirable features. We are in negotiations with a major food company regarding applicaiton of these materials in packaging.\n\nThe polymers can be used as compatibilizers in the preparation of fully renewable cellulose nanocomposites. These materials have high moduli and tensile strenth and could be suitable for various applications including in home furnishings and automotive industries. We have presented this work to Arup. The results of this follow on funding have been published in peer-reviewed journals (2 papers) and have been presented at 6 international scientific conferences and 2 industrial symposia (BASF and Arup). The research has led to an on-going collaboration with Prof. Molly Stevens (Dept. Materials, Imperial College London) and Prof. Steve Howdle (Dept. Chemistry, Nottingham University). There is also an on-going collaboraiton, via staff secondment, with an SME (RepRegen) working on the development of new materials for tissue engineering. The results from this study have also been used to initiate a new collaboration, in the area of composite science, with Prof. Alexander Bismarck (Dept. Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London). The commercial opportunities and applications for the new polymers are being explored, through Imperial Innovations, and further studies of the polymers' mechanical, rheological and degradation properties are on-going. Furthermore, applications for the materials are being explored in collaboration with companies working on new medical polymers (RepRegen) and packaging Chemicals,Environment,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
