{"id":"A69D49BE-E981-4CFA-BC7D-C9EEDE6FF0BE","title":"AWAKE-UK 2014-2015 bridging request","abstractText":"The AWAKE project at CERN aims to demonstrate proton-driven plasma wakefield accelertaion for the first time. This will be carried out using the SPS proton beam in the CNGS facility. A wakefield will be excited in a plasma column which the modulates the current of the proton beam splitting it up into micro-bunches. These constructively interfere to create a high amplitude wakefield that will accelerate injected electrons from 15 MeV to 2 GeV in 6 m of plasma. \n\nThe understanding of the self-modulation process, the development of long, scalable and uniform plasma cells and the development of schemes for production and acceleration of short proton bunches could lead to a future stage of AWAKE in which electrons are accelerated to 100 GeV in 100 m of plasma. Application of this technology to high-energy particle facilities such as a future linear collider, LHeC, or a fixed-target and test-beam facility is the ultimate goal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006549/1","grantId":"ST/M006549/1","fundValue":"4838","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Dino Anthony  Jaroszynski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
