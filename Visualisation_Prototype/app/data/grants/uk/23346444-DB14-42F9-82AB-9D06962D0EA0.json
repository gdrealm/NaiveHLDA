{"id":"23346444-DB14-42F9-82AB-9D06962D0EA0","title":"The biology of avolition in schizophrenia","abstractText":"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that may seriously impair a person s ability to care for themselves. The condition is commonly only partially responsive to treatment, and though hearing voices may be a florid symptom of the disorder it is the cognitive (intellectual) impairments accompanying schizophrenia which best predict outcome. We want to know what brain systems are responsible for the inability to act that is seen in many people with schizophrenia and we wish to understand the nature of the biological abnormality in those systems. We are able to examine grey and white matter function and structure in the frontal lobes of the brain using technologies available at our centre. Crucially, we wish to discover whether deficits in the structure of the frontal lobe limit the ability of the brain to benefit from therapies used in schizophrenia (hence our use of the phrase: anatomy as destiny). If abnormalities of frontal lobe structure limit response to treatment then this will have implications for future treatment strategies applied to schizophrenia. Some patients may not respond to any conventional form of treatment (because of structural deficits). Some drug trials may not be comparable because the patients included have different potentials for recovery. The suite of methods that we are able to apply to this problem will allow us to provide systematic and coherent information to help answer these questions. The applicant is a branch-member of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship and, as well as the scientific dissemination of research findings, we are accustomed to presenting data to sufferers and their carers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200148","grantId":"G0200148","fundValue":"663096","fundStart":"2003-10-13","fundEnd":"2010-06-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean J A  Spence","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
