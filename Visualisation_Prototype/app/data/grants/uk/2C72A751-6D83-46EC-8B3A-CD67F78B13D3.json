The overall aim of this knowledge exchange programme is to develop the key recommendations of this research across six sites in England using Community of Practice methodology. Communities of Practice provide a vehicle for brokering knowledge and social relationships between researchers and different practitioners, providing a safe venue for people to listen, reflect, receive feedback on processes of care, and try out small changes that encourage innovation. We will be working in partnership with Revolving Doors, a national charity which has an established track record in delivering similar improvement programmes.</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the Programme are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>establish a national (sustainable) infrastructure for the advancement of Community of Practice methodology in the field of multiple exclusion</li>\n\n <li>establish six flagship Communities of Practice in different locations across England.</li>\n\n <li>encourage organisations to ‘mainstream’ collaborative endeavour and to demonstrate ways in which this can be achieved cost effectively in day to day practice</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010464/1","grantId":"ES/J010464/1","fundValue":"98272","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The CPDP has generated both academic and societal impact. First, it has ensured that the original research has been further disseminated and developed for practice. Evidence gathered as part of the Programme suggests significant impact has been achieved in the six localities which hosted the communities of practice. These impacts are on organisational development (building capacity to run communities of practice and to foster collaborative working locally) and on front line practices. In the survey of community of practice members for example, over 90% agreed that,\n\n• My skills and competencies in working with people facing multiple needs and exclusions have improved through my membership in the community of practice\n• My knowledge of the role and function of other agencies has increased through my membership in the community of practice\n• I have increased my networks and contacts through my membership of the community of practice.\n\nTo disseminate the learning generated through the Programme beyond the six sites, two key publications were produced. The first is a 'final report' of the Programme giving an overview of the work and the evaluation findings (Cornes et al, 2013). The second is a 'tool kit' which aims to support those wishing to set-up communities of practice in other areas (Henessy et al., 2013). The 'tool kit' takes the form of a written report and also links to the aforementioned website hosted by Revolving Doors Agency where there are many freely available resources which have been developed as part of the Programme.\n\nThe final report and the toolkit were launched at a learning event held at King's College London in February 2013. This attracted over 75 delegates from a range of influential organisations. A report of the conference can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/communities-of-practice-conference-programme/\n\nBoth the final report and the tool kit have received positive reviews in the academic and professional press. A review in 'Care Knowledge' noted that it was 'interesting to see a practice/professional route to more effective joint working getting an airing for once'. 'Community Care' concluded its review of the reports with the comment that &quot;Both are well worth a read.&quot; A review in the reports section of 'Journal of Interprofessional Care' is forthcoming.\n\nThe main academic impact from the Programme lies in making explicit the connection between debates around integration and the use of reflective practice in psychologically informed environments (PIEs). A conference paper (Cornes et al., 2013) outlining these ideas was presented at the 5th Psychosocial Studies Network Conference, 'Knowing and not knowing: thinking psychosocially about learning and resistance to learning', December 2012 (Institute of Education, London).

In particular, the mutual support found in communities of practice enables practitioners to stay motivated and engaged in stressful and emotionally challenging job roles. However, a key learning point is that in areas with a history of poor joint working, the amount of development work (brokerage) that may be needed to set-up a community of practice should not be underestimated. There is also a need to be realistic about what outcomes can be achieved through collaborative and integrative practice, such as that found within communities of practice, given the complex and long term nature of many of the problems being addressed. Since the Programme ended, we have been invited to discuss future projects with range of potential partners (e.g. East Sussex Clinical Governance Group, North East Youth Homelessness Forum, Life Line). The potential for future impact is summed-up by the Director of one of the organisations that hosted a community of practice:\n\n 'Participating in the CPDP has been a great opportunity to trial a way of working interprofessionally. The structure around the COP and the fact that a lot of preparation was put into the development of the programme by Revolving Doors and King's has increased the feeling that it has been implemented as a service improvement activity with integrity...The community of practice approach does have good application to the practice setting and I am advocating it be carried on in other programmes, such as the big lottery funded programmes for working with clients with complex needs' Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
