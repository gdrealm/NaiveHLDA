Ethical approval will be obtained from the National Social Care Research Ethics Committee. </p>\n\n<p>People with dementia and their spouses attending social cafes or support groups run by the Alzheimer's Society (or a community organisation) will be invited to take part in the study. Approximately twenty-four couples will be interviewed about the types of decisions they make every day and how they go about making these decisions. The researchers will also spend time at home with the couples, observing them as they go about their daily routines and make day-to-day decisions. </p>\n\n<p>The research findings should promote better understanding of how people with dementia can make decisions and how to involve them in decision-making.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2038","grantId":"RES-062-23-2038","fundValue":"198827","fundStart":"2010-03-29","fundEnd":"2012-11-05","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geraldine  Boyle","coPersons":["Lorna  Warren"],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
