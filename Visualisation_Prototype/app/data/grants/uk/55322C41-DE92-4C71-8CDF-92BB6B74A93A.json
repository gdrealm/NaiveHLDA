{"id":"55322C41-DE92-4C71-8CDF-92BB6B74A93A","title":"The Molecular Neurobiology of Breathing","abstractText":"Most ?higher? animals that live on land, including humans, breathe air through lungs. The expansion and\ncontraction of the lungs during breathing(respiration) is driven by a group of muscles that are attached to the rib cage. The breathing rhythm itself is generated in the brain and then conveyed to the muscles through a specialized type of nerve cell called respiratory motor neuron . I propose to investigate the genetic program that instructs some embryonic cells to become respiratory motor neurons prior to birth. Such a program typically consists of two sets of molecules: One set controls when and where genes are active within the body, and it defines the identity of the cells. A second set of molecules, regulated by the first one, allows developing motor neurons to connect to their ?right? target muscle. The genetic elements that constitute the ?respiratory motor neuron? program and their logical relationships to each other are currently\nnot known. Once I have decoded the program, I may be able to artificially create new nerve cells of this\ntype from embryonic stem cells and use them to replace dead or disconnected ones. Such a therapeutic\napproach could restore the ability to breathe in patients suffering from neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900585","grantId":"G0900585","fundValue":"497341","fundStart":"2010-02-15","fundEnd":"2013-02-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ivo  Lieberam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
