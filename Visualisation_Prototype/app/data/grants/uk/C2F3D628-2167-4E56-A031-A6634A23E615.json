By 2033, those aged over 65 years will constitute 23% of the population. Between 30 and 40% of people over 65 years fall at least once annually. The proportion of falls resulting in a fracture increases markedly with age. In persons over 65 years, fractures are present in three-quarters of fall-related hospital admissions. In more than half of these cases a fracture of the arm is sustained. In most instances the arm is immobilised for an extended period, often in plaster. While this may allow the injury to heal, there are other less positive consequences. Immobilisation of a limb, even for a very short time, leads to a profound decrease in strength. The most significant risk associated with such a period of disuse is that the loss of physical capacity will leave an individual too frail to perform everyday activities, such as rising from a chair. The loss of independence that this represents has consequences not only for the person concerned, but also for their family, their caregivers and the community. This research is concerned with strategies that may be used to minimise the loss of function that would otherwise occur during recovery from upper limb injuries, particularly in older persons. The Aims and Objectives There is now a great deal of evidence that the older adult brain retains an extensive facility to undergo adaptive change or reorganisation. This capacity is referred to as plasticity. Adaptations within the brain play a significant role in relation to the gains that older adults derive from various forms of physical activity. In addition to contributing to the maintenance of strength, adaptations underpinned by brain plasticity form the basis of learning new strategies for performing tasks that compensate for loss of strength. The aims of the proposed research are to examine improvements in the functional capabilities of one limb that occur when only the other limb is trained, and to determine how brain plasticity may best be exploited in order to maximise the gains that can be achieved by such training. The Potential Applications and Benefits For many older people who suffer an injury such as a facture that requires casting, the scope of the treatment rarely extends beyond the injury itself. The potential consequences that arise when a limb is not used for an extended period of time are rarely considered. The proposed research project concerns the scientific basis of interventions that may be used harness brain plasticity during periods of limb immobilisation, with the aim of maintaining functional capacity in older persons. The knowledge gained through this research will have the potential for application to rehabilitation programs for those who undergo enforced periods of limb immobilisation, for example following fractures arising as a result of a fall. The benefits that may accrue from the application of this knowledge are likely to be expressed not only in terms of enhanced quality of life and functional life span for those who experience such injuries, but also as significantly more effective use of health care funds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I008101/1","grantId":"BB/I008101/1","fundValue":"721390","fundStart":"2011-09-26","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Geoffrey Carson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
