Deeper insights into enzyme action are needed if we are to turn the massive increase in biological information, arising from structural biology and genome projects, into real biological and molecular understanding. Research programmes directed at fundamental enzymology are particularly timely as it is becoming clear that modern techniques in structural biology and site-directed mutagenesis coupled to improvements in computing and kinetic instrumentation have prepared the ground for a renaissance in mechanistic biochemistry. Aims and objectives I intend to investigate the fundamental basis of enzyme catalysis using the haem biosynthetic enzyme ferrochelatase. Earlier crystallographic and spectroscopic work shows that ferrochelatase binds and bends the porphyrin substrate. Chemical experience suggests that this helps the enzyme deprotonate the substrate and to insert the metal ion. I aim to use a combination of transient kinetics, structural variation and spectroscopy to explore the interplay between substrate distortion and general-base catalysis; strategies used across all enzyme families. Potential applications and benefits We will all benefit from a deeper understanding of enzymes. Life is a sequence of ordered, tightly regulated and synchronised enzyme catalysed reactions; understanding how these reactions are carried out is a basic biological question. The success of the genome projects is presenting biologists with an immense number of novel proteins with unknown functions; we really need to know how a protein sequence leads to a structure and a structure to a function. Our interest in enzyme action is not limited to fundamental biological questions; a better understanding of enzymology has immediate technological and industrial benefits. Many drugs targets are enzyme inhibitors, but developing new drugs is a frustrating and difficult business. A better understanding of enzyme action will make it easier to discover potential drugs. In a general industrial setting the ability of enzymes to accelerate chemical reactions at low temperatures and in aqueous solution has attracted attention as designed enzymes may be able to replace expensive high temperature processes in environmentally unfriendly solvents with a cheap, low temperature, biodegradable enzyme system. My proposal is firmly directed at fundamental questions in chemical biology. Wider benefits will arise not just from the work in my group, but also from training future enzymologists in the techniques needed to address questions of enzyme action and from application to broader industrial and medical problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001386/1","grantId":"BB/E001386/1","fundValue":"295535","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-12-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jim  Reid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
