We seek a total of 13,656 consisting of 2,120 to cover expenses of invited plenary speakers, 10,000 to cover bursaries for postgraduate research students to attend the conference, and 1,536 for administrative costs incurred in allocating the bursaries, processing receipts and providing other administrative support for the convention (120 hours in total). This funding will ensure the impact of AISB'06 and thus help to maintain and enhance the leading position of the UK in Artificial Intelligence and related fields. EPSRC support of last year's convention was extremely important in making the event accessible to students, and will be again this year. A successful convention will be of particular benefit to PhD students who will have an opportunity to present their work to senior members of the community and receive feedback from them. Due to the breadth of the convention and the unprecedented number of symposia young researchers will be exposed to a wide range of areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D079004/1","grantId":"EP/D079004/1","fundValue":"11311","fundStart":"2006-04-05","fundEnd":"2006-06-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tim  Kovacs","coPersons":["James Arthur Marshall"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
