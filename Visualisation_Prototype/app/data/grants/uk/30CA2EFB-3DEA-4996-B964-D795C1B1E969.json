{"id":"30CA2EFB-3DEA-4996-B964-D795C1B1E969","title":"Deep coalbed biosphere off Shimokita","abstractText":"Among the least characterized geobiological systems on Earth that can be accessed by scientific ocean drilling are deeply buried hydrocarbon reservoirs in sedimentary formations along continental margins. In particular, the microbiological and abiotic processes associated with deeply buried coalbed in the ocean remain poorly understood. To address important scientific questions, IODP Expedition 337 will drill and study the deep coalbed biosphere off the Shimokita Peninsula in the northwestern Pacific using Chikyu. This expedition aims to extend the maximum penetration of scientific ocean drilling to over 2,200 mbsf and will explore the microbial ecosystem associated with a deeply buried coalbed, i.e., a habitat that had never been accessed by previous scientific ocean drilling. The cored intervals in the deep hole will be subject to intense sampling for shipboard and shore-based investigations. The PI's involvement in this project is to date the sediments while drilling is taking place through the analysis on the Chikyu of fossil pollen and phytoplankton (dinoflagellates). These can imform on (1) environments reflected by the rock record, and (2) the age in which the rocks and fossils were deposited.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K002163/1","grantId":"NE/K002163/1","fundValue":"6441","fundStart":"2012-07-26","fundEnd":"2012-09-25","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Guy  Harrington","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
