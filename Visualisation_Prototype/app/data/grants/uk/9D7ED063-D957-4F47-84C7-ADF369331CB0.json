{"id":"9D7ED063-D957-4F47-84C7-ADF369331CB0","title":"Cultural Heritage and Improvised Music in European Festivals (CHIME)","abstractText":"CHIME is a transnational research project that explores how changing relationships between music, festivals and cultural heritage sites renegotiate established understandings and uses of heritage. Led by a highly experienced cross-disciplinary team of transnational researchers, this innovative project explores the uses and re-uses of different types of heritage through the lens of jazz and improvised music festivals. We will combine an ambitious research programme with strong, carefully targeted collaborative partnerships in order to advance understandings of cultural heritage among different communities of interest. Our core focus on festivals reflects the important - if undervalued - position that festivals occupy in Europe's cultural ecology, with their dynamic and synergetic relationship to spaces and cultural sites. We will use jazz and improvised music as a lens through which to explore key issues in heritage research, drawing on the music's unique and complex relationship to concepts of high and low culture, tradition, innovation, authenticity and (non)-European identity. CHIME integrates traditional scholarly outputs with Knowledge Exchange (KE) activities, and we will work collaboratively with 10 Associated Partners (APs) over a 28-month period to develop a series of Research and Development tools that will be of benefit to festivals, the jazz and improvised music sectors, policy makers and the broader cultural and creative industries. Our Associated Partners are festivals and music promoters, museums and archives, cultural policy makers and national and international networking organisations.\nCHIME focuses on three thematic work packages (WPs): Improvising Heritage: jazz,\nfestivals and heritage sites; Marketising Heritage: jazz in urban spaces; and Sounding Heritage:\njazz festival landscapes in the Netherlands. Each work package will develop a programme of\nactivities that feeds into the following research questions:\n?How does jazz music facilitate aonnection to heritage and enable a reconfiguring of people's\nrelationship to place?\n?In what ways do jazz and improvised music festivals provide new models for engagement with\ncultural heritage?\n?How does music shape and inform understandings of cultural memory through uses and re-uses\nof heritage?\n?What synergies and frictions are created when festivals and heritage sites interact (from positive\nre-imaginings of the past to envisaging alternative futures, from the negotiation of problems between conservation and use, to frictions between tourism and local interests etc.)?\n?In what ways can jazz and improvised music festivals act as lens to interrogate concepts of\ncultural identity?\n?How do music festivals blur the boundaries between tangible, intangible and digital heritage?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504373/1","grantId":"AH/N504373/1","fundValue":"157311","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony Robert Whyton","coPersons":["Nicholas Peter  Gebhardt"],"organisation":"Birmingham City University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
