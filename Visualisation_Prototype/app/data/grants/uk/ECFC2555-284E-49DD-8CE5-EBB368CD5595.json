Commonly used are titanium (Ti) and its alloys. Such procedures, however, have a limited lifespan due to a combination of lack of direct bone contact with the metal exacerbated by soft tissue formation; this allows micromotion and ultimately failure. Surgeons face a mounting pressure due to firstly an aging population (in the developed world in 1950, there were 9.3 people under 20 for every person over 65, by 2025 this ratio is forecast to be 0.59 people under 20 for every person older than 65) and associated problems of rheumatoid arthritis and secondly a more sports active younger populations and problems associated with osteoarthritis. Due to the present lifespan of these procedures (The 10 year failure rate for revision hip surgery was 26% in a Norwegian study of 4762 operations) patients will have to wait longer with pain before surgeons will consider operations. The metals are hard to work with due their material properties and so success to date with surface treatments to encourage direct bone growth and hence develop implants for life have been limited.We have recently demonstrated that specific nanoscale cues in the topography of a material surface can mean the difference between stem cell differentiation to bone and stem cell differentiation to fibrous tissue. Furthermore, we believe that this is merely an introduction to the range of effects obtainable through nanoscale design. That such small alterations in the material surface can have such large effects on stem cells makes it clear that nanoscale design could have significant impact in the rational design of orthopaedic biomaterials. Crucial issues for the development of 'intelligent' orthopaedic biomaterials such as bioactive load-bearing stems are: (1) ability to pattern into suitable materials (e.g. Ti) this has not previously been achieved other than using non-specific and random roughening, (2) achieving both mechanical interdigitation (microfeatures) and direct bone bonding (nanocues and microcues) and (3) generating prototype designs using this technology, which will permit the scale-up and development by industry thereby significantly impacting and benefiting patient health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G049076/1","grantId":"EP/G049076/1","fundValue":"255287","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Follow-on in vivo testing is underway to move on to the next step of application Healthcare ","person":"Bo  Su","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" Current demographic changes indicate that people will grow older, yet at the same time want to stay flexible and sport active. In addition, the number of younger people needing orthopedic implants e.g. after severe sport injuries, is also growing. Titanium and its alloys have been widely used in orthopedic implants for many years. Yet with many patients the implant can become loose within a period of ten years, consequently leading to pain or inflammation. In a worst case scenario this will need revisionary surgery. There is a pressing need to develop orthopaedic implants with better performance and longer lifetime. It has been known that both surface chemistry and topography will affect cells in terms of their attachment, differentiation and proliferation. This project is aimed at exploring topographic cues of implant surfaces to modulate cellular behaviour, to achieve optimal mechanical interdigitation and direct bone bonding at the bone-implant interface. We have developed a range of micro- and nano-patterning technologies which are applicable and up-scalable to titanium implant manufacturing. They include electrochemical micro-machining, through-mask anodisation and block copolymer templated anodisation. We have identified optimal micro- and nano-features that are both osteoconductive and osteoinductive. This may lead to significantly improved osseointegration of orthopaedic implants. We have further extended micro-/nano-patterning of titanium to other clinically relevant materials such as ceramics and PEEK. Journal publications Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
