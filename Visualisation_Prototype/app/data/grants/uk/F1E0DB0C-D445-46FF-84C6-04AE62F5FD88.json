Here, we propose to develop a novel catalytic membrane micro-reactor for capture of CO2 and at the same time producing ultrapure hydrogen at low temperatures from fossil fuel such as methane (or coal/biomass). This involves a combination of several advanced catalysts and membrane technologies recently developed by us. The novel membrane to be developed consists of Al2O3 in the form of an asymmetric hollow fibre support onto which a series of modified-Ni (Fe,Cu), Ru or Rh catalysts will be deposited with a Pd or Pd-Ag alloy membrane coated onto the opposite side. Such an approach of fabricating an oxide support with active metal catalysts and a hydrogen separation layer for a combined function of reforming of fossil fuel and CO2 capture has not been attempted to date. The major advantage of this novel membrane micro-reactor is that, due to the low operating temperature and highly selective permeation of H2, high methane conversions can be achieved without catalyst deactivation enabling long term stability of the catalysts. The work will involve a highly multi-disciplinary effort with world-leading groups from UK and China to examine a number of key challenges mentioned above The proposal is distinctive in that the PDRAs and PhD student employed on the grant will travel to collaborating institutions for extended training in catalysis, membranes, modelling and system integration which will strengthen our research capability and increase the employability of the employed researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010947/1","grantId":"EP/I010947/1","fundValue":"458648","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings will be used as the basis for MSc projects in Advanced Chemical Engineering and a PhD project to develop the concept further.

This configuration enables hydrogen free of carbon dioxide to be produced by steam reforming of methane (natural gas) or via the water gas shift reaction. The reactor show excellent performance compared to the more traditional type of reactor. A key feature of the reactor configuration is a asymmetric hollow fibre with radial finger-like channels or pores in which the catalyst is deposited. In developing this unique architecture significant progress has been made in understanding of the production of asymmetric hollow fibre membrane devices. The asymmetric hollow fibre membrane reactor configuration may have potential in a range of areas other than hydrogen production including chemical manufacture, environmental catalysis, water treatment.
