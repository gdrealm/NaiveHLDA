It is the commonest cause of inherited ataxia and symptoms usually become apparent in childhood. As well as causing problems in the nervous system, the disease may also lead to heart and metabolism problems. At the present time there are no treatments that can slow down, let alone cure, the condition, which usually leads to wheelchair dependency in early adulthood. Stem cell therapies are being developed for a variety of neurological and non-neurological conditions and preliminary evidence suggests that they may be of use in FRDA. Our initial studies have suggested that bone marrow-derived stem cells offer protection to nerve cells and cells derived from patients with FRDA. These stem cells are also able to improve some of the metabolic problems that FRDA causes. We hypothesise that mobilising stem cells present in the bone marrow of patients with FRDA may be a way of protecting cells within the body and thus reducing damage caused by the genetic disorder. There are a number of drugs that stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood circulation. We believe that there are multiple ways in which such drugs could help, not just through mobilising bone marrow stem cells: they may have a direct protective effect on brain cells; they may promote nerve cell regeneration by stimulating stem cells known to reside in the brain; and they may also promote repair in non-neurological tissue, such as the heart. These experimental effects have been shown to be valuable in animal models of other degenerative neurological and cardiac disorders, where they clearly improve recovery. Such drugs are already in routine clinical use (mostly for diseases of the blood system, such as leukaemia), which has led to good evidence of their safety, so helping to accelerate future translational research into their use in other conditions. These drugs have also now begun to be tested in human clinical trials in patients with conditions ranging from motor neuron disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injury to myocardial infarction.\nExperimental studies undertaken within our laboratories clearly indicate bone marrow stem cells protect nerve cells and induce repair of the nervous system. We have demonstrated that human bone marrow stem cells help correct the effects of the genetic mutations in cells derived from patients with FRDA (increasing the expression of the protein, frataxin, which is reduced in FRDA); and increase their resistance to cell damage. We believe that studying stem cell mobilising drugs is the next rational step in defining mechanisms of nerve cell protection. We aim to further determine the mechanisms by which nerve cells may be protected or replaced by these drugs. We will test this in a variety of cell culture and animal models of FRDA. Translating the approach of using bone marrow stem cell mobilising drugs to clinical practice is very realistic, but depends vitally on experimental studies such as those we propose, exploring and understanding the therapeutic mechanisms of these drugs in order to allow the development of a potentially simple, non-invasive and effective neuroprotective and regenerative therapy in patients with FRDA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J012580/1","grantId":"MR/J012580/1","fundValue":"340514","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair  Wilkins","coPersons":["Neil  Scolding"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
