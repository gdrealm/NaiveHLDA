To understand the relationships, functional imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI can address the where question of functional anatomy: Which areas of the brain show increased activity when a particular task is being resolved and psychological functions solicited? But brain processes are not static, they are dynamic, and the questions of when and how perceptions and cognitive activities arise are as essential as where they arise. In principle, EEG and MEG provide the millisecond temporal resolution that is necessary to study the dynamics of perceptual and cognitive states. Furthermore, new developments in spatial filtering methods have recently enabled a reliable cortical localization of MEG signals, which are less distorted by the intervening tissue than EEG signals. Lastly, and central to this research proposal, high temporal resolution allows for an optimal decomposition of the measured MEG signals into frequency components, in order to analyse oscillatory activity and coupling in relation to cognitive tasks. Here, we will render the a flow-chart of information processing in the brain for the main nodes of the cortical processing networks associated with biologically important face categorisation tasks (i.e. gender and expression).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01400X/1","grantId":"BB/D01400X/1","fundValue":"215425","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philippe Georges Schyns","coPersons":["Klaus  Kessler","Marie Louise Smith"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
