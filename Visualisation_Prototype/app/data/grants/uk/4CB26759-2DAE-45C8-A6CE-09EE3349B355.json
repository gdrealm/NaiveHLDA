This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I031022/1","grantId":"ES/I031022/1","fundValue":"171220","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lisa Marie DeBruine","coPersons":["Benedict Christopher Jones"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" Significant new knowledge included:\n\n1. Demonstrating that mate preference and choice are correlated for shape sexual dimorphism (an invited revision reporting this result is being prepared for Proceedings B)\n\n2. Demonstrating that own attractiveness moderates the relationship between mate preference and choice for perceived health (a paper reporting these results is under review at Evolution and Human Behavior)\n\n3. Demonstrating that mate preference and choice are correlated for facial cues of adiposity, but that this relationship does not contribute significantly to assortative mating for weight (a paper reporting these results is in press at British Journal of Psychology)\n\n4. Demonstrating that men's, but not women's, openness to uncommitted relationships predicts their sensitivity to cues of the attractiveness and dominance of potential romantic rivals (a paper reporting these results was published in Archives of Sexual Behavior)\n\nWe published six additional papers on other aspects of face preferences that acknowledged the grant because they used stimuli developed primarily for the project. A total of 12 talks on data from the grant were made at international conferences. Dr DeBruine and Professor Jones have been invited to present research from the project in plenary talks at international meetings in USA and Italy next summer.\n\nData and paradigms from the grant were included in interactive exhibits at 2013 Glasgow Science Centre's Biology Week, 2014 Glasgow Science Festival, and an ongoing, permanent exhibit on mate choice at the Glasgow Science Centre's Bodyworks exhibit.\n\nAn invited article by Dr DeBruine that references findings from the project and acknowledges the ESRC for funding her ongoing work on human mate choice was recently published in the magazine of the international Association for Psychological Science (APS). Our Pathways to Impact statement emphasised the potential for this research to contribute to public engagement with science. We have already included methods and key findings of this research in public science events, including the 2013 Glasgow Science Centre's Biology Week exhibit, the 2014 Glasgow Science Festival, and an ongoing, permanent exhibit on mate choice at the Glasgow Science Centre. \n\nThe findings from this project present new evidence for the validity of experimental methods for Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
