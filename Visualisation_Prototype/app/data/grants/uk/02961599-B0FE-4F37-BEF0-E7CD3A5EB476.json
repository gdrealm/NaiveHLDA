Drawing inspiration from a variety of traditional and contemporary sources from both East and West, such as Japanese noh and butoh, and the work of such contemporary playwrights/performance makers as Samuel Beckett, Tadeusz Kantor and Heiner M&uuml;ller, this project will examine how to create a performance that draws from diverse cultural traditions, and is experimental or 'post-dramatic' in its structure and dramaturgy. The production of TOLD BY THE WIND will be used to reflect anew on theatre that is made between cultures and that involves alternative dramaturgies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H00789X/1","grantId":"AH/H00789X/1","fundValue":"28619","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Phillip Barry Zarrilli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
