The grant focuses on the response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), an important lethal and carcinogenic lesion. DSBs arise from endogenous oxidative damage, during certain metabolic processes including V(D)J recombination, a step during immune development, and following exposure to ionising radiation. DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent DSB repair pathways and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) regulates the major DSB signalling response. This programme aims to understand how DSBs are processed and rejoined by NHEJ and its contribution to human disease. Three disorders conferred by defects in NHEJ have known and all are associated with immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity. ATM signalling is dispensable for most DSB repair. However, a subset of DSBs require ATM signalling proteins and a nuclease, Artemis. We will examine the roles of Artemis and ATM in DSB repair. ATR regulates a related signalling process that is activated by stalled replication forks and bulky lesions. Seckel Syndrome is characterised by defects in the ATR signalling pathway, although not all defective genes have been identified. This programme will also aim to gain insight into ATR signalling and its contribution to disorders affecting human health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500897","grantId":"G0500897","fundValue":"1479630","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny Ann Jeggo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
