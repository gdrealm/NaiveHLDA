{"id":"CE6DC3FC-4570-49CA-A165-CDE26DCB616E","title":"Sophocles: Selected Fragmentary Tragedies II","abstractText":"The Athenian tragic dramatist Sophocles wrote a total of 120-130 plays, of which only seven survive complete today. For the others, over ninety per cent of his output, we are dependent on quotations and references in the writings of other ancient authors, on artistic representations, and in some cases on scrappy and broken papyrus texts. In 2006, with two collaborators, I published a well-received edition of six of these plays, with translation and full commentary; I now intend, together with Tom Talboy and Amy Clark, to produce a second volume containing nine further plays.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G008922/1","grantId":"AH/G008922/1","fundValue":"38290","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Herbert  Sommerstein","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
