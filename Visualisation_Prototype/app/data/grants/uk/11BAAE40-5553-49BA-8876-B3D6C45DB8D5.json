{"id":"11BAAE40-5553-49BA-8876-B3D6C45DB8D5","title":"RCaH Impact Acceleration Fellowships and Workshops","abstractText":"Four multidisciplinary research groups have been funded by an open EPSRC call to undertake &quot;cutting-edge&quot; research, and to facilitate this the groups have been housed in the purpose built Research Complex on the Harwell Science and Technology site, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), so that the groups have ready access to the world-leading synchrotron, neutron and laser facilities at RAL. \n\nThe four groups comprise:\nI. The UK Catalysis Hub: The Hub has four main areas of research: catalysis and energy, catalysis in protection of the environment, chemical transformations and catalysis by design. The physical base at Harwell coordinates Hub activities as well as hosting the design theme projects and providing residence to over 20 full time researchers. The Hub network brings together a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling catalytic challenges incorporating world-leading academics in their respective areas.\nII. The Structural evolution across multiple time and length scales MXIF@RCaH Group: The MXIF@RCaH team has a strong culture of knowledge exchange across disciplines, identifying and undertaking challenging 'step-jump' imaging experiments to study &quot;Structural evolution across multiple time and length scales&quot;.\nIII. The Dynamic Structural Science Consortium (DySS): This consortium makes full use of the Diamond synchrotron, the ISIS neutron and the Central Laser facilities to develop techniques for following chemical and biological processes, in the solid-state and in solution, over timescales of picoseconds to minutes.\nIV. The Phase Modulation Technology for X-ray Imaging Group: This team from UCL and Sheffield University is developing new optics for X-ray imaging and has pioneered a new &quot;single-shot&quot; X-ray method.\n\nThese four groups have been working successfully at the RCaH since 2011, and at the recent mid-term review have been encouraged to achieve &quot;even greater impact by increasing the interaction between the four groups&quot; and &quot;developing greater industrial involvement in order to make the project more sustainable and guarantee the potential for high impact research and development&quot;.\n\nThrough the Impact Acceleration funding that the four groups are now jointly applying for we wish to achieve these targets by appointing 8 Impact Acceleration Fellows (4 Academic and 4 Industrial) for periods of up to six months, who will each span the research fields of two or more of the RCaH groups and/or will have strong industrial links. The Fellows, who will be international experts in their own areas, will be tasked with fostering the academic and industrial links between the four groups at the RCaH and the wider international academic and industrial communities. \n\nSecondly, we wish to run 8 Workshops during the next two years to further facilitate the interactions between the four groups, between the groups and the wider academic and industrial communities, and to focus on the development of early career researchers working in the science areas of the groups at the RCaH. The workshops will alternate between scientific dissemination format, translation to Industry format, and Early Career Idea Factories. We will invite internationally leading academic and industrialists for the scientific dissemination format and translation to industry format workshops, and encourage the early career researchers already working at the RCaH to develop their own idea factory workshops.\n\nThrough these activities we will accelerate the impact of the high quality science being undertaken by the four EPSRC-sponsored groups at the RCaH.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M010481/1","grantId":"EP/M010481/1","fundValue":"65935","fundStart":"2014-10-09","fundEnd":"2016-10-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Robert  Raithby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
