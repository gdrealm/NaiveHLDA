Like herpes, CMV is carried for life and can reactivate at any time to cause disease. Most people worldwide are infected with CMV, yet do not know. In hospitals , however, CMV is well known and recognized to be an important pathogen. CMV can cause severe multi-organ disease in individuals whose immune system is suppressed by drugs (bone marrow, heart or kidney transplant recipients), compromised by HIV-AIDS and also when the virus crosses the placenta to infect the foetus. CMV is the largest and most complex of any human virus, estimated to have some 184 genes. CMV researchers have increasingly been concerned about the viruses they have been using in the laboratory. CMV has evolved with us to grow in us. Before the virus will grow in vitro it mutates and changes; always the same genes first: RL13 and UL128 first. We already know a fair bit about UL128. Counterintuitively, RL13 suppresses the growth of CMV in all cell types. Why would a virus do that? We suspect it is to allow the virus to persist and spread in our tissue without alerting the immune response. Since this gene has a major effect on virus growth, it is crucial to work out what it is doing and how. Moreover, it is important to work out how to grow and work with the virus that causes clinical disease. Up until now, our understanding of CMV has been almost exclusively based on work with mutant viruses.\n\nWhat do these ~184 genes do? Surprisingly only a minority are needed by the virus to grow, the majority appear to be there to control us and our immune system! As most of us carry the virus, this is a major concern. CMV is known to alter the repertoire of out white blood cells even in healthy carriers. We have nearly finished cloning all 184 genes into a different (replication-defective/disabled) virus, so we can study all CMV?s genes individually. Using this gene library and high throughput screening systems we seek to identify characterise as many of the key immune regulatory genes in this virus as possible. The more we know about this virus, the better we can manage disease and develop antiviral strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000236","grantId":"G1000236","fundValue":"721174","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-08","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin William Wilkinson","coPersons":["Eddie Chung Wang","Peter  Tomasec"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
