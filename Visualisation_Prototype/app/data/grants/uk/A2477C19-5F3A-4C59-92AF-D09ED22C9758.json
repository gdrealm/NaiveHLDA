It compares the UK with USA whose less stable housing regime may be reflected in more difficulties for&nbsp; children.This raises the question of whether changes to the UK housing market may have unintended effects on children.</p>\n\n<p>Two large samples of families are compared: the Fragile Families and Wellbeing Study (US) and the Millennium Cohort Study (UK). Each follow babies born around 2000, here up to age five. They provide information about parental capabilities and circumstances to help account for any move, and for childrenâ€™s progress in verbal ability, behavioural adjustment and general health. Home moves are classified as resulting in better or worse housing, parental employment or neighbourhood than the situation before move. Movers&nbsp; are compared with stayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The precursors of various sorts of moving. and outcomes for children are modelled statistically, to compare relationships across the two countries. The resulting derived variables will be made available for other researchers, and introduced to them, along with findings, in workshops in London and New York.&nbsp; Another event is planned to discuss the relevance of findings to British housing policy. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000438/1","grantId":"ES/K000438/1","fundValue":"353612","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Heather Evelyn Joshi","coPersons":["Mary Clare  Lennon","Ruth  Lupton"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
