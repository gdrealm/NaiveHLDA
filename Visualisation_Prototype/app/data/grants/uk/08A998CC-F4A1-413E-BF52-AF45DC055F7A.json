Through case studies world-wide it will trace the development of sustainable materials and processes on a viable commercial scale. It will provide designers and manufacturers with an accessible resource (an exhibition) which will help them in the evaluation of the environmental audit of products and services. Working with London Remade and Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), a government organisation building markets for recycled materials, the research investigates the network of partnerships between the business community, government and the waste management industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113196/1","grantId":"113196/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jakki  Dehn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
