The Coordinator will build opportunities for researchers to engage with relevant stakeholders and to communicate findings in accessible ways which help inform voter decisions in 2014</li>\n\n <li>to explore the referendum as a fundamental issue for social science analysis. It is rare that citizens are faced with such a fundamental choice as whether or not to create a new states.This creates opportunities for ESRC-funded researchers to understand the character and resilience of social relationships amid the pressures created by that choice.The Coordinator will work across the various projects to ensure this opportunity is taken.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002442/1","grantId":"ES/L002442/1","fundValue":"343481","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlie  Jeffery","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
