{"id":"F03E1D54-3BCA-4991-AE4A-EAD9BA73B157","title":"Designing the most effective vehicle to deliver alginate to effectively reduce fat digestion and absorption","abstractText":"Obesity is one of the fastest growing medical issues across the world and is fast becoming one of the leading causes of mortality. 337,000 death/year in Britain are related to being overweight and Britain leads EU in deaths related to excess body weight. Obesity will become an even greater problem in the future for the EU as 22 million children are considered overweight or obese, with this increasing by 400,000 every year. In our previous studies funded by BBSRC we demonstrated that alginates (dietary fibres from seaweeds) could reduce fat digestion and absorption, so could help to reduce obesity. We along with Gregg's PLC have developed a bread based alginate product which was highly acceptable with no bowel related side effects. Here we intend to develop a range of alginate based food products driven by consultation with the public and carry out further studies to allow us to make a health claim. This will pave the way for alginate products to come to market as an aid to weight loss.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K020307/1","grantId":"BB/K020307/1","fundValue":"179321","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"J.P  Pearson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" This is still ongoing and does not finish until 31 JAN 15 project still ongoing.
