This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J533055/1","grantId":"BB/J533055/1","fundValue":"135837","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Based on a previous project, we have identified the Arabidopsis gene, GA3OX1 (gibberellin biosynthesis gene) as important for efficient seed dispersal. We identified the mechanism by which gibberellin mediates degradation of DELLA repressor to de-repress the ALC transcription factor, which is a positive regulator of pod shatter.

We identified an allelic series of mutations in all genes using an oilseed rape TILLING population. We grew promising mutants to single-mutant homozygosity and made crosses to generate combinations of mutants. We are continuing to bring the mutant combinations to homozygosity and are characterising the phenotypes with respect to pod shatter resistance. We are in contact with breeding companies who are interested in the approach and the resulting lines. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
