The creation of a programme website and MyESRC web page\n2. Site visits and meetings (CSIFs) between PI's, DSTL, ESRC and stakeholders\n3. Continuous dialogue between the Integrator team and: PIs, DSTL, ESRC \n4. Design and dissemination of the first Qualtrics impact questionnaire in consultation with PIs and DSTL\n5. Identification of appropriate, additional, dissemination and engagement policy and user platforms for project outputs e.g. Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST), Westminster Forum \n\nWe will continue to engage with all projects in the next 6-12 months. Going forward, we will accelerate further our stakeholder engagement activities, and dissemination and impact plans, with a planned CSIF meeting on 24-25 November 2014 targeted to refine ideas and proposals in order to achieve this in the most effective way. In addition the PI will produce a commentary/brief on lessons learnt from the programme and processes involved, and the integrator team will also produce towards the end of the project, an academic paper/commentary which engages with the on-going debate on the importance of integrating the arts, social science and the natural sciences.

To this end the research integrator team aimed to work with successful applicants throughout the various stages of their research to:\n\n1. Ensure that the research projects maximise impact and uptake well beyond their funding period by building durable networks between the project researchers, policy communities and other project relevant stakeholders.\n2. Help foster and develop research impact communities between social (including arts and humanities) and natural/physical scientists within academia, business and industry, and policy; laying the foundations for future collaborations and continued synergies beyond the funded life of the projects.\n3. Ensure that the research projects are exposed to the policy community at the earliest stages to ensure that they have sufficient input to produce significant impact whilst developing world class research findings and insights.\n4. Identify opportunities through horizon-scanning to ensure that the projects keep stock of developments and opportunities within the defence and security sectors.\n5. Facilitate the cross-fertilisation and integration of research findings, to provide added intellectual value, through a range of innovative strategies and techniques.\n6. Ensure that our communication and engagement activities highlight the world class nature and importance of these projects and the role of ESRC and DSTL. \n\nTo ensure the co-production of outstanding research our integrator activities have included: regular communications with, and site visits to, the research teams; programme meetings to understand and exploit synergies across the project teams; a bi-monthly programme newsletter and project webpage (with embedded new media technologies); direct engagements with user communities - including workshops and meetings with government departments; and, the production of policy briefs and reports.\n\nOur work has been undertaken in three project phases and has followed our RICK methodology. Stage One (months 1-7) identified emergent research challenges and the development of 'exploitation plans' to give greater visibility to the GU programme and DSTL. Stage Two (months 8-12) developed, greater opportunities for impact, engagement and integration and explore opportunities for uptake and allow research results to inform policy-making and professional practice. Stage Three (months 13-24) focused on promoting the research project's findings, producing insights and policy recommendation and establishing a lasting legacy for the projects. The emerging findings from our work have been fed into the RCUK through the RCUK-DSTL Strategy board, and DSTL/MoD through a review of MOD ethics requirements. Our work will inform the development of strategic programmes co-funded between RCUK and security agencies as well as assisting existing funded projects to maximise their impact.
