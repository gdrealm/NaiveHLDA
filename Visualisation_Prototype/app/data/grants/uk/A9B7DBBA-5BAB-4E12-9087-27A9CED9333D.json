The blood vessels, which are formed from endothelial cells, develop during follicular growth in the theca layer, but the inner granulosa cell layer remains avascular. After ovulation, the follicle collapses inwards followed by extensive tissue remodelling. Underpinning these changes, there is a period of intense angiogenesis with 85% of the proliferating cells being of endothelial origin. This enables the corpus luteum (CL) to grow at a rapid rate (to &gt;5g in 5 days) that is only surpassed by the fastest growing tumours. This is essential for sufficient progesterone to be produced to support the developing embryo and studies in a variety of species have shown that blocking angiogenesis inhibits progesterone production. In cattle for example, if sufficient progesterone is not produced rapidly enough, then the embryo will die. Hence luteal angiogenesis is critical for maintaining pregnancy and the aim of this project is to understand how this process is regulated. The factors thought to regulate angiogenesis in the CL include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and other growth factors, but their precise roles are unclear. Unexpectedly, we found that FGF-2 was more dynamic than VEGF during the follicle-luteal transition period. Levels of FGF-2 increased dramatically around ovulation, before declining to basal levels for the remainder of the luteal phase. This led us to hypothesise 1) that this FGF-2 surge is the major initiator of luteal angiogenesis. We also propose 2) that the subsequent basal levels of FGF-2 and VEGF are obligatory at specific times for the development and maintenance of blood vessels. To test these hypotheses, we have developed a new culture system using follicular granulosa and theca cells or enzymatically dispersed cells from the corpus luteum in which endothelial tubule-like structures develop in the culture dish. We can quantify the number and area of these tubules by staining them and using microscopy and image analysis. This culture system uses a mixed population of follicular or luteal cells (including steroidogenic, endothelial and pericyte cells) and hence is a more physiologically relevant model system than using cell lines. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating ovarian angiogenesis at a level of detail that would not be possible in the whole animal. Finally, we hypothesise 3) that tubule formation involves communication between pericytes and endothelial cells via specific pathways and also 4) that the steroidogenic luteal cells influence the migration of the endothelial cells. We will test these hypotheses by 1) mimicking the dynamic changes in FGF-2 in our mixed luteinised follicular cell culture system and 2) blocking basal levels of FGF-2 and/or VEGF using receptor blockers at different times during the culture of dispersed luteal cells and determining the effect on luteal endothelial cell migration, tubule initiation and network establishment. To test hypothesis 3) we will determine the effect of removing pericytes from the mixed cell population. Then we will block two important pathways of communication between pericytes and endothelial cells and see what happens to tubule formation. Finally, for hypothesis 4) we will culture isolated steroidogenic cells and find out if endothelial cells in culture will move towards them and which specific compounds can block this effect. All these experiments will advance our understanding of how angiogenesis in the ovary is regulated, particularly during the follicle-luteal transition period and the early luteal phase. They will provide new insights into progesterone production during the critical period of early embryo development and may lead ultimately to the development of new strategies to improve fertility in cattle and other species including man.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F002998/1","grantId":"BB/F002998/1","fundValue":"284363","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Morag  Hunter","coPersons":["George Edward Mann","Robert  Robinson"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
