Disruption of natural binding partners or alterations in the expression levels of a particular protein can perturb the balance of this signaling process and lead to the onset of a range of diseases. Altered protein-protein interactions are present in cancers, HIV, and Alzheimer's and inhibiting the abnormal protein-protein interactions associated with these diseases offers an exciting new avenue to develop highly selective drug molecules. \n\nHowever, despite considerable research efforts, identifying inhibitors of disease-associated protein-protein interactions has proven to be very challenging. The large binding surfaces present in most protein-protein interactions has meant that effective inhibitors based on small molecules have been hard to identify, but larger compounds, such as cyclic peptides that can be used to mimic protein binding surfaces, have emerged as a promising therapeutics leads. \n\nAt the cutting edge of this field is the application of multicyclic peptide scaffolds, as the 3-dimensional structure of these compounds can be designed to allow multiple binding regions on a protein interface to be targeted simultaneously. But progress into designing new inhibitors of protein-protein interactions using this approach is severely hampered by a lack of viable synthetic routes to multicyclic peptide scaffolds. \n\nUtilising novel fluoropyridine amino acids as the key building blocks we will develop synthetic strategies to access multicyclic peptide scaffolds, each with a defined 3-dimensional structure. The methodology developed will also permit the formation of the peptide scaffolds in a highly controlled and regionspecific manner which is something that is not currently possible using existing technologies. Having access to multicyclic peptide scaffolds will help to accelerate the discovery of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions and thus the development of new drug molecules to target diseases such as cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J015989/1","grantId":"EP/J015989/1","fundValue":"99889","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have used the primary data to support research publications and two UK patent applications.

We have been able to do this and we have also been able to use the methods developed to develop new bioconjugation methods that can be used to link different classes of biomolecules. For example, the method can be sued to link peptides to sugars to make glyco-peptides. Patent applications on this work (two UK patents 2014 May) have been filed and follow on funding from the EPSRC IAA fund has been awarded to continue this work. Our follow on EPSRC IAA funding that was awarded based on the results obtained in the original EPSRC first grant is giving us the chance to develop additional novel IP and look to spin our technology out in to a company. Doing this would provide the best opportunity to engage with other researchers in both different academic fields and in industry. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
