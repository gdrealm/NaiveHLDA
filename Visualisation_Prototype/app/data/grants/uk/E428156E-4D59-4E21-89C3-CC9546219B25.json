It forms the 'training trainers' part of a joint plan developed by the aAdvenced Institute of Management Research (AIM) and the British Academy of Management. </p> \n<p>The AIM programme has four components:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Consultative development of teaching materials on the logic of enquiry that frames the research process and production of outputs<br /></li> \n <li>Workshop series on research methods course design and teaching<br /></li> \n <li>Workshop series on teaching selected priority research methods generating potentially publishable outputs - systematic reviewing, critical reviewing, and handling large data sets<br /></li> \n <li>Workshop series on training in supervision and in mentoring skills. A conception of the logic of enquiry in the social sciences underpins all four components<br /></li>\n</ul> \n<p>Academic discourse is viewed as a two-way process of attempting to convince a sceptical audience of one’s own argument about the social world, while adopting a sceptical stance towards others’ arguments. Materials development will employ e-learning as a consultative medium and a means of disseminating the products. The workshop series will be offered in four regional locations.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0049-A","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0049-A","fundValue":"106282","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This was a research training grant.
