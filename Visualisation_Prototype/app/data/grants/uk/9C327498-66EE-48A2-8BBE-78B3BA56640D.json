This is an exploratory study to clarify the nature of the information in the GMC’s electronic databases and to ask what could be learnt from it, possibly in combination with other sources of information, that could promote effective regulation. Risk-based approaches to regulation, now widely endorsed, rely on good quality information about risks. Taking a social psychological approach, the study is based on the premise that all information is shaped by the contexts in which it is generated and processed. Data on fitness-to-practice cases coming to the GMC over a period of two years will be studied, and more detailed content analysis will be carried out on sub-samples of cases. The analysis is supplemented by 15 exploratory interviews with doctors, patients and representatives of public bodies involved in cases.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-153-25-0087","grantId":"RES-153-25-0087","fundValue":"69778","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally Margaret Lloyd-Bostock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
