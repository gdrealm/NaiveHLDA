{"id":"DEF23FA2-90B1-4AB2-937A-B323FB8E7D54","title":"Biomedical Imaging using Surface-Enhanced Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy based on Supercontinuum Laser","abstractText":"Raman microscopy is an optical technique which has the potential to revolutionise biomedical imaging sciences by providing the rich chemical information of biological samples with high spatial resolution. It offers true multiplex imaging of protein distribution and allows access to tissue chemistry without the need of conventional staining. Unfortunately, this technique has long been plagued by the notoriously low intensity of the Raman signal and the inherent background noise found in biological samples. Recent advances in non-linear Raman techniques, such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and stimulated Raman scattering have allowed these problems to be partially resolved by increasing the signal strength. These new techniques, however, suffer from the very high cost of conventional laser systems, making them inaccessible to a large number of research laboratories. The current research proposal puts forwards the development of a new type of stimulated Raman scattering microscope powered by three modern technologies: inexpensive supercontinuum laser source, surface-enhanced Raman substrates and automated analysis based on spectral clustering. This radical new approach will allow this technique to be available at a fraction of the current price, making it affordable to a wide range of biomedical imaging applications. Combined with surface-enhanced Raman substrates made from gold nanoparticles, we will demonstrate that background-free chemical maps can be obtained in a fraction of the time currently possible. We will test the potential use of this instrument for cell and tissue imaging with future applications in cancer diagnosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I014470/1","grantId":"EP/I014470/1","fundValue":"100240","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used in publications  ","person":"Frederic  Festy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" The principal aim of this project was to build a Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscope based on a relatively affordable, commercially available, supercontinuum laser source. We have found that this recent technology is currently not well suited for this type of microscopic application. The main reasons for this low suitability are:\n\n\n\n1) Although the overall output power of such laser systems is very high (2 - 4 W), it is spread over a very large spectral range (500 nm to 1700 nm) while only a relatively small portion of it can be used for SRS, typically 750 nm to 900 nm in our case.\n\n2) The relatively long duration (around 10 ps) of the laser pulse coming out of the long photonic crystal fibre does not provide sufficient peak power to produce reliable SRS loss/gain signals.\n\n3) The general noise and stability of this type of supercontinuum laser source is too poor for accurate measurements of long Raman spectra and large single peak Raman maps.\n\n4) A narrow region of the supercontinuum is selected using a monochromator to generate the pump beam. The shape of this beam is elongated due to the shape of the monochromator slit, leading to very poor spatial overlap between the pump beam and the Raman Stoke beam.\n\n\n\nThe original design proposed in the grant application has been modified to the following: A state-of-the-art automated Titanium/Sapphire femtosecond laser pumps a tailor-made photonic crystal fibre to produce a continuum concentrated in the region suitable for SRS. The femtosecond pulses combined with the high power from the Ti/Sapph laser, provides a combined peak power suitable for SRS. The monochromator has been replaced by a fixed-wavelength high-quality narrow-bandpass interference filter, resulting in a clean Gaussian beam shape for proper spatial beam overlap. The tunnability of the SRS system is provided by the automated tuning of the Ti/Sapph laser. The downside of this modified design is the need of an expensive Ti/Sapph laser source.\n\n\n\nThe secondary aim of this project was to modify an existing spectral clustering algorithm to be able to analyse large dataset (&gt;1 M) from a variety of Raman instruments: conventional spontaneous Raman, SRS and Coherent Antistoke Raman (CARS). We have successfully demonstrated that up to 5 different fluorescent beads can be demultiplexed from a broadband CARS microscope, paving the way to true multiplexed protein distribution imaging using conventional fluorescence tagging technologies. We have also shown that this analytical tool can separate the 3 different types of dentine (sound/infected/affected) from unstained histological sections of caries lesions imaged using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Such stain-free optical characterisation will provide a unique tool to accurately assess the remineralisation effects of novel tooth restoration materials and can potentially have a huge impact on the treatment of caries, improving of the population's oral health. Others should not rely on this particular type of laser excitation source to do SRS. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
