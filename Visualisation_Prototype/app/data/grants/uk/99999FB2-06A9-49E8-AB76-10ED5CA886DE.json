Work with patients with brain injury shows that knowledge for living things can be selectively impaired whilst that for nonliving things remains preserved (and vice versa). This suggests critical differences in the way in which the meaning for living and nonliving things is represented in memory.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A common assumption is that a concept’s meaning corresponds to its set of defining features. This project therefore asks: which features are critical to the meaning of living and nonliving concepts, and how are those features organised in memory?</p> \n<p>In a series of experiments looking at the speed with which people respond to concept names, we will explore the relative contribution of two types of features that concepts possess and that may influence how they are stored in memory. These are form features (what a concept looks like) and function features (what a concept ‘does’).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1362","grantId":"RES-000-22-1362","fundValue":"46113","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"W  Macken","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
