Despite the commitment made by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, all the evidence shows that biodiversity is declining at steady or even accelerating rates, and that the pressures behind the decline are if anything getting worse. This is bad news, because every person in every country depends on ecosystem services - benefits that ecological systems provide to people - and the biodiversity that underpins it. These links are most direct for the hundreds of millions of people in the world's poorest countries who depend on local biodiversity for food, fibres, medicines and fuel.\n\nAs the deadline for the 2010 target came and went, problems became apparent with the biodiversity indicators scientists have used to assess trends. Because the 2010 target needed to be assessed quickly, existing indicators were designed around sets of data that researchers had already collated together. This led to biases because we know more about charismatic vertebrates than about insects, more about temperate than tropical biodiversity, and more about populations of single species than about the ecological communities of which they are parts. The rush also meant that some indicators might not be rigorous enough to support policy decisions - a real concern, given how any apparent weakness in the evidence for human-caused climate change is leapt on by vociferous critics. There is a need for scientifically rigorous indicators that reflect threats to biodiversity, the state of biodiversity, ecosystem services and policy responses.\n\nThe main threats facing biodiversity (often termed drivers or pressures) are the destruction, degradation and fragmentation of habitats, and the damage to individuals' fitness caused by exploitation, pollution and introduction of species from other parts of the world. We know that the highest proportions of threatened mammals, birds and amphibians are found in those regions where human pressures have recently become intense. We also know that some species and ecosystems have characteristics that make them better able than others to persist in spite of human actions. An urgent priority for research, therefore, is to model how the state of biodiversity is affected not only by threat intensities but also by ecological characteristics. Such a model will let us understand the complex spatial, temporal, taxonomic and ecological patterns of decline. We will also be able to use those models to make projections that can inform and support policy.\n\nThis proposal is a true partnership between a world-class university (Imperial College London), an intergovernmental conservation organisation (UNEP-WCMC), a leading biodiversity research institute (Institute of Zoology) and a world-leading technology company (Microsoft Research), sharing the aim of integrating existing data on biodiversity and human threats to produce the best possible basis for policy. We will also use the framework we develop to tackle a wide range of both fundamental and policy-relevant questions in biodiversity science.\n\nUNEP-WCMC will use the framework for biodiversity projections in response to requests from decision-makers, including the international conventions, governments and businesses. We will meet guidelines laid down by the nascent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to ensure the framework is fit for purpose. Because the framework is being developed as a true partnership between project partners, it will translate directly into evaluations of policy options for biodiversity management.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J011193/1","grantId":"NE/J011193/1","fundValue":"614229","fundStart":"2012-07-16","fundEnd":"2013-11-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our global models of how local biodiversity have responded to land-use and associated changes were used in UNEP-WCMC's report, Towards a global map of natural capital: key ecosystem assets.

We have estimated the global average reduction in local species richness caused so far by these pressures, and projected losses forwards to 2100 under four alternative land-use scenarios that relate to different climate mitigation strategies. This work is not yet published but is in review. Our models are based on a database we have collated which is unprecedented in its size, taxonomic breadth and geographic coverage. It contains nearly 2% as many species as are known to science, and has over 20000 sites from over 90 countries worldwide. One of the most important things we have found is that literally hundreds of scientists worldwide are willing to share their data so that global models can be produced. Our database has therefore had the additional benefit of 'rescuing' many datasets that were previously at risk of being lost to science. UNEP-WCMC has taken outputs from our models and used them in its conservation 'dashboard', providing country-specific estimates of how much terrestrial biodiversity has been lost Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
