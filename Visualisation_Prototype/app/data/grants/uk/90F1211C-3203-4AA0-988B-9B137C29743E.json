One important reason is that mutations have made the parasite resistant to drugs like chloroquine. Artemisinin is therefore a vitally important drug. It would be a major public-health disaster if resistance to artemisinin develops. We therefore need to know in advance which genes are likely to mutate.\nWe have already produced parasites which are resistant to artemisinin, and now wish to identify the genetic loci involved. We can do this using cutting-edge and highly efficient genetics strategies and methods. Because of the experimental and ethical limitations in using human malaria, we use a malaria species which infects mice. Other scientists will be interested in confirming our results in human malaria parasites in the laboratory and in natural infections.\nThis project addresses a vital question in contemporary malaria science and is likely to make a significant practical impact. It will help us to decide which drugs should be used in specific regions of the world, improve our understanding of how artemisinin drugs work, how resistance evolves and how we may reduce the rate at which resistance spreads. It will help us to design other effective drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400476","grantId":"G0400476","fundValue":"530195","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Hunt","coPersons":["Richard  Carter","Pedro  Cravo"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
