{"id":"0BF55870-4219-4F76-AE34-480F9445E80A","title":"Summer School of Sociolinguistics 2010","abstractText":"<p>A six-day Summer School teaching master classes and affording PG students the opportunity to present their own work was held at the University of Edinburgh in June 2010. Leading researchers from the UK and North America gave state of the art lectures on their sub-disciplines in sociolinguistics, ran three-hour workshops focussing on methods for data collection and data analysis in sociolinguistics, commented on student papers in their subject areas and participated in workshops led by students. Topics covered were: Stance and indexicality; Sociolinguistics and multilingualism; Discourse in context; Children and sociolinguistics; Sociophonetics and gender. On the remaining day, PhD students at Edinburgh devised workshop activities and led discussion groups exploring issues in planning and funding a sociolinguistics PhD; collecting and analysing data; and moving forward on completion of the PhD. Social and cultural events for visitors were organised out of Summer School hours on Day 3 and Day 5. On the final day, a Russian film on the sociolinguistics of endangered languages was screened and discussed. ESRC support enabled all participants to attend free of cost.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-810-21-0068","grantId":"RES-810-21-0068","fundValue":"31452","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Miriam  Meyerhoff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
