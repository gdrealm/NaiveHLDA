The work of the Brunel group is aimed at completing the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter for CMS, contributing to the software associated with the Tracker and Electromagnetic Calorimeter of CMS, and exploiting the data when the LHC commences in 2007. We continue to analyse the data now being produced by the BaBar experiment in particular in the channels involving rare charmless decays. We will be developing, installing and exploiting tracking detectors for the new experiments MICE and FP420. Data visualisation and statistical learning techniques will be applied to particle physics data analysis. Our work on the development of novel silicon detectors will benefit future upgrades to LHC detectors as well as many other areas of scientific research (for example detectors at synchrotron sources).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000479/1","grantId":"PP/E000479/1","fundValue":"1074910","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Robert Hobson","coPersons":["Cinzia  Da Vi√°","Liliana  Teodorescu","Stephen  Watts","Paul  Kyberd","AM  Khan"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
