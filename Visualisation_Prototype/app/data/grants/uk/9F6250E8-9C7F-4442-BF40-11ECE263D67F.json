{"id":"9F6250E8-9C7F-4442-BF40-11ECE263D67F","title":"Investigation of discrepancies between direct and indirect comparison of competing healthcare interventions","abstractText":"To choose the best treatment from several available treatments to an illness, the best evidence is from randomised trials (RCTs) where different treatments have been directly tested against each other (direct comparison). \nA statistical method known as adjusted indirect comparison may be helpful when available treatments have not been directly compared in RCTs. However, this indirect comparison method may produce results that are different from a direct comparison of different treatments. \nWe aim to investigate factors associated with the difference between direct and indirect approaches. We will see if indirect comparison gives the same answer as trials where the different treatments have been directly compared. If the two methods give different answers, we will look through the studies in detail, and try to work out what may have caused the difference. \nThe research we plan to do is very important because government bodies like the National Institute of Clinical Excellence may have to use indirect comparison methods in choosing treatments, when no direct comparison study is available. Our research findings should help us recognize situations where the indirect comparison may be a good, reliable choice, and also when it can give us wrong answers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701607","grantId":"G0701607","fundValue":"356260","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fujian  Song","coPersons":["Yoon Kong LOKE","Anne-Marie  Glenny","Alex  Sutton","Jonathan James Deeks"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
