{"id":"53AB16B8-1F9E-486C-8B1D-E79908EAAEE6","title":"Intelligent Support for Mathematical Generalisation","abstractText":"<p>Expressing generality, recognising and analysing pattern and articulating structure are at the core of mathematical thinking and scientific enquiry. These ideas are notoriously elusive for students, who routinely find themselves unable to understand what mathematics is about. There have been attempts to foster an appreciation of generality, yet despite some successes, difficulties remain, and these tend to coalesce around the need for intensive, timely and appropriate pedagogic support. The project will respond to this need, by developing an intelligent learning environment for improving 11-14 year-old students’ learning of mathematical generalisation. </p> \n<p>The methodology is characterised by iterative cycles of design, testing and revision of a pedagogical and technical environment consisting of:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sequenced and progressive activities undertaken within a prototype microworld – the eXpresser – designed to promote the learning of mathematical generalisation through model-construction.</li> \n <li>An intelligent component, the eGeneraliser, which will provide personalised feedback during the process of model analysis and generalisation.</li> \n <li>A&nbsp;second intelligent component, the eCollaborator, which will foster cumulative knowledge construction through the sharing and discussion of models, aiming to develop and sustain an effective online community. </li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0381","grantId":"RES-139-25-0381","fundValue":"1253170","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  See Impact Report: http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-139-25-0381/outputs/Read/a0d20499-4833-498f-b225-a8998dfe9798 Education ","person":"Richard  Noss","coPersons":["George D Magoulas","Alexandra  Poulovassilis","Celia  Hoyles","Niall  Winters"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":" See Impact Report: http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-139-25-0381/outputs/Read/a0d20499-4833-498f-b225-a8998dfe9798 See Impact Report: http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-139-25-0381/outputs/Read/a0d20499-4833-498f-b225-a8998dfe9798 Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education","dataset":"gtr"}
