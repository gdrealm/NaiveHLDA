An important feature of the project is the collaboration of Centre for Geospatial Science, University of Nottingham, and the Department of Geomatics, University of Melbourne, Australia, who will contribute expertise in the geoinformatics of disaster management complementary but closely related to this endeavour.In general terms there can be no doubt that effective emergency management, monitoring the nation's critical infrastructure and managing recovery in the case of a disaster, is extremely important for the national economy, public services, and for the health of citizens. Effective emergency management and disaster response can be significantly enhanced by the new sensor-based technologies that are coming on stream. However, sensor data from many heterogeneous sources, distributed in space and time, can only be effectively utilized if the foundations in informatics and knowledge representation are available to transform the data into information that is timely and meaningful to decision makers. It is towards this goal that the research in this proposed project makes a contribution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I007555/1","grantId":"EP/I007555/1","fundValue":"30284","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Nothing concrete as yet, outside the academic sphere.

The theory is presented in the form of an ontology. The development of an information system to support the activities of emergency manageers must be informed by an appropriate understanding of the different kinds of information that is to be handled, the different forms that the information can take, the transformations it can undergo, and the different levels of accuracy, precision, and trustworthiness\nthat it can manifest. The ontology of information developed in this project can provide a useful framework within which such information systems can be designed.
