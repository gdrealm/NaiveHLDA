{"id":"5B1C5B85-3263-414F-9DC8-1EE1EB3C31B1","title":"Higher representation theory","abstractText":"It is a common occurrence in mathematics that in order to understand a given thing, we add extra structure to it - seemingly making it more complicated, but in fact making it easier to obtain insight on it. An analogy would be ordering things in the real world. The thought of all possible words in a language seems quite overwhelming, but ordering them lexicographically and writing them in a dictionary, we have an easy way to obtain information about any given one, despite seemingly having complicated things by imposing extra structure (knowing when a word comes before another). In mathematical terms, we have turned words into a category.\n\nCategories are commonly studied through their representations, meaning actions on things that are more easily accessible, not unlike books written in a certain language: Not all of the language will be visible in a given book, but the more books we read, the better we know the language. For certain important categories called algebras, there is a very well-developed theory of such representations.\n\nIn recent years, it has been found that in order to study questions about categories, it is often useful to add even more structure to obtain 2-categories, e.g. the &quot;category of all categories&quot;. The study of examples of representations of such 2-categories has led to some exciting breakthroughs on long-standing problems in pure mathematics. Our project is to extend the theory of representations of algebras to representations of 2-categories with analogous properties to those of algebras, with the goal of providing a structured framework for the examples that have been observed, hence facilitating future use of these successful concepts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K011782/1","grantId":"EP/K011782/1","fundValue":"98836","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They have not yet been used as they are too new (the grant only having been live for 13 months).

We have furthermore developed a Morita theory for finitary 2-categories. We have started investigating 2-representations with more than one simple transitive subquotient. There will be applications to examples that many people are itnrested in, e.g. 2-Kac-Moody algebras, Soergel bimodules in type A, and more. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
