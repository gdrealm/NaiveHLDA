{"id":"890255A6-BB88-46FB-AE1F-81B208057806","title":"Novel tendon attachment and repair strategy","abstractText":"Every year there are &gt;3,000people that injure their hand tendons. Currently, only 60% of these people result with an effective repair. This is because scar tissue forms that is not the same as its original tissue, making the hand stiff and difficult to move properly. This poor healing not only has an impact on the person with the injury, but also on the NHS as physiotherapy and occupational therapy costs post injury as a result are high. This project proposes an exciting and novel approach to repairing tendons. It allows mechanical loads to be transferred across the healing tendon which will promote new healthy tissue repair and reduce the formation of scars. We have a currently funded DPFS grant that has given us a promising set of data that demonstrates how state of the art polymer nano-fibres can be used in tendon repair. This data is in small rodents only and we now seek further MRC DPFS funding to perform larger animal model studies to translate this product development to the clinic. The proposed multidisiplinary research team have international track records in the area of clinical tendon repair, biomaterials development and medicinal product translation. In this project, this team will gather the regulatory data necessary on this novel medical device read for clinical trial following this project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M007642/1","grantId":"MR/M007642/1","fundValue":"1221230","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Harriet Cartmell","coPersons":["Adam  Reid","Jason  Wong","Duncan Angus  McGrouther","Karl  Kadler","Peter David Clegg","Lucy Ann Bosworth"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
