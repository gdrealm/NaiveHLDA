It will suggest that etymological play is positioned strategically at the beginning and end of important sectors of the argument and reflects an ancient atomist analogy between the combination of letters in words and the combination of atoms in things. This analogy will also be shown to play a key role in lacertian poetics, with the poet's act of literary creation being likened to the creation of the universe through the combination of atoms and void.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112909/1","grantId":"112909/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Maltby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
