{"id":"E1E501DB-1D85-4E81-A992-2DB1B128FC37","title":"Numerical and mathematical analysis of diffusion induced grain boundary motion","abstractText":"This research intends to use mathematical and computational techniques to study the phenomenon of diffusion induced grain boundary motion (DIGM). Grain boundaries, that are typically very thin, separate regions in metals that are made up of different structures. DIGM occurs when a thin sheet of metal is placed in a vapour that contains a different metal. The atoms from the vapour diffuse into the sheet but only in the areas where the grain boundaries are situated. The presence of the vapour atoms in the sheet causes stresses in the metal and as a result of these stresses the grain bounadies move within the sheet. The objective of the proposed research is to analyse mathematical models for the motion of these grain boundaries and to produce reliable and efficient computer codes that will enable computer simulations of DIGM in three space dimensions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078334/1","grantId":"EP/D078334/1","fundValue":"148903","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vanessa  Styles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
