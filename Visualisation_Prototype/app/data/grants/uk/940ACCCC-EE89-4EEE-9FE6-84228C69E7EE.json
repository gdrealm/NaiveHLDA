{"id":"940ACCCC-EE89-4EEE-9FE6-84228C69E7EE","title":"ES/H023380/1","abstractText":"<p>Recent developments in psychometric item response theory are having an increasing impact on data modeling and analysis in all the social sciences. At the same time the demand for psychometricians and psychometric expertise in education, medicine, business and forensics is increasing considerably. As a result of these developments a serious skills shortage is emerging, not only in academia but also in the workforce more generally.&nbsp; Our very successful 3rd round RDI initiated a training programme to address this issue. </p>\n\n<p>The 4th round will build on this success, while at the same time focusing on topical issues surrounding the use of psychometrics in a diverse society, particularly where decisions have to be made that can have an adverse impact on specific groups defined by social, gender, ethnic, cultural, religious, or disability. During this award we will develop training ( 2-day Workshops), webpages and e-resources and 5-day Summer Schools on psychometric methods, including IRT, Differential Item Functioning (DIF), Multilevel Modeling and Longitudinal Data Analysis using multiple software packages, including commercial produces such as Stata and Mplus, and free software such as R. We will also host a national event raising awareness of the potential of psychometrics for meeting the needs of a diverse society.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-046-25-0012","grantId":"RES-046-25-0012","fundValue":"80422","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2012-06-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy James Croudace","coPersons":["John  Rust"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
