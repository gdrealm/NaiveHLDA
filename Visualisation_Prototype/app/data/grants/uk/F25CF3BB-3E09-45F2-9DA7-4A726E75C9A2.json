{"id":"F25CF3BB-3E09-45F2-9DA7-4A726E75C9A2","title":"Structural Basis of Sigma-1 Receptor Ligand Interactions and Signalling","abstractText":"Cells have internal compartments that are specialised for unique functions including energy generation and protein production. The compartments are segregated by internal membranes that are selectively permeable. The membranes contain protein molecules (&quot;membrane proteins&quot;) with the critical job of permitting the transfer of matter and information into and out of the intracellular compartments to enable coordination of cellular function. The Sigma-1 Receptor (S1R) is one such protein that is involved in regulating the communication between energy generating mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which requires energy to produce the proteins necessary for the cell to function effectively. S1R is embedded in the ER membrane of neural cells in a region closely apposed to mitochondria and signals energy demands to the mitochondria. Because of its central role in maintaining an appropriate response to energy demands in neurons, S1R activity impacts a range of neurological conditions. S1R is regulated by both endogenous molecules and exogenous drugs, some of which are currently used therapeutically for the treatment of pain, depression, and schizophrenia. Our work aims to understand the molecular basis of S1R activity in terms of how it interacts with those drugs and how those interactions lead to communication between the ER and mitochondria.\n Membrane proteins like S1R that transmit signals across membranes are critical switching points in intracellular communication networks. Because of their functional importance, understanding how these proteins work is important both medically and for biotechnology and industry. As with the macroscopic world, one of the best approaches for understanding how proteins work is by observing them in detail. However, membrane proteins are extremely challenging to study by conventional methods since they must be extracted from the native cellular environment in which they have evolved to be most stable. We have developed methods to produce S1R in large quantities and purify it in large quantities from both bacterial and mammalian cells -- a necessity for robust, atomic-level observation. We propose here to take advantage of the approaches we have developed to study the structure and interactions of S1R in detail. A central technique of the proposed research is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). NMR is a flexible, information-rich spectroscopy that provides atomic level information, and is particularly powerful in studying inter-molecular interactions in detail. We anticipate that the results of this study will (i) help to understand the mechanism of S1R in neurological disease, (ii) facilitate design of novel therapeutic agents, and (iii) facilitate structural characterisation of other membrane protein signaling proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K018590/1","grantId":"MR/K018590/1","fundValue":"625233","fundStart":"2013-04-02","fundEnd":"2016-04-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason Ronald Schnell","coPersons":["Alexandru Radu Aricescu"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
