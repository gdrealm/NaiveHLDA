{"id":"80682EA8-7236-4487-AEEE-724E4D8B24D8","title":"Pavement and Rail Track Engineering","abstractText":"This grant will allow the Nottingham Transportation Engineering Centre (NTEC), formerly known as the Nottingham Centre for Pavement Engineering (NCPE), to continue to undertake a wide range of research-led initiatives in pavement and rail track engineering. These are critical infrastructure areas for the UK economy and quality of life and represent a combined asset value of some 620 billion with an annual expenditure in the region of 6 billion.In this proposal, particular emphasis is placed on the development of Highway Asset Management as a research theme and the continued development of Physicochemical Interactions and Sustainable Construction through multidisciplinary research links with areas such as Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Structural Mechanics, Materials Science and Economics to exploit research at the boundaries between these disciplines and pavement and rail track engineering.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F018045/1","grantId":"EP/F018045/1","fundValue":"668173","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2013-03-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon  AireyAndrew Charles Collop","coPersons":["Tony  Parry","Stephen Frederick  Brown","Andrew R Dawson","Nicholas Howard Thom"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
