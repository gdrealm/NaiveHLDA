Its critical position to the settlement of the Caribbean is reflected in its deep archaeological record, documenting the complex interactions between its diverse peoples over millennia. Unique among its archaeological sites is Pitch Lake, one of the largest natural deposits of asphalt in the world (see Fig. 1 - Visual Evidence), which over the years has yielded extremely rare wood carvings - to date the largest concentration of ancient wood artefacts in the Lesser Antilles (of the 18 carvings known from the region, eleven were recovered from Pitch Lake). However, unlike any systematic archaeological excavation, these carvings have been dredged up as a consequence of commercial pitch harvesting (Fig 2), and any association between them, or the skeletal remains that were also recovered, have been lost. They are thus rarely discussed in the archaeological literature - they float outside chronologies, peripheral to the ceramic and stone foundations upon which Caribbean prehistory is based. \n\nYet wood is among the most insightful of materials, lending itself to radiocarbon dating, stable isotope analyses and botanical identification - the latter two providing direct insights into people's interaction with their environment. The carving scars evident on these pieces echo the movements of those labouring over them and provide a window onto their past activities. Historical accounts from the 15th-16th centuries indicate that Caribbean cultures had rich wood carving traditions, and that much of their material culture was carved in wood - from massive communal houses to utilitarian objects such as canoes, paddles and vessels, to ritual items and ceremonial seats - and this heritage can now only be glimpsed through the handful of examples that survive in museum and private collections. This reliance on wood undoubtedly goes back to the first migrations - without canoes and paddles, for example, the islands could not be settled. Hence, despite the lack of context, the carvings from Pitch Lake - now held in three separate institutions - provide a unique opportunity to investigate the importance of wood artefacts, especially valuable in a context where wood was the basis of material culture, but rarely survives. The proposed research would be the first detailed, multi-disciplinary investigation of the Pitch Lake wood carvings, with the aim of placing these objects in a chronological and cultural perspective. \n\nFrom the artefacts (Fig 3) recovered from this one site we can potentially explore not only local adaptations, but regional influences and exchanges - as well as more esoteric/symbolic meanings. The methodologies enable a deeper level of investigation into the corpus - from the stable isotope analysis that can provide insights into the source of the trees used for the carvings, to the wood ID which can be cross-referenced with historical accounts of how such woods were used (from timber to medicinal knowledge). The deposit of burials and artefacts in the lake also suggests a deeper symbolism, one befitting such an unusual setting. Several myths collected during the 19th century, a time when an indigenous population was still resident in the area, recount that the lake was a portal through which the deceased returned in the form of birds to visit their descendants. The recurring themes in the legends, of death and the afterlife, give some support to the possibility that the area may have had a spiritual significance, one that may have had a considerable chronological depth spanning many generations. The lake could have had conceptual parallels to caves, used across the Caribbean for burials and the deposit of ritual objects - and as such a fitting area of ceremonial deposit and myth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L00268X/1","grantId":"AH/L00268X/1","fundValue":"139935","fundStart":"2014-02-28","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Ostapkowicz","coPersons":["Fiona  Brock"],"organisation":"National Museums Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
