The auctions improve efficiency by simultaneously allocating distinct goods - in this example, funds against different collaterals.</p>\n\n<p>This project will further develop the Product-Mix Auction to make it a practical tool in a broader range of contexts—including non-financial ones.</p>\n\n<p>The work required to extend it’s range and flexibility will</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>use recently-developed geometric techniques</li>\n\n <li>develop our theory of &quot;demand types&quot;</li>\n\n <li>shed light on a wide range of theoretical issues</li>\n\n <li>develop a better characterisation and understanding of economic agents' preferences when goods are indivisible</li>\n\n <li>yield answers to some deep problems about the existence of economic equilibrium</li>\n\n <li>have applications to matching theory.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will also develop software implementations of our auction procedures.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003058/1","grantId":"ES/L003058/1","fundValue":"434028","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Klemperer","coPersons":["Elizabeth Camilla Baldwin"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
