By means of a survey of a random sample of 500 LGBs and a similar number of heterosexual employees, the study will describe and quantify experiences, examine how experiences vary between lesbians, gays and bisexuals, and how they differ from those of heterosexuals. Factors which may contribute to negative experiences, eg gender, age, ethnicity, disability, levels of education, pay, tenure, organisational status and occupation will be explored. The survey will be followed up by six organisational case studies, two each from the public, private and third sectors, respectively representing a high and a low risk organisation in terms of discrimination, bullying and harassment. In addition to investigating various risk-factors, the case studies will explore how LGBs describe and make sense of their working experiences with a particular focus on LGBsâ€™ level of openness about their sexuality in the workplace. Information about how actions by management, trade unions/staff associations and other players might impact on disclosure and experience of discrimination, bullying and harassment will also be sought.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H025553/1","grantId":"ES/H025553/1","fundValue":"432031","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings of this study were released at a conference for practitioners and policy-makers at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Canary Wharf where a report of key findings: 'The ups and downs of LGBs' workplace experiences' was made available in print and digital copy formats on study website. Public relations associated with the report launch generated considerable interest in the media, including The Independent and HR press. The study's key findings were discussed in invited addresses by representatives from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), and in statements by panellists representing large organisations within public and private sectors, case-study organisations from the study, policy-making bodies and LGB advocacy organisations such as Stonewall and Lesbian &amp; Gay Federation (LGF). \nAmong key issues highlighted with potential for impact were the following:\n1. Due to its scale and robust methodology, the report (study) documented more accurately than any previous LGB studies the realities of LGB employees' experiences in British workplaces, particularly adverse and negative experiences. \n2. The thought-provoking nature of many of the findings and commentaries such as the disclosure process, sexualisation and negative stereotyping of LGBs as well as homophobia, challenged key aspects of current academic thinking and practitioner understanding. \n3. The insights provided by focus groups in our case studies of heterosexuals' understanding of LGB workplace experiences sparked discussion and reflection on policy development and enactment in general, and more specifically on workplace conduct and behaviour and the role of managers in setting standards and ensuring these are upheld, if necessary though intervention. \nFollow-up events have taken place particularly aimed at HR practitioners, including a workshop at the House of Lords for the CIPD's national Senior Diversity Managers' Network. Other organisational initiatives aimed at discussion, training and education are in train in several sectors, e.g. the Royal Navy, the Civil Service and the Department of Health, utilising our materials to stimulate discussion. In the NHS, ongoing consultation with the researchers concerning more effectively addressing LGB issues are taking place with senior management. The importance of fostering senior LGB role-models has been adopted by the organisation Outstanding, a network for LGBT executives, where a study of their experiences on company boards has been developed in conjunction with the research team and is currently seeking funding.\nLGB networks within several trade unions have used the findings to revise practices in consultation with members of the research team. Two motions emerging from study findings were passed at the TUC Conference in 2015 aiming to bring LGBs' workplace experiences to the attention of the trade union movement for action to improve LGB employee experiences. Internationally, the findings have been presented and discussed at events organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Norwegian Equality and Discrimination Ombud, a Canadian trade union and at various international academic conferences. In particular, among researchers and practitioners of workplace bullying and harassment, our study has brought new insights and stimulated new research projects into LGB employees (e.g. Spain and Japan).
