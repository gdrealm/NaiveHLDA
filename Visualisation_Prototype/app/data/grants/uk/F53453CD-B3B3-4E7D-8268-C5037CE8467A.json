One paper compared different approaches to the analysis of household-level decisions using longitudinal individual-level data when household composition changes over time, and introduced new random effects models (Steele, Clarke and Washbrook, Sociological Methodology). These models have also been employed in analysis of residential mobility in Australia (Haynes and Martinez, submitted). In Britain the results show an increased chance of a move during pregnancy and shortly after a birth, but lower mobility among larger families and a decline in mobility with the age of the youngest child. Other methodological research considered the impact of non-ignorable attrition when drop-out is directly influenced by moving home (Washbrook, Clarke and Steele, J. Roy. Stat. Soc. C). Ermisch and Washbrook (Scottish Journal of Political Economy) focused on the effect of housing equity on residential mobility of home-owners under age 45. Moves among this group are likely to be motivated by the desire to 'upgrade' housing in terms of space for additional children or neighbourhood quality. The results suggest that the ability of households to realise their moving desires is inhibited by low equity in their current homes.\n\nAnother strand of research investigated spatial variation in fertility and the effect of local house prices. Kulu and Washbrook (Advances in Life Course Research) examined fertility variation between central London, London suburbs, other towns and cities, and small towns and rural areas. The analysis shows that fertility rates increase as settlement size decreases, a pattern that is not explained by migration of couples to smaller settlements in anticipation of childbearing. Washbrook (submitted) used monthly area-level house price data linked to individual-level data to explore the precise timing of the relationship between housing market conditions and fertility responses. The results reveal positive but temporary effects on the fertility of home-owners, in contrast to negative and longer-lasting effects on the fertility of renters. \n\nThe above research focused on either the effects of family changes on housing transitions or the effects of residential context and other housing-related factors on childbearing. Joint analysis of the two processes enhances our understanding of their interrelationship. Multichannel sequence analysis was used to study holistic housing pathways for Australian families (Spalek, Haynes and Jones, J. Longitudinal and Lifecourse Studies). Comparative research of housing pathways in Australia and Britain is underway. Kulu and Steele (Demography) used multilevel simultaneous equations modelling, applied to rich Finnish register data, to analyse the relative timing of childbearing and housing changes. \n\nAnother strand of research considered the process by which individuals sort into different types of neighbourhood. A longitudinal mixed logit model was developed to estimate the effects of area characteristics on the decision to move from the current area ('push' effects) and on the choice of destination among movers ('pull' effects), allowing the importance of area factors to depend on measured and unmeasured household characteristics (Steele, Washbrook et al, submitted). Further research is in progress to apply this methodology in a study of neighbourhood choices of young families. The principal aim of the project was to develop appropriate methodology for examining the relationship between housing transitions and fertility and, more broadly, the analysis of longitudinal data on individuals and households. We therefore expect that the research will have most impact on the ways in which quantitative social scientists analyse longitudinal data. In the short term we anticipate that the methods developed under the project will be used primarily by academic researchers, with Communities and Social Services/Policy","dataset":"gtr"}
