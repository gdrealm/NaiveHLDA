{"id":"7364777D-EA2D-4E84-92AF-9EF2E28DA2E5","title":"Limit theorems for spatiotemporal random fields and related topics","abstractText":"The proposed project concerns with the problem of anomalous diffusion, which is described by different types of fractional kinetic and non-linear diffusion equations. We will develop models and prove limit theorems for spatio-temporal random fields, arising as the Green function solution to stochastic differential equations or fractional stochastic differential equations driven by independently scattered random measures. We will also study the scaling laws for the Burgers and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equations with quadratic external potential and random initial conditions. We will investigate the limit theorems for integrals and multifractal products of spatio-temporal random fields with log infinite divisible distributions. The identification problems for spatio-temporal random fields arising in turbulence and anomalous diffusion based on the higher-order information will be also examined.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D057361/1","grantId":"EP/D057361/1","fundValue":"10379","fundStart":"2006-03-07","fundEnd":"2009-03-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"N  Leonenko","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
