We will identify, analyse and compare key controversies in the two countries in which the media construct public images of different religions and their members. This will be supported by the development of a matrix for comparing media datasets which, in addition to its use in our own contexts, will provide the foundation for further comparative analysis in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the Nordic countries.<br /><br />The collaboration is based on twice-yearly meetings and the following core activities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the development of a strategy for comparing media portrayals of religion and religious identity in the UK and Canada</li>\n\n <li>opportunities for postgraduates and early career researchers through active participation in both the research and the network</li>\n\n <li>knowledge exchange and impact activities including religion and media workshops (with journalists, religious correspondents, religious communications specialists etc), and contributions to policy through collaboration with existing users</li>\n\n <li>international dissemination of the research results and extension of the partnership to researchers beyond UK/Canada.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J019739/1","grantId":"ES/J019739/1","fundValue":"22088","fundStart":"2012-05-18","fundEnd":"2015-05-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kim  Knott","coPersons":["Lori G Beaman"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
