{"id":"8F0B091D-B5D7-45BC-BDC5-9C8E80C76FED","title":"Ethics in Consumption: Interdisciplinary Perspectives","abstractText":"The proposed seminar programme connects with a series of important historic and contemporary concerns that relate to issues of individual, societal and environmental wellbeing. We focus on critical connections between consumption and ethics that are increasingly central to citizen and industry practice and government policy. Consumption and ethics have become central to how individuals and groups experience, interpret and respond to the marketplace and governmental policy and often in turn how these institutions respond to them. \n\nThe proposed seminar series is designed to create inter-disciplinary links nationally and internationally with leading scholars, early career researchers and scholars, and relevant user and stakeholder groups that are interested in critically engaging with the intersections between ethics and consumption. The series also aims to create a supportive forum and community of practice to foster good practice, encourage collaborative projects and explore solutions to environmental and human ethical concerns across consumption related activities. \n\nThis proposal supports ESRC's three strategic priorities: (1) the promotion of sustainable growth through consideration of the social, environmental, and economic impacts of consumption; (2) influencing societal behaviour through the engagement of a broad range of stakeholders and the dissemination of insight arising from the seminars; and (3) the promotion of a fair and vibrant society through cross-disciplinary and cross-industry focus on the ethics involved in consumption and the development of concrete strategies and actions - including recommendations for public policy - through the community of practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M002446/1","grantId":"ES/M002446/1","fundValue":"30052","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deirdre Sheila Shaw","coPersons":["Terry  Newholm","Michal Jemma Carrington","Andreas  Chatzidakis"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
