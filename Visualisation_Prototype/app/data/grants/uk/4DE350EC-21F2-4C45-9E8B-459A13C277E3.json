In a newborn human baby, areas of soft tissue remain between skull bones, allowing flexibility and continued growth. In an adult, the sutures close and the brain is enclosed in a rigid bony shell to which the facial bones are immovably attached. Gape is limited. However, in the skulls of adult lizards, snakes and birds some sutures remain open, allowing movement of the skull parts on one another. This flexibility (=kinesis) can be spectacular, e.g. in a large snake swallowing prey with a body diameter several times that of its own head. Such skulls clearly operate in a very different way to the rigid skulls of mammals, and reflect major differences in biology and lifestyle. Comparative studies between skull types are important in shedding light on normal, pathological and aging skull functions generally. Mammals need a regular supply of food to maintain a constant high body temperature. Their skulls have evolved to maximise the efficiency of oral food processing (chewing) (e.g. differentiated teeth, precise occlusion, hard palate, precise muscle control). Lizards and snakes, in contrast, warm themselves from external sources and can feed opportunistically. A large meal can last a snake for months), and there is usually little oral food processing. Instead, the skull of advanced snakes allows increased gape and aids both food transport through the mouth and swallowing. In lizards, from which snakes evolved, the situation is less clear-cut. Skull movements are more subtle and many of the joints through which they act, or potentially act, are not well understood. Many questions remain unanswered, notably: a) which lizards are really kinetic and to what degree? b) how do the different skull parts move in relation to one another, and by how much (passive adjustments or active linked movements)? c) what is the role of the membrane-cartilage braincase in the adult? Does it aid or limit kinesis? Does observed anatomical variation match the pattern of kinesis? d) what are the consequences of kinesis for skull function and stability, and how does this relate to diet? e) can kinetic ability be predicted by skull shape? To date, most discussion of lizard kinesis has been based on dissection, manipulation of dead or anaesthetised animals, theoretical analyses, and a few experimental studies. As a result, there is a lack of agreement on many points. Advanced computer modelling offers an alternative approach. Our research group is cross-disciplinary (reptile anatomy/evolution; biomechanical engineering; analysis of shape in relation to function). We have a strong track-record and have pioneered an approach that combines the use of 3-D computer simulations (multibody dynamics analysis) and stress analysis (finite element analysis). This yields detailed, anatomically accurate working computer models of animal skulls, including joints and muscles (jaw, neck). Sophisticated software then allows us to relate changing skull shape to skull performance during feeding. Comparisons with living animals (bite force data, records of muscle action and feeding) have shown our models to be biologically realistic, but our U.S collaborators (Ross, Lappin) will collect further comparative data in the new project. Beneficiaries of our work include the academic community (evolutionary biologists, palaeontologists, functional anatomists - data and new methodological approaches), the UK science base in general (through training of young scientists in an interdisciplinary framework, attraction of overseas students and collaborators, engaging young people in science), the wider public (public engagement, media interest) and, potentially, clinicians (perspectives on normal, aging and pathological skull, jaw and tooth function).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H011668/1","grantId":"BB/H011668/1","fundValue":"310869","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project has revealed the role of skull flexibility in feeding, and in addition the key role of soft tissue in cranial biomechanics.

To date, kinesis has proved extremely difficult to study in live animals. X-ray cinematography has its limitations as subtle movements between bones are difficult to record and interpret, especially when the head as a whole is moving. Strain gauging is a second approach but only a few points on the skull can be studied simultaneously, frustrating the development of an integrated picture. Computer modelling offers an alternative. Software originally created for mechanical engineers can be used to build anatomically accurate, moving, computer models of animal skulls in order to analyse their behaviour (global patterns of strain) during feeding. The main problem, however, is validation. Do these models represent biological reality? This is difficult to demonstrate with extinct animals but by studying living animals in the same way we can compare in vivo and in silico data from the same animals and assess model accuracy and determine which model attributes (e.g. bone density, muscle attachment) are most sensitive to perturbation.\n\nWe expect outputs to continue but to date:\n(a) In vivo strain and bite force data have been recorded for six lizard taxa: Tupinambis, Iguana, Varanus, Gekko, Uromastyx and Anolis. Data for Uromastyx, Tupinambis and Varanus have been processed (the rest are ongoing) and show that food capture, manipulation and biting put the greatest stress on the skull. In the skull roof, these stress are much greater than those in comparable mammals, supporting the view that the frame-like reptile skull is optimised to withstand feeding forces. \n\n(b) The lizards used in (a) were euthanized and one individual of each lizard type (with the best in vivo data) was CT scanned to make a 3D digital skull model. The same head was then dissected and individual muscles removed, weighed, and fibre lengths measured. Skull, joint and muscle data were combined to make multi-body models as a preliminary to strain analysis (=FEA). \n\n(c) The multibody model of the Tupinambis skull yielded bite force estimates that closely match in vivo bites from the same individual, providing a strong validation of the methodology, although it is sensitive to muscle data (e.g. fibre length, intrinsic strength). Work on other lizards is ongoing.\n\n(d) In our more familiar human skulls, the sutures between individual bones close to create a rigid shell that fully encloses the brain. In lizards, these sutures often remain patent, allowing small but important displacements in reaction to forces acting on the skull. Larger-scale movements may occur at kinetic joints. Incorporation of sutures and kinetic joints to the skull model of Tupinambis increased total strain, a result that seems counterintuitive. However, the sutures help to distribute strain more evenly, reducing peak strains that might damage the skull and ensuring a background level of strain that is probably necessary to maintain bone integrity. \n\n(e) The role of other cranial soft tissues has yet to be fully explored, but we hypothesised that the cartilaginous braincase (=chondrocranium) might play a role in damping stresses. More work is needed, but its inclusion in the Tupinambis skull model did reduce strains in the facial region.\n\n(f) Varanus (Africa, Australia, Asia) and Tupinambis (South America) are large terrestrial lizards with a similar lifestyle. We recorded bites of ~200N in both, greater than that of many comparable mammals. Although Varanus reportedly has the more flexible skull, we found greater mid-skull bending in Tupinambis, but skull strains were higher in the longer snout of Varanus. Work is ongoing but confirms that kinesis is absent in Iguana and significant in Gekko, with previously unreported flexibility in Anolis. a) Suture work developed into further projects into mammal skull growth and research into craniosynostosis and its treatment\nb) New approaches to the modelling of biological systems\nc) Education and museums\n\nResearch continues - with increasing interest in clinical problems.
