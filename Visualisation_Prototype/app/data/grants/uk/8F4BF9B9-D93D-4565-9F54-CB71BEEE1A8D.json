{"id":"8F4BF9B9-D93D-4565-9F54-CB71BEEE1A8D","title":"Medieval monographs on the Jewish calendar","abstractText":"A number of monographs describing the Jewish calendar, its origins, and how weeks, months, and years are reckoned in Jewish tradition were written by various Hebrew authors in the first half of the 12th century CE. These works have largely been ignored in modern scholarship; yet calendars are central to social life, and the large number of manuscripts that have survived of these works demonstrates the importance they must have held in Jewish medieval culture.\\n\\nIn this project we propose to examine the calendar monographs of Jacob b.Shimshon, Abraham b.Hiyya, and Abraham ibn Ezra (all early 12th cent.) and produce modern editions with critical apparatus, translation, introduction, and commentary. Such editions have never yet been produced. Our project will involve first compilation, then textual and codicological analysis, of all the manuscripts extant; elucidation of the calendrical, astronomical, and mathematical contents of the works; and source and literary criticism. A comparison of these works will be carried out, and consideration will be taken of their broader context including other relevant works by the same authors, Islamic and Chistian calendars and calendar monographs from the medieval period, controversies on the calendar between Rabbanites (who authored our monographs on the Jewish calendar) and Karaites, and medieval astronomy (which forms an essential component of these works).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F009518/1","grantId":"AH/F009518/1","fundValue":"732243","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sacha  Stern","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
