{"id":"078A2878-99D9-4A11-A46E-75FF2128AF92","title":"Experimental Particle Physics","abstractText":"Our research is focused on experimental measurements and physics analysis of data taken at the CERN, DESY and SLAC laboratories. We contribute to the design, construction and testing of detector components, preparation of software and physics analysis, monitoring and operation of detectors during data-taking and physics analysis of the recorded data. We are making significant contributions to the ATLAS and ALICE experiments which are being prepared for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. During the period of the grant these two experiments will make the transition into physics data collection and analysis, and we will be very strongly involved with that. In addition, we are working on the data-taking and analysis of the physics data from the BaBar and H1 experiments, and research and development for both the accelerator and detector at the international linear collider.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000355/1","grantId":"PP/E000355/1","fundValue":"6000960","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Watkins","coPersons":["Nigel Keith Watson","Alan Trevor Watson","David  Evans","David  Charlton","Christopher  Hawkes","John Allan Wilson","Paul  Newman","Goronwy  Tudor Jones"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
