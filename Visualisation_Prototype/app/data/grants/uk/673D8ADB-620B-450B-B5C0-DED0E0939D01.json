{"id":"673D8ADB-620B-450B-B5C0-DED0E0939D01","title":"The role of metabotropic glutamate and GABA-B receptors in oligodendrocyte development survival and vulnerability in the immature brain","abstractText":"Oligodendroglial cells are located in the area of the brain called 'white matter' where they provide support to nerve cells. Nerve cells communicate with other nerve cells via fibres called axons. Fast and reliable communication through axons in the brain fundamentally depends on myelin that covers the axons. Oligodendrocytes are the specialised brain cells that produce this myelin and ensheath axons during development. Normal development of oligodendrocytes and myelin formation are complex procedures, regulated by a wide range of cellular interactions. Oligodendrocytes respond to various chemical signals in the developing brain and they alter their proliferation, migration, differentiation and myelin formation. Immature oligodendroglial cells are very vulnerable in the developing brain and they are often damaged if they are poorly supplied with oxygen (e.g.: poor lung function or birth complications). The selective death of oligodendroglial cells can severely disrupt myelination in newborn infants, which can lead to major neurological complications later in life. Memory and movement disorders frequently develop following extensive lesions of the immature oligodendroglial cells in brain white matter. Our basic understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of oligodendrocyte development, their increased vulnerability and factors that enhance their regeneration in the immature brain is very limited. Recently we have identified proteins (receptors), which mediate the actions of the major brain transmitter chemicals glutamate and GABA in immature oligodendroglial cells. Glutamate and GABA are released from active nerve cells and they represent chemical signals for cells in the brain including the oligodendrocytes. The activity dependent release of glutamate and GABA from nerve cells may influence oligodendrocyte development and survival in the brain. The purpose of this project is to define the role of these receptors in oligodendroglial development, myelin formation, survival and regeneration following white matter damage. Better understanding of these basic cellular and molecular events in the premature brain is essential for the development of effective treatment strategies for white matter damage. Medical advances significantly improved the survival rate of seriously premature infants and 70% of these infants develop prominent oligodendrocyte damage. Furthermore, oligodendrocyte damage is a prominent feature of a range of other neurological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke and spinal cord injury). Therefore better understanding of basic processes of oligodendrocyte development, survival and regeneration following damage has major public health implications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011326/1","grantId":"BB/F011326/1","fundValue":"470594","fundStart":"2008-06-16","fundEnd":"2011-07-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results of this project provided a basis for a PhD studentship for Alexandra Spittle which identified the properties and signalling mechanisms of group I metabotropic glutamate and GABAB receptors in oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

We have established that activation of the GABAB neurotransmitter receptors can increase the number of oligodendrocites and stimulate their migration. These changes likely to improve myelin regeneration following damage caused by poor blood and oxygen supply to the immature brain. Indeed, treatment with a drug that selectively activates GABAB receptors immediately after relatively moderate early postnatal brain damage improved the performance of male rats in behavioural and motor coordination tests performed after the animals recovered. Activation of one of the glutamate receptors (mGluR5) can protect immature oligodendrocytes from cell death. In contrast, treatment with a synthetic steroid hormone can increase the vulnerability of immature oligodendrocytes, which may have clinical implications.  Healthcare,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
