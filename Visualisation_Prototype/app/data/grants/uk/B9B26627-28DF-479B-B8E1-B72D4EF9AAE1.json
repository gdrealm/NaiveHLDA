Drawing on archival research this project examines how extensive contract with a commercial and territorially expansive empire facilitated the absorption of Iroquois land, labour and resources in to a market economy. It will also consider how native gender and ethnic identities were reconfigured in the process. Wishing to dismantle the artificial barrier between Indian and non-Indian histories, this study situates the Iroquois within a larger imperial perspective demonstrating how they were shaped by and shapers of the early -modern Atlantic world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112812/1","grantId":"112812/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gail  MacLeitch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
