It is difficult to prove with all scientific rigor that an image produced by a new algorithm is statistically significantly better than other state-of-the-art results. This project is indented to provide means of comparing computer graphics results in a possibly effective and accurate way. A major deliverable of this project is to develop the first computational image quality metric suitable for use with computer graphics applications. The metric is intended to replace tedious user studies with a computational algorithm capable of estimating quality loss due to approximated solutions. Such a metric will have a significant impact on both academic researchers and industries working in the field. It will enable validation studies to be more robust and far cheaper to carry out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006575/1","grantId":"EP/I006575/1","fundValue":"100739","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rafal Konrad Mantiuk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
