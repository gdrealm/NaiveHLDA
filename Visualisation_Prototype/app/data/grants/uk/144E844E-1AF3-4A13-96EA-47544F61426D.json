{"id":"144E844E-1AF3-4A13-96EA-47544F61426D","title":"Queen Victoria's Skull: George Combe and the mid-Victorian mind","abstractText":"George Combe (1788-1858) was an Edinburgh-based phrenologist who came to wield a tremendous intellectual influence in the mid nineteenth century. An advisor to Price Albert: the mentor of Richard Cobden: a formative influence on George Eliot: Combe provided intellectual inspiration to a generation of political and educational reformers. Combe's name fell into obscurity due to his connection with the discredited pseudo-science of phrenology, and this will be the first full-length study of his life and work since 1879. Among the subjects explored are the connections between phrenology and political reform, Combe's role as a public lecturer, and a detailed consideration of his Constitution of Man (1828).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112720/1","grantId":"112720/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Stack","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
