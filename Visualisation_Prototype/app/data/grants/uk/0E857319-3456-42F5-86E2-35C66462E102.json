People risk may arise from the actions or behaviours of a person, or persons, due to inadequate/insufficient methods, processes, systems or controls to the detriment of strategic objectives. The consideration of people as an underlying cause of risk (now termed 'people risk') is deeply rooted in people being the most important asset in the firm.</p>\n\n<p>However, in particular industries failures by 'key employees' (pilots, air traffic controllers, financial market traders, surgeons, train drivers, maritime captains) can have catastrophic economic, societal, and environmental consequences, thus creating a situation where employees can also be the most volatile liability in the firm.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Through a number of one-day seminars 'Lessons in People Risk Management' aims to bring together academics, researchers, industry practitioners, government agencies and post graduate students from both domestic and international bodies to share experiences and generate new knowledge and perspectives about the management of 'people risk' within their own industries.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000776/1","grantId":"ES/L000776/1","fundValue":"27858","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-18","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Cormac  Bryce","coPersons":["Robert  Webb","Zeljko  Sevic","Aleksandar  Sevic","Justin James Waring","Brian  Lucey","Thorsten G.H.
