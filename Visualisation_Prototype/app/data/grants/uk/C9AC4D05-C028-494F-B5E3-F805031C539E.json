{"id":"C9AC4D05-C028-494F-B5E3-F805031C539E","title":"Chemistry in Contemporary Society: An Adult Education Programme","abstractText":"Stories in the media about science continue to fire the imaginations of the general public. However, there is a significant proportion of the adult population whose scientific knowledge is insufficient to understand even the most basic aspects of these issues. The result is a section of the general public who are frustrated, or even intimidated, by science. The objective of this programme is to develop and present an extensive programme of events which illustrates the importance and pervasive nature of chemistry, and allows mature adults with only a rudimentary knowledge of science to learn about chemistry through presentations, demonstrations, debate, visits to laboratories and hands-on experience of practical chemistry. The programme has been designed to introduce the participants gently to a variety of aspects of fundamental and contemporary chemistry through taster events (presented by APTT, WEA and University of Newcastle). Other institutions (Centre for Lifelong Learning, University of Northumbria, Life Sciences Centre and The Open University) with an expertise and commitment to teaching adults are also collaborating on this project. Participants in the taster courses will receive guidance and encouragement to further their scientific knowledge by registering for the slightly more advanced course offered by these institutions. The more advanced courses range from those which stand alone, last only a few weeks and develop a particular aspect of chemistry in more detail, to those that lead to formal qualifications including degrees.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D507049/1","grantId":"EP/D507049/1","fundValue":"19902","fundStart":"2006-02-25","fundEnd":"2007-08-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Anthony Henderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
