Challenges include: complex causes, diverse diseases, climbing costs and conflicting risk factor trends (less smoking, more obesity, more diabetes, and persistent poverty). \n\nWe will therefore: \n# identify different ways to reduce risk factors in high-risk individuals and in whole populations (by searching the evidence literature and consulting NHS decision-makers);\n# extend a widely used computer prediction model for heart disease to include stroke and peripheral artery disease;\n# develop Web-based forms of the model for NHS users;\n# compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different prevention plans;\n# discuss our results with planners, policy makers, professionals and patient groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900847","grantId":"G0900847","fundValue":"487161","fundStart":"2010-05-24","fundEnd":"2014-05-23","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Capewell","coPersons":["Ffion  Lloyd-Williams","Helen  Mason","Cam  Donaldson","David  Taylor-Robinson","John  Foxe","Iain Edward Buchan"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
