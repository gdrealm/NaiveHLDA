The time frame begins\\nwith the Restoration of Charles II as King of Ireland and ends with the prohibition of divorce in the Irish Free State. The primary focus will be on the logistics of marriage among the social classes below the level of wealthy landowning families: how marriage was perceived, negotiated and controlled by church and state as well as by individual men and women. Although a significant amount of research has been completed on aristocratic marriage in Ireland surprisingly little has been done on the history of marriage among the 'middling' and lower social classes in rural or urban society. The project will, therefore, open up a new field of Irish social history \\nThe study will be divided into three main themes: 1) the control and regulation of marriage by church and state; 2) the identification and selection of spouses and the negotiation of formal and informal marriages; and 3) the logistics of marriage breakdown: why and how did marital partners separate and how was the separation viewed by the family, the community and church and state authorities. Key questions to be asked of each of these themes include the extent to which attitudes and practices changed over the time period examined and differed regionally and according to social class.\\nThe first theme will concentrate on tracing the evolution of statute law on marriage and the ways in which the different church denominations responded to civil legislation and how they supervised and controlled marriage within their own communities. It will explore the ambiguous attitude, reflected in legislation, of the state towards marriage ceremonies conducted outside the Church of Ireland. Following the Restoration, the Irish administration increasingly expressed its opposition to inter-denominational marriages and this section will examine how this opposition changed over the period and what it reveals about attitudes to marriage. There will also be an analysis of legislation designed to regulate other aspects of marriage including the age of spouses, abductions and clandestine marriages. Each of the main Christian denominations had its own rules and regulations concerning marriage. This section will also, therefore, incorporate a comparison of the supervision by the different denominations of the choice of spouse, courting rituals and regulation of marriage. \\nThe second theme of the project shifts attention to individual experience and explores how marriage partners were chosen and why. There will be a particular focus in this section on the economic basis for marriage and the rise in importance of the dowry among the middling sections of rural and urban society. The less formal side of marriage will also be examined through a comparative analysis of regional customs, rituals and folklore associated with courtship and the tradition of abductions and elopement which remained common in some parts of rural Ireland well into the second half of the nineteenth century. The prevalence of co-habitation or informal marriages not sanctioned by church or state, especially at the poorest level of society will also be explored. Particular attention will be given to the impact of the Great Famine on such customs and, more generally, on changing attitudes to dowries and what was considered as socially acceptable behaviour in the selection and courtship of a marriage partner. \\nThe third and final section will ask what happened when things went wrong. In a society where divorce was only available to the very wealthy, how did couples arrange or cope with separations or the long term break up of the marital bond? Under what circumstances did families and the communities accept separations even if prohibited by the rules of church and state? And, most importantly, what were the economic consequences of separation?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F01161X/1","grantId":"AH/F01161X/1","fundValue":"439107","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Luddy","coPersons":["Mary  O'Dowd"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
