This methodology produces exact simulations (to the accuracy constraints of any computer used for the experiment) and has remarkable efficiency properties, so that there appears to be no cost for exactness in this case. However the Exact Algorithm (EA) framework can be applied only for certain classes of diffusion processes (although this class essentially includes all one-dimensional non-explosive diffusions)This project aims to extend the framework above to a very rich and diverse class of stochastic processes, such as jump diffusions, hypo-elliptic diffusions and solutions of stochastic partial differential equations). The approach is to work both with pure simulation methodology and also with related (and more flexible) importance sampling techniques.There are many potential applications of these methods in scientific problems. We will focus on two important areas. The use of diffusion-related models in Systems Biology is expanding rapidly, and we will apply our methodology here. Secondly, we will consider the problem of rare event simulation in molecular dynamics simulation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026521/1","grantId":"EP/G026521/1","fundValue":"311940","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Roberts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" Traditional methods for diffusion simulation and related Monte Carlo methods have relied on time-discretisation techniques.

The main output is a novel Monte Carlo approach for calculating properties of any continuous-time stochastic process in a way that avoids any time-discretisation error. Other work includes approaches to inference for diffusions that uses a computationally-efficient approximation: which has been successfully applied to models used within systems biology and epidemics.
