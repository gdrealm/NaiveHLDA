We propose to use wireless sensor networks, in which mobile phones or other devices are configured to sense, transmit, receive and analyse information about an individual’s health status. </p>\n\n<p>The proposed research is based on the premise that both the technology and the clinical methodology already exist. The challenge is to convert theoretical knowledge of how chronic illnesses can be prevented or managed into a mode of use that is consistent with the target group's lifestyle. The combination of optimal clinical interventions and a mode of delivery that effectively resonates with an individual’s lifestyle is expected to result in improved quality of life – and possibly improved clinical outcomes. </p>\n\n<p>The objectives for the preparatory phase are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To form a consortium that is able to cover all the areas required, with each partner having an identified goal and benefits.<br /></li>\n\n <li>To develop a collaboration plan and work plan for a Collaborative Research Programme in Self Monitoring of Chronic Disease in Older People.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0138","grantId":"RES-351-25-0138","fundValue":"20111","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Marshall","coPersons":["Janet  Cade","Brian Stewart Hoyle"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
