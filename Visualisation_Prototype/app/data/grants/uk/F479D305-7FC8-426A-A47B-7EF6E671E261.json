Both industry and the extensive UK university network involved in nuclear research have stressed the importance of research using authentic, and thus by definition highly radioactive, materials. While a few UK universities routinely use small quantities of radioactive materials in their own laboratories, the only facility in the UK that could be accessed by university researchers for work on highly radioactive materials is the NNL's Central Laboratory.Due to the absence of suitable facilities and equipment, any nuclear research carried out by UK academia is restricted either to simulants or to limited programmes carried out overseas. While the quality of science is good within these constraints, all overseas competitors now have access to specialised facilities in national laboratories and work based on simulants is increasingly seen as falling below the normal quality benchmark. Any credible UK research programme must therefore have at its foundation the ability to work with and characterise highly radioactive samples. The UK also faces major R&amp;D and skills challenges in many areas of nuclear science and technology, which can only be met by a concerted, cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional programme of research and training built around close collaboration between industry, regulators and academia. This programme must be underpinned by facilities not just for the preparation of highly radioactive samples, but also for their characterisation. Since Central Laboratory is presently geared towards industrially driven development in which characterisation is a lesser priority, its capability in this area needs to be significantly enhanced. The provision of state-of-the-art analysis and characterisation facilities will therefore support research across all of the UK's priority nuclear research themes, and thus benefit the entire nuclear academic sector. We therefore propose to establish a core equipment base could be established in the National Nuclear Laboratory's Central Laboratory. This would be unique in the UK and facilitate world class fundamental research. Priority areas are spectroscopy and electron optics","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I034106/1","grantId":"EP/I034106/1","fundValue":"1578220","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is an equipment only grant Energy,Environment Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Francis  Livens","coPersons":["Sven Philipp Koehler","Louise Sarah Natrajan","Sarah  Heath","Simon Martin Pimblott","Nicholas  Bryan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The range of equipment specified in the grant application (primarily electron optics and chemical analysis instrumentation) has been procured and is now being installed in the NNL Central Laboratory.
