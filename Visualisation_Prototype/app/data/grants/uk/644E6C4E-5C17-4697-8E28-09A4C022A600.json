This will be achieved in the quaternion domain, benefiting from its division algebra, and thus promising a quantum improvement in the modelling of such signals. Particular emphasis will be on solutions for adaptive signal processing problems, whose accuracy will be enhanced through the use of quaternion statistics and the associated special forms of correlation- and eigen-structures. Current algorithms are less than adequate for the very large class of processes with noncircular (rotation dependent) probability distributions, and for signals whose components exhibit coupling and large unbalanced dynamics; these are common in array signal processing, wind modelling, motion tracking, and chaos engineering.The proposed research will enable unified modelling of three- and four-dimensional signals, together with better understanding of the associated nonlinear dynamics and geometry of learning, and will also serve as a framework for simultaneous modelling of heterogeneous data sources. The fundamental novelty of this work is our recently proposed quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithm, which makes full use of quaternion algebra, and thus allows for additional degrees of freedom and enhanced accuracy in the modelling of real world phenomena. This will also serve as a framework to design a suite of novel adaptive filtering and tracking algorithms, based on both standard and widely linear models, which will be suitable to deal with the generality of quaternion valued signals. Comprehensive theoretical evaluation and practical testing will be performed in order to prove the worthwhileness of the proposed approach. Practical applications considered will be short term wind forecasting in renewable energy and trajectory tracking from motion sensors in smart environments; particular gains are expected when dealing with large and intermittent dynamics at multiple scales (turbulence, gusts, multiple coupled rotation trajectories).This research proposal, based at Imperial College and in collaboration with an internationally leading research group from University of Tokyo Japan, will find solutions to these problems and will also open new possibilities for advances in a number of emerging areas dealing with uncertainty, complexity and multidimensional data natures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H026266/1","grantId":"EP/H026266/1","fundValue":"329847","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Danilo  Mandic","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
