They will then carry out a detailed investigation of recent innovation activity in four sites in each country and of the factors that have constrained and those that have supported innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Participatory research tools will include innovation histories, communication maps, value chain analysis and timelines. The analysis will generate hypotheses linking institutional arrangements, innovation activity, and changes in farm output, livelihoods, and incomes. These hypotheses will be tested using data from further participatory research and a sample survey in each of the research sites. The team will develop evidence-based conclusions on the potential and limitations for enhancing support for smallholder farmers’ innovation through new institutional arrangements and different ways of implementing support programmes at local level.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J00975X/1","grantId":"ES/J00975X/1","fundValue":"396645","fundStart":"2012-06-19","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Project recommendations formed part of final recommendations from FAO Forum on Communication for Development &amp; Community Media for Family Farming in Rome October 2014.
