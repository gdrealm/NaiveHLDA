{"id":"FA819C18-7917-4E22-A343-03184C5C686C","title":"Research in Theoretical Astronomy, 2006-11","abstractText":"The proposed research spans a wide range of topics within theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, addressing problems that span size scales ranging from the most compact stellar objects (neutron stars) to megaparsec scale processes in the intergalactic medium. The topics presented reflect the research expertise of the applicants and include topics that are traditional strengths at the IOA (e.g. dynamics, accretion discs, theoretical cosmology, computational simulations). A particular element of this grant is that it aims to promote synergy and collaboration between applicants working in diverse, but inter-related fields. For example, one project makes the link between massive stars and gamma ray bursts, while another applies the theory of warped accretion discs (developed for small scale discs around stars) to the problem of the spin distribution of supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies. Other projects are relevant to observational work that is ongoing at the IOA, such as studies of dwarf spheroidal galaxies or the structure of the intergalactic medium, or else pioneer computational techniques that can be applied to a wide range of problems in cosmology and astrophysics. Overall, our aim is to ensure that the research projects listed here reap the maximum added value of being conducted in the environment of a large and diverse institution such as the IOA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001005/1","grantId":"PP/D001005/1","fundValue":"1446180","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"C  Clarke","coPersons":["James  Pringle","Sverre Johannes Aarseth","George  Efstathiou","Martin  Rees","Antony Martin Lewis","Christopher Adam Tout","Martin  Haehnelt","W  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
