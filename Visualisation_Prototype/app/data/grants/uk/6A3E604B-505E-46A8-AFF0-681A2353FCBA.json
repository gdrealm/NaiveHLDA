{"id":"6A3E604B-505E-46A8-AFF0-681A2353FCBA","title":"Political Theologies:Responses of Religious Leaders and Authority Figures In England to Contemporary Issues of Freedom of Expression","abstractText":"If the European Enlightenment marginalized the political role of religion, current evidence shows a renewed importance for religion in global governance (Casanova, 1994; Gearon, 2002; Haynes, 2006; Hanson, 2006), increased interest in political theology (de Vries and Sullivan, 2006; Scott and Cavanaugh, 2007), and concentrated academic enquiry on the role of religion in public life (http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/nrpl/). \\n The events of 11 September 2001 have further heightened though an often negatively perceived role of religion in world governance (Hanson, 2006). In terms of freedom of expression, the 'Danish cartoons' in Jyllands-Posten and Pope Benedict XVI's Regensburg address have all reinforced in the popular imagination religion's, and specifically Islam's, perceived role in the repression of freedom of expression (Schall, 2007). Such perceptions highlight how little comparative work has been done to examine the range of religious responses to issues of freedom of expression. \\n Focused on responses of religious leaders and authority figures in England to contemporary issues of freedom of expression, Political Theologies will investigate, map and conceptualise notions of authority and leadership within disparate religious traditions in England, and thus advance our knowledge of contemporary relationships between religious and secular authority, with specific regard to issues of freedom of expression. The research will be of direct relevance to wider international debates around freedom of religion and freedom of thought, opinion and expression. AHRC here commented on the need to distinguish between freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Political Theologies will address this but is likely to demonstrate the difficulty of separating one from the other (Alexander, 2005; Appignanesi, 2006). \\n In contemporary political philosophy, where authority is conceptually fundamental to understanding and justifying polity, governance and law (Christiano, 2004; Raz, 1990; Shapiro, 2002; cf. Waldron, 1999), the research will produce a new, fresh and original empirical/ theoretical contribution to debates in which the political realities of contemporary religious authority and leadership have arguably been underplayed (Rawls, 2001; Dombrowski, 2001; Taylor, 2007). These 'political theologies' will provide new conceptualisations of religious authority and leadership in contemporary England through grounded, empirical evidence from the traditions themselves. This new, rich source of data will form the basis of further theoretical analysis, and a major contribution to the emergent field of political theology itself, and should satisfy the AHRC request that the re-submission develop a theoretical framework for authority, distinguishing between religious leaders and authority figures. (Refining these theoretical perspectives, including the distinction between religious leaders and authority figures, will also be further, directly and explicitly, addressed now in the interview schedule.) \\n This research is strongly speculative in making inroads into untrammelled territory, namely regarding our limited empirical knowledge of religious authority and leadership in relation in moments of 'cultural crisis'. More widely the research will here provide new knowledge and understanding of religious attitudes to secular authority, especially legal, and particularly human rights frameworks. The research will thus broadly enhance our knowledge of the nature, scope and influence of religious authority and leadership in England today.\\n The Department of Theology, University of Exeter, will now act as a Project Partner, facilitating dissemination of findings through the Network for Religion in Public Life, http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/nrpl/.\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008543/1","grantId":"AH/H008543/1","fundValue":"63788","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  I expect further impact on the publication of this substantial book, Religious Authority and the Arts: Conversations in Political Theology.

Over nearly three years I interviewed a range of senior religious figures from the considerable diversity of religious traditions represented in England. The small scale project conducted around fifty interviews, and produced nearly half a million words of transcripted interviews, edited down to its present length, with some difficult selection of material which necessarily meant for reasons of space some insightful conversations were omitted. Those that have been included cannot be said to be systematic in its coverage of all religious traditions or even of all the voices within any one of them. What for me became a physical and political-theological journey around England - from metropolitan capital to rural hinterlands - provided nevertheless a snapshot of attitudes and ideas, political and theological responses to contemporary issues of freedom of expression. \n It was an extraordinary journey, physically and intellectually, and I have tried to capture the essence of the exchanges for as wide an audience as possible. The most striking finding was the range of differing responses of religious authority figures to contemporary issues of freedom of expression. These I framed into a typology (of political-theological responses) which forms the structure of my forthcoming book, Religious Authority and the Arts: Conversations in Political Theology. Thus:\nChapter 1\nPolitical-Theological Convergence:\nThe Church of England\n\nChapter 2\nPolitical-Theological Conservatism:\nCatholicism, Orthodox Christianity and Evangelical Protestantism\n\nChapter 3\nPolitical-Theological Crisis:\nJudaism\n\nChapter 4\nPolitical-Theological Conflict:\nIslam\n\nChapter 5\nPolitical-Theological (Re-) Construal (I):\nHinduism\n\nChapter 6\nPolitical-Theological (Re-) Construal (II):\nBuddhism \n\nChapter 7\nPolitical-Theological Condemnation:\nWhat the secular humanists say\n\nChapter 8\nPolitical-Theological Critique:\nWhat the writers say\n\nIn short, then, The topic of freedom of expression, which was the main focus of discussions, remains much in the public eye, and for some significant reasons. The research uncovered however some far deeper faultlines in the contemporary debate. A review of the literature on freedom of expression revealed a prevailing and still unfolding aetiology at the interface of aesthetics, politics and theology. This came later, only as the project developed. The initial and main concern was to provide some comparative understanding of how different religious traditions and not simply the one that seemed to be most often in the news related to these contemporary issues of freedom of expression. \n Here the interviewees brought a diverse series of reflections on historically rooted and conditioned responses, responses in other words conditioned that is by their traditions, their theology, to the contemporary context. It was this contemporary context which provided an acute focus to an issue perennial since antiquity. \n THE most important theoretical findings, which is leading to further work is the intensely contested space at the interface of politics, theology and aesthetics.
