It is estimated that by 2020, over 450,000 Californians will suffer from vision loss or blindness due to the age-related\nmacular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of retinal degeneration diseases in the elderly. AMD is a progressive\nocular disease of the part of the retina, called the macula, which enables people to read, visualize faces, and drive. The disease\ninitially causes distortion in central vision, and eventually leads to legal blindness.\nA layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), provide support, protection, and nutrition to\nthe light sensitive cells of the retina; the photoreceptors which consist of rods and cones . The dysfunction and/or loss of these\nRPE cells play a critical role in the loss of the PR?s and hence the blindness in AMD. Effective treatment could be achieved by\nproper replacement of damaged RPE and retinal cells with healthy ones. More specifically, the regenerated and restored RPE\nlayer would prevent the irreversible loss of the PR?s. However, the lack of a feasible approach to restore the RPE cells has\nprevented the realization of a potential therapy.\nRecent advances in knowledge and technology of human embryonic stem (hES) cells brings new hope for the development of\ncell replacement treatment. hES cells are capable of unlimited self-replication and production of different cell types. RPE cells\nderived from hES cells are a potentially unlimited and robust source for regenerating RPE.\nWe hypothesize that the dysfunction and/or loss of RPE can be overcome by regenerating and restoring the RPE through the\ntransplantation of functionally polarized RPE monolayers derived from hES cells. Such RPE cells derived from hES can then be\ntransplanted into the eye, using minimally invasive surgical procedures saving the PR from dying.\nOur group is composed of unique multidisciplinary members who collectively have more than two decades of experience in\nefforts to restore sight to the blind as well as retinal cell transplantation and stem cell research. Our plan for this grant is to use\nour expertise and infrastructure to show to the FDA the success of our preclinical tests using hES derived RPE cells in order to get\napproval to conduct a clinical trial in patients at risk of vision loss due to AMD.\nLimit Public","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000730","grantId":"G1000730","fundValue":"2065340","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Coffey","coPersons":["David R Hinton","Martin  Pera","Mark  Humayun","Lincoln  Johnson","Dennis  Clegg"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
