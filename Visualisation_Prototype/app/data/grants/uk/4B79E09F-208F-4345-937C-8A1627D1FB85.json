The context of the research focuses on the particular contemporary position of Europe and its armed forces.</p>\n\n<p>While the change in the way that European’s think about their militaries has been changing since the end of the Cold War, more recent issues have put Europe’s militaries in crisis. The first and perhaps most significant for everyday lives is the global financial crisis, which has had a large effect on government budgets and in particular defence budgets. At the same time, militaries face developments in strategic doctrine. We see evidence that European militaries are beginning to innovate towards a ‘network centric’ (or enabled) model by incorporating the US modernisation agenda into their development. On the grander scale, changes in the trans-Atlantic might explain changes in European security forces. Europe and NATO are left in a crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at these factors, we compare eight case studies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Belgium</li>\n\n <li>France</li>\n\n <li>Germany</li>\n\n <li>Great Britain</li>\n\n <li>Italy</li>\n\n <li>Norway</li>\n\n <li>Poland</li>\n\n <li>Spain</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010190/1","grantId":"ES/K010190/1","fundValue":"209885","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Galbreath","coPersons":["Adrian Gordon Hyde-Price"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
