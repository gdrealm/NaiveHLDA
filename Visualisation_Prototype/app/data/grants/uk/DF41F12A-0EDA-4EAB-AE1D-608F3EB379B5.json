It has recently been realised that human pharmaceuticals are present in the environment, particularly the aquatic environment. This is because humans excrete the drugs they take in their urine and faeces, and thus they enter the sewage system. Although sewage treatment plants remove a high proportion of the drugs entering them in wastewater, complete removal is rarely achieved and hence low concentrations of many pharmaceuticals are present in the effluents that are discharged into rivers. To date, chemists have been able to identify well over 100 different pharmaceuticals in rivers, although this is still only a small proportion of the 3000 different pharmaceuticals in widespread use. Hence, all aquatic organisms are exposed to many different pharmaceuticals, albeit at low concentrations. Intuitively it seems unlikely that these low concentrations would adversely affect aquatic wildlife such as fish, yet recent research on one particular pharmaceutical, a constituent of the contraceptive 'Pill', has questioned that assumption. This pharmaceutical contributes to the feminisation of male fish that has been widely reported. This discovery has raised the possibility that other pharmaceuticals may also be affecting fish. But with so many different pharmaceuticals present in rivers, which ones are of concern, and what effects do they induce? This project addresses these key questions by testing the hypothesis 'Human pharmaceuticals cause the same effects in fish as they do in humans, and these effects occur only if the blood concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in fish reach the same concentrations as those required in humans for the pharmaceuticals to have their effects.' Fish will be exposed to four different classes of pharmaceuticals during the project: analgesics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and synthetic glucocorticoids. Plasma levels of the drugs will be measured to establish that therapeutic concentrations - levels that give effects in humans - are reached. Because fish are very similar to humans at the molecular and biochemical levels, it as anticipated that the main, or even only, effect in fish will be the same as that which occurs in people taking these pharmaceuticals. These effects will be measured in the fish, and by additionally using an exposure concentration of 100-fold less than that required to reached therapeutic concentrations, we will establish that the effects are seen only when blood levels of the drugs compare to effective concentrations in humans. If this is the case, it will support our hypothesis and mean that the potential effects of pharmaceuticals on fish can be predicted based on existing knowledge of the drugs. Being able to do so would have two major advantages: it would aid in predicting which pharmaceuticals present in the environment might be of most concern, and it will mean that the likely effects of pharmaceuticals on fish (if any of course), at environmentally relevant concentrations, could be predicted with some degree of confidence. Being able to do so would be a major step forward in understanding whether or not pharmaceuticals in the environment pose any risk to fish.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I00646X/1","grantId":"BB/I00646X/1","fundValue":"327964","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Sumpter","coPersons":["Mariann  Rand-Weaver"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
