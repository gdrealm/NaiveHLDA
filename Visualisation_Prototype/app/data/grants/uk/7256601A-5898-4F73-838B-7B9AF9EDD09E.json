The research fits into a growing interest in crossovers between film and photography in this period and more genera!!y. The relation of neorealist films to still photography has been little explored. Most writing on neorealism in the cinema has dealt with its narrative aspects, including its treatment of time. Ennery Taramelli's book Viaggio nell'ltalia del neorealismo (1995) is an important exception which, among other things, brought to the fore the work of Italian documentary photographers such as Alberto Lattuada, Paolo Donzelli and Enrico Pasquali which showed affinities with neorealism. However, Taramelli did not explore the relations between this work and the neorealist film and her book contains no close analysis of any of the films themselves.\n\n\nThe aims are to investigate closely the relations between photography and cinema, as well as writing about these two media, in Italy from the mid-1930s to mid-1950s, and to examine both the function of 'stilled' images (including long takes and static shots) in narrative films and of narrative uses of the photograph in such genres as photojournalism and the book of photographs with accompanying written text.\n\n\nThe objectives are to demonstrate and disseminate findings about the key role played in the cinema of Italian neorealism by a particular use of the still photograph, the relations between particular films and 'intermediate genres' such as the photo reportage and photo-books, and the connections, both within Italy and internationally, between still photography and cinema in this period. The work of Italian photographers who moved into cinematography and/or directing is an important part of this story. Lattuada directed II bandito in 1946 after making an army documentary the year before; G.R. Aldo (Alda Graziati) shot La terra trema for Visconti and II cielo sulla palude (1949} for Augusto Genina, with a very striking treatment of landscapes and light in both cases. Among the other important cinematographers of the period is Giovanni Ventimiglia, who worked in England and USA between the wars shooting among other things Hitchcock's The Lodger), and who then shot Antonioni's short documentaries NU, Superstizione and Sette canne un vestito.\n\n\nThe main potential applications of the research will be in scholarship and teaching. The published work should provide a better understanding than is currently available of the role of photography in relation to cinema of this period. This will, I hope, have spin-offs in future research by others- for instance on the photographic image in the films of particular directors- as well into the teaching of courses and the organizing of screenings and exhibitions featuring the connections between film and photography. The work is concerned with an international circulation of photographic and filmed images, so findings of the research will be of interest to those who work on image culture in many countries, and not just to specialists in Italian culture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D501318/1","grantId":"AH/D501318/1","fundValue":"24674","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David Anthony Forgacs","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
