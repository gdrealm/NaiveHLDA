First, of course, I publish my work and, now, do so only in Open Source journals. I have been a strong supporter of the Public Library of Science since its inception. I have given many talks to publishers, librarians and others on the need for open access publishing.\n Second I probably give over fifteen talks a year, at scientific meetings, in university departments and at scientitific institutes.\n I also write for the general public on scientific matters, most usually, these days, for Open Democracy (www.opendemocracy.net).\n I run a course on Drosophila genetics every two years at Cold Spring Harbor, and this year am running a 2-week course in Bangalore, India.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500293","grantId":"G0500293","fundValue":"594930","fundStart":"2006-02-06","fundEnd":"2011-02-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Ashburner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
