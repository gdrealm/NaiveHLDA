Any field CCS facility needs to implement monitoring, verification, and accounting activities in order to verify storage permanence. In addition, technologies and associated protocols are needed to quantify potential releases, to study the pathways of these as well as their anticipated impacts. Research has modelled the effects of CO2 leakage and found that leakage rates below 0.5% per year are required to keep CCS economically and environmentally viable.\nThe hereby proposed project is to develop a novel technology called Chirped Laser Dispersion Spectroscopy (CLaDS) to address some challenges of the CCS monitoring problem. It specifically focuses on the near surface atmospheric component of a monitoring system to account for CO2 surface fluxes. This unique and novel technology has the potential to enable large area gas fluxes mapping at unprecedented precision, though the combination of open-path monitoring with tomographic techniques.\nThe project focuses on developing a field prototype that will be deployed for a realistic CO2 flux mapping campaign towards the end of the activity. This demonstration will exhibit the benefit of this new technology and facilitate barrier removal for adoption by CCS industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00626X/1","grantId":"ST/L00626X/1","fundValue":"19536","fundStart":"2014-06-25","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
