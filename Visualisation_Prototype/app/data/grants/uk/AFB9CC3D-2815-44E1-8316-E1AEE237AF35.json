In a city sharing socio-cultural links and a notorious prostitution history with Paris, this social experiment has fascinated artist of many kinds as the culmination of a series of French-inspired spectacles and performances by women. The proposed research examines the legacy of Storyville through transatlantic representation of the District in 19th century cultural, especially literary, production. The broader aim is to illuminate the racial and sexual cultural legacy of women in post-colonial New Orleans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112690/1","grantId":"112690/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
