{"id":"C9641F20-6F71-4E03-AEC0-B8EBFAB26F25","title":"RA to work on MINOS","abstractText":"MINOS is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Neutrinos come in 3 different favours and MINOS can measure how one of these can transform into the two others. MINOS investigates this transitions, which are also called oscillations and measures how muon neutrinos can transform themselves into electron and tau neutrinos. The experiment makes precision measurements of the neutrino properties that govern these transitions. This grant will allow to capitalise of the substantial investment that STFC made in the NuMI/MINOS facility and to continue the exploitation of the experiment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002626/1","grantId":"ST/I002626/1","fundValue":"115410","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The research has been used to inform the future direction in neutrino physics.

The MINOS experiment has measured on how one type of neutrino can transform itself into another. It laid the fundation to properly understand the effect of neutrino oscillation, which in the future could help to explain whay there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe. The research ouputs of the experiment are used to inform the design of future more sensitve experiments. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
