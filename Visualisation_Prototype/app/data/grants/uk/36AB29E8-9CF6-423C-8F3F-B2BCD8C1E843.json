Our demonstration that kinesin can assemble micrometre-scale structures which can be used to manipulate molecular cargoes, under the control of molecular programming instructions, is proof of principle that synthetic self-organized systems can operate across multiple length scales. Practical applications of this revolutionary new technology are still just around the corner, but promising directions include molecular manufacture and molecular electronics, drug discovery, drug delivery and structural biology.

This allows us to alter the number of kinesin heads that are working together, or the length or the elasticity of the link between them, in ways that are not possible when working with the natural protein alone. Our aims are to improve the precision of measurements of single kinesin molecules walking, to study how kinesin's heads are coordinated, and to investigate how many kinesins work together to create larger forces.\n\nWe have measured the properties of synthetic teams of kinesin motor proteins and are using the results to develop a model for how these teams generate force. We have also used controllable kinesin teams to create synthetic molecular transport systems, inspired by biological structures, in which motor proteins can be programmed by molecular signals to create ordered arrays of microtubule tracks (and to destroy them), and to use these arrays to scavenge, concentrate and release cargo molecules. Discoveries made by using novel DNA-kinesin hybrids are likely to be of interest to the academic community working on kinesin and related molecular motors and on their roles within cells. In the longer term, significant discoveries may influence the development of drugs and therapies for use in the treatment of diseases related to motor malfunction and for cancer. Biomimetic systems powered by fast and efficient kinesin motors may form the basis of future self-organized molecular factories and theranostic devices.
