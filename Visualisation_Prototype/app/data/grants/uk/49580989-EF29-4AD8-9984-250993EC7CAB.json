The project will bring together top scholars in a broad range of disciplines (including anthropology, archaeology, cognitive psychology, comparative psychology, developmental psychology, economics, history, neuroscience, and philosophy) to investigate the philosophical consequences of the impact of culture on the mind and the cognitive and evolutionary foundations of culture. The project will centrally involve detailed cross-cultural studies in each of the three central focus areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119413/1","grantId":"119413/1","fundValue":"538141","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Laurence","coPersons":["Rita  Astuti"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" The AHRC Culture and the Mind project brought together over 200 scholars (from over 100 institutions in 17 countries) in a broad range of disciplines (including anthropology, archaeology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, economics, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and zoology/comparative psychology) to study the interaction of culture and the mind. The project focused on three central cognitive domains: (1) artefacts and material culture, (2) norms and moral psychology, and (3) theory of mind and folk epistemology. One component of the project was a series of workshops and conferences. The project's 23 workshops provided an opportunity to exchange ideas across disciplines, develop and refine research projects to be conducted by the project, and analyse the results of that research. Three public conferences provided further opportunities to exchange ideas across disciplines. In addition to these workshops and conferences, the project also conducted a series of 12 sets of experiments cross-culturally in field sites around the world. In total, the project conducted experiments in 19 different traditional societies on every continent (apart from Antarctica). The overwhelming majority of the project's field sites were in rural, small-scale societies, in villages and small towns ranging in size from 150 people to a couple thousand people, with limited access to the influence of Western culture. The experiments explored universals and cultural variation in cognition in the three broad cognitive domains mentioned above. This work is currently being written up for publication in journals. A fuller description of the project's key findings will be available once this work has been published. As originally envisaged, the main research results from the project are contributions to academic research on cognitive universals and cross-cultural cognitive variation. However, the project's results give us a snapshot of shared features of cognition across massive cultural variation, as well as aspects of cross-cultural variation, which has potential to inform our understanding of how humans are in many ways the same in spite of superficial differences and also how cultural variation can lead to real differences in cognition across cultures. This understanding could help us to make more sense of cultural clashes, and potentially help us to find constructive ways to cooperate and build bridges across cultures. While the project only offers a snapshot of a small number of cognitive domains, it offers perhaps the broadest, and most detailed, snapshot to date, comparing a wide range of cultures across a significant number of experimental paradigms, with the same researchers working with the same populations.
