In this project we will try to understand how the many blood cell types are specified from a sibgle stem cell, and how this process is disturbed in leukemias. By using the body?s own molecules to alter the fate of the stem cells we will analyze if leukemia development can be accelerated and delayed by signals normally used to increase the production of white and red blood cells, respectively","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900892","grantId":"G0900892","fundValue":"2754050","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Claus  Nerlov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
