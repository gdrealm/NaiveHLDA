Previous approaches to equitable management of forest ecosystems in the Amazon tended to offer very narrow formalised solutions, lacked structure and coherence, were too insular and lacked broader international perspective and expertise. The proposed project will address these gaps by providing a holistic and inter-disciplinary approach to understanding the links between the causes, mechanisms and the effects of deforestation on poverty at the agricultural frontier in three case study areas in Bolivia and Brazil. The problem of making the benefits of forest ecosystems available equitably to the disadvantaged people is one of the top priority policy issues identified in the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). However, environmental governance in the Amazon tends to lack engagement with forest dependent poor, so that some ecosystem management initiatives restrict poor people's access to resources and reduce their anti-poverty capabilities. The proposed project attempts to rectify this problem by giving the voice to the rural poor in the Amazon frontier, reconnecting them with the regional policy makers and linking them into broader research networks to develop Southern-led solutions to the problems of deforestation and poverty. Through the series of workshops, pilot studies and user-engagement events the proposed project exposes dynamism of deforestation and its effects on poverty in the frontier areas as well as suggests institutional changes necessary for equitable forest ecosystems management in the Amazon. It will attend to three key areas: 1. Understanding concerns over, experiences of and reactions to deforestation by the forest dependent poor The project will give voice to the forest dependent poor to articulate their concerns over forest degradation and deforestation and to incorporate their perspectives on poverty and poverty alleviation into the development of pathways to sustaining ecosystem services. 2. Developing holistic, interdisciplinary approaches to poverty alleviation through sustainable forestry The proposed project will address fragmentation of existing mechanisms governing ecosystem management and tackling poverty of the people affected by deforestation by bringing together forest dependent poor, policy-makers, governing bodies, and research institutions involved in rural development. It will evaluate existing policies reducing environmental vulnerability, address the lack of capacity and explore the potential for more effective inter-agency work to avoid policy conflicts and duplication of development efforts. 3. Developing international knowledge networks to facilitate equitable forest management Through a series of workshops and pilot studies the project will develop southern-led solutions to deforestation and the alleviation of poverty. It will enable knowledge transfer, research networking and cross-agency learning for the actors at local, national and international levels involved in sustainable forest management in the Amazon.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I004467/1","grantId":"NE/I004467/1","fundValue":"48640","fundStart":"2010-08-20","fundEnd":"2011-02-19","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michelle Amy Pinard","coPersons":["Sergei  Shubin","Antonio Antonio Ioris"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" The objectives were to screen African tree species for their responses to drought and light so that predictions could be made for the fate of moist African forests subjected to a drying climate. \n\n\n\nMultivariate analysis of tree species characteristics indicated two contrasting species groups: those with high light demand, rapid growth and low wood density (Pioneers) and shade-tolerant species with slower growth and higher wood density (non-Pioneers). Because the allocation of species to Pioneer or Non-Pioneer groups has been based on subjective field observation, shadehouse experiments were used to grow tree seedlings in moderate light in order to provide an objective quantification of species responses to light.\n\n\n\nField experiments in the Republic of Congo compared the survival of tree species seedlings in irrigated and droughted plots and measured species traits that were relevant to drought tolerance. It was found that, in general, Pioneer species were more sensitive to drought. A subset of Pioneers, however, were less sensitive, notably those with a distribution in Africa biased to drier climates. Evolution has evidently found different routes in response to drought. The complexity of species traits and their relationship to light and drought are complex, making predictions for the fate of African forests difficult.\n\n\n\nAncillary research assembled tree species lists for 459 forest samples across tropical Africa. Analyses included 1175 species which were arranged along a compositional gradient that was closely correlated with mean annual rainfall and the length of the annual dry seasons. The position of each species on the gradient provides a preliminary indication of species ability to tolerate drought. Species that were experimentally more drought-sensitive were biased in distribution to higher rainfall climates. The same data were also used to propose a pan-African classification of forests and a means to identify new samples to their appropriate class. Seven forest types were defined based on species composition, three for East Africa, two for Central Africa and two for West Africa. As part of the overall Biodiversa project, the results will help timber companies and forest authorities in central Africa develop appropriate management plans for their forest resources. The results of the project should find application in the selection of tree species for plantations by avoiding, for example, the use of drought-sensitive species in drier climates. It also indicates that further research is needed to better understand the different natures of species within the two main ecological groups. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
