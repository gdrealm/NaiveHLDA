However, the success of interventions that provide information is often varied.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this research is to improve understanding of the process by which information changes emotional responses. Three studies employ repeated sequences of learning, intervention, and test stages, to examine the influence of verbal information on an emotional response.</p>\n\n<p>Study 1 will establish optimal parameters for the following two studies. Studies 2 and 3 will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural correlates in the brain between working memory, which maintains the information that is given as part of an intervention, and emotional response systems.</p>\n\n<p>Our objectives are to test three hypotheses</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>information can generate emotions, and emotions so generated will resemble ‘natural’ emotions that are acquired through experience </li>\n\n <li>information can enhance and attenuate emotions</li>\n\n <li>emotional responses result from predictions that the brain makes about the impact of an event on a person’s goals.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>An improved understanding of the processes involved in successful interventions and behaviour change will be critical to a number of social objectives, particularly those related to health and well being.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0512","grantId":"RES-061-25-0512","fundValue":"265477","fundStart":"2011-03-07","fundEnd":"2015-08-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah  Talmi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" Developed a principled framework for modelling the interaction between negative and positive experiences. This draws on advanced models in economics and findings in decision neuroscience. \n\nFound that the Event-Related Potential (ERP) called the 'feedback related negativity' appears to respond similarly to positive and negative experiences, and therefore may signal salience rather than emotional valence. \n\nPreliminary findings suggest that reward does not diminish skin conductance responses evoked in anticipation of punishment. Currently the impact is mainly on academic audience. \n\nDecision neuroscientists could benefit from the proposed computational approach as described in my review paper and talks. \n\nThere is a reasonably sized community working on EEG signals of emotional valence. Our findings challenge the dominant theory in the field. I have convened a symposium to discuss this and collaborated with the key figure in the field. New work suggests that discrepancies can be reconciled using novel analytic methods. \n\nMy main objective was to shed light on the neural mechanism underlying emotion regulation. Our current findings are preliminary so cannot be used by the sectors below, but we hope that we will have substantiated them by the end date of the grant.
