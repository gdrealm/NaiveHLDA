Thus, sociologists have argued that the production of cultural value is actually the production of a form of belief. Although popular accounts of how culture gets made tend to focus on brilliant individual creators, research has highlighted over and over again that their work typically emerges from a creative milieu, in which value (or belief in value) comes into existence. This arguably explains why cultural producers - musicians, artists, etc - are among the most committed audiences for cultural products, and why so many of them create work primarily for appreciation by other producers. This highlights the relationship between amateur, professional, and semi-professional cultural production, which is commonly assumed to have been transformed by Web 2.0 technologies that potentially making every internet user into a creator and publisher of digital content.\n\nThis project will make an incisive contribution to our understanding of how culture and its value is produced in the digital age by focusing on a specific art form: music. We will gather evidence from the SoundCloud website, which many musicians use for commenting on one another's work. And we will focus on a specific genre that has a special relationship with that website, i.e. electronic music. We will identify as 'electronic music' all audio files that are identified by their creators with synonyms of or recognised genres of electronic music (to take just a few examples: dubstep, intelligent dance music, electronica, algorave, chiptune, electronic pop, live coding). Although many registered users of SoundCloud do not produce audio content, the website's original core users consisted of musicians - especially electronic musicians - who use it for commenting on one another's work. This project will study relationships between millions of users of that website, building a series of social network graphs to represent their evaluations of audio files uploaded by other users. Social network analysis provides mathematical ways of analysing peer esteem and reflecting the intuition that the opinion of a highly-regarded creator may have special impact: for example, in a social network diagram representing positive evaluations, more highly esteemed producers will occupy more central positions, with the most central positions being occupied by those who are esteemed by other highly esteemed producers. In order to enhance this analysis, we will not only study evaluations implied by 'likes' and 'follows' on the website, but also use computational linguistic analysis to study the kinds of language used in comments and identify whether a given comment is likely to be positive or negative. Moreover, we will observe and interview musicians in the real world in order to understand how they locate value in their relationships with one another, both online and off.\n\nFindings will be disseminated through a range of venues, including a public access event featuring lectures from academics who have carried out related studies and invited performances by musicians who have been studied. We will also write a public report explaining our findings to a general audience (including emerging musicians who may wish to understand the role that websites such as SoundCloud can play in building a career), and we will release the source code to all the applications we create, with full instructions that will enable other researchers (both inside and outside the university system) to adapt those applications to study data from other sources. Our website will include a blog providing progress updates, and knowledge will be further disseminated through professionally-produced audiovisual podcasts and press releases to specialist media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L014602/1","grantId":"AH/L014602/1","fundValue":"38098","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2014-08-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Although it is too early for the project's findings to have made a wider impact, they have been shared with Sound and Music (the national agency for new music), where they have led to the organisation's making a commitment to develop a policy with regard to electronic dance music. Sound and Music is now collaborating with the researchers in putting together a plan for studying this field in order to inform its strategy vis a vis electronic dance music and the development and promotion of new music outside London.

While this challenge to professional music-making has gathered pace, music production software has facilitated the creation of professional-sounding tracks in home studios. At the same time, social networking and new media websites have provided music makers with new spaces in which to negotiate and produce cultural value for their work, taking on tasks that would once have been the sphere of specialists in marketing, publicity and criticism. These phenomena appear to have had a particular impact on electronic music, which is typically made by lone, but highly networked, individuals and is often circulated noncommercially. Notwithstanding these developments, a record deal is still considered the mark of success and a reflection of a music-maker's value, and local, regional, national, and world-regional scenes remain important sites for the production of cultural value in music, with London being an unusually privileged location. For the most part, musicmakers assert their concern for all listeners, but close attention to their activity (and how they describe it) suggests that interactions with peers are especially important for the production of value for their work. There is a complex relationship between the two areas of work referred to as production (a blanket term covering all activities involved in the creation of an audio track) and DJing (combination of audio tracks into a continuous mix): except in online venues, DJing tends to be better remunerated than production, yet production is accorded more cultural value than DJing; DJs play a significant role in the production of cultural value for producers, yet status as a DJ often depends on having cultural value as a producer. Live performance is vital to the production of both cultural and economic value, and there is evidence for exclusion from the production of value in terms of gender, location, and genre, where ethnicity and class may be implicated in the latter two. The massive concentration of value in London is not necessarily a good thing for Britain. To some extent, it mirrors the distribution of arts funding within the UK - even though SoundCloud is (as we have seen) a website dominated by hip hop and electronic dance music: musical genres virtually unsupported by arts funding. The finding that the value of the particular kinds of music commonly distributed through SoundCloud appears to be so unevenly distributed when produced in Britain could be taken as an indication of success for London or as an indication of an urgent need to challenge this by developing musical culture outside London. Alternatively, it could be understood as an index of the prevailing myopia of musicians who work in large, cosmopolitan cities, or of an on-going tendency to dismiss certain forms of music made outside the walls of certain consecrating cities (a problem equally familiar to jazz musicians).\n\nIf this finding is replicated with regard to other art forms, it will have implications for the viability of cultural independence for the 'Celtic' nations currently encompassed within the UK: the Scottish and Welsh capitals are located close together on the periphery of graph; Scotland's second city is located close to the capital of the Republic of Ireland in a slightly less peripheral location on a par with provincial English cities such as Brighton and Leeds; no Northern Irish cities even appear. As we have seen, one of our interviewees described the huge advantages that resulted from her moving from the Republic of Ireland to London; while this was a good thing for her career, the fact that she had to do it in order to get ahead - even when distributing music primarily through the internet - is potentially problematic for Ireland. \n\nThe research as a whole has brought to light a need for further research, both quantitative and qualitative. We have shown that it is fruitful to study acts of valuing as a directed graph, but we have also found (through qualitative research) that much value is produced through interactions taking place away from the online sites. With regard to electronic dance music, the key site for the production of value remains the club or rave, where the key acts of valuing appear to be (a) the DJ's decision to include a track within a live set, and (b) the audience's embodied responses to that decision. To study these - whether qualitatively or quantitatively - will require more intensive and longer-term offline data collection.
