{"id":"A28460BA-93F3-492F-BD1F-0131F46E1303","title":"Empirical Tests of Non-Competitive Behaviour in Markets: Theory and Applications","abstractText":"<p>The functioning of markets and their ability to induce socially efficient outcomes depend on the degree to which their participants recognise the effect that their individual trades exert on the resulting market prices. </p>\n\n<p>The classical argument that says that markets implement socially efficient distributions of resources relies on the premise that all participants ignore their individual impacts on prices. But this assumption is untenable in many markets that are of great economic and social significance, where a small number of participants conduct most of the trade, at least in one side of the market (demand or supply). </p>\n\n<p>The objective of this research project is to develop tests of canonical models of non-competitive behavior in markets. In these tests no functional forms are to be introduced, and only minimal restrictions on the class of fundamentals that are allowed will be imposed. This exercise will be done both at the level of a single market and at the level of a whole set of inter-related markets. These tests will allow an analyst to empirically determine whether the usual theoretical models of market behavior are suitable to be applied in the study of specific market or markets. Immediately, the results will validate the policy recommendations that such models give.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H011838/1","grantId":"ES/H011838/1","fundValue":"66041","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andres Mauricio Carvajal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
