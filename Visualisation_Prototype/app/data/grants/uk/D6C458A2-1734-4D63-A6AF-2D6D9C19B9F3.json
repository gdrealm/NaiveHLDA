Community Champions will quickly and effectively disseminate opportunities for the use of e-Infrastructure that are relevant and essential, overcoming traditional barriers to enable high impact science.\n\nMany UK researchers now benefit from the adoption of e-tools, methods and infrastructures which enable them to access and effectively utilise the growing number of computational and data resources available to them. But there are still many barriers to the adoption of these technologies by the mainstream majority. This remains a significant issue if the investment in e-Infrastructure for UK researchers is to be properly realised.\n\nThe proposed consortium of the National Grid Service (NGS) and the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) has extensive experience of capturing, analysing and addressing the requirements of users, developers and providers of e-Infrastructure and the related software and tools. Importantly, we have experience in running some of the most significant networks of advocates for each of these three categories: the NGS Collaboration Board, OMII-UK and SSI PALS, NGS Campus Champions and UK ETF (Engineering Task Force).\n\nWhat we aim to do is link these groups together by taking the current network of SSI PALs (discipline-based researchers), the NGS Campus Champions (institutionally-focused super-users) and supplement this with additional advocates in key areas of engineering and physical sciences.\n\nOne single multi-disciplinary network provides improvements in support for the researcher but also improvements in support for the shared and collaborative research that underpins high impact science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J000698/1","grantId":"EP/J000698/1","fundValue":"248895","fundStart":"2011-04-18","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Devereux","coPersons":["Pamela  Greenwell","Zhongwei  Guan","Rebecca  Notman","Phillip William Fowler","Nicolas S  Holliman","Robert Michael  Baxter","David  Wallom","Simon James Cox"],"organisation":"STFC - Laboratories","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
