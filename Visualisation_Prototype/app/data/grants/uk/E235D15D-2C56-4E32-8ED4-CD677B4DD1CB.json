It will make an immediate impact on the policy and practitioner debate about anti-politics and the open policy arena for reform measures created by the Coalition government in the UK because it will tied to the prominent and authoritative surveys run by the Hansard Society since 2004 but will provide a more fleshed out understanding of factors behind anti-politics and therefore the appropriateness of various solutions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4441","grantId":"RES-000-22-4441","fundValue":"77048","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings have informed debate about political disenchantment as reflected in media coverage and interst of practitioners Government, Democracy and Justice Policy & public services","person":"Gerry  Stoker","coPersons":["Ruth  Fox","Colin  Hay","Andy  Williamson"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
