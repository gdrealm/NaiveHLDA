{"id":"2BAC5492-85FC-4421-B542-8DB3909DCFBF","title":"Inspired by nature: Exosomes as RNA delivery platforms","abstractText":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly promising method to switch off the activity of virtually any disease-causing gene. It therefore has enormous therapeutic potential. The process of RNAi is carried out by small pieces of RNA (an information carrying molecular similar to DNA), which must be taken up into the cells of the body in which the disease-causing gene is active. Because of the size and nature of these small RNAs (which are much, much larger than typical drugs such as for example paracetamol), this step of cell delivery has proven to be a major challenge and remains the critical obstacle hindering the clinical progress of RNAi. Most recently and very surprisingly, it has been discovered that in the human body a natural transport system exists that is capable of transferring naturally occurring small RNAs between cells. This transport system consists of extremely tiny particles surrounded by a fatty membrane, called exosomes. In this project, we now plan to take a leaf from nature's book and study this natural communication system embodied by exosomes, in order to either utilise it to deliver small pieces of RNA for therapeutic purposes, or to use the knowledge gained from understanding how exosomes work to design exosome-inspired synthetic methods for RNA delivery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M024393/1","grantId":"BB/M024393/1","fundValue":"412223","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew John Wood","coPersons":["Samir  El-Andaloussi"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
