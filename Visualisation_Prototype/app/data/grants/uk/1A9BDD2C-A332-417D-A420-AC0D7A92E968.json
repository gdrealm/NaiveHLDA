{"id":"1A9BDD2C-A332-417D-A420-AC0D7A92E968","title":"Defining novel genetic mechanisms of congenital hyperinsulinism","abstractText":"Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes the pancreas to make too much insulin. High insulin levels cause severe hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose).\nHypoglycaemia is a major cause of brain damage, mental retardation and cerebral palsy during the newborn, infancy and childhood periods. The mechanisms that lead to too much insulin production from the pancreas are only understood in a small number of patients. We have collected a very large number of patients with congenital hyperinsulinism from all over the world. We will do further genetic studies on these patients to try and understand why they have congenital\nhyperinsulinism. Our research will help to understand how the pancreas controls insulin secretion. This information is very important for understanding more common conditions such as diabetes mellitus and will provide new knowledge about the function of the pancreas","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001821","grantId":"G1001821","fundValue":"641554","fundStart":"2011-07-22","fundEnd":"2015-01-21","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Khalid  Hussain","coPersons":["Sian  Ellard"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
