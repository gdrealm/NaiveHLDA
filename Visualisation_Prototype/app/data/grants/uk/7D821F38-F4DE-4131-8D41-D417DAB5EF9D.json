It affects ~300m people worldwide, and in the UK costs the NHS &pound;2.3billion a year with 80% of this expenditure spent on the 20% of patients with the most severe and poorly controlled asthma.\n\nDuring an asthma attack, triggered by irritants such as dust or smoke, the muscle cells that line the walls of the airways, contract so that the airway becomes narrower. This is called bronchoconstriction. The lining of the airways also becomes inflamed and sticky mucus or phlegm is produced. All these reactions cause the airways to become narrower and irritated, leading to the symptoms of asthma such as coughing and wheezing. Over time, repeated episodes of asthma attacks can cause the number of muscle cells and other cells in the airway wall to increase resulting in the airway wall getting thicker (called remodelling) thereby exacerbating asthma symptoms and causing a decline in lung function. Doctors are currently unable to prevent airway remodelling or reverse it once it has occurred. Although symptoms can be managed with regular medication, serious complications can still arise requiring hospitalisation. For a very long time inflammation was thought to be the main cause of remodelling. However, medication called corticosteroids, that keeps inflammation levels down, in many cases appear to have little effect in preventing remodelling. More recently, we and others have found that, instead, bronchoconstriction itself may cause remodelling. Given that bronchoconstriction and inflammation occur together in asthma, we suggest a new theory: while remodelling might be initiated by inflammation, the contraction of the airway during bronchoconstriction, generates forces that trigger cells to produce chemicals that cause the airway wall to become even thicker. The increased numbers of cells respond even more strongly to inflammation so that there is a worsening cycle. \n\nOur aim is to investiate the combined effect of both inflammation and bronchoconstriction (which occur over minutes to hours) on remodelling which occurs over longer periods of time (days to weeks). The problem is very complex because there are both mechanical and biochemical processes involved that probably feedback on each other, as well as many cell types contained in the airway wall that also interact. Much of the research so far has been carried out on these individual aspects but it is incredibly difficult to work out what the combined effect of these interactions are, just by looking at the individual measurements. \n\nThis work will develop a new model that represents both the biochemical and mechanical processes involved, and their complex interactions. This will allow us to run computational simulations for many random asthma episodes to predict whether or not remodelling occurs. To develop this model we will combine cutting-edge physics, mathematics and biological information from experiments on both human and animal tissue, bridging the gaps between the different levels (cells to tissues). This work will require both theoretical and experimental scientists to work as a team to ensure that the experiments that are done are designed in such a way that the theoretical models can be developed with exactly the right kind of data. Once the models are developed, they will need testing to ensure that what the model predicts matches what happens in real airways. So other data from specially designed experiments will also used for model testing. \n\nThis work will thus help us to understand how the processes involved in remodelling interact with each other, and so to understand what might happen if we could disrupt one of the processes. Ultimately, computational tools developed in this way will help scientists really understand the underlying biology and to find new, more effective, therapies to either stop or reverse airway remodelling, preventing further decline in lung functio","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M004643/1","grantId":"MR/M004643/1","fundValue":"636315","fundStart":"2015-01-31","fundEnd":"2019-01-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Bindi  Brook","coPersons":["Charlotte Katherine Billington","Amanda Louise Tatler","Simon Richard Johnson","Reuben  O'Dea"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
