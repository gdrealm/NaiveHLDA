{"id":"EC222F41-0FD5-4F36-9062-9A4BE9571742","title":"Reasoning About Exceptions and Interrupts","abstractText":"Dealing with unexpected events is an important, and increasingly inevitable, aspect of modern computer programming. As a result, most programming languages provide special features for detecting and managing these events, in the form of so-called exception and interrupt handling primitives. Such primitives are a key feature of modern languages, allowing programs to be written that are robust to various kinds of unexpected events, without having to spoil the structure of the program with a proliferation of tests for special cases. Despite their importance, however, the issue of provable correctness for programs involving exceptions and interrupts has received little attention, but is particularly crucial given the difficulty of writing correct programs in this setting. The aim of this project is to build upon the success of a programme of groundwork that we have conducted in this area, and significantly advance the state-of-the art in formal reasoning about exceptions and interrupts in programming languages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E04350X/1","grantId":"EP/E04350X/1","fundValue":"306915","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The ideas from papers [2,3] above are now being integrated into the Glasgow Haskell Compiler by a team at the University of Kansas.

Three of these articles were published to the top international journal in the field (Journal of Functional Programming), and the remaining two in leading international conferences (Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages and the International Conference on Functional Programming.) \n\n\n\n[1] What is the meaning of these constant interruptions?
