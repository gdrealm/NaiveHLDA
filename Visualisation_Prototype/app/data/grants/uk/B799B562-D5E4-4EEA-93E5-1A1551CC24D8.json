During this period ProfessorLast would give a short course on ``Some topics in stochastic geometry'' at Heriot-Watt University under an umbrella of Maxwell Institute, andwould hold an intensive exchange of ideas with the proposedInvestigators and their colleagues as an initial phase of proposedcollaboration. He would also visit other UK Institutions to giveseminar talks and to hold further scientific discussions with colleaguesat those places.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E050751/1","grantId":"EP/E050751/1","fundValue":"7317","fundStart":"2007-02-17","fundEnd":"2007-05-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Prof Last has written two papers (they were published in top journals) , with acknowledgements to the grant.

The the stable allocation theory\nwon the Nobel price in economics in 2012\n(Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth). It is important for teaching students (including students of economics) and for a new textbook &quot;Lectures on the Poisson Process&quot; (by Guenter Last and Mathew Penrose), to be published by OUP.
