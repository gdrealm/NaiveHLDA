{"id":"DC9132E0-DC77-41E0-836E-A4A0ECDFE0A2","title":"EPSRC/VCE Strategic Partnership: Green Radio","abstractText":"There is a need on environmental grounds to reduce the energy requirements of radio access networks. From an operator perspective, reduced energy consumption translates directly to the bottom line - lower Operating Expenditure (OPEX). These are the key drivers of the Green Radio programme. Both wide area public networks (traditionally cellular ) and local area private networks (traditionally wireless LAN ) will be considered, recognizing that the structure of a Green Radio Network may differ from today's radio networks. Thus in essence, the specific objective of the Green Radio programme is to investigate and create innovative methods for the reduction of the total power needed to operate a radio access network and to identify appropriate radio architectures which enable such power reduction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G064105/1","grantId":"EP/G064105/1","fundValue":"337980","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Principles developed in Green Radio on energy saving and capacity enhancement through small cell deployment has become a major solution for 4G networks as well as setting the research agenda for 5G research into heterogeneous and small cell networks.

That the salient energy and capacity metrics in radio access networks are area averaged power, area averaged throughput and their product. Findings can be used to design future radio access networks such as LTE-Advanced (4G). Findings directly support and initiate research into 5G radio access networks.
