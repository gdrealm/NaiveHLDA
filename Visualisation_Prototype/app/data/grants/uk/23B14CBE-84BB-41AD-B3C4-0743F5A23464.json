It has been assumed that all DNA exists primarily as a canonical two stranded double helix, as proposed by Watson and Crick. However, there is mounting evidence to suggest that a four stranded quadruple helix DNA structure, called a quadruplex, may be able to form, and may have a functional significance. This proposal aims to directly explore whether such quadruplex structures exist in cell and to localise where in the ~ 3 Billion bases of DNA, in the human geneome, quadruplexes exist. The outcome(s) will directly address the central hypothesis and may also identify new functional targets for future therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G008337/1","grantId":"BB/G008337/1","fundValue":"316935","fundStart":"2009-05-21","fundEnd":"2012-11-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Appropriately labelled small molecules developed during the course of this award continue to be used for mapping the occurrence of G-quadruplexes in the genome and facilitating the study of the occurrence and function of G-quadruplexes in human cells.

However, nucleic acids can adopt non-canonical structures that have been suggested to regulate biological processes crucial for cellular stability, such as gene regulation and protein expression. A large number of secondary structures named G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been found in the whole genome, suggesting that these structures can be involved in a myriad of biological \nprocesses. The aim of this research was to use small molecule probes to bind with G-quadruplex (G4) structures in cells in order to provide direct evidence that these secondary DNA structures exist within cells, and to map out where in the human genome G4 structures actually form.\n\nA small molecule, pyridostatin (PDS), previously developed within our research group has been shown to tightly bind the G4s with a high degree of selectivity over the canonical double-stranded DNA. This molecule has been functionalized with an affinity tag (biotin) that enabled the isolation of genomic DNA containing G4 forming sequences from cellular extracts. These findings enabled an unbiased genome-wide mapping of G4 forming sequences based on a small molecule-DNA interaction.\n\nMoreover, we showed that PDS triggered DNA-damage response (double strand break formation) as a result of its tight binding to DNA in specific genomic regions; using immunoprecipitation protocols coupled with DNA sequencing and computational analysis we were able to identify the nature and location of sequences associated with these PDS-promoted breaks. This unbiased approach has ultimately led to the discovery of genomic domains that contain clusters of G4 motifs including therapeutically relevant oncogenes such as SRC and MYC. In particular this study underlined the importance of G4 targeting in SRC to reduce cell motility as a potential alternative treatment for metastatic cancers.\n\nBased on the scaffold of PDS, several small molecules were synthesised and a thorough structure-activity relationship study was carried out. These molecules were fully characterised biophysically and their use in cellular experiments provided further evidence of how targeting G4 interferes with cancer hallmarks like uncontrolled proliferation and telomerase activity. These findings recently enabled us to identify a PDS-based small molecule that acts as a selective binder of G4 RNA over G4 DNA. Given the importance of gene regulation to health and disease, these scientific breakthroughs may inspire future therapeutics. Further development of quadruplex ligands to validate G-quadruplexes as a therapeutic target could enable the treatment of cancer via a novel mechanism.
