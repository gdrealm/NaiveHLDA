Large, devastating epidemics of this disease occur in Africa in a sub-Saharan region called the ‘meningitis belt’. A vaccine is being developed against this disease, and will be first used in Burkina Faso in 2009.\n\nPeople who are vaccinated produce antibodies in their blood that protect them from this form of meningitis. We also know that some individuals can develop antibodies naturally if they are exposed to the bacteria during the course of their life. Although we can measure these antibodies we do not know what levels are needed for protection. To study this, we are going to take blood samples from unvaccinated individuals in Burkina Faso and compare the proportion of people in different age groups who have antibodies above a certain threshold with their chances of getting meningitis. \n\nIf we can define this marker of protection, we will help scientists address other important questions, such as how often populations should be vaccinated to maintain protection against the disease. In addition, we will create a collection of blood samples that can be used by other researchers to study other types of meningitis in Africa.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701269","grantId":"G0701269","fundValue":"209720","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline Louise Trotter","coPersons":["Seydou  Yaro","Ray  Borrow","Judith Elisabeth Mueller"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
