Indeed, many important social changes have been achieved through alliances between different social groups. How will a common ingroup identity such as the 'Rainbow Coalition' affect relations between the social groups that lay claim to it? No fewer than four models have been proposed to explain the consequences of a common ingroup identity for intergroup relations. Some show how a common ingroup identity reduces conflict, while others predict exacerbating effects, but each originates from the same question: How does a superordinate identity impact subgroup relations? In contrast, workplace diversity research turns this question around and asks: what does subgroup diversity do for superordinate outcomes? Results are also mixed, showing both positive and negative effects of subgroup diversity. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to resolve these apparent contradictions, first by meta-analysing intergroup relations and workplace diversity research to specify when superordinate identities predict positive relations between social groups. Second, in a series of three experiments we will evaluate effects of three key moderator variables on subgroup-superordinate relations: focal category (subgroup or superordinate), context of subgroup-superordinate relations (eg, competitive versus cooperative), and content (eg, norms). </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1992","grantId":"RES-000-22-1992","fundValue":"77297","fundStart":"2007-06-04","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronni Michelle Greenwood","coPersons":["Russell  Spears"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
