The work will make explicit the complex briefing process and evaluation of exemplar projects, identifying design specific innovation where is exists. The research will make recommendations on the application and scalability of the findings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L504038/1","grantId":"AH/L504038/1","fundValue":"203673","fundStart":"2014-02-28","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  Cooper OBE","coPersons":["Emma Lee  Murphy","Bruce  Tether"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
