{"id":"BF3E1214-C3CD-4BEE-9B5E-0AC6BCB8C842","title":"Commercialisation of Smart Foundation System","abstractText":"The construction industry consumes around 400 million tonnes of materials every year, a quarter of all raw materials used in the economy. It also produces annually three times the amount of waste generated by all UK households combined. The industry produces 90 million tonnes of inert waste every year, and approximately 10% of UK carbon dioxide emissions are associated with the manufacture and transport of construction materials and the construction processes. It is therefore important that the construction industry changes the way it designs and builds to reduce its environmental impact and to enable the UK to meet its carbon dioxide reduction commitments. The main theme of this proposal is to achieve the goal of this initiative from the geotechnical aspects of building construction using the outcome of an EPSRC project Smart Foundations with Distributed Fibre Optics Technology (EP/D040000/1) . The project delivered the following research outcomes: (i) a foundation design tool that optimises the layout and geometries of foundations (both piles and raft), thereby minimising the use of construction materials while achieving similar building performance, (ii) a foundation design tool that considers reuse of existing foundations for new buildings, and (iii) an inexpensive optical fibre strain measurement system to ensure the foundation based on the optimised design is performing as predicted in both short- and long-terms. This follow-on project aims to commercialise the research outcomes by converting the complex algorithms developed on research-based platforms to more user-friendly formats so they can be used directly by the industry. It consists of the following two major efforts: (a) development of middleware that converts raw Optical Fibre Strain (OFS) data to engineering performance data and (ii) coding of the foundation design tool into C++. The expected outcome is an engineering software package that aids the design and optimisation analyses of new and reuse foundations, determines the need and optimum locations of foundation instrumentation, and converts raw OFS data into engineering data for short- and long-term monitoring endeavours.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007423/1","grantId":"EP/H007423/1","fundValue":"88498","fundStart":"2010-02-23","fundEnd":"2011-02-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The commercialization of the foundation design code is currently in progress with financial support from Cementation Skanska and the Cambridge Enterprise (Cambridge University's Technology Transfer Office).

The code allows (i) fast pile group/piled raft analysis, (ii) optimisation of pile configurations, (iii) consideration of superstructure stiffness, and (iv) interaction of existing reuse piles and new piles. It optimises the layout and geometries of foundations (both piles and raft), thereby minimising the use of construction materials while achieving similar building performance. Also an algorithm to covert fibre optics data to actual engineering performance data that is useful to geotechnical engineers was developed. This was incorporated into the innovative fibre optics distributed strain sensing technology that was developed in an earlier EPSRC funded project. The combination of the innovative foundation design software and the fibre optics sensing technology allows users to determine rational locations for pile instrumentation, which enables to gain better understanding of the actual in-situ behaviour of foundations. If the foundation performance were to be monitored during their working lives, it would lead to better design for reuse of foundations. It therefore ensures that the foundation based on the optimised design is performing as predicted in both short- and long-terms. The foundation design code developed in the project can be used by practicing geotechnical engineers who conduct foundation designs. The code will be available from the University's Technology Transfer Office. The fibre optics data analysis algorithm is published in a journal paper and can be adopted by researchers in the field.
