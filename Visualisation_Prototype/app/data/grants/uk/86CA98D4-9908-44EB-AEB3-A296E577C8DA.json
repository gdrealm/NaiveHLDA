{"id":"86CA98D4-9908-44EB-AEB3-A296E577C8DA","title":"Spanish Cinema in Transnational Contexts: Production, Marketing and Distribution","abstractText":"The project abandons the idea that Spanish cinema is an autonomous 'national cinema' and explores instead the dense web of relations it exists in with other cinemas, particularly of the Americas. With this in mind, I want to look at some crucial factors and implications of transnational contacts for contemporary Spanish cinema industry, its professionals and its products in recent years. Its aims are:\n\nTo test the notion of the emergence of new conditions and expectations in Spanish cinema within a globalized context using the above case studies based on production and marketing/distribution trends in Argentina and Spain.\n\nTo make an intervention in Spanish cinema historiography and methodology at the time when the newly elected Socialist government (in office since March 2004) is creating policies that encourage co-productions with Latin American countries using Argentina as a case study.\n\nTo analyze the strategies of filmmakers and production companies and study whether these three case studies act as an example of a shift in the traditional dichotomy of Hollywood vs. national cinemas.\n\nTo examine the role of Spanish and Argentine cultural institutions ICAA (Institute for the Cinema and Audiovisual Arts) and INCAA (National Institute for the Cinema and Audio Visual Arts) in the processes of 'trans nationalising' their cinemas by studying the defensive efforts adopted by these bodies (for instance, through direct financiation of production) and the type of cinema resulting from the application of these strategies.\n\nThe project will interest scholars from areas such as Hispanic Studies, Film Studies and Cultural Studies but it can potentially serve as a case study of an emerging situation in which co-production, film exhibition through festivals and advertising through new technologies is making all cinemas more global in its orientation. My findings will test the notion of Spain traditional position within the European film industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505880/1","grantId":"AH/E505880/1","fundValue":"25255","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2007-01-17","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria-Nuria  Triana-Toribio","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
