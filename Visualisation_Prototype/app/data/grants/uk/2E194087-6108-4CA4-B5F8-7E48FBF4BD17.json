{"id":"2E194087-6108-4CA4-B5F8-7E48FBF4BD17","title":"The Reality of Film: Cinema and Critique of Representation","abstractText":"The project argues for a conception of the reality of film. It advocates an engagement with cinema's capacity to create its own presentations, that is, its ability to create what I call 'filmic realities'. I argue that, rather than offering realistic representations of the world, films in fact produce their own worlds, worlds that are filmically real and not just reflections or representations of a reality located elsewhere. The project uses film theory and the close analysis of specific film to chart some of the ways that filmic realities are produced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113063/1","grantId":"113063/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Rushton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
