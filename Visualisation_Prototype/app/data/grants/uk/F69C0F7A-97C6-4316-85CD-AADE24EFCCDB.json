{"id":"F69C0F7A-97C6-4316-85CD-AADE24EFCCDB","title":"An Ethnographic Study of Industrial Decline and Regeneration in the UK Potteries.","abstractText":"<p>This one year study will examine the impact of the decline of the pottery industry upon the everyday lives of former pottery workers in Stoke-on-Trent, England. It looks at how their strong sense of identity and belonging as 'Potteries people' might have changed since previous research was carried out there over twenty years ago, when pottery manufacture was still a staple industry. Unlike coal-mining and car-making, the demise of the pottery industry, with a substantial female work-force, is remarkably under-researched.</p> \n<p>This anthropological study will use fieldwork and in-depth interviews with former pottery workers to find out how, following its decline, people's very strong sense of identification with the pottery industry affects expectations for the future, including people's responses to attempts to regenerate the area. The research will make an original contribution to an understanding of the impact of globalisation on people's lives.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1945","grantId":"RES-000-22-1945","fundValue":"79517","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Hart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
