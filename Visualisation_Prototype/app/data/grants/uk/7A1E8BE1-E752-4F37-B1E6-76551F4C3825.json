In response to both the academic and the public interest, the 'New Audiences for the Wollaton Antiphonal' project created a permanent virtual display of the Antiphonal. Collaboration with the British Library (BL) and members of the Royal Manuscripts project (Illuminated Manuscripts of the Kings and Queens of England) provided valuable knowledge and experience of developing remote access through new technologies, in particular use of &quot;Turning Pages&quot; software. A &quot;virtual loan&quot; to the BL of aspects of the Antiphonal project enabled the resource to reach a wider audience in the context of the BL project. Overall the project sought to develop a virtual display of the Antiphonal which renders the manuscript accessible to different constituencies of local users (using a kiosk display system) and to a wider academic and non-academic audience using web delivery. The outcomes comprised both resources for long term use (digital and print) and activities to encourage community engagement. The principal ones are: Kiosk-mounted Turning Pages virtual publications of the Wollaton Antiphonal; with music, art history, liturgical explanation, and artefactual information; a &quot;Virtual loan&quot; of the digital book to the British Library, for viewing during the period of the Royal Manuscripts exhibition. Another outcome was the provision of transcriptions of the liturgical music and support for the parish church choir in recording performance for inclusion in the digital delivery and delivered an extended web version of the Turning Pages publication, adding more pages to satisfy access needs of the research community. They also formed a free leaflet/booklet about the Antiphonal, for distribution locally and at appropriate events at the British Library or other venues. They provided web page resources about the Antiphonal, providing description and explanation of its history and significance and a blog about the project and enhanced AHRC web project pages. Finally, workshops were held at Nottingham in collaboration with the BL., on the theme of physical/digital access and the perceived impact of Turning Pages delivery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J500808/1","grantId":"AH/J500808/1","fundValue":"31824","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thorlac  Turville-Petre","coPersons":["Dorothy  Johnston"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
