However, in his/her 2009 report for the AHRC, Reviewer 181303 did note that the monograph is likely to be 'extremely influential among scholars working with, and editing, manuscript sources of music, as well as being of more general value to performers, students and to the informed general reader'. In this respect - that is in terms of the broader implications of the project's findings for the way in which seventeenth-century sources are used in the production of scholarly music editions and the subsequent use of those editions by performers - it is probable that the monograph in particular will have an impact that reaches to the non-academic community in time.

These contextual factors were investigated both by considering the cultures in which manuscript sources were produced and used, and also by assessing the impact that the newly established commercial music-printing profession had on the creative activities of composers. The secondary focus sought to situate musical composition within the broader framework of creative activity in early modern England, a period that saw significant changes in the way in which invention was taught, discussed and understood, particularly within the visual arts, drama and literature.\n\nThe project aimed to move away from previous composer-centred analyses of 'compositional process', first by demonstrating that the act of individual creation by a single composer in Restoration England was part of a culture of creativity that was essentially communal, and secondly by exploring the complex evidence surrounding the concept of originality and the significance placed on individual authorship in the period. By engaging with interdisciplinary studies of creativity, particularly those assessing relationships between text and performance in early modern drama, it sought to illustrate the ways in which musical notation served particular purposes in different practical and creative circumstances; as a result, relationships between practical function, notation, performance, improvisation and musical memory were not constant, but varied according to context. The fundamental contention of the project was that we can develop a fuller understanding of the creative approaches taken by musicians in the period only when we take these social and practical circumstances into account. The results of the research constitute a radical reassessment of the processes of musical creativity in mid-late seventeenth-century England, the role of patrons, institutions and commerce in determining the creative methods used by composers, and how knowledge of the creative techniques used by musicians in the period can inform our understanding of surviving notated sources from the period today. The main evidence for the project's importance to the academic community is again provided by peer-review reports produced for CUP and Boydell, together with the 2009 reports for the AHRC and a number of published reviews now appearing in the press (by Peter Holman in Early Music, doi:10.1093/em/cau071, published in vol. 42/3 (2014), pp. 464-8; by Martin Adams in Early Music doi:10.1093/em/cau109, to be published in vol. 42/4 (2014); and by Bryan White in Music &amp;amp; Letters, to be published in vol. 95/4 (2014)). All these evaluations emphasize the project's originality and predict that its outputs will have a significant impact, the books having been described as 'very important' (Boydell Reviewer 1), 'a significant contribution to knowledge' (AHRC Reviewer 181304) and likely to be 'highly influential' (AHRC Reviewer 181303). Peter Holman's review of the monograph 'Musical Creativity in Restoration England' (Early Music, 42/3 (2014), p. 464, referred to it as 'one of the most important books on 17th-centuy music to appear in recent years'. He also commented positively in this review on two of the other research outcomes, the co-edited book 'Concepts of Creativity in 17th-Century England' and the 'Catalogue of Restoration Music Manuscripts', which he described as 'invaluable' (p. 465).\n\nBased on their comments, it seems likely that the project will be significant in three main areas:\n\nThe project's primary importance is likely to derive from its entirely new approach to understanding musical creativity; in this respect it has broad implications for musicological scholarship, which, according to CUP's Reviewer 1, mean that the book 'will be unique in ways that go well beyond its seventeenth-century subject'. The peer-review comments suggest it has the potential to form as significant a revisionist perspective on musical composition as did Owens's 'Composers at Work' of 1997, particularly in its strong portrayal of the importance of communal creative cultures in the period, which de- emphasizes the role of the individual composer that has been assumed in earlier studies, and in the evidence it presents of techniques differentiated according to the purposes for which music was being created.\n\nSecondly, the project is pioneering in its attempt to place musical composition within the creative cultures of its period, demonstrated within both the monograph and the collection of essays. Whereas in previous research compositional processes have been studied in isolation, here techniques used by musicians are shown to belong within well-established pedagogical and intellectual systems that were not specific to music. Clearly this presents a significant challenge to current assumptions and preconceptions about what composers were seeking to achieve in the period, particularly in studies that persist in applying later creative priorities, such as originality, to early modern music. It also provides a context for understanding aspects of compositional activity that, as CUP's Reviewer 2 commented, 'have been in many cases identified, but never so well explained as a standard practice'. Both CUP readers commented on the likely impact of the monograph's theoretical underpinning, and Reviewer 1 noted specifically that it 'reveals some fascinating links between music and other arts', which are likely to be influential to future work on creativity carried out both by musicologists and by other historians of culture within early modern studies. In addition, Boydell's Reviewer 1 suggests that the essay collection, will 'have far-reaching implications in offering a revisionist view of our understanding of Early Modern ideas of invention', based on the common themes and interactions identified in the book.\n\nFinally, the monograph develops fully a new nomenclature for describing manuscripts according to the purposes for which they were created. The publication of the pilot study for the project has already encouraged movement away from the use of anachronistic terms such as 'rough draft' and 'fair copy' that have been applied uncritically to sources from this period in the past; this article has been regularly cited since its appearance in 2006, was described as 'important' by reviewers for both CUP and the AHRC, and forms the framework for the chapter on sources in the new 'Ashgate Research Companion to Henry Purcell', written by Robert Thompson. The monograph develops these preliminary ideas fully, and thus\ndescribes Restoration manuscript culture more fully than existing scholarship, according to CUP's Reviewer 2. As well as creating a new cultural model for understanding English sources, it will provide a framework for reconsidering manuscript sources in other contexts.
