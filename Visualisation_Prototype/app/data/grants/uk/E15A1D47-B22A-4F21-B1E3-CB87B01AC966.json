It will also provide the basis for exploring of the legacies of the earlier period of mobilisation, and elucidating how the networks and strategies developed by the first generation of exiles and solidarity activists influenced the experiences and activities of subsequent generations.&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H021302/1","grantId":"ES/H021302/1","fundValue":"78788","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"JoAnn  McGregor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
