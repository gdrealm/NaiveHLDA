These two properties make ESCs remarkably powerful research tools, providing an experimental platform for a) modeling embryonic development in the culture dish and b) transmitting complex genetic modifications through the germ line to make transgenic animals. The development of human ESCs, a potentially unlimited source of specialized cells for studying disease processes in culture and testing new drugs, promises to deliver unparalleled opportunities in regenerative medicine. Notwithstanding their exciting potential, ESCs have only been derived from a limited number of animals. However, the recent development of a novel dual chemical inhibitor (2i) medium that blocks ESC differentiation signals makes it possible to extend ESC technology to other important research animals, such as the rat. \nBecause of its size, lifespan, physiology, genetics, reproduction and behaviour the rat is one of the most widely used animals for modeling aspects of human behavior and disease. Recent advances facilitating the introduction of targeted mutations using rat ESCs and gene editing enzymes makes it possible to design bespoke genetically modified rat models of human diseases. ESC technology is particularly suited to engineering complex genetic modifications, but can be compromised by instability in cultures. However, recent studies have shown that the ESC state can be stabilised by &quot;epigenetic&quot; modification (not affecting DNA sequence) of genes,. Interestingly, vitamin C, the micronutrient and common food additive, has recently been shown to regulate enzymes that modify the epigenetic status of genes, and stabilize the acquisition of pluripotency. We propose that instability in rat ESC cultures arises from discordance between the undifferentiated state of rat ESC in 2i medium and a more naive &quot;ground state&quot; condition closer to that in the early embryo. In light of Vitamin C's role as epigenetic regulator, we tested its effects on the potency of rat ESCs.\nWe find that vitamin C increases proliferation of rat ESC, improves their undifferentiated status, and enhances gene targeting. Vitamin C treated cells retain developmental potency as they integrate into host embryos to generate chimaeric animals. Interestingly, the antioxidant D-isoascorbic acid (DiAA), a vitamin C stereoisomer, only stabilises ESC self-renewal, indicating that vitamin C regulates rat ESC by at least two distinct mechanisms. \nIn this project we will ask how vitamin C affects, 1) gene activity and methylation status of rat ESC, 2) the developmental capacity of rat ESC in vivo and 3) genetic modification of rat ESCs? We will compare gene transcription and methylation profiles of control, vitamin C and DiAA-treated cells to identify vitamin C-regulated genes, and use genetic loss or gain-of-function experiments to test their functional contribution. We will examine the developmental potential of vitamin C treated cultures by analysing their engraftment in adult chimaeras and functional contribution to the germ line. Finally, we will systematically compare gene targeting in different classes of genes, to assess the benefits of Vitamin C in genetic engineering.\nThe practical aim of these experiments is to improve rat ESC utility. These studies provide insights into the maintenance of pluripotency, and in particular how epigenetic modifications mediated by a widely used food additive affect developmental capacity of ESCs, including germ line differentiation. Cross-species comparisons using the rat ESC data sets will provide novel insights into the evolution of epigenetics and regulation of pluripotency in other mammals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M023397/1","grantId":"BB/M023397/1","fundValue":"530179","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Grant Burdon","coPersons":["Richard  Meehan","James Gordon Prendergast"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
