One of the problems faced by police forces and UKBA officers is the ability to test objects or containers found on individuals or groups of individuals at the scene of a suspected crime or at points of entry to the UK (airports, ports, etc). This project is to develop a compact sample analyser that could provide detailed analysis of sufficient quality to be used as evidence in court without opening the packaging. The system is based upon a novel approach to a well know analytical procedure - X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction is usually carried out in one of two ways. These are called angular dispersive or energy dispersive and they each have advantages and disadvantages. This project uses a new X-ray sensor developed by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in a mode that allows the two X-ray diffraction approaches to be combined into one. This uses the best of both approaches and gives high quality sample analysis in a matter of seconds without any moving parts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00318X/1","grantId":"ST/L00318X/1","fundValue":"107809","fundStart":"2014-06-09","fundEnd":"2015-06-08","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This project has only started in June so findings are limited.
