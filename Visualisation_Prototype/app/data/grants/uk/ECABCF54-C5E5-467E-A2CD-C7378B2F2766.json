Shifts in the role of different fuels and energy conversion technologies have often underpinned broad social and geographical change, such as those accompanying the transition from wood and water power to coal in the 19th century.</p>\n\n<p>The primary energy challenge in the twentyfirst century is to bring about a new transition, towards a more sustainable energy system characterised by security and affordability of supply and efficient, low-carbon sources.The spatial implications of this new energy paradigm are not well defined, however, and a range of quite different geographical futures are currently in contention.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this seminar series was to catalyse social science research on the spatial implications of the contemporary energy transition by initiating a dialogue between human geographers and energy experts in the academy, policy community and commercial sector.</p>\n\n<p>The five seminars in the series brought together economic, political, cultural and environmental geographers with selected energy experts drawn from energy studies, sociology, environmental history, technology studies, economics and politics.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0692","grantId":"RES-451-26-0692","fundValue":"18531","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Bridge","coPersons":["Stefan  Bouzarovski","Michael Joseph Bradshaw","Nick  Eyre"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
