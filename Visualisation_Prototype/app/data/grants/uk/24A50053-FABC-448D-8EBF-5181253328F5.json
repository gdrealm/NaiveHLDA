Infection is commonly associated with consumption of beef and related products (especially hamburgers), but can also result from consumption of contaminated vegetables or from farm visits. To gain a foothold in the human bowel, E. coli O157 uses a sophisticated molecular syringe (called a type III secretion system) to inject its own proteins into human cells. Deployment of the syringe is in turn controlled by regulation of the genes that encode its components. We are interested in a bacterial protein called Ler that regulates these type III secretion genes. Although interest in the past has focused exclusively on how Ler regulates type III secretion, we have preliminary evidence to suggest that Ler regulates many other facets of the bacterial cell. We now wish to confirm and expand on these findings to gain a global all-round view of Ler's function in gene regulation. We also wish to investigate Ler's interactions with other proteins and test our hypothesis that Ler is involved in a system for sensing when proteins are secreted and changing the expression of genes in response to such secretion. A better understanding of how Ler regulates virulence in E. coli will pave the way for the development and introduction of novel vaccine strains providing new approaches to the prevention and control not only of this fearsome pathogen, but also potentially of other infectious micro-organisms. In this work, we benefit from a (1) world-class team of applicants (all three have published in top journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in the last year), (2) an exceptional research environment with unique access to key technologies and information and (3) input from superb collaborators, who have broad experience of the kind of questions we are trying to address in other settings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E020860/1","grantId":"BB/E020860/1","fundValue":"463950","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark John Pallen","coPersons":["Klaus  Futterer","Steve  Busby"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
