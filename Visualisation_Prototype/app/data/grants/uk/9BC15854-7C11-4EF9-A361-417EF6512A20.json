We will reveal the novel mechanisms how the virus evades the host immune system and steals mRNA cap of host cells, as well as how the virus binds genomic RNA and NP forms oligomers. Knowledge learned from this study of Lassa fever virus will undoubtedly help facilitate future development of effective vaccines and antivirals against deadly hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses (arenaviruses).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100110","grantId":"G1100110","fundValue":"619412","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Changjiang  Dong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
