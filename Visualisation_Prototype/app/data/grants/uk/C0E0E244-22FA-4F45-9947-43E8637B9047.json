In particular, the framework enables the investigators to distinguish between and evaluate the relative importance of two&nbsp;theories -&nbsp;agency theory and overvaluation theory -&nbsp;which analyse takeover motivation and acquirer returns. Both theories generate similar predictions for the role of cash reserves in relation to the announcement effect and the probability of being a acquirer, but they have contrasting implications for the impact of principal-agent relationships for cash-rich acquirers. Importantly, they contain a significant number of contrasting predictions concerning various stages of an acquisition, which will enable the investigators to distinguish between the relative importance of the two theories. This holds especially when firm and deal characteristics are considered.</p>\n\n<p>This project will contribute to our understanding of the wealth implications of corporate cash reserves for shareholders, and potentially inform the decision making of investors, company managers and policy makers.<br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G000646/1","grantId":"ES/G000646/1","fundValue":"194043","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ning  Gao","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
