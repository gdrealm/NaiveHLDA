{"id":"6D7FE186-BB05-481E-8F79-28DDD80FA81C","title":"The development and evaluation of an internet-based smoking cessation intervention (ISCI)","abstractText":"There is a need for effective smoking cessation support that can reach smokers, especially those with economic or other disadvantage, and who do not access face-to-face sessions or telephone support (95% of smokers). There is also a need to develop an improving technology of behaviour change. The internet could meet both those needs. The proposal is to develop an interactive internet-based smoking cessation programme and evaluate its effectiveness, attractiveness and usability in comparison with a simple system that delivers untailored smoking cessation advice. The proposal consists of two phases. The first phase involves using best available evidence and an intensive process of consultation with smokers to design and test a tailored intervention that would be applicable across the UK. The second phase involves a randomised controlled trial comparing this intervention with a simple non-interactive website. The study will assess both effectiveness and the extent to which smokers, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, find it attractive and easy to use. If effective, this intervention could form part of the NHS LifeCheck and NHS Health Trainers Programmes. Key novel features for a study of this kind: 1) Use of Health Trainers to recruit disadvantaged smokers; 2) Biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence; 3) Use of LifeGuide to enable highly cost-effective website development and ultimtely help build a technology of behaviour change","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802035","grantId":"G0802035","fundValue":"452288","fundStart":"2010-01-25","fundEnd":"2013-07-24","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Jeremy West","coPersons":["Gary Brian Wills","Lucy  Yardley","Andy  McEwen","Susan Fiona Michie","Lion  Shahab","John  Stapleton","Benjamin David Gardner"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
