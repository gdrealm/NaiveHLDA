The ability to make carbon-carbon bonds is key to this development. A number of the most used methods to carry out this bond forming reaction rely on the use of expensive, toxic and environmentally damaging transition-metal catalysts. \n\nThis research programme aims to develop iron-based alternatives to the currently used methods and expand upon the scope and applicability of the current transformations. Iron catalysts offer the advantage of being inexpensive, non-toxic and environmentally benign and so are of great interest to the chemical community. Specifically, we will introduce a new carbon-carbon bond forming reaction with a concurrent reduction to produce fully saturated products (alkanes).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I036281/1","grantId":"EP/I036281/1","fundValue":"99841","fundStart":"2012-01-09","fundEnd":"2013-01-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Patrick Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
