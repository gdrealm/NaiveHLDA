This includes the occurrence of floods and droughts, of heat waves and cold spells. To do this, we are going to examine the largest source of year-to-year climate variability on Earth, namely, El Ni&ntilde;o. The El Ni&ntilde;o is a warm ocean current that appears off the coast of NW South America every 3-5 years, and it is a result of a much larger scale phenomenon involving changes to the winds, rainfall, temperature and ocean currents across the whole of the tropical Pacific. The larger scale phenomenon is known as the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, a name which reflects the fact that it involves a natural cycle in the circulation of both the atmosphere and the surface ocean and how they interact. Although we know that ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific, it has near world-wide impacts because of the way it affects the circulation of the atmosphere, and hence the winds and transport of moisture from the tropics to the extra-tropics. Floods and droughts and changed incidence of storminess from El Ni&ntilde;o directly affect the lives and livelihoods of well over a billion people, and major El Ni&ntilde;o events are associated with tens of thousands of human deaths, billions of pounds of damage, and devastation to some natural ecosystems such as coral reefs. Even Europe experiences changed weather patterns associated with ENSO! Although we now understand quite well the basic mechanisms behind the ENSO cycle, some major questions remain. In particular, we do not understand why some El Ni&ntilde;o events are much stronger than others, why some decades show much stronger El Ni&ntilde;o activity, or how ENSO will respond to climate change. To help answer some of these questions, we will reconstruct changes in ENSO over the past 5,000 years by analysing growth rings in the skeletons of old dead ('fossil') corals that lived in the Gal&aacute;pagos. The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands experience extremein weather associated with El Ni&ntilde;o (warmer and wetter during events), and these changes are recorded in the chemistry of the skeletons of corals living in the surrounding ocean. Some of these corals live for up to a hundred years, or longer, laying down layers of skeleton a bit like tree rings. We will collect cores through old dead corals, including some that lived thousands of years ago. Then, by analysing the chemistry of their growth bands we will be able to reconstruct the changes in climate, and ENSO, that the corals experienced during their life time. By combining the records from many such corals we will build up a picture of the natural variability in ENSO, helping us see how often major events occurred, and how much decade-to-decade variability in ENSO occurred. These coral records can let us reconstruct the history of past changes in ENSO, but on their own they do not help us to understand the causes of the changes. Were they due to changes in the sun's radiation? Or due to the cooling effects of major volcanic eruptions? Or were they simply random variations that we should expect without any sort of trigger? To answer these questions, we need to use climate models. The same models that we now use to predict future climate can be used to research changes in ENSO. In our work, we will use the most up-to-date climate models to see if they can correctly replicate the observed changes in ENSO over the past few thousand years as defined by our coral records. We can also see what the effects are of changing volcanic eruptions, solar radiation and greenhouse gases in these models. By comparing the model results with the coral records we will get a better understanding of the nature and causes of changes in ENSO, and the skill of the models at predicting this. In this way we will make a significant contribution to helping predict the likely range of ENSO-related climate events for the coming decades.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H009957/1","grantId":"NE/H009957/1","fundValue":"527211","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This research has not yet had impact beyond academia.

Empirical constraints derived from CMIP5 GCM control simulations lower the apparent significance of changes within the instrumental record, but the near-centennial time-scale changes present between 14/15th C and 20th C coral records remain unlikely to have originated through unforced variability alone.\n \n2) Isotope-enabled model work suggests that interpretation of western Pacific coral _18O records in terms of changes in ENSO variance is generally robust, but with some tendency to underestimate the magnitude of extreme events.\n\n3) Inferring changes in ENSO variability from teleconnected regions requires either very strong calibration relationships, or very long records. \n\n4) Fossil and living corals in Galapagos preserve in the oxygen isotopic composition of their skeletons robust records of past seasonality and ENSO variability. Fossil corals are providing 30-70 year-long windows into climate variability in the region over the past 4,000 years. Our work is revealing the range of natural and forced variability in the strength of ENSO over the past few thousand years. These data may provide new constraints on our understanding of the likelihood of future extreme El Nino events (e.g., over the next few decades). This would be of use to the insurance industry, to governments, to aid agencies, and to natural resource managers.
