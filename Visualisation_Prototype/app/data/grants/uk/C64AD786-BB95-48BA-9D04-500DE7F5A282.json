However, little is known about their use locally, particularly where local issues assume prominence, such as in local authority social services. The relationships between national performance ratings and the ways local authorities manage their own performance are not fully known. This study explored these links through investigating social care services for older people (a costly, relatively unexamined service in this context). National questionnaire surveys gathered information from all local authority social care organisations in England and all health and social services trusts in Northern Ireland. The surveys included information on the range of measures used locally, the organisational context and the manner in which performance is measured. Interviews with managers in selected sites supplemented these data. These findings were compared with data and written material from Japan, where measures at a local level are more generally available. \n\nPerformance measurement practices across the three countries showed distinct differences, reflecting the different ways performance reporting is conceptualised in each. In England practices drew largely on nationally available measures, although local bespoke measures are increasingly available; in Northern Ireland a more local approach was employed; while in Japan a system conceptualised as 'intelligence', gathers data at the individual level. In England, it appears that management practices, principally strategies stressing flexibility and innovation, influence both local performance processes and centralised composite performance ratings, the latter, to a larger extent than external factors, such as resources.
