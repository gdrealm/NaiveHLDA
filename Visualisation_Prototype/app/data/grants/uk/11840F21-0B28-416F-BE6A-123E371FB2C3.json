In some individuals this occurs to such an extent that they suffer considerable pain and are unable to undertake daily activities, let alone exercise to maintain good health. Tendons - the soft connective tissues that connect muscles to bone - are particularly vulnerable to age related changes. It is well known that proteins, such as collagen that forms the main force-resisting component of tendon, are susceptible to modification by sugars in the blood. The addition of sugars to collagen results in cross-links forming between neighbouring collagen molecules. Tendon, ligament and bone are composed of the same type of collagen and therefore it is likely that the same sugar mediated crosslinks will form. Although these cross-links are recognised to have a detrimental effect on collagen properties, they have been notoriously difficult to study. Recent advances in mass spectrometry of proteins, computer modelling studies and nano-scale mechanics have made it possible to study these age-related modifications to proteins in much more detail. In our study we will quantify and locate levels of important sugar-mediated cross-links in tendons from individuals of different ages and link this to how the collagen structures perform mechanically and renew themselves within the tendon tissue. In addition, we will investigate ligament and bone tissue to determine whether a similar pattern and level of age related crosslinking is present suggesting commonality in ageing of different skeletal tissues. Glycation mediated cross-links are likely modified by diet, exercise and pharmacological agents and this may provide an opportune way of intervening to reduce the impact of normal ageing and risk of frailty and poor health. The findings of this study have great potential to improve the quality of life and wellbeing into old age in a large proportion of the population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K007785/1","grantId":"BB/K007785/1","fundValue":"690874","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2016-11-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In the 12 months this project has been active we have presented the work at the European Matrix Biology and British Society of matrix Biology conferences in the form of 5 abstracts and posters.

At the under-graduate level 2 projects are planned for 3rd year intercalating medical students at UCL.

We are particularly focused on the crosslinks that form within and between collagen molecules as a result of a series of chemical reactions following the addition of a sugar molecule. These crosslinks are known as advanced glycation end-product (AGE) crosslinks and involve the free amine group of lysine and arginine residues in the protein structure. We are using a combination of computational techniques and direct measurements to identify and quantify AGE crosslinks, particularly glucosepane and to assess their impact on matrix turnover rates and mechanical function.\nIn the first 12 months of this grant, our computational work has identified 24 positions based on distance criteria where lysine and arginine residues are close enough to form a crosslink between collagen polypeptide chains. A fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation showed that 6 of these sites were energetically favourable (exothermic binding enthalpies) compared to unbound glucose. Some of these favourable positions potentially have significant implications on the biological function of collagen, as they are within sites where key collagen-biomolecule and collagen-cell interactions occur and therefore likely to affect function. We are preparing a manuscript for publication of these data, which is almost ready for submission.\nThe formation of glucosepane is initiated by a reactive dicarbonyl metabolite (in this case glucose) attack on the free amine group of lysine residues. The stable crosslink only occurs however following a long series of re-arrangements and there is some controversy in the literature regarding the reaction pathway. We have used Density Functional Theory to thermodynamically characterize the reaction pathway. Our studies have shown a thermodynamically viable process although many of the transition states reside on a flat potential energy surface and this may explain their very slow formation over years in the body. We are continuing this work by investigating alternative pathways and the possibility that the arginine amine group is the first site of attack.\nIn our experimental work we have synthesized and purified glucosepane in vitro and used a 12 tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to analyse the product. The mass spectrum showed a product with mass of 429.24561 Da and an identical mass was observed in the mass spectrum of the tendon tissue. We are undertaking further work to confirm the structure of glucosepane using advanced fragmentation techniques and mass spectrometry and additionally by using NMR.\nIn further experimental work in collaboration with Professor Peter Clegg at the University of Liverpool, we have used Next Generation Sequencing to characterise the cell response to ageing in human Achilles tendon and to identify molecular signatures and that might contribute to age-related degeneration. This work demonstrated dynamic alterations in RNA with age at numerous genomic levels, indicating changes in the regulation of transcriptional networks. However, the results suggested that ageing is not primarily associated with loss of ability to synthesise matrix proteins and matrix degrading enzymes providing further support for the importance of AGE crosslinking in age related decline in tendon function. A manuscript describing this study has been submitted to Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy journal and is currently in the review process. Our findings to date will be of interest to academics; particularly those modelling protein-to-protein interactions and working to understand irreversible glycation modifications of long-lived proteins and their accumulation during ageing. Although our study focuses on skeletal tissue, specifically tendon, this chemical process is relevant in other tissues and other age related diseases. In addition bioengineers and those working with biomaterials will be interested in our findings as replacement tissues are often collagen based and involve in vitro crosslinking techniques. \nThe medical profession and other allied healthcare professionals will be able to use our findings to inform treatments of tendinopathies, particularly in older individuals. The findings will also be of interest to those in the medical profession involved in the management of diabetes.
