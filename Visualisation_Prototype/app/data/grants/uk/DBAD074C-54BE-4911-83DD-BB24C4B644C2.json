In addition, its concentration has been shown to change 5 to 10-fold in response to several stimuli showing it acts as a true second messenger. cGMP has a role in phytochrome signalling, alpha-amylase production, defense responses and many other mechanisms. Furthermore, the participation of cGMP in the modulation of ionic fluxes has been reported in several studies: Exposure of protoplasts to membrane permeable cGMP led to a rapid influx of Ca2+; during stomatal functioning cGMP directly affects K+ fluxes that generate turgor changes; cation conducting cyclic nucleotide gated channels are activated by cyclic nucleotides; non-selective ion channels in Arabidopsis root plasma membranes are inhibited by cGMP. At the tissue level, net Na+ uptake and Na+ accumulation, Na+ efflux and K+ uptake are all affected by cGMP. In addition, we recently showed that cGMP modulates transcription of many genes particularly those involved in cation transport. This proposal is therefore aimed at building on these observations and to study (i) which specific transporters are involved in cGMP modulated Na+ and K+ fluxes and (ii) what the basic principles are of plant cGMP based signalling. Ultimately such knowledge may help in understanding important aspects of plant mineral nutrition such as K+ uptake and homeostasis, and plant tolerance to salinity stress","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000010/1","grantId":"BB/E000010/1","fundValue":"307818","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frans  Maathuis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
