For example, whilst we know a lot about the function and response of stem cells in the laboratory, we know very little about their behaviour in tissues within individuals. A further major barrier has been the inability to accurately track cell lineages and to distinguish them from other cell types within the tissue (i.e. when one cell divides to become two cells are they the same or different? Is this effect the same or different each time the cell divides? Where do they go?). This application will address these issues by bringing together researchers across different scientific disciplines in the physical and life sciences to develop novel technologies for stem cell science. Specifically, we will develop new ways of non-destructively labelling stem cells by manipulating molecules within the cells so we can follow both their position and their eventual fate (i.e. what do these stem cells turn into?). In order to image the cells we will develop new microscopic techniques that allow us to view these cells in a non-invasive, non-harmful way (unlike current approaches) and we will utilise technologies that will eventually enable us to image these cells deep within patient tissues. Being able to follow these stem cells will allow us to examine the mechanical influence of their surrounding tissue environments. Armed with such knowledge we will mechanically manipulate the surrounding environment to direct stem cells into our tissue of choice in order to deliver custom designed tissues on demand (either within the laboratory or eventually within a patient). Overall, our ultimate aim is to develop new tools to allow us to investigate and control stem cell biology in order to realise the true clinical potential of these cells.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H045848/1","grantId":"EP/H045848/1","fundValue":"1545310","fundStart":"2010-09-15","fundEnd":"2014-03-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Further grant applications to develop some aspects of the technology (CARS assessment and PET imaging)  ","person":"Phil  Stephens","coPersons":["Rachel Jane Errington","Susan MacLean  Hunter","Karl  Hawkins","Stephen James Paisey","Phylip Rhodri Williams","C  Wright","Paola  Borri","Eric Michael  Tippmann","Alastair James  Sloan","Wolfgang  Langbein"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" - A way of visualising stem cells and differentiated cells using a non-destructive, non-labelled based imaging technology\n- Novel ways of labelling cells for imaging deep within the body\n- Methods for automated tracking/tracing of cells and their progeny\n-A live-cell rheometer set up for investigating how cells influence their environment We are currently refining methodologies and equipment that others could use in their investigations.
