{"id":"32C9D8DC-EFA0-43E9-9CFB-35B9F054D0AC","title":"A Dissenting Society: heresy, orthodoxy and rebellion in thirteenth-century Quercy","abstractText":"My research examines patterns of political and religious dissidence, the latter expressed through the 'Cathar' and 'Waldensian' heresies, in the southern French county of Quercy during the Albigensian Crusade (1209-29) and rebellion against its northern French victors into the 1240s. Documents relating to political alliances and religious networks, as well as statements made to Catholic inquisitors, reveal partisan involvement by urban and rural communities, their lords, and even their clergy, demonstrating that although regional patters of adherence emerge, Quercy's social circles were neither inherently 'Catholic' nor 'heretical'. Ironically, it was military occupation by Catholic armies that led to the confessional revolt.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112957/1","grantId":"112957/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-30","fundEnd":"2006-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
