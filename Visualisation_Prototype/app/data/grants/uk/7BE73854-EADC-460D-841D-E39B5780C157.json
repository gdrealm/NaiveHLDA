{"id":"7BE73854-EADC-460D-841D-E39B5780C157","title":"British Participation in the International Social Survey Programme, 2013-2015","abstractText":"<p>This project provides funding to maintain Britainâ€™s participation in the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 2013 to 2015. The ISSP is one of the most important attempts at undertaking cross-national survey research that currently exist. Originally started in 1985 by research teams from Australia, Great Britain, the United States and the then West Germany, its membership now extends to 45 teams from countries that between them cover all five of the inhabited continents. Its aim is to facilitate in depth study of cross-national variation in attitudes towards subjects of global importance and interest. The British data is collected as part of the British Social Attitudes survey, carried out by NatCen Social Research.<br /><br />The aim of ISSP is not simply to visit one topic and then move on to another. Rather it is that topics should be revisited on a regular basis. This means that the programme not only provides a means of examining cross-national differences at one point in time but also cross-national differences in trends over time. Over the next three years ISSP will address three topics. In 2013, it will field a module of questions about national identify, following on from earlier work in 1995 and 2003. In 2014 it covers citizenship, following on from work in 2004. And in 2015 it will revisit role of government, building on earlier work in 19858, 1990, 1995 and 2006.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002795/1","grantId":"ES/L002795/1","fundValue":"159848","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"RACHEL MARY ORMSTONAlison  Park","coPersons":["Eleanor  Taylor"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
