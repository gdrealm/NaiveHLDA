Fair treatment - in wage policies, working-time arrangements, equality and diversity practices, consultation, and so forth - impact on the quality of work and workplace relationships and on productivity and economic performance. Fair employment conditions are important for building an inclusive, vibrant and sustainable society rather than one which is fractured and divided by pronounced inequalities, distrust and resentment.<br /><br />This series of six seminars created a forum for researchers and research users to discuss research and debate ideas about fairness in relation to current developments in employment and working conditions.The series covered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the concept of ‘fairness’ in the employment contract and working conditions</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equality, diversity and intersectionality - from ideas to implementation</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fairness during fiscal austerity</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health, safety and dignified working conditions</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair Pay</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair consultation and ‘voice’</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The series stimulated dialogue and deepened networks beyond the immediacy of the seminar meetings. Examples include the ‘Fairness at Work’ research group’s involvement in co-organising the International Labour Organisation’s ‘Decent Work’ Conference (Geneva, July 2011) and the ‘Fairness at Work’ conference (University of Manchester, September, 2012) http://research.mbs.ac.uk/fairness-at-work</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H002502/1","grantId":"ES/H002502/1","fundValue":"18336","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Colette  Fagan","coPersons":["Jill  Rubery","Annette  Cox","Miguel  Martinez Lucio","Helge  Hoel","Jacqueline  O'Reilly"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
