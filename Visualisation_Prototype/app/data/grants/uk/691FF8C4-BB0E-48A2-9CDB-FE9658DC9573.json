{"id":"691FF8C4-BB0E-48A2-9CDB-FE9658DC9573","title":"SOLplus - Improved Energy Efficiency of Solar PV Systems via Low Surface Energy Coatings","abstractText":"Recent reports indicate that a significant impact of accumulation of dust and other debris on the surface of photovoltaic modules causes a decrease in the incoming solar irradiance, with typical power losses of 10-15%, or even up to 50% in some cases reported. Durable highly repellent coatings based on advanced, nanostructured, low energy materials can provide a permanent solution to prevent the accumulation of dirt on the transparent top layer of a PV system. The primary objective of the SOLplus project is to determine the technological, commercial, and economic viability of such a low surface energy coating for use in the solar PV market. The main technology and commercial objectives for this product will be to deliver a durable coating that prevents the accumulation of dirt/dust on glass and plastic solar substrates, is cost-effective in its application method, and demonstrates real and tangible benefits to the end user (maintenance-free and avoidance of expensive cleaning procedures). Technology validation for the solar PV market and a refinement of our assessment of the market opportunity during the project will allow for a better focus on the market needs","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N510014/1","grantId":"EP/N510014/1","fundValue":"74731","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Mike Walls","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
