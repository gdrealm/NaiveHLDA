This project investigates efforts by leading republicans to understanding why many American rejected their party's programmes and philosophy. Further, it analyses their activities to boost Republican fortunes. In so doing, it traces the evolution of modern American conservationism, particularly its responses to doctrines of government interventionism and welfarism and its exploitation of new cultural and racial issues that emerged during this period. The project assesse the hypothesis, that principle rather than pragmatism accounts for much of this activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111931/1","grantId":"111931/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-19","fundEnd":"2006-05-18","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Mason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
