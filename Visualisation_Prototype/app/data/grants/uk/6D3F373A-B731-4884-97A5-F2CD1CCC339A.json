It will also refer to the particular historical development of Palestinians in Lebanon, the international environment and the presence of Islam as a source of personal comfort and promoter of political activism. Understanding how Palestinian women have coped with the trauma of forced dispossession can provide insights into the Palestinian diaspora as a whole and its prospects for survival, as well as the experiences of other diaspora communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119489/1","grantId":"119489/1","fundValue":"9945","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Christine Holt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
