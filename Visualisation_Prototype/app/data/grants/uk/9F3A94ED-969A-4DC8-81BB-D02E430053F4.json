{"id":"9F3A94ED-969A-4DC8-81BB-D02E430053F4","title":"Regino of Prum and his Chronicon","abstractText":"The kings of the Carolingian dynasty ruled the Frankish people and monopolised royal power in continental Western Europe from the middle of the eighth century until the end of the ninth. As well as using force to construct an empire of approximately one million square kilometers, they sponsored a spectacular revival in learning, one conspicuous result of which was a great flowering of history-writing. This research project takes as its subject the last great work of Carolingian history: the Chronicon, completed in 908 at Trier by Regina, exiled abbot of Prum in the Ardennes. This is a work of exceptional interest for an historian of the period. It contains unique and detailed information touching on aspects of ninth century warfare, Viking activity and politics (both dynastic and ecclesiastical). Regina is also an important early witness to the development of the kingdom of Lotharingia, a newly-created realm which stretched south from the Low Countries to Burgundy. Moreover, he was fully Involved in the events he described: his work contains a long but cryptic account of his expulsion from Prum in the course of a Lotharingian aristocratic feud in the 890s, and copies of his work were intended for the attention of important figures in the court circle of King Louis the Child (900 911).\n\nYet precisely these latter aspects of the text have led to its relative neglect by historians. Because Lotharingia has no modem successor state. Regina was not adopted by the national historical traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and because the decades around 900 in which he lived are conventionally written off as chaotic and confusing, it has been assumed that what he has to tell us is of little interest. Consequently, although historians plunder information and anecdotes from the text, only a handful of scholarly articles deal directly with the Chronicon, a meager haul compared with the many studies expended on each of the other major Carolingian histories.\n\nHowever, the assumptions that led to this neglect have been forcefully challenged in recent years. New approaches to the study of early medieval historical writing have been developed; and historians have begun to re-evaluate the contemporary political scene. The time is thus ripe for a renewed consideration of the Chronicon.\n\nMy project has two main strands, which will culminate in the publication of a book by Manchester University Press and a scholarly article. The centerpiece will be the first English translation of the Chronicon along with a collection of supporting texts, including the mid tenth century continuation by Adalbert of Magdeburg and excerpts from Regina's other works (a manual of canon law and a treatise on music) which cast sidelights on aspects of his career. This translation will be useful in teaching the numerous university courses which cover this period, and may also be of interest to general readers. \nThe other strand is the furthering of a series of research questions on Regina and his work, and the identification of further avenues of study. Among the issues to be considered are the interaction between Regina, his work and the contemporary political situation; his use and manipulation of written and oral sources; the text's place in the context of Carolingian historical writing; the role of the Chronicon in the development of a Lotharingian identity; and the ways in which the work was received and repackaged by subsequent generations. The results of this research will be made available through a 20,000 word introduction, a detailed footnoted commentary, and a separate scholarly article on Regina and the contemporary political situation in Lotharingia.\n\nThe overall intention is to widen access to, and develop new research perspectives on, this final great work of Carolingian history.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504353/1","grantId":"AH/E504353/1","fundValue":"20465","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-04","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  MacLean","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
