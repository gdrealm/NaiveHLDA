Hairdressers use a lot of energy, water and chemicals, but preliminary research (Baden, 2010) indicated that, despite the increased concerns and public pronouncements on the importance of sustainability, little awareness has filtered into the hairdressing sector. This lack of attention to environmental issues by hairdressers then constitutes a social norm that is antagonistic to sustainability awareness, especially hair-washing, drying and colouring, which are activities that are also carried out at home. Thus the study aims to engage hairdressers, both in developing their own sustainability practices, and as ‘catalytic individuals’ to diffuse practices and ideas relating to responsible chemical, energy and water use across their social networks.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010375/1","grantId":"ES/J010375/1","fundValue":"78773","fundStart":"2012-03-21","fundEnd":"2013-09-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Denise  Baden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
