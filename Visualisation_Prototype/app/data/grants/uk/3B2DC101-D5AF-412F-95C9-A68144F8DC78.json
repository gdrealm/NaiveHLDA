{"id":"3B2DC101-D5AF-412F-95C9-A68144F8DC78","title":"The changing nature of religious rights in international law","abstractText":"The law of International human rights is formulated in response to particular problems, which change over time. This gives rise to new questions about the interpretation and application of existing rules. The shift has been particularly apparent in the case of religious rights. The potential for religion to be a source of violence, the significance of religious associational activity, and pressures on the state to be 'neutral' increasingly dominate legal agendas. This project seeks to gain a better understanding of contemporary international legal responses to questions of religious rights and to inform the response of international organisations working in the field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119352/1","grantId":"119352/1","fundValue":"83250","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm David Evans","coPersons":["Julian  Rivers"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
