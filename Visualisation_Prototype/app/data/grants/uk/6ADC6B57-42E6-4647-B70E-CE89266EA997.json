However, in many cases the biological pathways through which these genes exert their negative effects are unknown. The aim of this proposal is to better characterize the biological systems that genetically predispose some people to future disease. 101 genetic markers associated with common diseases will be genotyped in 10,000 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and their Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a very large study containing detailed information on hundreds of biological variables relevant to future health, including measures of genetic functioning in 1000 of these children. The planned research revolves around investigating the genetic markers (i.e. which are associated with disease), and their relationship to the biological variables and measures of genetic functioning contained within ALSPAC. In order to integrate the many different data types and make maximum use of the information, a combination of existing and new statistical methodology will be employed. In the event that an interesting biological effect is identified, the experiment will be repeated in two other large studies that contain similar information- the RAINE study in Australia, and the Pelotas study in Brazil. This will give an indication of whether the finding is genuine or whether it was simply due to chance. It is expected that this sort of approach will increase our understanding of the causal pathways involved in disease etiology, and enhance our ability to detect disease-genes above and beyond what could be achieved through standard methods alone.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800582","grantId":"G0800582","fundValue":"304766","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
