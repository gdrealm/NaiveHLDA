Achieving high spatial resolution in an ordinary confocal microscope requires closing a pinhole in front of the detector to a very small size, which inevitably leads to substantial loss of light. In contrast, the proposed detection technique can achieve even better resolution with a light throughput performance typical for relatively open pinholes. Also the out-of-focus suppression will be enhanced. This idea promises a substantial improvement over existing technology, but has so far not practically been realized. The optical scheme, to employ is based on the use of an image-inversion interferometer, which is very different in spirit from previous attempts using aperture modifying filters.The project will build a prototype to demonstrate and evaluate these concepts and also an extension, which will allow high resolution imaging in a projection mode (extended focus imaging).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F069731/1","grantId":"EP/F069731/1","fundValue":"410970","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2012-09-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rainer  Heintzmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
