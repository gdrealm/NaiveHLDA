To focus this network we have selected decorative textiles with figurative imagery as a case study because these objects raise particular questions about the dynamics of perception: narrative (reading), visual (form and colour) and material (texture). Decorative textiles were the most ubiquitous form of domestic furnishing in early modern England but few survive and the extant objects present significant challenges for interpretation, conservation, display and presentation (for example, they are particularly vulnerable to damage and surface deterioration caused by light and touch). \\n\\nAs well as accommodating the practical needs of everyday life, domestic interiors of any size during the period 1500-1700 were decorated and furnished to express a range of concerns including wealth, identity, belief, education, gender, taste and fashion. Yet scholarship and museum practice has focused overwhelmingly on describing the form, techniques and appearance of domestic buildings and furnishings without probing the culturally-specific and multi-sensory forms of perception that informed interpretation and experience of this environment. It is therefore necessary to establish a dedicated research network to investigate ways of studying how contemporaries would have perceived and engaged with their material surroundings.\\n\\nThis subject requires sustained multi-disciplinary investigation because of the extent of its implications for academic research, museums practice and public impact. Understanding the domestic context for everyday life is not only an emergent area of academic attention and debate, it is also a central interest of visitors to museums and historic properties who want to gain a meaningful experience of period interiors based on current understanding of their physical and conceptual authenticity. Through a series of workshops, a conference, special issue of a leading academic journal and series of podcasts, this network aims to facilitate innovative and collaborative cross-disciplinary approaches to researching the history of the domestic interior and inform new directions for display and presentation.\\n\\nThe network crosses the boundaries between Humanities and Science disciplines to exchange knowledge about historical artefacts and environments and explore the possible applications of new expertise, technologies and methods in psychology, neuroscience, computing and digital archaeology, which enable investigation of the specificity of visual perception in relation to particular objects and settings (for example, new developments in mobile eye-tracking) and through the digital reconstruction and simulation of historic environments. \\n\\nThe network comprises 17 experts including researchers on domestic interiors and/or textiles in the disciplines of English, History, Art history and Archaeology; researchers on visual perception in the cognitive sciences; computer scientists; conservators, curators and heritage professionals who are also researchers in this area. We will also engage postgraduate students starting work in this field in workshop activities and in progressing the impact aims. The network facilitates exchange across 14 institutions including 6 universities and 7 national and regional museums.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I026510/1","grantId":"AH/I026510/1","fundValue":"23897","fundStart":"2012-03-07","fundEnd":"2014-03-06","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The network included humanities and science researchers from six UK universities working in conjunction with conservators, museum curators and heritage professionals. This dialogue has directly benefitted non-HEI researchers, cultural institutions and the wider public by informing new directions for display and presentation in historic houses. It has helped curators of historic properties to interpret the spaces and objects in their care, to understand early modern methods of engaging with domestic interiors, and to explore new ways of presenting them to the public. Particular examples of the influence of network discussions on display practice include Bayleaf House at the Weald and Downland Museum and the discussions around Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Working together, we have undertaken research that has demonstrated how textiles worked within early modern domestic interiors - what their visual impact was and how their original viewers might have responded to them - and brought us closer to understanding how household spaces functioned in Shakespearean England. The findings are already influencing heritage practice by shaping the way those who manage historic properties approach their display, and there is scope for this aspect of the project's impact to expand. In addition, there is scope for our findings about the experience of household life in the time of Shakespeare to be used in all levels of education from school to university, and for creative responses to be made to these findings which allow further exploration of domestic life.
