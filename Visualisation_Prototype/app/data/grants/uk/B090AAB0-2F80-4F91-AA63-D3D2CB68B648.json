It is widely believed that changes to the properties of synapses occur when neurons are working in harmony, and that this is the basic mechanism responsible for our ability to learn and memorize information. It is therefore likely that any disruption to the ability of synapse to change will have devastating effects on memory and learning, such as occurs in diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s. The effects of this synaptic plasticity on information flow in neuronal networks have previously been studied using two parallel approaches. First, experiments on synaptic transmission have revealed much information about the detailed mechanisms responsible for changes in synaptic properties. Second, theoretical work, using mathematical tools and computer models of neurons, has explored how changes at synaptic connections can be used to implement learning in artificial neuronal networks. In this project we are undertaking an integrated experimental and theoretical approach that will bridge the gap between these two research paths. We will quantify the strength of synaptic inputs to single neurons in the cerebral cortex of rodents triggered by sensory stimulation, and induce plasticity at these synapses by manipulating the timing of the neuronal output. We will then measure how this plasticity affects the message conveyed by the synaptic input by using mathematical tools and computer models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500244","grantId":"G0500244","fundValue":"336651","fundStart":"2005-08-23","fundEnd":"2008-08-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Hausser","coPersons":["Michael  London"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
