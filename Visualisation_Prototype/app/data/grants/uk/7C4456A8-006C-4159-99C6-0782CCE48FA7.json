Perhaps the most variable of all central nervous system structures is the cerebellum, a centre of unconscious movement control in mammals, which shows an enormous range of scale and form. A paradox that intrigued early neuroanatomists is that the internal organisation of the cerebellum, in terms of the different types of neurons and their connections, is more-or-less constant. At its core, the synapse between the granule cell (which channels the majority of inputs to the cerebellum) and the Purkinje cell (its output) is invariable. This puzzle has remained unresolved since the study of the comparative neuroanatomy of the cerebellum entered a decline in the 1970's. However, new molecular approaches to the analysis of gene function during development in a variety of model organisms have led to a radical revision and dramatic simplification of the general model for the development of this region. We wish to test the hypothesis that variability between vertebrate cerebellums is caused by subtle changes in the organisation of cell division within one highly defined strip of cells in the developing brain, the rhombic lip. The cells that the rhombic lip produces are responsible for channeling both inputs to the cerebellum and the output of its Purkinje cells. However, most significantly, the rhombic lip produces one of the most unusual populations of cells in the brain, a migratory, dividing cell which will generate a single product, the cerebellar granule neuron. This highly motile precursor population, which collectively organises itself into a temporary layer of rapidly proliferating cells on the surface of the cerebellum, is the brain's foremost example of 'transit amplification', the process by which the products of stem cells become multiplied into vast numbers. Understanding the origins of transit amplification will help us to understand how stem cells contribute to normal development. Granule cell precursors are also the prime suspects in causing medulloblastoma, the major childhood brain cancer and the molecules that contribute to their uniqueness may help to understand this disease. In the broadest sense, this research will also help to illuminate the function of the cerebellum whose beguilingly simple cellular structure masks its participation in a vast range of neural processes from simple eye movement control to learning and complex cognition. Various conditions such as dyslexia and autism, which are interpreted as defects of relatively complex neural behaviour, have neuroanatomical deficits associated with the cerebellum - an organ characterised as principally mediating subconscious motor reflexes. In this proposal, the survey of the genes and processes at the rhombic lip in the spotted dogfish, the Mississippi paddlefish, zebrafish, frog, and chick will shed vital insights into how cerebellar function and development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F020570/1","grantId":"BB/F020570/1","fundValue":"357756","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Since their publication our findings have been cited in 32 papers and have generated significant interest in review articles.\nChaplin et al.

This theory has been confirmed and our substantial discovery is that the ability of migratory granule cell precursors to proliferate is an adaptation that accompanied land colonisation. This adaptation is of enormous significance in understanding the ontology of developmental mechanisms and disease. Our insights offer a fantastic opportunity to pin down the precise gene regulatory network that determines granule cell behaviour - a key goal for understanding medulloblastoma (the most significant childhood brain cancer) - and the broader evolutionary mechanisms underlying the emergence of the cortex in mammals.
