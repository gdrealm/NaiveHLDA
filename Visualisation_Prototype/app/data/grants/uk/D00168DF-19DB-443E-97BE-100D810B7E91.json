Exploring the working lives of young women in the classical music profession","abstractText":"<p>Work in the cultural industries is frequently described as work that you can’t help doing. However, research has shown that such work is often precarious and that the cultural sector is marked by increasing inequalities.</p>\n\n<p>This project aims to add to our understanding of cultural work by conducting qualitative research on young, female classical musicians in Berlin and London. In doing so, the study addresses gaps in existing research that relate to the working lives of classical musicians, and the ways in which cultural work is affected by gender and its urban context.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the research draws on an innovative theoretical framework that links cultural work to the category ‘young woman’ through the notion of entrepreneurialism. Recent research has demonstrated that entrepreneurialism, as an ethos to work on and improve the self, is prevalent amongst cultural workers and young women. By focusing on early-career female musicians, the project will explore the experiences of individuals who may be the quintessence of entrepreneurialism, thereby illuminating how entrepreneurialism is registered and lived out.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K008765/1","grantId":"ES/K008765/1","fundValue":"102300","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina Marie Scharff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
