Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an extremely versatile advanced new imaging technique in Medicine. This method can, in principle, provide highly accurate information on the structure and pump function of the heart, on whether the heart muscle is well supplied with nutrients and oxygen, and on whether portions of it that have stopped functioning (pumping) are still alive (stunned) or dead (scar). However, current CMR systems, which work at a magnetic field strength of 1.5T, are limited in the amount of information they can provide. We have obtained one of the first CMR systems, which uses a much higher field strength, 3T, and propose to develop new CMR methods that would be of major help to examine patients with heart disease. These methods should provide the information needed by Cardiologists to manage their patients with optimum clinical outcomes, and free from risk to the patient. Such new imaging techniques would not only substantially improve the care of patients with heart disease, but would also be used in clinical research, to yield new insight into how heart disease develops and how it should best be treated. Our work should therefore contribute substantially to improving cardiovascular health and to relieving the burden of cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in the U.K.\n\nWe have established a web site (www.cardiov.ox.ac.uk/ocmr/ocmr.htm) to promote the activities of our group and to disseminate our findings. If the application is successful, the lay summary will be placed on the website, which will be updated as the milestones are reached.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400444","grantId":"G0400444","fundValue":"404837","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Neubauer","coPersons":["Matthew David Robson","Alison  Noble"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
