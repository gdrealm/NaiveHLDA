{"id":"6AA6BB3B-3ABE-4A87-872F-1C9A764E10B1","title":"The impact of high sex ratios in urban and rural China","abstractText":"In China there are currently 120 male births for every 100 female. By 2020 there will be over 20 million more men than women of marriageable age.&nbsp; These imbalances are already affecting the reproductive age group, yet lack of empirical studies means the consequences of this huge surplus of men remain unknown.\n<br />\n<br />The aim of this study is to explore the demographic, social and psychological consequences of high sex ratios in China. It will be carried-out at twelve field sites in Zhejiang, Henan&nbsp; and Yunnan provinces, representing east, central and western regions, and where sex ratios in 2005 were 115 and 130 and 109 respectively.&nbsp; The study comprises three components: first, a comparison of key sociodemographic indicators across the twelve sites, followed by&nbsp; interviews with young adults and opinion leaders to explore awareness and attitudes about high sex ratios, and finally a questionnaire survey among 7000 young adults, to assess psychological well-being, attitudes and behaviours towards sex and gender roles, and aggressive tendencies.\n<br />\n<br />This study will be the most rigorous exploration of the impact of high sex ratios on men, women and society in the world literature.&nbsp; It will inform policy about the management and prevention of high sex ratios. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F034466/1","grantId":"ES/F034466/1","fundValue":"415632","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Therese  Hesketh","coPersons":["Jay  Belsky","Sara Claire Randall"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
