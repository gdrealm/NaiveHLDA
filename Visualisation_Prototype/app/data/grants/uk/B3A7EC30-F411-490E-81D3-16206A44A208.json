The very existence of Northern Ireland (NI) as a political unit - born in 1922 - owes so much to the FWW and the associated fraught relationships that existed between Great Britain and Ireland at that time. It is within this context that a compelling case can be made to create a FWW Coordinating Centre in NI.\n\nThe NI FWW Centre will be in the right place at the right time to witness and record the serious and significant FWW commemorative activities that will occur in NI (and Ireland) between 2014 and 2018. It will provide not only the means to ensure that this momentous period is itself committed to history but through its activities and resources, the Centre will provide a service to a community with immense interest in and appetite for the FWW. This is true for both the Protestant community in NI - long aligning itself with the legacies of the FWW - as well as the Roman Catholic community, only now coming to terms with its place in the history (and heritage) of the FWW, the peace process allowing examination of what was for so long a hidden history. The NI FWW Centre will act as a hub of knowledge exchange and research coproduction across NI, through supporting community researchers within a framework of arts and humanities expertise and scholarship existing within the two NI universities, Queen's University Belfast and the University of Ulster. It will do so through a programme of research training and outreach events, developed through a partnership with National Museums of Northern Ireland (NMNI), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, and Libraries NI. Four key areas of research expertise of international standing at QUB and UU will be used to forge linkages between community heritage projects and academic and professional heritage researchers.\n\nMigration history, museum studies, material culture, and performing arts have much relevance for NI communities, as is borne out by recent HLF-funded FWW projects in NI, and through the Centre these and others will be developed during 2014-2016, coinciding with key FWW commemorative events and anniversaries taking place in Ireland. In this context, the Centre will help connect Irish and Ulster communities across the UK and Ireland, and indeed beyond, putting the community research projects on a global stage. Here especially the Centre's use of digital and multimedia approaches will enable NI communities to reach a much wider audience and engagement, giving new voice to the enduring past legacies of the FWW in Ireland, as well as building a lasting future legacy of the commemorative period itself.\n\nCritically, the government of NI through the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, fully supports this proposal (see letter of support), thus ensuring the involvement of those heritage bodies that fall within its remit (eg PRONI and Libraries NI). It also has very strong support from the university sector within NI and beyond, including leading universities in GB which also have expertise in the FWW and Ireland, notably Goldsmiths, University of London, and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The NI FWW Centre will foster these research linkages and through them provide community researchers across the UK with a hub for meeting and exchanging knowledge and expertise about Ireland and the FWW. Using the facilities, resources and of QUB's new Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities, where the Centre will be based, and led by a team of dedicated, experienced, and enthusiastic public-facing researchers at QUB and UU, the Centre will capitalise on the well-established local community relations that exist in NI between the heritage and university sectors, as well as devolved government departments and organisations in NI including the Community Relations Council (CRC) and HLF.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L008343/1","grantId":"AH/L008343/1","fundValue":"522987","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Through museums and libraries as well as local heritage groups and partnerships.

In particular, we are helping communities across the UK to:\n o tell their stories and share these stories with others;\n o rediscover the forgotten First World War heritage in our landscapes;\n o find out why and where people moved as a result of the war;\n o express stories about the conflict through drama and theatre. The formation of the Living Legacies Engagement Centre emerged through shared interests between academics in exploring the contemporary resonances of the First World War. The past is particularly palpable in Northern Ireland, where our centre is situated. In Ireland, the First World War had a complex impact and longstanding effect, still evidenced today by the enduring legacies of the conflict in the histories and identities of Ireland's populations, as well as in its politics and places, both in this offshore part of the UK as well as in the neighbouring Republic of Ireland.\n\nThese troubled legacies of the First World War offer interesting opportunities to work with communities in understanding the cultural politics of conflict commemoration and its shaping of transnational identities, subjects we think have contemporary relevance not just for Northern Ireland but for other parts of Europe too, and indeed other parts of the world. For this reason we are using different but complementary areas of research - our five themes - to address the First World War not simply as history but as heritage.\n\nThinking about heritage focuses attention on the ways the past lives on in the present, in complex ways. This academic interest also provides us with substantive ways of contributing to community-based research projects that are similarly concerned with First World War heritage; whether that heritage is something that is shared, for example through theatre, through landscapes and monuments, and museums; or something kept personal and private, such as family histories and objects, artefacts and memorabilia that we keep as reminders of the First World War and its impacts on previous generations.\n\nWhat we hope the Living Legacies engagement centre will achieve, during the three years it is funded, is a stronger shared understanding of the First World War and its legacies. We aim to bring disparate communities together through linking projects that share a common interest in the war's continued presence in our lives and our memories. Recording these modern-day community engagements with First World War heritage, during the centenary period, is as important - we think - as researching the war itself, taking both together we can begin to move from a past conflict to a shared future.
