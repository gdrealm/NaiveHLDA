We are exploring fundamental\nproperties of particles at the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and\nalso exploring the nature of dark matter and neutrinos by developing\nand employing novel detection systems.\n\nWe are contributing to the continued operation of the ATLAS project at\nthe Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We have constructed and\ncommissioned electronic systems and the software that drives them.\nFrom the beginning of data taking we have played a leading role in\nsearches for exotic particles, the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson,\nand studies of properties of the top quark. We are preparing for the\nrenewed data taking starting in 2015 with further analyses on these\nand related topics.\n\nAlthough there is ample indirect evidence for the existence of dark\nmatter is inferred from its gravitational interactions, it has not yet\nbeen directly detected in terrestrial laboratories. Direct detection\nexperiments seek to observe dark matter scattering on target detector\nnuclei. We explore these issues through a world-leading dark matter\nsearch on DEAP/CLEAN, a liquid Argon detector with unique potential\nfor scaling to multi-tonne masses, with the DMTPC detector development\nprogramme to measure the dark matter wind, and the Lux-Zeplin\nexperiment. The group's expertise in high pressure TPCs is now being\nutilised to carry out measurements relevant to the study of neutrinos\nas part of the Hyper-K experiment.\n\nOur expertise in accelerator science will allow us to carry out\nstudies for the machine-detector interface for the High Luminosity LHC\nand ILC. We will also expand the interactions between our\nphenomenology group and the experimental community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001168/1","grantId":"ST/N001168/1","fundValue":"43000","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Glen  Cowan","coPersons":["Veronique  Boisvert","James Algot Nikkel","Stephen Michael Gibson","Pedro  Teixeira-Dias","Stewart Takashi Boogert","Jocelyn  Monroe","Tracey Sharon Berry","Nikolas  Kauer"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
