{"id":"413D1246-7144-4DFD-A813-B3DA8F3EB3A3","title":"Jurassic shale analogue study: from resource to reserve (JARR)","abstractText":"Resource to reserve calculations in unconventional shale gas or oil exploitation depends on quanitifying and characterising &quot;sweet spots&quot;. Sweet spots typically occur where black shale deposits have high total organic carbon, stiff/brittle rheology, abundant natural fractures, sufficient thickness and maturity, and high gas-in-place. In turn, these characteristics are controlled by fundamental geological processes including organic productivity, run-off, diagenesis, and tectonic and burial histories - all of which vary from the edges to the centres of depositional basins (i.e. proximal to distal). Sweet spot characterisation requires a multi-disciplinary approach, and access to datasets that encompass the entire range of proximal to distal environments and tectonic or burial histories. Jurassic shales in NW Europe (Liassic, Kimmeridgian), include world-class hydrocarbon source rock that underlies much of the North Sea. Jurassic rocks crop out in coastal sections in the UK and northern France, crucially these strata, have been cored and logged in many North Sea wells. Taken in their entirety, these outcrop and borehole datasets should provide an unrivalled record of the proximal to distal transition within a mud-prone stratigraphic interval across a broad region characterised by varied, but well-known tectonic and burial histories. This basin-wide dataset has the potential to provide insights into sweet spot identification not available in individual shale gas concessions that comprise small, sub-areas of much larger shale basins. Further benefits would be to identify subtle, conventional stratigraphic traps, e.g. sandy intervals within an otherwise mud-prone sequence. Despite its outstanding potential, a rigorous basin-wide study of the Jurassic in NW Europe has been hampered due to the disparate and dispersed nature of the datasets. This NERC catalyst proposal will connect a multi-disciplinary team of NERC- and industrially-funded researchers at Durham and Newcastle Universities with industrial geoscientists. Our aim is to conduct a scoping study of existing Liasic and Kimmeridgian datasets to evaluate their potential for further in-depth research into sweet spot characterisation. Catalyst funding will enable us to generate an open access GIS meta-database of existing maps, outcrops, cores, cuttings and wireline logs that penetrate Jurassic rocks of the North Sea, England and northern France. To facilitate knowledge exchange and gain a deep understanding of the challenges of sweet spot characterisation, JARR will organise and host a series of industry-academia field- and core-based workshops in the UK and northern France that will focus on three key themes: (1) basin-wide variations in black shale deposition; (2) basin-wide lithostratigraphic controls on natural fractures in proximal to distal environments; (3) basin-wide variations in the mechanical properties of mud-prone sequences, held at key onshore localities. JARR will synthesize the discussions into an open access report that will critically appraise the Jurassic as a proximal to distal shale basin analogue. JARR will publish the report and GIS meta-database on its website (www.shale-research.org), available to industry and public. The project will culminate in a professionally-facilitated industry-academia &quot;sandpit&quot; meeting, which will develop proposals for a network of collaborative Joint Industry Projects (JIPs) based around the three key themes identified above. We anticipate the JIPs will either utilize directly the datasets identified during the scoping study, and/or develop questions raised and &quot;lessons learned&quot; during the workshops and sandpit discussion. The JARR proposal will help UK-based hydrocarbon companies to better understand resource to reserve conversion factors by unlocking additional value from existing datasets, and could ultimately provide them with real competitive advantage in unconventional exploration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L008092/1","grantId":"NE/L008092/1","fundValue":"65737","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The NERC funding enabled workshops to be held this brought academic and industry participants together to share knowledge. \n\nResearch carried out during the JARR project indicate that it is quite possible that UK onshore shale gas or shale oil reserves are much lower than has been claimed.

The project was set up to conduct a scoping study of Jurassic shales from the UK, with the aim of using the data to understand shale depositional systems more broadly. Of particular interest was the use of Jurassic shales as an analogue to provide information relevant to Carboniferous shale successions, which are the main target for shale gas exploration in the UK.\nWorkshops were held as part of the project, at the British Geological Survey in Nottingham, on the Dorset coast, and in Alnwick, Northumberland. These enabled industry and academic participants to learn and discuss the latest research on how shales form, how they fracture, and how these fundamental variables impact on shale gas potential. Research carried out during the JARR project indicate that it is quite possible that UK onshore shale gas or shale oil reserves are much lower than has been claimed. New scientific models were introduced, demonstrating the importance of climate variability at orbital time scales (10 to 400-kyr frequencies) in controlling basin-wide shale composition and quality. JARR also showed how these primary depositional controls can affect the mechanical properties of shales and their propensity to generate, store, and release hydrocarbons during burial. JARR researchers have actively disseminated this to industrial, academic and public audiences at national and international conferences, published initial findings in a new peer-reviewed scientific paper, with further papers to be published shortly.\nOne of the key outcomes of the JARR project was the demonstration to industrial researchers that orbital time-scale climate variability explains many aspects of shale systems. The project expanded on the potential applicability of Jurassic depositional models to older shale successions, including the Carboniferous. However, it became clear that our understanding of UK onshore Carboniferous shales is strongly limited by a lack of complementary data that resolve orbital time scales. To address this, we are developing JARR-2. This program aims to work with industry and Government to identify sites for one or more research boreholes in the UK, targeting Carboniferous shales. Through JARR it has been explicitly recognised that there is a shortage of non-proprietary core and data on Carboniferous shales. From the sandpit meeting we developed an initial proposal for a shallow borehole (below). We are also in discussion with various companies in the UK, including those named above to discuss how to take the research further and how to set up a larger matched council-JIP funding scheme. \n\nBowland Shallow Borehole project\n This pathway builds directly from work undertaken in the JARR project, and will focus on characterizing the Carboniferous shales of northern England. The JARR team will be broadened to include expertise in soil and rock mechanics (Prof. Charles Augarde, Dr Nic de Paola), petroleum geochemistry (Dr Martin Jones) and computational fracture mechanics (Dr Will Coombs, Prof. Jon Trevelyan). The follow up proposal will also build on external partnerships - initiated during JARR and other NERC-funded projects - with government agencies (BGS, NHM, Innovate UK Energy Generation &amp; Supply Network), hydrocarbon service sector (Chemostrat, APT, RPS, Getech, Robertson) and exploration companies (Celtique Energy, Cuadrilla). The aim is to progress the research borehole concept to the point at which development of a full technical proposal is possible. The objectives are to: (1) develop a consensus view from industry, government and academia for a Carboniferous research borehole in northern England; and (2) undertake a technical evaluation/screening of potential borehole locations within the Bowland Shale resource area.\nObjective 1 will focus on building support through engagement with partners, including potential funders, culminating in a multi-partner workshop to shortlist possible borehole locations. We have recently received funding for Objective 1 through the Durham Energy Institute Small Grants scheme.\nObjective 2 will be an exercise in data mining and integration to evaluate the geological, geotechnical and cost implications of potential study sites. \n\n&quot;Deeper Levels of Understanding&quot; - Deep UK borehole/s research project with 3D seismic data acquisition and possible hydraulic fracturing.
