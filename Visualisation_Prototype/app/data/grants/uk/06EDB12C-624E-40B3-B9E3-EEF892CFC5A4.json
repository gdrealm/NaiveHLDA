{"id":"06EDB12C-624E-40B3-B9E3-EEF892CFC5A4","title":"Spatiotemporal Analysis of GPCR-Dependent Rac Signalling in Neutrophils","abstractText":"Rac is a protein that enables cells to do a myriad of things, such as moving around, secreting various factors, or eating and killing germs. In order to fulfil its many roles, Rac must become activated, which happens in response to signals such as hormones or growth factors that are received by the cell from the outside. Activation of Rac is done by a large group of proteins called GEFs which read these signals. We assume that so many different Rac-GEFs exist in order for each to induce a characteristic pattern of Rac activity within the cell, and that these patterns of Rac activity dictate how the cell reacts to a given signal. We have developed a tool that enables us to test this hypothesis, namely a mouse strain which carries a fluorescent dye that shows up colour patterns of Rac activity in living cells, the so-called Rac-FRET mouse strain. For this first project with the Rac-FRET mouse strain, we have chosen to study Rac activity in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that defends us against bacterial and fungal infections. Rac activity is essential for neutrophils to function appropriately. When neutrophils don't work well, we get severe and repeated infections, or, when they work too hard, they can cause or worsen inflammatory disorders such as septic shock and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, although our project mainly aims to advance basic science, it also carries inherent importance for our health. We will measure Rac activity in neutrophils from the Rac-FRET mouse strain (we already know that this will work). Mostly, Rac activity will be assessed by microscopy, so we can measure both how much and when and where Rac is active. We will compare the patterns of Rac activity in normal Rac-FRET neutrophils to those which lack certain GEFs. The GEFs we chose for this purpose, namely P-Rex1/Vav1 and DOCK2, are known to be important in relaying a particularly type of signal, called GPCR signal, which enables many different neutrophil functions. If we can show that P-Rex1/Vav1 and DOCK2 cause distinct patterns of Rac activity in neutrophils in response to GPCR signals, we will have proof that they don't simply fulfil interchangeable roles. By correlating the patterns of Rac activity induced by each GEF with the responses that they induce in the cell, such as cell migration, we aim to proof that different pools of Rac activity within the cell can give rise to different neutrophil functions. In addition to our microscopy-based experiments, we will also use the Rac-FRET neutrophils in the development of an improved test-tube based method for testing reagents that stimulate or suppress Rac activity. Together, the results from this study will fundamentally advance our insight into Rac and neutrophil biology. It may also help us decide which GEFs to target in future for inhibiting inappropriate levels of Rac activity in inflammatory disorders while preserving Rac activity for immune-defence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I02154X/1","grantId":"BB/I02154X/1","fundValue":"496496","fundStart":"2011-11-16","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Heidi Christine Welch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
