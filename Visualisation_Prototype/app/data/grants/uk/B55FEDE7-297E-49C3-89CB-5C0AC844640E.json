This research work was performed in mice but was thought to imply that the same will happen in human females. This report, published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature, created much interest both among scientists and the public media. This is so, because it has been believed for a long time that from birth of mammalian females (including girls) and onwards there is a continuous decline in the number of egg-producing cells until total depletion, leading to menopause. If a topping up process exists during adulthood, it would prompt a major rethink of many of our views in reproductive biology, touching upon everything from fertility and aging to the childbearing capabilities of young cancer patients undergoing therapy. Importantly the topping up process could be exploited in situations of disease or chemotherapy, so that by stimulating the process, fertility could be maintained. We are seeking resources to be able to follow up and expand this work in mice, using a combination of more advanced microscopy and cell growth technology. Even if we cannot confirm the observations of the USA group in itself, the project should lead to additional important information to be obtained with respect to egg-producing cells in mice females, information that could then be extrapolated to the situation in women.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D002583/1","grantId":"BB/D002583/1","fundValue":"186382","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maj Anita  Hulten","coPersons":["Robert William Old"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
