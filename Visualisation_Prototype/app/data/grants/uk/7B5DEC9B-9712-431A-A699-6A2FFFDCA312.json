{"id":"7B5DEC9B-9712-431A-A699-6A2FFFDCA312","title":"Quantitative Nanoscale Imaging of Trace Elements in Biological Systems","abstractText":"The project we propose involves research into novel chemical imaging methodology for 2D and 3D visualisation of trace elements in cells and tissues with greatly improved sensitivity, easy of reliability and magnification over current approaches. The technology includes powerful lasers for the uniform and highly sensitive detection of atoms and small molecules ejected from biological specimens under bombardment from high energy particles. The result is a multi-element chemical map of the specimen showing detail on the sub-cellular length scale. We shall demonstrate the power of this approach in the detection and localisation of cancer drugs in cells and model tissues. However, the methodology we will develop will be more widely applicable in a number of important biological problems involving trace element transport, storage and distribution. This includes but is not limited to drug development, disease diagnosis and fundamental cell biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I023771/1","grantId":"BB/I023771/1","fundValue":"119427","fundStart":"2012-02-27","fundEnd":"2013-08-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The impact of this award beyond the immediate academic beneficiaries has yet to be realised.

In doing so we have compared the results in terms of sensitivity to a more established method (secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS) to assess the optimum approach in imaging drig distributions in biological samples including cells and tissue. The LPI approach has enable upto 100-fold increase in sensitivity in the detection of the drug cisplatin. We have established calibration data using drugs diltuted into a biological mimic (gelatin), demonstrating that the limit of detection reaches levels matching the concentrations of these drugs in clinical use. This suggests the LPI method is appropriate in imaging drug distrubutions in real samples from patients undergoing drug therapy. This has important implications for the monitoring of therapy and the development of new drugs which target specific cells. We have further demonstrated this capability by imaging a boron-based drug in a brain tumour biopsy taken from a patient given a therapeutic drug dose. At the present stage of development more academic research is needed into the LPI process and its application in the biosciences. We have further demonstrated signficiant advantages in specific analytes, but it remains to be seen how these advantages can be gained in the majority of drugs and small biomolecules.
