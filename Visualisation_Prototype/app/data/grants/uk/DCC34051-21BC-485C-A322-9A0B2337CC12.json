{"id":"DCC34051-21BC-485C-A322-9A0B2337CC12","title":"A Decision-By-Sampling Account of Decision Under Risk","abstractText":"<p>There are many existing models of how people make risky decisions. The models suggest people use distorted estimates of risk and reward and, given these distortions, give a good description of the decisions people make. But they do not explain why people make these distortions. The research proposed here will develop a new model of risky decisions. The model - decision by sampling - assumes that people reach decisions using the simple cognitive abilities that people have available to them. Decision by sampling has already given a successful explanation of why estimates of risks and rewards are distorted as they are. The first part of this research will deliver experimental tests of the core assumptions of the model. The second part of this research will select the model which best explains people's risky decision making from the full set of existing models, including decision by sampling. Together, this research will lead to a better understanding of decision under risk and provide a more complete model of risky decision making. Such a model will inform behavioural economics and neuroeconomics, consumer psychology, and UK financial services.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F02598X/1","grantId":"ES/F02598X/1","fundValue":"248899","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Stewart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
