As it is common in such cases the art is to segment the systems to subsystems and then model each one using a technique best suited to its peculiarities. Then, the various sub-models need to be combined to account fully for all interactions. This process of segmentation, sub-system modelling and aggregation is very challenging in all physical domains but it is particularly so in high-frequency applications (electromagnetic waves do not respect boundaries-they propagate and couple along large distances).In this proposal we aim to address these issues using a range of numerical models, field-based, network-based and behavioural. We combine our own expertise in constructing sophisticated macro-models of multi-scale systems with that of our partners to address a challenging problem of crucial importance to the advanced development of information and communications technologies which pervade all engineering applications. Successful completion of this research programme will make available to Industry a sophisticated hybrid modelling capability to analyse and design complex electromagnetic systems such as typified by a modern mobile phone which combines in a single handheld unit a multitude of complex functions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G009201/1","grantId":"EP/G009201/1","fundValue":"433510","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Thomas","coPersons":["Stephen  Greedy","Phillip Donald Sewell"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
