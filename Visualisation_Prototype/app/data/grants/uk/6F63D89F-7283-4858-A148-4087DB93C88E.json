Recent studies suggest that when individuals with DID are tested in contexts which elevated their anxiety, they show a weakened ability to withhold distracting information from influencing task goals. The ability to withhold distracting information is referred to as cognitive inhibition. It is unclear whether weakened cognitive inhibition is present in other trauma-related psychiatric conditions and whether it is directly related to an individualâ€™s capacity to engage in dissociation. </p>\n\n<p>The first aim of this study is to determine if previous findings of weakened cognitive inhibition in DID in anxiety-arousing situations are evident in another trauma-related psychiatric condition, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The second aim is to determine if dissociation (dissociative ability) is the primary psychological characteristic responsible for weakened cognitive inhibition in anxiety-provoking contexts. </p>\n\n<p>The study utilises a computer-presented task where individuals with PTSD who have high or low dissociative experiences and those from the general population are assessed on their cognitive inhibitory ability in two contexts. The first context is after exposure to a neutral memory from their personal history. The second context is after exposure to a traumatic memory. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1653","grantId":"RES-000-22-1653","fundValue":"39418","fundStart":"2006-05-15","fundEnd":"2007-05-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Noel  Sheehy","coPersons":["Ciaran  Mulholland","Martin  Dorahy"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
