{"id":"6C9A9913-3D1B-4C73-9A86-FEDE820AB65E","title":"Probing ubiquitin topology","abstractText":"Ubiquitin is a small protein found in organisms as diverse as yeast and man. It is responsible for the regulation of a host of processes within the cell, including targeting proteins for destruction, gene transcription, cell signalling, and controlling traffic through the cell membrane. Ubiquitin is attached to one or more sites on a target protein by the action of a set of enzymes in a process known as ubiquitination. Ubiquitin is coupled to the amino acid lysine within the target protein structure and, because ubiquitin itself contains lysine residues, it is possible for polymeric ubiquitin chains to build up during ubiquitination / through linkage at any of seven lysines. Thus, poly-ubiquitin can form defined shapes, or topologies, depending upon its linkage pattern. It is believed that different topologies and chain lengths maybe responsible for different functions within the cell, but probing the complete topology of a poly-ubiquitin chain has not previously been possible. Here we propose methods to map poly-ubiquitin linkage, and determine the binding of different topologies with ubiquitin-interacting proteins to allow us to tackle the key question 'does poly-ubiquitin shape and size matter?' in the context of some important biological processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F019297/1","grantId":"BB/F019297/1","fundValue":"347609","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Knowledge of the existence of cyclic di-ubiquitin, which was identified as a result of research conducted under this award (see publication) has been used by the company Boston Biochem in improving the quality of their commercial di-ubiquitin product.

The method was validated against UBDs of known affinity and found to be in excellent agreement. Application to previously unstudied Ub interactions provided new insights into this important signalling pathway. \n\nb)Identification of linkage topology profiles for unanchored Ubn in rat skeletal muscle using analysis of intact Ubn chains by MS. K-48 and K-11 isopeptide-linked topologies were found to be the most abundant forms of Ub2 in vivo. Cyclic K-48 linked Ub2 was identified as a biologically relevant species for the first time.\n\nc)Development of an ion mobility-MS method to distinguish between K-11, K-27, K-48 and K-63 Ub2 using collisional activation of low charge state ions. Different linkages of Ub2 were found to exhibit different unfolding profiles in the gas-phase, allowing their discrimination. Ubiquitination, a post-translational modification (PTM) resulting in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to a target protein, is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in many eukaryotic cellular processes. Protein degradation, endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and various signalling pathways are all regulated by this important PTM. A better understanding of the topology of poly-Ub and its interactions with proteins possessing Ub-binding domains have potential for significant application for drug development by the pharmaceutical industry. As one example we are currently exploring the inhibition of interactions between isopeptidase-T and unanchored poly-Ub chains, which leads to stabilisation of the cell cycle-controlling protein p53, and is a potentially powerful anti-cancer strategy.
