The injury itself causes immediate and irreversible damage and also initiates a cascade of changes that lead to continued brain damage (secondary injury) that can, in some circumstances, be prevented or treated. The degree of cell damage and death is related to reduction in brain oxygen supply and the inability of some brain cells to utilise oxygen effectively. Different regions of the brain will be affected to different degrees. Patients with severe head injury are monitored and treated on intensive care units where the aim is to minimise secondary brain injury. \n\nMeasurement of the pressure inside the head and the oxygen levels in the brain helps to guide the intensive care treatment of head injury. However, most established brain monitors have disadvantages; many are invasive and provide information about only a small part of the brain whereas others make ?average? measurements of the whole brain and miss important regional changes. Modern imaging techniques can provide sophisticated maps of the injured brain but such techniques are not generally available at the bedside and, in any case, only provide a ?snapshot? of information at one particular moment in time. \n\nNear infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an inexpensive optical technique using low light levels to measure the distribution of oxygen and blood in the brain and crucially how oxygen is being utilised at a cellular level. The equipment is portable and well suited to measurements during neurointensive care. We have recently developed a novel NIRS system that specifically assesses cellular oxygen utilisation in the adult brain. The aim of this project is to use this new system to monitor brain oxygen levels in a large number of patients with head injury and to determine whether the brain cells are effectively utilising delivered oxygen. Because this system is non-invasive, measurements can be made at multiple sites in the brain, allowing a comparison of injured and uninjured areas. Continuous monitoring also allows minute-to-minute changes to be identified. This information will help doctors to decide which part of the brain is most affected by the injury and assist them in the delivery of targeted treatment. \n\nThe applicants have a strong history of public engagement in science activities including the Royal Society Science Exhibition (2006), radio and television programmes, lectures at the House of Commons and Royal Institution and numerous schools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701458","grantId":"G0701458","fundValue":"292677","fundStart":"2009-02-04","fundEnd":"2011-02-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare Elizabeth Elwell","coPersons":["Martin  Smith","Christopher Eric Cooper"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
