Case studies will then be developed in contrasting communities severely affected by HIV and AIDS to identify contextual factors that can lead to exclusion from conventional schooling and dropping out.&nbsp;The case studies will be complemented by data collected using a range of approaches such as semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, informal discussions with family members, participatory activities and observation. </p> \n<p>Based on this formative research, a pilot intervention will then be made through secondary schools to identify and trial a small-scale ODFL intervention package designed to overcome the barriers to conventional schooling identified in the case studies. The intervention will be evaluated qualitatively and also quantitatively using an experimental design.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E014410/1","grantId":"ES/E014410/1","fundValue":"223128","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pat Judith Pridmore","coPersons":["Christopher Andrew Yates"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
