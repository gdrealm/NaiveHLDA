{"id":"557222BF-D47A-459D-AF98-562F3D8A2E38","title":"The Digital Creativity Hub","abstractText":"The creative industries are crucial to UK social and cultural life and one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Games and media are key pillars for growth in the creative industries, with UK turnovers of &pound;3.5bn and &pound;12.9bn respectively. Research in digital creativity has started to be well supported by governmental funds. To achieve full impact from these investments, translational and audience-facing research activities are needed to turn ideas into commercial practice and societal good. We propose a &quot;Digital Creativity&quot; Hub for such next-step research, which will produce impact from a huge amount of research activity in direct collaboration with a large group of highly engaged stakeholders, delivering impact in the Digital Economy challenge areas of Sustainable Society, Communities and Culture and New Economic Models.\n\nYork is the perfect location for the DC Hub, with a fast-growing Digital Creativity industry (which grew 18.4% from 2011 to 2012), and 4800 creative digital companies within a 40-mile radius of the city. The DC Hub will be housed in the Ron Cooke Hub, alongside the IGGI centre for doctoral training, world-class researchers, and numerous small hi-tech companies.\n\nThe DC Hub brings:\n\n- A wealth of research outcomes from Digital Economy projects funded by &pound;90m of grants, &pound;40m of which was managed directly by the investigators named in the proposal. The majority of these projects are interdisciplinary collaborations which involved co-creation of research questions and approaches with creative industry partners, and all of them produced results which are ripe for translational impact.\n\n- Substantial cash and in-kind support amounting to pledges of &pound;9m from 80 partner organisations. These include key organisations in the Digital Economy, such as the KTN, Creative England and the BBC, major companies such as BT, Sony and IBM, and a large number of SMEs working in games and interactive media. The host Universities have also pledge3m in matched funding, with the University of York agreeing to hire four &quot;transitional&quot; research fellows on permanent contracts from the outset leading to academic positions as a Professor, a Reader and two Lecturers.\n\n- Strong overlap with current projects run by the investigators which have complementary goals. These include the NEMOG project to study new economic models and opportunities for games, the Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) centre for doctoral training, with 55+ PhDs, and the Falmouth ERA Chair project, which will contribute an extra 5 five-year research fellowships to the DC Hub, leveraging &pound;2m of EC funding for translational research in digital games technologies.\n\n- A diverse and highly active base of 16 investigators and 4 named PDRAs across four universities, who have much experience of working together on funded research projects delivering high-impact results. The links between these investigators are many and varied, and interdisciplinarity is ensured by a group of investigators working across Computer Science, Theatre Film and TV, Electronics, Art, Audio Production, Sociology, Education, Psychology, and Business.\n\n- Huge potential for step-change impact in the creative industries, with particular emphasis on video game technologies, interactive media, and the convergence of games and media for science and society. Projects in these areas will be supported by and feed into basic research in underpinning themes of data analytics, business models, human-computer interaction and social science. The projects will range over impact themes comprising impact projects which will be specified throughout the life of the Hub in close collaboration with our industry partners, who will help shape the research, thus increasing the potential for major impact.\n\n- A management team, with substantial experience of working together on large projects for research and impact in collaboration with the digital creative industries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M023265/1","grantId":"EP/M023265/1","fundValue":"4039830","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2020-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Ivan Cowling","coPersons":["Jonathan David Hook","Feng  Li","Damian  Murphy","Darren James Reed","Alex Robert Wade","Nicolas S  Holliman","Paul Antony Cairns","Simon  Colton","James  Austin","Marian  Ursu","William  Latham","Julian  Richards","Jeremy  Gow","Emma Josephine Marsden","Helen  Petrie"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
