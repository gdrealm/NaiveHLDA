It represents one of the major new datasets collected in Antarctica over the past 10 years, and has changed our appreciation of topography across of large regions of the Antarctic continent.\n\n\n\nEvidence for basal water flowing from the ice sheet interior to the ice margin.\n\nKnowing that subglacial lakes exist at the centre of East Antarctica, and that ice streams at the margin are warm based, we interrogated geophysical data to understand evidence for and against basal water flow from the interior to the edge of the ice sheet. This was possible as a consequence of the data collected, and has never been attempted before. We conclude that there is no evidence against water continuous flow and several datasets in support of it. While none are themsleves conclusive, the balance of probability, based on several independent datasets inspected, means it is very likely that water does indeed flow from the ice sheet interior to the margin in east Antarctica.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence for past significant ice sheet change in East Antarctica.\n\nRadar data was used to determine subglacial topography, which revealed major new information on the Antarctic sub-ice landscape. We use this to show that, in the Aurora basin region, significant former ice sheet changes had taken place, at that in previous times the ice sheet in this region has been far smaller. \n\n\n\n\n\nNew gravity and magnetics data, revealing information on the tectonics of the continent.\n\nWe have used gravity and magnetics data from our survey of Antarctica, and coupled it to similar datasets in Australia, to show how they have formerly been connected, how major geological faults and tectononics can be seen in both regions, and geology subsequently has influenced long-term ice sheet flow and form since ice sheet inception 34Ma. Our work has been featured in TV/Radio and newspapers on several occasions, due to some high level publications that have received media and public interest. We are keen to promote our work in this way and in particular reach out to children in order to inform them about Antarctica, science and the environment. The Antarctic Treaty forbids the exploitation of Antarctic resources. However, the data collected are freely available for anyone to use. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
