{"id":"DBFCB3A3-1F93-4DEF-941F-98D8ED28DFF7","title":"Dynamic Responsive Signal Control for Railway Junctions","abstractText":"Stations and junctions are vital elements of railway systems, but they are also a major constraint on network capacity. Several new technologies, such as the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) level 3, have been proposed for signal control of tracks between junctions, but as yet no innovative technology has been proposed for junctions and stations. In the current system, signal control officers manually control signals, but they need to consider various factors at every moment. Several stations have adopted the Automatic Route Setting (ARS) system, but major stations with complex operations still rely on manual control of officers because ARS only solves possible future conflicts between trains and does not consider other factors such as operations and optimisation of train operations at the network level.The purpose of this project is to increase the capacity of rail networks by enhancing the control of rail junctions. Its aim is to explore ways in which the capacity of railway junctions can be expanded by developing concepts of dynamic comprehensive responsive control, drawing on techniques used in road traffic management and control applications. The project will also investigate techniques used in other transport industries where the operation is demand-responsive, namely airport operation for landing aircrafts, taxi operation, and emergency vehicle operation.The main objective of the proposed project is to develop a framework for dynamic responsive operation at railway junctions and stations, and control strategies that support the framework. In particular, we will:- Analyse the factors in responsive operations at railway junctions and stations in order to develop a framework for dynamic comprehensive responsive operations - Develop control strategies that support dynamic responsive operations and an algorithm that implement these strategies. - Examine the effects of the new framework and the strategies by simulationThe new framework and strategies do not involve laying additional tracks, which requires the purchase of additional land and additional civil engineering work. Our new framework and strategies can be an economical way of increasing capacity. In addition, the framework and strategies will reduce the recovery time from service disruptions. This helps train operating companies and infrastructure management companies reduce the increase of operation costs caused by service disruptions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I010734/1","grantId":"EP/I010734/1","fundValue":"344240","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Taku  Fujiyama","coPersons":["Benjamin  Heydecker"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
