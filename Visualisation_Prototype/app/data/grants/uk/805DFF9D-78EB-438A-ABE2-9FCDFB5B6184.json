The current research programme has three broad aims: 1) to investigate the individual and work-related antecedents of poor psychological detachment from work during evenings and weekends amongst UK healthcare and central government employees; 2) to examine the impact of poor psychological detachment from work on employees’ psychological health and work performance; and 3) to evaluate a worksite training programme designed to enhance healthy detachment, well-being, and recovery. The first study will use questionnaires and a daily survey method to assess individual and work-related predictors of psychological detachment from work across three or four evenings in the same working week. Study two will employ a weekend respite design to assess the role of weekend experiences in helping employees psychologically detach and recover from the demands of work. The final study will use a randomised controlled group design to evaluate a mindfulness-based psychological skills training programme focused on enhancing recovery and general well-being.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0232","grantId":"RES-061-25-0232","fundValue":"82411","fundStart":"2009-01-05","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Flaxman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
