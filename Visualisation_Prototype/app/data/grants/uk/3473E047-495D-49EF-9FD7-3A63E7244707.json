The development of these secondary tumours is normally the cause of mortality in the patient. This proposal aims to evaluate the potential for the therapeutic blocking of a destructive enzyme, cathepsin S, in the development and spread of aggressive tumours. Over-produced by tumour and tumour associated cells, the inhibition of this protease may in the future prove useful in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to not only kill the cancer cells but to prevent the spread and seeding of these secondary metastases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901615","grantId":"G0901615","fundValue":"365747","fundStart":"2010-08-23","fundEnd":"2014-03-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Scott","coPersons":["Brian  Walker","Helen  McCarthy"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
