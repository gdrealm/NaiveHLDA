Specifically, we examined the social production of the military memoir - the range of practices and processes which shape the genesis, writing, editing and publication of these texts. <br /><br />Military memoirs are a prominent and significant site for the cultural construction of ideas about war. Those ideas emerge through the representational capacities of the finished text.&nbsp; What this research asked is: how does that text emerge in the first place? <br /><br />We had two objectives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to address the practical issue of how military memoirs come to be written and produced</li>\n\n <li>to theorise why military personnel are motivated to produce memoirs. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Using innovative methodologies of depth interviewing based on documentary elicitation and textual analysis, this research explored how the contemporary British military memoir comes into being. Outputs include both popular and academic publications.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1493","grantId":"RES-062-23-1493","fundValue":"235859","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings are of general use to scholars working on military topics and a wider interested public.
