{"id":"26CB6380-2601-468E-B6FD-55BDC060664F","title":"Maximising the impact of online fundraising","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this research is to develop an understanding of online fundraising (eg what motivates individual fundraisers and donors and what determines how much money is raised for charity). This is important for its own sake - charities would like to know how to maximise the potential of this particular form of fundraising. The public nature of online fundraising also provides a useful setting for exploring wider aspects of giving, such as the role of social networks and peer group effects. The project will be done in collaboration with the biggest online fundraising website, Justgiving.</p>\n\n<p>The project will integrate the results of a survey of Justgiving users, which collected a rich set of information on individualsâ€™ socio-demographic characteristics and their motivations for engaging in fundraising, together with transactional data on fundraising and sponsorships. The combined dataset will provide a uniquely rich dataset that will allow us to address a number of practical- and policy-focused questions.</p>\n\n<p>The findings will be shared and discussed with Justgiving throughout the project, enabling them to provide a practitioner perspective and to integrate research findings from their ongoing programme of qualitative, focus group-based research. We will also hold a user workshop early in 2014.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007904/1","grantId":"ES/K007904/1","fundValue":"13824","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Louise Smith","coPersons":["A.
