{"id":"3E1BB2F3-C3BF-4B1A-96C4-FF5878FAF67D","title":"Rational design of low-CO2 alkali-activated concretes for eco-efficiency and durability","abstractText":"This project will develop new methodologies for designing and optimising environmentally friendly concretes derived from industrial by-product materials. As a collaborative project involving leading institutions in the UK and China, we will work together to design these concretes, which are based on low-CO2 alkali-activated cements instead of traditional Portland cement, in a way which optimises the properties of the concrete by making use of the unique interfacial binding properties of the alkali-activated cement material. We will achieve this through a combined programme of experimental and mathematical modelling work, and will validate the performance of the concretes through accelerated durability testing. This project also links to the work of the international RILEM technical committee which is working towards the standardisation of testing methods for these materials on an international level, enhancing the leadership of UK and Chinese researchers in this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M003272/1","grantId":"EP/M003272/1","fundValue":"687171","fundStart":"2014-12-15","fundEnd":"2017-12-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Lloyd Provis","coPersons":["Marios  Soutsos","Sreejith  Nanukuttan","Muhammed  Basheer"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
