Pellagra, Italian for ‘rough skin’, was the disease of the four 'd's: dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and death. Through a book-length study, a new data set, a major international conference and a travelling historical exhibit, the ‘Rough Skin’ will explore the response of society, the state and the medical community to pellagra, and explore the experience of pellagra from the point of view of sufferers and their families.</p>\n\n<p>The project compares and contrasts the Italian experience of maize and pellagra with other regions similarly struck (like Asturias in Spain, the southern United States, and Romania); with other preventable deficiency diseases, such as beriberi and goitre; and with present-day man-made epidemic diseases, like obesity.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the project’s research assistant will prepare a data set based on the clinical files of pellagrins (pellagra victims) hospitalised at the asylums of San Servolo (men) and San Clemente (women), in Venice, providing answers about the construction of disease categories, the changing treatment strategies employed, and the social origins of pellagrins.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K010212/1","grantId":"ES/K010212/1","fundValue":"430234","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The focus of the project, at this developmental stage, has been to establish academic and wider social contacts in order to make the project widely known, both in the UK and in Italy.

This includes activities directed at a more general audience, as well as reaching out to non-historians. \nThe RA has made substantial progress with the planned San Servolo/San Clemente data set. The findings have already been presented at numerous international conferences (Lausanne, Lisbon, and soon, Leicester). He has begun work on two substantial publications, one on the use of photography in patient records, and the second on the changing classification of mental illness. In addition, he has established local contacts with regard to the planned museum exhibit/workshop, in Treviso (psychologists) and Badia di Polesine (mayor's office). In terms of the data set, we hope that it will be able to interact with historical hospital databases elsewhere.\nThe research itself will be of use to historians of medicine, historians of food, and historians of society, in particular in our understanding of epidemics and food-related diseases across time and place.
