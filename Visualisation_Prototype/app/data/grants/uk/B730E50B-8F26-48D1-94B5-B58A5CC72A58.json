We show that different environmental oestrogens can induce different tissue responses with different potential health outcomes. This provides a more intelligent system for assessing biological effects of environmental oestrogens and avoids the use of intact animals. We are in the process of establishing the assay in format that will allow for high throughput screening of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. It is envisaged that the new system will result in a reduction and refinement in the use of animals for chemical testing.

The assay is also being employed in support of an OECD test guideline assay for screening chemicals for hormone disrupting chemicals.
