This proposal extends\nthe applicants' previous work on family influences on children's abilities to regulate their thoughts and behaviours in several ways: by focusing on the first two years of life; by examining effects of paternal as well as maternal influences; by integrating this cognitive perspective with the co-investigators' expertise in assessing individual differences at biological and social levels; and finally by adopting\na multi-site design that provides a stringent test of the generalisability of study findings. \n\nA sample of 400 expectant mothers and their partners (200 in the UK and 100 in the USA and\nthe Netherlands) will be recruited using an enriched sampling design to maximize the\nparticipation of expectant parents showing low levels of well-being. Self-regulatory\nskills will be assessed using validated experimental methods. We hope to examine the complex interplay between a range of social factors (e.g., quality of family relationships) cognitive factors (in both parents and infants) and biological factors (maternal and infant levels of the stress hormone cortisol) as predictors of infant adjustment and well-being.\n\nA key strength of the study is its inclusion of fathers, as many basic questions regarding parental influences remain unanswered: For example are the relations between parental predictors and infant outcomes similar in nature and magnitude for fathers and mothers? \n\nBuilding on the rapid growth of studies that highlight variation in children's susceptibility to environmental influences, the proposed study will explore contrasts in the nature and magnitude of family predictors of infant adjustment that relate to characteristics of the infant (e.g., stress reactivity), the parent (e.g., parenting style) and the culture (e.g., level of societal support for individuals making the transition to parenthood).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L016648/1","grantId":"ES/L016648/1","fundValue":"584669","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Helene Hughes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
