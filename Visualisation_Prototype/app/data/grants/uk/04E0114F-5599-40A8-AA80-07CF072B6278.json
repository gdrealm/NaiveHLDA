While the electromagnetic, weak\nand strong forces have been understood since the formulation of the\nstandard model in 1967, it has so far not been possible\nto add the more familiar force of gravity in a consistent way. Our\ncurrent description of gravity is Einstein's very successful theory\nof general relativity, which describes the motion of planets, stars\nand galaxies. \n\nAt small distances the behaviour of matter and forces is governed\nby quantum mechanics. It is crucial for the quantum mechanical\nconsistency of the electromagnetic and strong and weak forces that\nthe standard model of particle physics incorporates a large amount\nof of symmetry. Unfortunately, Einstein's theory of general relativity is\nnot consistent with quantum mechanics and so cannot be simply\ncombined with the standard model to provide a consistent theory of\nall the four forces.\n\nIt is widely believed that supersymmetry, which is a symmetry that\nexchanges fermions (matter particles such as the electron) with\nbosons (force carriers such as photons of light) will play an\nimportant role in formulating a unified theory of the four forces. \nSupersymmetry predicts the existence of yet unknown subatomic \nparticles, and the search for these is an important motivation behind \nthe construction of the `Large Hadron Collider' (LHC) at CERN, a vast \nlaboratory situated in Geneva.\n\nStrings are microscopic objects which are extended along one dimension and can vibrate, just like strings on a violin. To date there does not exist a complete theory of strings, but the lowest energy effects of such a theory\nare unique as a consequence of the large amount of symmetry, and in\nparticular supersymmetry, that they possess. These are the so-called\nsupergravity theories. By studying these theories it has been realised that \nbranes and a symmetry called U-duality are an important part of the full \ntheory. Branes can similarly be thought of as microscopic generalizations of \nstrings to objects that are extended along more than one dimension. This complete theory is known as M-theory. Although little is known about it on microscopic level it is known to involve eleven-dimensions, extending the ten-dimensional space-time of superstrings.\n\nWe wish to find and understand this underlying theory of string and\nbranes. We propose to investigate this very intricate theory from\nseveral points of view. The first is to understand the theory at low\nenergies, where it must produce space-time and the four forces we\nknow. Secondly, we will investigate the theory at very high\nenergies, where its fundamental constituents behave like vibrating\nstrings and branes and the notion of a smooth space-time does no\nlonger make sense. \n\nOur most important tool will be the enormous amount of symmetry that\nthis theory is thought to possesses. Symmetry is a sign of\nunderlying simplicity and beauty and has been a reliable guiding\nprinciple in reaching the understanding of physics we have today. In\nthis process we expect to replace of our usual notion of space-time\nby one which is consistent with such symmetries. This illustrates on\nthe one hand the profound effect that a unified theory has on our\nunderstanding of nature, and on the other hand the central role\nplayed by symmetries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002798/1","grantId":"ST/J002798/1","fundValue":"995349","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Christopher West","coPersons":["Jonathan (John) Ellis","Sakura  Schafer-Nameki","Bobby Samir Acharya","Nikolaos  Mavromatos","Nadav  Drukker","Dario  Martelli","Neil  Lambert","Nikolay Alexandrovich Gromov","Malcolm  Fairbairn","G  Papadopoulos"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
