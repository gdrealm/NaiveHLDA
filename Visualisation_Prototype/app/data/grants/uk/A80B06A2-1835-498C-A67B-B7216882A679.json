As media coverage demonstrates only too clearly, the drought has reopened questions about current systems of water management, the assumptions of demand forecasting and management, and the possibilities of ‘appropriate’ alternatives and solutions.&nbsp;In particular strategies by the government, regulators and water companies to shape domestic water demand have provoked renewed discussion about water needs, rights, and responsibilities.&nbsp;This study&nbsp;involves a real-time qualitative sociological analysis of the 2006 drought in the south east of England, involving interviews with householders, water resource managers and regulators. The project aims to reveal the assumptions about demand inherent in existing systems of water practice and provision, to discover how far the drought might act as a catalyst for change in definitions of normal and necessary levels of water consumption, and to identify the dynamics of resilience in demand, both in relation to adaptation as well as persistence. The project is co-funded by UKWIR, DEFRA, OFWAT, the Environment Agency, Anglian Water, Essex and Suffolk Water, Folkestone and Dover Water, Three Valleys Water and South East Water.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E007112/1","grantId":"ES/E007112/1","fundValue":"63051","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"William Peter Medd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
