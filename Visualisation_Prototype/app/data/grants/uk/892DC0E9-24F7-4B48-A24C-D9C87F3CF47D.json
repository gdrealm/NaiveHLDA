{"id":"892DC0E9-24F7-4B48-A24C-D9C87F3CF47D","title":"Meta-analysis, complexity and heterogeneity (MACH): methodological review and development of guidance","abstractText":"Systematic reviews are commonly used to summarise large bodies of evidence, particularly on clinical trials. They are increasingly used to inform decision-making in other fields that are relevant to human health and wellbeing, including the fields of public health, social welfare, agriculture, international development, crime, education and many others. Interventions are often complex and study designs and populations in the review are often varied, and researchers may be discouraged from conducting a meta-analysis. It has been argued, however, that meta-analysis is under-used. What factors drive the decision to conduct a meta-analysis, and what factors should be considered?\n\nThere is currently a lack of clear guidance for making a decision about whether to conduct a meta-analysis or not, which can be a particularly difficult decision when synthesising complex interventions. Current guidance tends to focus on statistical heterogeneity, although there are doubts as to whether this is always a critical concern (especially if there is conceptual homogeneity and the statistical variance can be modelled), and there are arguably many other concerns (statistical, substantive, and resource-related) that could or should be considered. The lack of guidance on this point may mean that opportunities for appropriate meta-analyses are being missed, while meta-analyses are sometimes inappropriately conducted. This then raises the concern: does it matter if the 'wrong' decision is made about whether to conduct a meta-analysis or not, either in relation to the findings of different synthesis techniques or the perceived credibility/utility of different synthesis outputs? \n\nThis project aims to explore factors in the decision to conduct a meta-analysis; to compare existing guidance in health-related fields and beyond to see what can be learned; and to compare the perceived utility of different approaches to evidence synthesis by reviewer users (policymakers and practitioners) in a new trial. This will investigate the impact of meta-analytic and narrative synthesis approaches on health-related decision-making. Overall, the findings of this project will be used to develop new guidance on the meta-analysis of complex interventions. The findings will be widely disseminated with the help of experts from other disciplines, to ensure that it is of value to those conducting systematic reviews in public health, as well as in other fields where the outcomes include human health and wellbeing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K024167/1","grantId":"MR/K024167/1","fundValue":"333789","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Patrick Petticrew","coPersons":["Alison Jane O'Mara-Eves","James  Thomas"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
