{"id":"0ADFA9DF-CFC6-41BA-B2D2-0907344B37B8","title":"CLOVER - Post cancellation close-out activities","abstractText":"The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a radiation emitted in the very early Universe. It tells us that the Universe has a beginning in Time. Measurements to date of the intensity of the CMB are consistent with the inflationary theory of the origin of the Universe, however there is much still to learn. Structures - galaxies, clusters and super-clusters of galaxies - that we see in the sky are generated by primordial quantum fluctuations of spacetime during an exponential expansion phase during the first fraction of a second of the existence of the Universe. These primordial quantum fluctuations are the source of a background of gravitational waves, which in turn generates a signature on the polarisation of the CMB, known as B-modes. CLOVER, a now cancelled UK-led experiment, intended to measure the spectrum of this B-mode signature. To achieve this high-sensitivity, new world-class technologies have been developed in the UK. This follow-up project will complete the integration and testing of these core technologies and ensure that all aspects are secure and documented for any future use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004378/1","grantId":"ST/H004378/1","fundValue":"39600","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Ade","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
