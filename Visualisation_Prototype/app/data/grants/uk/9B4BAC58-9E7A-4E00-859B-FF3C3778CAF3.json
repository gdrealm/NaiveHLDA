It is an 8 day festival held annually during early August at different locations within Wales, Denbigh in 2013 and Llanelli in 2014. The National Eisteddfod will be held in Meifod in 2015 which is located in Montgomeryshire, Mid Wales. Total attendance at each festival usually exceeds 160,000. The site includes a main pavilion of capacity 3,500, with approximately 10 smaller satellite pavilions, including the Science &amp; Technology pavilion, all surrounded by some 300 commercial and other stands. At each of the 2012, 2013 and 2014 Eisteddfodau, the total space allocated to Science was: pavilion and other buildings (600sqm) and external exhibitions (400 sqm). Attendance at the Science Exhibition has consistently been in excess of 20,000 over 8 days for each of the past 3 years.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Eisteddfod Science and Technology programme are to:\n1. Promote the Public Understanding of Science - To provide innovative opportunities for visitors to become better informed about various aspects of Science and Technology (STEM) subjects.\n2. To provide STFC facilities and Welsh &quot;science-producing&quot; bodies such as Universities with an opportunity to showcase their achievements locally, regionally and globally.\n3. Create interest and excitement in STEM subjects leading to improved attainment in Science KS3, KS4 and KS5 and to motivate students.\n4. To stimulate young people to consider careers in STEM subjects.\n\nAims of this project \n1. To promote and raise interest and excitement in STEM through the medium of Welsh and English\n2. Inspire young people (11-16) to take up opportunities in STEM subjects and to consider a career in Physics\n3. To engage the public with the Science and Technology at Diamond Light Source, raising awareness of the exciting discoveries and its impact on society. \n4. Through this project engage the public with the International Year of Light 2015\n5. To provide a stage for Diamond Light Source staff and users of the facility to communicate their research to a wide ranging audience; specialist, children and the general public\n6. To provide an additional major outlet for STFC S + S funded programmes (&quot;X-Appeal - Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2014&quot;)\n7. To make science accessible to pupils in underprivileged and remote areas in Wales\n8. Indirectly and in the long term increase the take up in STEM subjects at A level and University (the proportion of students in Wales taking up STEM at A level is significantly lower than the rest of the UK)\n9. To support the Welsh Government's 'Science for Wales' strategy by raising aspirations and attainment in Science and to contribute nationally to an improvement in PISA results where currently Wales have fallen significantly behind England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M006905/1","grantId":"ST/M006905/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2015-01-12","fundEnd":"2015-10-11","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robyn  Wheldon-Williams","coPersons":["Andy  Evans","Alun  Ashton"],"organisation":"National Eisteddfod of Wales","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
