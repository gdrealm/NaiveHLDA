They affect the wellbeing and productivity of livestock and thus present a large economic cost to society. Although worm infections can be cleared with drugs, animals become reinfected and many drugs are losing their effectiveness as worms develop drug resistance. Further there are consumer concerns over drug residues in meat. Thus a vaccine to protect animals from infection would be beneficial in terms of both animal welfare and the economy of the livestock industry. For most intestinal worms, we know the type of response required to control infection. Further, mechanisms are beginning to emerge relating to how the body rids itself of infection. Much of this knowledge has come from laboratory models such as whipworm infection in the mouse. Using this model we have identified an unusual family of proteins called angiogenins known to be important in defence against bacteria and which we think are also anti-parasitic. Thus these proteins are only expressed at high levels in mice able to clear the infection; mice unable to rid themselves of worms do not make these proteins. We will explore these molecules in terms of their basic biology and role in defence against worms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012647/1","grantId":"BB/E012647/1","fundValue":"382880","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our publications have been cited by others working in the field.\nWe have sent our anti-angiogenin 4 polyclonal antibody to other interested researchers on request.

We identified the goblet cell as the cellular source of the anti-microbial protein angiogenin 4 in the murine large intestine.\n\n\n\n2.We demonstrated a clear, significant correlation of angiogenin 4 production (gene expression and protein) with resistance to infection with gastro intestinal helminths and gained an understanding of how angiogenin 4 is regulated in vivo: up-regulation of angiogenin 4 is independent of IL-4 and TLR4 and dependent on IL-13.\n\n\n\n3.We made an anti-mouse angiogenin 4 polyclonal antibody and developed its use in Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and ELISA for quantifying angiogenin 4 production. This enabled our work to be translated into other research areas locally and abroad. (Dr Alan Pemberton - demonstrating the expression of angiogenin 4 in the small intestine post-Trichinella spiralis infection; Dr Matt Hepworth, Humboldt University of Berlin, - demonstrating the expression of angiogenin 4 in the small intestine post-Heligmosomoides bakeri infection) we made an anti-angiogenin 4 polyclonal antibody which is available for others to use Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
