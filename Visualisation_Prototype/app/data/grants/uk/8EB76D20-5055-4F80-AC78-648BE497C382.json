For the ombudsman system to maximise its purpose of helping citizens to resolve grievances with government (public sector ombudsmen) or business (private sector ombudsmen), a better understanding of its users levels of engagement and trust is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a closer look at what people expect from an ombudsman procedure, and testing this empirically through the lens of procedural justice theory, the differences and similarities of various national settings and types of grievances will be examined. This research project will compare levels of perceived procedural fairness and trust in ombudsman systems in France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research method is made up of a mixture of collecting qualitative and quantitative data (secondary data collection, focus groups, surveys and semi-structured interviews) in a cross country and cross sector comparison.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00820X/1","grantId":"ES/K00820X/1","fundValue":"175402","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  It is too early to report on findings, what I can report however is that most ombudsmen who are part of my project (UK, Germany and France) will keep the survey - I designed for my research - as their regular customer satisfaction survey, replacing the one they send out (UK). in Germany there is no tradition of surveys so they will adopt mine as the first regular survey.

It is too early to determine all of the ways people will take on the research. However there has been a big uptake of the survey I designed in the 14 ombudsman schemes and most of them will implement it as their customer satisfaction survey in the future.
