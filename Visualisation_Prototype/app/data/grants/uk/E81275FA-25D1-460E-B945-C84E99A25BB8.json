Cosmic rays make an excellent introduction into particle physics and astronomy: particle production in the upper atmosphere and the investigation of their source. The discussion can then be widened to other sources of radiation, to neutrinos and to gravitational waves.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005255/1","grantId":"ST/L005255/1","fundValue":"4230","fundStart":"2014-03-11","fundEnd":"2016-03-10","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"John Allan Wilson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
