There is presently no well-founded theoretical approach able to predict this important property in such cases where the molecules differ greatly in size. In this project, we will develop a new kinetic theory for the viscosity of an important class of model fluids: mixtures comprising chains of hard spherical segments. Next, we will develop a methodology whereby this new theory can be used to predict the viscosity of a real fluid mixture provided that the viscosities of the constituent pure fluids are known. In parallel with this, we will make measurements of the viscosity of refrigerant-lubricant mixtures against which to validate the new methodology.The theoretical aspects of this project are ambitious and will result in significant advances in what is a difficult field. The results will have applications not only in refrigeration technology, as highlighted in the proposal, but far beyond and they will reduce the present reliance upon empirical models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E007031/1","grantId":"EP/E007031/1","fundValue":"332076","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2010-01-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Velisa  Vesovic","coPersons":["John Paul Martin  Trusler","George  Jackson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
