{"id":"ECE6122A-4D1D-446F-99F6-0C224CE6C0F9","title":"Quantitative analysis of the teacher labour market in England","abstractText":"<p>Dr Allen will investigate how the early experiences of teachers in training placement schools and first posts affects their subsequent likelihood to move into particular types of schools or exit the profession altogether. Understanding how to create a schooling environment that retains the best teachers within the state maintained system is critical because we know that relatively large numbers of high quality teachers leave the profession every year and this turnover is damaging to pupil achievement.</p>\n\n<p>There is an opportunity to make real progress on this question with the School Workforce Census that links teachers to the institutional, pupil and colleague characteristics within their school. This new administrative dataset&nbsp; will&nbsp; be complemented by collecting primary data from institutional records and surveys that track cohorts of teachers from their teacher-training placement experiences through into their early career.</p>\n\n<p>A key goal of this research is to use these methods to make causal claims about the effects of particular school experiences on teacher retention.These novel statistical approaches exploit elements of random assignment of trainee teachers to schools, and also make full use of the longitudinal nature of the data to analyse changes in experiences over time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001272/1","grantId":"ES/K001272/1","fundValue":"169282","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Allen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
