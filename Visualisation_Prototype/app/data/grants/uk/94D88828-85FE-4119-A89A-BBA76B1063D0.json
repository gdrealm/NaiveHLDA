For every ten degrees increase in temperature, it occurs about 2 and a half times faster. We are respiring organisms but we don't notice this because our body temperatures are regulated, but cold-blooded creatures do, and so too do the most important respirers of all in terms of global processes - the bacteria and other microbes. This is why we put food in the fridge, and why a tropical swamp is a much more biologically active place than a temperate bog. Recently there has been a dawning realization among Earth System scientists that this marked temperature-dependency of microbial metabolism must be taken into account if we are to understand some of the big global feedbacks involved in climate change, and hence we should incorporate it into Earth System computer models.\n\nOne important process that helps regulate the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere occurs in the ocean, and is called the 'biological pump'. Algae photosynthesize in the photic zone at the surface, forming the base of the food chain. Most of this organic matter gets eaten up and respired in the surface layer and the CO2 is returned to the atmosphere, but a substantial proportion sinks to deeper water. Most of it does, eventually, also get broken down by bacteria, but here the CO2 released is isolated from the surface. Some of the organic matter can reach the sea floor where it can be incorporated into sediments, forming the hydrocarbon source rocks of the future. The rain of organic matter sinking to the deep sea and sediments produces a compensatory 'pump' of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean. \n\nNow imagine we turn up the temperature in the water column as a result of climate change. This is good news for the bacteria which use up the sinking organic matter more efficiently. Less carbon gets removed from the surface ocean hence CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere until a new balance is restored. Because CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming when it is in the atmosphere, this process could theoretically accentuate the warming process, or work the other way round on a cooling planet. \n\nIt is important that we understand how important this feedback is in the real world, and what knock-on effects it may have in other parts of the Earth System. We have devised a way of studying it in the Earth's past, using fossil sediments from the sea floor. We plan to take a series of sediment samples spanning the last 15 million years across the oceans to investigate the efficiency of the biological pump. The planet has cooled markedly over this period so we predict major changes to the functioning of ocean ecosystems and the biological pump. We will study the chemical composition of fossil shells of foraminifera (microscopic protists that occur in large numbers) that lived distributed through the water column. By using a combination of geochemical techniques we can establish the temperature profile, pH profile, and strength of the biological pump.\n\nTo explore the data we will use a specially modified version of a state-of-the-art Earth System Model that will take into account temperature-dependency of metabolic processes. We will then use the model to investigate its impact on a range of globally important factors such as patterns of organic carbon burial and atmospheric carbon dioxide, and investigate how important these factors are for future climate change.\n\nWe predict that global cooling over the last 15 million years has produced improved oxygenation and food supply in deep planktonic niches (the so-called 'twilight zone' of the ocean) and that this would have spurred evolutionary innovation at depth. We will test this idea by studying plankton abundance patterns at depth in time and space and investigating whether there has been enhanced evolution in this environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N002598/1","grantId":"NE/N002598/1","fundValue":"127504","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Bridget  Wade","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
