They are the ?powerstations? of the cell since they are responsible for generating most of the cellular ?energy? in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is done in a series of enzymatic reactions known as the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation system. Defects of the human mitochondrial respiratory chain are responsible for a significant burden of disease, particularly in childhood. The clinical signs of these disorders are extremely varied since they can affect any organ system of the body, particularly the brain, muscle, heart, kidney, liver and gut. In very few children with mitochondrial disease can the genetic cause for their disease be identified.\n\nStudies in yeast have indicated that more than 100 genes are involved in the manufacture and assembly of a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain. Defects in the human equivalents of all these yeast genes, together with defects in other as yet undiscovered genes, may be responsible for mitochondrial respiratory chain disease in childhood.\n\nBecause of this complexity traditional techniques cannot be used to map and isolate the genes responsible for human mitochondrial respiratory chain disease. New strategies need to be employed to identify these genes. We propose to use a technique known as microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. In this technique individual chromosomes from healthy donor cells (with normal mitochondrial respiratory chain function) are tagged and then transferred, by cell fusion, to patient cell lines with deficient activity of cytochrome oxidase (COX), one component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The fused cells are called hybrids and these hybrids are analysed to see if they still have COX deficiency. Hybrids with COX activity that has been restored must have received a normal copy of the gene responsible for the COX deficiency during the chromosome transfer process. It can be inferred that the chromosome that has been transferred contains this gene, and more detailed genetic mapping techniques will then be used to identify this gene.\n\nIdentification of new disease-causing genes is the first step in improving our understanding of mitochondrial disease in childhood. The next step is to find out how these genes work, and in so doing we hope to discover new treatments for children with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200335","grantId":"G0200335","fundValue":"191512","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Shamima  Rahman","coPersons":["Michael  Hanna","Simon  Heales","James Vivian Leonard"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
