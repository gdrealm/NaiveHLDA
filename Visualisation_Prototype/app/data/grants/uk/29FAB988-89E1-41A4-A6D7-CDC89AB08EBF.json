However, damage to our DNA by ionising radiation from the environment is a constant daily occurrence and DNA damage accumulation is thought to be involved in the development of ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To combat this, our cells usually contain efficient DNA repair mechanisms that act to prevent the development of these human diseases. Conversely radiotherapy, in the form of ionising radiation, is also still the most effective treatment for killing cancer cells, although it's effectiveness is variable in different cancers and side effects can be common. Despite this knowledge, complete information on how our cells repair DNA damage induced by ionising radiation in our chromosomes is still unclear and is the focus of the proposed research. This proposal is therefore essential for our understanding of the basic biological mechanisms our cells use to prevent DNA damage accumulation caused by ionising radiation, and thus act to stop the formation of human diseases. Furthermore, this proposal aims to provide leads to the development of new strategies in combination with radiotherapy, for the effective treatment of cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M000354/1","grantId":"MR/M000354/1","fundValue":"356564","fundStart":"2014-11-03","fundEnd":"2017-11-02","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jason Luke  Parsons","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
