{"id":"11CC2C93-1FDB-4A50-BF70-0643B8C6874D","title":"Novel Media For Terabyte Holographic Data Storage","abstractText":"The importance, motivation and stimulus of this multi-disciplinary (chemical synthesis, liquid crystal and polymer science, optical technology and information storage) and international (UK, Japan, Denmark and USA) materials-related feasibility research proposal is to address the urgent global consumer requirement for an ever-increasing demand for higher data storage capacity. Current technologies such as conventional magneto-optical are fast becoming economically unviable and will soon reach their physical limitations of storage capacity. Hence new solutions are required to address this multi-billion dollar problem. Optical holographic storage is a critical next-generation technology that can support the growing information storage needs of the 21st century. Novel holographic read/write media are required. Our solution encompasses technology transfer between academia and industry via the synthesis, characterisation (chemical and optical) and industrial global evaluation of strategic organic materials as a source of novel highcapacity holographic read/write storage media. The materials are organic-based polyesters comprising both side-chain mesogenic and side-chain heterocyclic photoresponsive groups. The synthetic chemistry is versatile and readily amenable to large-scale production. The media will be industrially tested for 'end-user' commercial applications providing the project with focus, application and realism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C542223/1","grantId":"EP/C542223/1","fundValue":"63138","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Avtar  Matharu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
