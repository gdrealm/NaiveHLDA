{"id":"E04CD318-F88D-446D-82DA-E60379C78279","title":"Physics of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures","abstractText":"At the foundation of electronics lies the observation that energies of electrons travelling in materials with regular, periodic arrangement of atoms are quantized and restricted to electronic bands. This way, depending on the arrangement of those bands and experimental conditions, some materials conduct and some are insulating. At the same time, we know that another quantizing restriction on the energy of a travelling charged particle can be imposed with magnetic field. Very interesting physics has been predicted for the situation in which those two effects compete with similar strength and the formation of bands interplays with that of magnetic levels, leading to a self-repetitive pattern bearing likeness to self-similar patterns on leaves or those formed by snowflakes. Unfortunately, such electronic band structure patterns remained elusive due to the conditions on the periodicity of the system and magnetic field that need to be fulfilled simultaneously. Recently, it has been shown that the electronic band structure in sandwiches made of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, two atomically thin materials, becomes such a self-similar pattern. This is because, apart from regular arrangement of atoms within each of the materials, another periodicity known as moir&eacute; arises due to complicated overlay between the two atomic layers and can be probed thanks to the outstanding quality of those materials. In this project, I will investigate the electronic properties of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride systems in order to understand the interplay between periodicity and magnetic field quantizations in those structures. I will explore theoretically the result of manipulating the latter by rearranging the layers with respect to each other and suggest what experimental tools give the fullest knowledge of the physics at play. Finally, I will model the self-similar electronic band structure formed in external magnetic field and explore the fascinating physics it is describing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L013010/1","grantId":"EP/L013010/1","fundValue":"63321","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marcin  Mucha-Kruczynski","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":" We have described the fractal magnetic miniband spectra of the monolayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure.

Our findings contribute to the understanding of the physics of the graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures, which are currently one of the candidates for application in graphene electronics. By developing theoretical models to describe these heterostructures we provide a framework for scientists and engineers to use when designing their experiments/devices. In fact, our work has already been used to help explain experiments performed at the University of Manchester and University of California at Berkeley. Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
