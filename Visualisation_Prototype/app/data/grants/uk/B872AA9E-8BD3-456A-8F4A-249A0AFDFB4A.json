{"id":"B872AA9E-8BD3-456A-8F4A-249A0AFDFB4A","title":"n-ary Inductive Logic","abstractText":"Imagine you didn't know anything about chemistry and you went into a lab and started adding a first chemical to a test tube containing a second chemical. Sometimes there's a reaction, sometimes not. Suppose you noticethat if the first chemical is A then there is usually a reaction and similarly if the second chemical is B. In that case you would surely give a higher than evens probability that if you added A to B (an as yet untried experiment) you would get an reaction. This is an example of binary induction. You are giving a qualified prediction that a relation holds between A and B on the basis of some finitely many previous instances of that relation. The question is Why is it rational to draw that conclusion, what factors influence it? Philosophical Logic has widely considered this question, under the title `Inductive Logic', but only for unary relations. Despite the ease with which we commonly seem to draw such conclusions in the higher arity case almost no research has been carried out on these questions in that case. The purpose of this proposal is to continue our current work on addressing that lacuna, to the benefit of the Inductive Logic community and more widely to those intent on capturing and implementing patterns of everyday common sense reasoning on computers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033756/1","grantId":"EP/D033756/1","fundValue":"164356","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeff  Paris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
