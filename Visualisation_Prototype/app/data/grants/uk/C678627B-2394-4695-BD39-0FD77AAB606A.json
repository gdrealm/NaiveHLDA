{"id":"C678627B-2394-4695-BD39-0FD77AAB606A","title":"Linking environmental fate and behaviour studies with the toxicology and epidemiology of organic pollutants","abstractText":"Dr Thomas will spend 6 months as a 'discipline-hop' period working at the Institute of Risk Analysis Science (IRAS) at Utrecht University (Netherlands). During that time Dr Thomas will use in vitro tests to investigate the neurotoxicological effects of organophosphorus, carbamate and organochlorine pesticides singly and in mixtures. Whilst performing the research project will allow Dr Thomas to gain detailed experience and understanding of the technical and experimental aspects of a particular toxicological question, Dr Thomas will also spend time studying other areas of toxicology, and epidemiology, with the guidance of the IRAS staff. He will thereby gain an understanding of a broad spectrum of theoretical and practical aspects of toxicology and epidemiology by being located in a leading toxicological and epidemiological research institute. This will allow him to design future exposure and bioavailability studies to better inform toxicology, epidemiology and human risk assessment, and allow him the opportunity to develop ideas and relationships for future collaborative work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E007732/1","grantId":"NE/E007732/1","fundValue":"46112","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Owen Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
