These stem cells are equipotent and their descendants can replace each other. The developed models and the fitted parameters inform on how stem cells work under homeostasis. Variation of these parameters may be indicators of illness.\nPredictions on stem cell proliferation may be applied to estimate time for recovery after injuries or from side effects of some therapies.
