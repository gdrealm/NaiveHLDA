Development Workers as Mobile Professionals","abstractText":"<p>The profession of the overseas aid worker has long had considerable resonance in the public imagination. It evokes, on the one hand, images of selfless individuals who work for the benefit of the poor in third-world countries. On the other hand, it is associated with lavish spending of overseas aid, which rarely seems to reach those it was destined for. </p>\n\n<p>Aid workers are thus situated in an ambivalent professional and personal context. In spite of the relevance of these issues in a globalising, consistently unequal world, few attempts have been made to systematically investigate the profession of overseas development workers; instead, most academic attention has been focused on aid institutions, policies and third-world beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p>This research project aims to redress this. It will pursue a distinctly ethnographic approach, and place aid workers as social actors, mobile professionals and moral beings at the centre of inquiry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to take into account their high mobility, the research will investigate aid workers in one particular country, Cambodia, as well as those currently residing in the UK who have been involved in the Cambodian development sector in the past. </p>\n\n<p>The broader rationale is that studying aid workers will provide a novel, more nuanced understanding of development processes on a larger scale.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3481","grantId":"RES-000-22-3481","fundValue":"80212","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne-Meike  Fechter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
