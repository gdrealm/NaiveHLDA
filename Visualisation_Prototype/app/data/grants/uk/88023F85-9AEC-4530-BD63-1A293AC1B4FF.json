{"id":"88023F85-9AEC-4530-BD63-1A293AC1B4FF","title":"SUPERSOLAR Solar Energy Hub","abstractText":"The market for photovoltaic (PV) solar modules is experiencing astonishing growth due to increasing energy demand, security of supply issues, increasing cost of fossil fuels and concerns over global warming. The world market for photovoltaics grew by 139% to 21GW in 2010. Although this extraordinary pace of growth is unlikely to be maintained in the short term it will advance rapidly again at the point where grid parity is achieved. It is important that the UK retains a strong research presence in this important technology. It is proposed that the SUPERSOLAR Hub of Universities be set up to co-ordinate research activities, establish a network of academic and industrial researchers, conduct cross-technology research and provide a focus for international co-operation. \n\nSUPERSOLAR is led by CREST at Loughborough University and supported by the Universities of Bath, Liverpool, Oxford, Sheffield and Southampton. This group is active in all of the PV technologies including new materials, thin film chalcopyrite, c-Si, thin film a-Si, dye sensitised solar cells, organic PV, concentrator PV, PV systems performance and testing. SUPERSOLAR will set up a solar cell efficiency measurement facility for the benefit of the PV community in the UK. The consortium contains a deliberate balance of expertise, with no bias towards any one technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017361/1","grantId":"EP/J017361/1","fundValue":"4088360","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The primary objective of the SUPERGEN SuperSolar Hub is to establish a co-ordinated network for the PV research community in the UK. The network boasts 438 members and 50 associate members from 29 institutions.

This has been achieved remarkably quickly and there is scope for further rapid improvement. \n\nPerovskite-based PV has exciting commercial potential and Oxford have developed important IP which is licensed to Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd (OPV). OPV)is well positioned to exploit the technology. \n\nOPV's business model is to prove the technology and then license the processes to volume manufacturers (especially glass companies).\n\nUNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL \nA cheap salt used in tofu making has been used to replace a toxic expensive chemical used for decades in thin film solar cell manufacture. \n\nThe chemical it replaces is water/skin soluble, toxic and carcinogenic. Magnesium chloride is edible and is used in bath salts. It is about 50 times cheaper than the cadmium chloride that it replaces. \n\nThe paper was published in 'Nature' and the press story went global. In the UK it was featured in the BBC TV News, BBC R4 'Inside Science' and the front page/editorial of The Independent. There were &amp;amp;gt; 100 media reports worldwide.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD\nThe use of spray-coating techniques to fabricate perovskite photovoltaics\n\nUNIVERSITY OF BATH\nThe state-of-the-art in materials simulation has been used to provide atomistic insights into the operation mechanism of hybrid perovskites solar cells and the role of microstructure in thin-film CdTe solar cells. The work led by Prof Aron Walsh has involved collaborations across the solar energy hub, leading to high impact publications and scientific talks, and a follow-on EPSRC responsive mode grant.\n\nLOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY\nThe development of broadband anti-reflection (AR) coatings for solar modules OXFORD UNIVERSITY\nThe technology could open up a new market for power producing semi-transparent windows.\n\nTandem perovskite/crystalline silicon cells could provide more efficient modules for large scale in utility scale deployments.\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL \nThe process promises cost reductions in PV manufacturing, not only from reduced materials costs, but from reduced plant and infrastructure required for health and safety. CdTe is the biggest thin film technology worldwide and this is a very significant breakthrough.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD\nThis is an enabling technology that would allow such devices to be fabricated over large areas. Device efficiency achieved currently using this scalable technique is 11.1% This is similar to that achieved using non-scaleable 'small-scale' lab fabrication processes\n\nUNIVERSITY OF BATH\nThe research demonstrates the predictive nature of materials modelling where: (i) a ferroelectric effect was predicted for the hybrid halide perovskites, and subsequently observed experimentally; (ii) the role of stacking faults in electron-hole recombination in CdTe was confirmed, which matched high-resolution microscopy. The work has direct impact on developments in computational science, applications in a range of photovoltaic technologies, and will be extended to screen new low-cost high-efficiency combinations of materials\n\nLOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY\nBroadband AR coatings have been designed and tested for thin film (CdTe, CIGS, CZTS, a-Si, and Perovskite) as well as for organic PV, DSSC and c-Si cover glass. These AR coatings increase the photocurrent and efficiency for all devices by ~4%. \n\nBeneficiaries: All PV manufacturers. First Solar Inc and G24 are currently evaluating the coatings.\n\nGlass manufacturers: Additional revenue from 'added value' of the high performance AR coating.
