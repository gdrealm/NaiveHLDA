It aims to re-imagine cinema as a tool for collective community communication, creativity and engagement. Inspired by the crowdsourced film Life in a Day(2011), Lifemirror will create a framework in which initiated projects will document themselves through the growing number of users with cameras. This power to build, frame and contribute to other people's stories lies at the heart of Lifemirror and provides the framework for deep analysis of collective storytelling, mass creativity and cinematic systems development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K037544/1","grantId":"EP/K037544/1","fundValue":"10081","fundStart":"2013-04-10","fundEnd":"2014-10-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon  Blair","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
