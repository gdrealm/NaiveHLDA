One obvious solution is to reduce meat and milk consumption but this is unlikely to be acceptable to everyone. Moreover, grass-fed animals can provide other benefits than food, such as managing biodiversity. The UK has a good climate for producing grass and many of the upland regions of the UK cannot be used for cultivating anything other than grass. Grazing animals therefore provide the backbone of many rural communities.</p>\n\n<p>A range of different animal breeding technologies (including but not limited to genetic modification) could be used to mitigate the global warming impact of farm livestock, but adoption of these may be limited by willingness of farmers to purchase these replacement breeding animals. The aim of this project is to: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>understand how farmers reach decisions on where to source replacement breeding animals;</li>\n\n <li>understand how the whole system of producing replacement breeding animals impacts on the decisions made by farmers; </li>\n\n <li>evaluate what changes could be made to encourage the uptake of animals bred for reduced global warming impact.<br /></li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H008756/1","grantId":"ES/H008756/1","fundValue":"77699","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ann  Bruce","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
