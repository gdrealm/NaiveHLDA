Over the past 50 or so years we have seen that genetics research, including molecular and statistical developments, has been applied by many operational plant and livestock breeding programmes. The availability of reference sequences for many species has resulted in the discovery of very many thousands (and higher) of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to the on-going development of low-cost SNP arrays and being used around the globe in many livestock species - genomic selection. Through research and industry (nationally and internationally) the UK dairy industry implemented genomic selection for industry traits (milk production, fertility, longevity) in April 2012 using a pooled collaborative SNP genotype file (predominately bulls, now over 100,000 individuals). This will lead to an expected increase in the annual rate of genetic improvement of approximately 30-50%. \n\nThe next horizon for research and its translation into genetic improvement tools is the inclusion of sequence data alongside the tools that the industry have already invested in. These developments provide exciting opportunities for the research community to explore the more readily available and vast amounts of genomic data to create new knowledge and drive innovation in the field, as we have seen historically in plant and livestock genetic research. Because the UK dairy industry and research sectors are collectively likely to invest heavily in sequence information in the coming years, a collaborative strategy to generate, store and process sequence information efficiently is needed to enable its effective used in animal breeding research and for use in next generation genetic improvement tools. The rate of change we are now experiencing in ready availability of genomic and sequence information means there a real need to take a community based approach to utilising these data, including the involvement of the end user as well as basic research. In the case of this proposal, the end-user focus is the animal breeding industry as well as the biosciences research community.\n\nA DNA sequence captures the complete genome of an individual. If available for sufficient individuals, it will provide a range of benefits 1) greater livestock improvement through more accurate and more persistent genomic selection, 2) the identification of targets for genome editing, 3) detection and breeding management of rare variants, including recent mutations, and 4) greater biological knowledge. More powerful biological discovery will be enabled because the causal nucleotides are contained within the sequence, unlike the case of markers such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).\n\nIts exploitation in animal breeding programmes is expected to create a paradigm shift that will greatly enhance the production of food from farmed livestock through both increased output and reduced wastage. However, it is expensive to collect sequence data at the high read rates (essentially accuracy) needed generally for research and this has led to small islands of sequence data at research institutes. Commercial breeding companies are beginning to assimilate some sequence data but this is usually IP protected. Some have large genotype datasets that can be imputed to full sequence level. The aim of this project is to develop the methodology(s) to optimise the distribution of sequencing effort across, and in key populations within, the UK dairy cattle population. The hypothesis that will be studied is that the inclusion of optimal sequence data will improve the results for genome wide association studies for novel traits and genomic selection in the wider UK dairy cattle population compared to widespread SNP chips alone.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M009254/1","grantId":"BB/M009254/1","fundValue":"341732","fundStart":"2015-06-16","fundEnd":"2018-06-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Micheal Hickey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
