However, when faces are unfamiliar, recognition from different pictures can be challenging. A change in pose or illumination, for example, can impair recognition. This study will focus on how people learn to recognise faces across pose and illumination variations. Although prior research has demonstrated detrimental effects of these variations on unfamiliar face recognition, the relationship between learning of the two types of image variation remains unknown. The hypothesis in this study is that people can learn to handle pose or illumination changes once they have seen a small number of representative variations of that type. However, generalisation will be largely limited to the trained type, thus learning to recognise a face in a new pose does little help to recognising the same face in a new illumination. This hypothesis will be tested through a series of experiments, where training of unfamiliar faces in one type of variation will be tested in new pictures that either involve a variation of the same type as the trained or of a different type. The results will help to determine whether the brain deals with the two types of variation separately.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D002494/1","grantId":"ES/D002494/1","fundValue":"74156","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chang Hong  Liu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
