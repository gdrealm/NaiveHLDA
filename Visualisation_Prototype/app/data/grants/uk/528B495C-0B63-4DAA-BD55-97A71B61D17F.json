The goal here is to make simple metal and metal oxide nanoparticles that will be coated with biological molecules. These bio-molecules will specifically bind to residues in forensic evidence which will prove the presence or absence of illicit substances. The work programme combines end-user partners who will provide project focus in law enforcement and security fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005850/1","grantId":"EP/G005850/1","fundValue":"100047","fundStart":"2009-04-03","fundEnd":"2010-10-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The data from this research grant directly influenced the success of my spin-out company, Intelligent Fingerprinting Ltd. Seedcorn funding (?250K) from Iceni LLP was awarded in 2009. To date, the company has received &gt;$10 million USD in investment. The company has 14 employees, working in dedicated office and laboratories in the Norwich Research Park Innovation Centre. The focus of the company is on the detection of drugs and drug metabolites in fingerprints. The company's first products will be available in 2015.
