This project proposes to set up an interdisciplinary, expandable and sustainable network of leading UK SUPERGEN and Chinese institutions to work together in the area of energy research in order to (1) promote coordinated SUPERGEN cross-consortia interaction and collaboration with leading Chinese institutions and to bridge the energy industry in the UK and China; (2)establish the SUPERGEN brand and its influence in China as the representative of the advanced technology and UK's policy of clean energy. The network will commence the operation with the participation of key players from all the UK SUPERGEN consortia who have confirmed their support and membership and the prominent professors in the top 7 Chinese universities in electric power engineering with whom the PI and CI have established academic links. The project will be managed by the PI and CI for the evolution and expansion of the proposed network by identifying and inviting more collaborators both in the UK and China to join the network with the taskforce groups formed in the identified key priority areas and the UK-China joint projects developed. It will run for 24 months to meet its objectives via 4 organised activities (a small group visit to China, a network workshop, exchange of visits and a UK(SUPERGEN)-China Energy Forum) and will bring the proposed network to the stage of self-supporting operation","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E040039/2","grantId":"EP/E040039/2","fundValue":"180939","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Haifeng  Wang","coPersons":["Raj  Aggarwal"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
