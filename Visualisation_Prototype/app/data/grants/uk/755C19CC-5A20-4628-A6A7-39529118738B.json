The novel method of direct printing live cells opens up new paradigm in tissue science and engineering for\ndrug discovery and therapeutic applications. We have pioneered the world first valve based bioprinter that is capable of\nprinting human embryonic stem cells without damaging the cells while maintaining their biological functions. This project\naims to develop the first commercial stem cell bioprinter baed on the valve-based printing technology, working in a\nconsortium led by the global player in robotic control (Renishaw Ltd) and a SME (ClydeBiosciences Ltd) specialised in\ndeveloping human heart muscle cells from stem cells for drug testing. We will develop a new type of stem cell printer by\nintegrating IP protected 3d printing platform from Renishaw with existing valve based cell printing technology. The new\nplatform will then be validated for producing human heart and liver tissues using human stem cells from leading stem cell\ncompany Roslin Cellab Ltd) and testing their responses to drugs. The new tool will not only allow us to produce high quality\nhuman tissue for potentially more reliable animal free drug testing, but also enable a range of high throughput applications\nfor pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and stem cell biologists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506837/1","grantId":"EP/M506837/1","fundValue":"124951","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Will Wenmiao  Shu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
