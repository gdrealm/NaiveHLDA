They enable us to track the arc of social reactions from the crime scene through to the conclusion of the court case, to understand how public opinion and sentiment is shaped and shifts as events unfold.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The work will produce new insights into the social dynamics of collective responses to high profile violent crimes, alongside methodological innovations developing text-mining methods for rigorous social scientific analyses of social media. Using a case study design applying qualitative, quantitative and geo-spatial data analysis techniques, the project will illuminate the signal event, conflict escalation and de-escalation, influence and resilience dynamics that arise in the aftermath of a major crime.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008181/1","grantId":"ES/L008181/1","fundValue":"146100","fundStart":"2014-02-15","fundEnd":"2015-08-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Innes","coPersons":["Alun David Preece","Irena  Spasic"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
