The first of these involves the extraction of natural gas in Sylhet, an area where long standing transnational migration to the U.K means that social networks, and the social protection which they provide for the poor, take on an international dimension. In the second case, national and local resistance movements to the extraction of coal in Dinajpur will be the main focus. Through these studies the project aims to produce groundbreaking research which provides new understanding of the articulation between social networks, rural livelihoods and mining, with a particular focus on the relationship between the global, transnational and local levels. A particular strength will be qualitative depth, since the field sites around which case studies will be based are well known to the researchers. It is will be first study of the social impact of mining in Bangladesh.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />Besides the production of primary data an additional aim of the project is for the findings to contribute to policies and practices of corporate social responsibility currently employed by mining companies in South Asia. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0297","grantId":"RES-167-25-0297","fundValue":"189735","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katy Jane Gardner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
