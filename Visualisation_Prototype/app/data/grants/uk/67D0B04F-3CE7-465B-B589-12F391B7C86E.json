The binding process can be thought of as a 'shape' problem, whereby the strength of binding depends critically on shape complementarity between the ligand and the binding pocket on the protein. However, the binding process is more complicated than this, since it is also determined by the extent of dynamics ('floppiness') of the interacting partners. A valuable technique to measure the contribution of protein dynamics to binding concerns high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation-time measurements. However, the intepretation of such measurements requires some knowledge of the nature of the molecular motions, and in the past it has been common practice to assume a simplified model for these motions. Here, we propose to make use of theoretical molecular dynamics simulations which are restrained by the experimental NMR data. Such simulations will offer a much more realistic picture of the motional processes that take place in the protein before and after ligand binding, and will permit a more accurate quantitation of the dynamic factors that influence the binding process. Such information is of significant importance in the context of structure-based discovery of lead compounds for novel drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E014844/1","grantId":"BB/E014844/1","fundValue":"178548","fundStart":"2007-01-04","fundEnd":"2009-01-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Homans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
