An understanding of the ageing process and appropriate drugs or nutritional supplements to slow the process down may help us be healthier in old age. Spontaneous damage to proteins and DNA accumulates in cells during their life and contributes to the ageing effects. This can probably be resisted by increasing the activity of enzymes that protect proteins and DNA from damage. One such enzyme is glyoxalase I (GLO1). GLO1 protects proteins and DNA directly against damage from reactive sugar-derived molecules and protects indirectly against oxidative damage and impairment of cell respiration. Increasing the amount of GLO1, by overexpression of the gene for GLO1 in experimental conditions, has recently been shown to produce a 40% increase in lifespan of a small worm (nematode) commonly used as an experimental model of ageing. I have recently found that GLO1 can also be increased by compounds absorbed from Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and others. These compounds, isothiocyanates, activate processes that affect the regulation of the GLO1 gene. I think it highly likely that isothiocyanates may slow the ageing process by increasing GLO1 expression / with probably also other effects. To test this, in this project I will use a human cell culture model of ageing. I will test if overexpression of GLO1 achieved by genetic techniques prevents ageing of human cells / measuring the expected decrease in damage to protein and DNA. I will then see and if this can also be achieved by induction of GLO1 gene expression by isothiocyanates. A successful outcome will give the first suggestions that eating your greens may slow the ageing process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D006295/2","grantId":"BB/D006295/2","fundValue":"209002","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The studies were used to build on in a BBSRC Industrial PhD studentship with Unilever where the mechanism of action was discovered.
