{"id":"AC0914D6-3CC9-4A7F-AF54-4D7D6EFF6CB8","title":"Searching for Theatrical Ancestors (STAR)","abstractText":"The National Trust's archive of the Victorian Shakespearean actor Ellen Terry (1847-1928) and her daughter, theatre director, suffragette, lesbian, Edith Craig (1869-1947), has proven to be a rich source of information for theatre historians and researchers, with extensive usage demonstrated internationally. Play programmes and other documents demonstrate that Ellen Terry was involved in numerous theatre productions, especially Shakespeare's plays and she gave lectures about Shakespeare in Britain, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database provides an online database to search this important theatre archive of over 20,000 documents. \n This project, entitled 'Searching for Theatrical Ancestors' (STAR), therefore seeks to facilitate and enhance the use of this online database by family historians interested in the culturally and politically volatile period from the late nineteenth- to the twentieth centuries. Additional data will be provided about Lyceum Theatre productions 1878-1903 and Shakespeare productions, scenes and lectures 1910-21, hitherto only described in the database, by means of digitized and scanned, searchable images of play programmes (including cast lists and adverts). An improved interface will also provide new links to other online data sources such as census records, transatlantic passenger lists, googlemaps.\n The enhancement of the database and its interface will be piloted in a workshop, (drawn from the membership of those who advised on the original AHRC ETEC database) who will contribute their opinions during the pilot stage of the development of the enhancements to the website. The inclusion of representatives from the British Library and the National Trust will reflect the implications of the online database for users who wish to view the archival holdings at these institutions. Principally the selection of material for digitization is informed by the identified need of family history researchers to search on individuals' names. Theatrical tours made visible those individuals involved and their journey may be traced by means of passenger lists as well as play programmes. Therefore, where possible links will be included to other online resources. The project will generate new ways of thinking about family-theatre history, invigorating the use of archival resources and the demonstration of the enhanced resource at the public conference at the British Library during the Shakespeare exhibition in 2016 will ensure that it reaches a wide audience. The schedule of work is timed to ensure that feedback will be used both from the pilot test and the conference at the British Library. The timing of the conference to coincide with 'Shakespeare 400' in 2016 promises to attract the widest audience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003438/1","grantId":"AH/N003438/1","fundValue":"67730","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katharine Mary Cockin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
