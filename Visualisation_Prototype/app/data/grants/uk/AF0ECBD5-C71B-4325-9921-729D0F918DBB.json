{"id":"AF0ECBD5-C71B-4325-9921-729D0F918DBB","title":"Assessing the effects of diagnostic tests on patient outcomes: how reliable, informative and practical are RCTs?","abstractText":"Whether a new diagnostic test causes more good than harm needs to be assessed before it is used. Tests affect the health of patients if they cause harm directly, or if the process of testing reassures or makes patients anxious. However, a test has greatest impact on patient outcomes when test results determine the treatment that patients receive. Using a better test may mean that more patients with the disease receive effective treatment, and fewer patients without the disease are inappropriately treated and unnecessarily put at risk of side effects.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to judge what type of research should be used to measure and compare the consequences of using tests on patient outcomes. Some recommend using randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients randomised to different tests and assessing their outcomes once all subsequent treatments have been carried out. Upto 100 test-plus-treatment RCTs of this form have been performed for various tests and diseases. An alternative approach is to use computer simulation models to link evidence of how accurate the test is with evidence of how well the treatments work. Such models may not work if the process by which clinicians interpret test results and decide on treatment is not well defined, nor if there are direct effects of tests on patient outcomes.\n\nIn this project we will identify published test-plus-treatment RCTs and similar RCTs commissioned by the Department of Health (including ongoing studies), and evaluate how well they are designed, executed and reported. We will consider whether they got enough patients; whether they are potentially biased through, for example losing too many patients; whether they describe the way in which test results are used to decide on treatments; whether the test is still in use when the study finishes; and whether all necessary outcomes were measured in the trials. This will be done both by critically reading the trial report and protocols, and by asking the trialists.\n\nWe will also compare the results of RCTs with those of computer models for all the interventions for which we can find both RCTs and models. Also, we will look in detail at one particular topic for which we have existing computer models and data from several RCTs.\n\nFrom this work we will develop guidelines for choosing and doing research that evaluates the impact of tests on patient outcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600545","grantId":"G0600545","fundValue":"200772","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan James Deeks","coPersons":["Pelham Mervyn Barton","Christopher John HYDE","Brendan  Delaney"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
