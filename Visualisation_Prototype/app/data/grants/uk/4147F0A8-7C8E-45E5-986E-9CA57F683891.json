Impaired development and long-term maintenance of memory T lymphocytes is thought to be a critical reason why infection with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis virus cause disease. Therefore, in order to cure viral diseases, it is essential to acquire a comprehensive understanding of how these memory T cell develop and are maintained so that a new generation of rationale vaccines and adjuvants can be designed. \nWe have undertaken a large scale in vivo genetic approach to understand the development and long term maintenance of CD8 T lymphocytes upon viral infection. This long term program will allow us to develop models affecting various phases of the CD8 T lymphocyte response to virus. By investigating these models, we will be able to better understand how the host responds to viral infections, and hence provide new targets for vaccines and small molecules development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700795","grantId":"G0700795","fundValue":"1087430","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie  Rutschmann","coPersons":["Philip  Ashton-Rickardt"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
