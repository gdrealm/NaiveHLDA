Discovery of new pesticidal products adopts a screening approach with largely empirical optimisation once candidate molecules are identified. This project will investigate a new paradigm in pesticide discovery/optimisation. Therein, the development process will be driven by detailed understanding of the ecology of target species bedded within a modelling framework to identify optimal molecular properties, formulation, timing and placement of the crop protection product.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M005100/1","grantId":"BB/M005100/1","fundValue":"171662","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin David Brown","coPersons":["Roman  Ashauer"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
