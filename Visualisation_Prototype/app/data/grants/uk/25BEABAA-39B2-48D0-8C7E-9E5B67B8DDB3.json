Such guidance is particularly important as the use of PMSCs in multilateral interventions is likely to increase due to reductions in the national armed forces and military budgets of many UN, NATO and EU member states.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021091/1","grantId":"ES/J021091/1","fundValue":"225251","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elke  Krahmann","coPersons":["Anna  Leander"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
