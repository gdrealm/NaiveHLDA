Flat slabs have been widely used in construction in the UK and worldwide due to their low cost and quick construction. Over the last 30 years, the interest on RC structures with high resilience to impulsive loads due to impact and blast has increased significantly to improve protection against the threat of terrorist acts targeting infrastructure or industrial accidents such as gas explosions or vehicle collisions. These extreme events can have catastrophic consequences in terms of human losses, economic losses and environmental impact. Structures that are required to resist high dynamic loads are for example office buildings and parking garages with high levels of threat (e.g. diplomatic buildings or important centres for business and transportation), industrial and storage facilities, nuclear power plants, protective barriers and some bridge piers. Previous research suggests that design against blast loading should be risk-based in which the type, probability and consequences of the event need to be examined against the costs of the protection and the assumed potential loss. The reliability of this type of analysis depends greatly on the accuracy in the estimation of the behaviour of the structure against impact or blast loading. The prediction of the residual strength of RC structures subjected to impulsive loading can be extremely challenging due to strong material nonlinearities and the influence of high strain rates on the behaviour. Shear mechanisms generally govern the response of RC structures subjected to impulsive loads and joint regions are generally critical. Shear failures have been observed experimentally even in members that were designed for static loading to fail in a ductile flexural manner. This is concerning since shear failures are brittle and can lead to progressive collapse of the structure. The dynamic effects on punching shear and progressive collapse are not well understood in RC structures and up to date there is no known physical model to predict the strength and deformation capacity of punching shear under impulsive loading. The principal aim of this project will be to provide a theoretical model for the design and analysis of slab-column connections under impulsive loading which can be used in practice by researchers and designers. Existing experimental data will be used to validate the model and non-linear dynamic FE analysis will be carried out to support the theoretical model.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K008153/1","grantId":"EP/K008153/1","fundValue":"99642","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2014-08-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The developed theoretical model in the project allows quantifying the structural performance of existing and new reinforced concrete infrastructure against impact and blast loading.

The proposed theoretical method is a significant move forward towards understanding and predicting the behaviour of concrete structures under accidental events.\nThe novelty of the proposed approach is that it considers dynamic effects in the material and structural response which until now was only possible by means of complex computer simulations. The proposed formulae can be applied manually for simple cases or aided by computer for complex geometries. The theoretical model was validated using existing experimental data of impact and blast tests of simply supported slabs. It was demonstrated that existing formulas for punching of slab-column connections described in current codes of practice are not suitable for dynamic loading since they were derived for static loading. The proposed theoretical model, which is based on first principles, highlights the main parameters that affect the capacity of the slab-column connections.\n\nThe preliminary findings of the project were presented at the international conference organized by the Federation International du Beton (fib) in Israel in 2013. The work was presented to a large audience which represented different sectors in construction, infrastructure planning and advanced technology development. The work was also presented to collaborators in Arup (London) and EPFL (Switzerland). These presentations gathered interest from researchers and designers at International level. The fundamentals of the theory were published in 2014 in the International Journal of Impact Engineering. This paper has been the most downloaded paper of the year (report in November showed 1,824 views with 90% of downloads from the Public Sector). Two additional papers were written with industrial collaborators to show the application and extension of the model for panels and slabs subjected to close-in detonations.\nImportant research questions opened up towards the end of the project regarding the interaction of the behaviour of the slab-column connection and the alternative load paths that can develop in structures during progressive collapse. In the past, the analysis of progressive collapse of flat slab structures was problematic due to the lack of physical or theoretical models for predicting the behaviour of slab-column connections. This project solved this question which will allow in the future to look at the interaction of different mechanisms; a holistic approach could be developed in the near future considering the different post-failure mechanisms involved, including the dynamic effects investigated in this project. The theoretical model can be used by researchers and practitioners in their designs of critical infrastructure. One potential use of the model is towards writing design guidelines for flat slab construction where there is a current gap of knowledge for accidental loading. Another direct application of the model is towards predicting structural behaviour of slabs and panels under accidental loading.
