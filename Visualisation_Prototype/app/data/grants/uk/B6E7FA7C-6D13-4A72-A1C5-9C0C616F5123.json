{"id":"B6E7FA7C-6D13-4A72-A1C5-9C0C616F5123","title":"Ferroelectric Switching","abstractText":"Ferroelectric materials are used in ceramic, thin film and single crystal form for actuator, sensor and memory applications. Their properties are intrinsically dependent on ferroelectric switching by the movement of domain walls. Despite the importance of ferroelectric switching, there is no complete theory to describe it, and the atomistic nature of the switching process is still unknown. In this work we will develop a rigorous formulism of Rate Theory to describe ferroelectric switching. This will then allow us this to analyse experimental polarisation switching data for ferroelectric ceramics to obtain the activation parameters (volume and enthalpy) for the rate controlling step in the switching process. The proposed research provides a new approach to modelling ferroelectric switching that will, importantly, provide a physical insight into the processes involved. The results of this work can potentially be applied in other fields, including ferroelectric polymers and geology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F038259/1","grantId":"EP/F038259/1","fundValue":"79576","fundStart":"2008-02-25","fundEnd":"2009-03-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has been picked up by others and applied to a rage of different ferroelectrics, including displacive, order-disorder and polymer.

This work presents an original approach to describing the dynamics of FE switching in the commercially important Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 compound. Compared to existing phenomenological approaches, the work provides new physical insights through the determination of activation volume and energy. The ideas developed in this work are now being applied to ferroelectric Metal-Organic-Framework compounds (J. Appl. Phys, 111(2), 024108, 2012) and polymers. The research is being extended to describe the time dependence of polarisation/strain change in ferroelectrics. Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
