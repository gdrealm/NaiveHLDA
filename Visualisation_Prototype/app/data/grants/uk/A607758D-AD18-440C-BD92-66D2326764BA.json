Correlatively, it suggests that human passions, which move individuals to action, be restrained according to the requirement of propriety and sociability. The research illustrates the importance of an historical approach to political thought in outlining the many and varied sources of these ideas, and explores how individual management of the passion came to be seen as crucial to the flourishing of citizens in advanced commercial civilizations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112772/1","grantId":"112772/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"D  Kelly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
