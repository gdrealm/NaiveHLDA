{"id":"DA841DA5-943D-4CE1-ABCF-E517330C4F88","title":"Accessibility &amp; User Needs in Transport for Sustainable Urban Environments - AUNT-SUE","abstractText":"The proposal integrates the expertise of the research centres and project partners in transport policies and planning, design, operations and evaluation. The UK government, European Commission and other agencies rightly emphasise the importance of socially inclusive and sustainable interventions. As yet, however, there is a dearth of comprehensive 'toolkits' and resources to support those who are working to reduce social exclusion in journey environments. The shared vision is to produce rigorous methodologies for sustainable policies and practices that will deliver effective socially inclusive design and operation in transport and the public realm from macro down to micro level. Three Core Projects will develop decision-support tools that will establish benchmarks and incorporate inclusion into policies, and support the design and operation of journey environments and transport facilities. A real-world but controlled 'Testbed' facility will allow these to be piloted in the context of the policy intentions and constraints that shape implementation. Solutions will then be tested and transferred to other Case Study areas and sites. Phase 2 of AUNT-SUE will build on the suite of tools developed in Phase I and apply these to intensive case studies of transport interchanges, nodes and development areas. This will both develop and test techniques to design accessible journey environments (routes and facilities) and transport provision and planning, and consult on these with people who have been identified as socially excluded from travel. Three inter-linked research modules will be validated through integrated case studies outlined below, utilising a GIS-based platform supported by CAD, relational databases and both quantitative and qualitative social surveys.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E040764/1","grantId":"EP/E040764/1","fundValue":"286609","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Research findings used in transport and street accessibility design and planning including in capital funding proposals and assessment.

This was the requisite guidance for all local authorities and others groups in their bids to TfL for accessibility improvement capital funding\n\n• i-Journey and related stresstimator tool tested in TfL's widely-acclaimed online Journey Planner\n\n• AUNT-SUE research findings and tools included in successive Parliamentary annual reports Research and development work relating to assistive technology, 2008-9 and 2007-8, Department of Health Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Transport Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Graeme  Evans","coPersons":["Stephen James  Shaw"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":" see Final Report submitted to EPSRC in 2010.\n\nA key emergent 'inclusion' theme emerging early on in Phase 1 was that of fear of crime and community safety as one of the prime barriers to pedestrian and transport access, amongst older, younger and particular vulnerable groups (e.g. ethnic minorities). Research into accessibility and mobility benchmarks found that official standards (DfT) did not reflect user needs and did not reflect the journey types (e.g. everyday shopping) undertaken particularly by older and less mobile people. The Loughborough team's HADRIAN-SAMMIE CAD-based design model was developed in response to the fact that (product and industrial) design standards effectively designed out a large proportion of the population and specific ability-restricted groups in particular. AUNT-SUE provided the opportunity to widen and test this lab-based design model into the transport and mobility sphere, and to extend this into travel information planning and transport facility design.\n\nA key advance made by AUNT-SUE has been the further development, validation and knowledge transfer of individual research approaches and methods and the development of inter-disciplinary methods across the research teams and integration of research tools and toolkits arising. Key methods and strands included 1. Policy &amp;amp;amp; Benchmarks, 2. Design and Operation and 3. Evaluation of 1 and 2. In accessibility and transport planning, urban design, community and user consultation and engagement. Policy, planning, design and evaluation stages of urban mobility and pedestrian systems. This includes transport and local authorities in London/London boroughs, Herts County Council and regional Passenger Transport Authorities.
