What is it about such experience that leaves people with an unflattering impression? Equally, what is the good practice of which they approve? It is also well-established that attitudes to the police are least favourable amongst the young and ethnic minorities, and also varies with lifestyle. Is this because young people, ethnic minorities and those with particular lifestyles are treated differently by the police, or do these groups have an 'anti-police' bias?</p>\n\n<p>How will the research be conducted?<br /> Focus groups comprising younger and older people from across a range of ethnic minorities and lifestyles will be shown exactly the same video-clips of police-citizen encounters and asked to discuss why they approve or disapprove of the behaviour of the officer(s) depicted. Those discussions will then be analysed in detail.</p>\n\n<p>This will help improve police-public relations by enabling officers to appreciate how others perceive and evaluate their actions.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H000739/1","grantId":"ES/H000739/1","fundValue":"76347","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Anthony James  Waddington","coPersons":["Eleanor  Southern","Kate  Williams","William Henry Newburn"],"organisation":"University of Wolverhampton","findingsText":" We found that when members of the public are invited to respond freely to video-clips of police-public encounters their opinions are far more nuanced and diverse than standardised questionnaires allow. We could find little evidence that demographic groups responded differently in these circumstances. Members of our focus groups overwhelmingly responded to the content of each of the five video--clips they were shown. Our research highlights the need for the police to understand how the public view their exercise of discretion, especially in the use of force. Our methodology can, we believe, be adapted to better inform policy-making and we have tried to engage with police forces to do so. Unfortunately, severe reductions in central government funding has diminished their receptivity to the idea, but we hope that this will be only temporary. Contact with police forces throughout the Midlands region continues and we propose to re-open the question when circumstances are more propitious. Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
