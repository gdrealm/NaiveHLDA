{"id":"C314C006-A070-49CA-881D-BE1DA5D6B228","title":"Social mobility and the middle classes: latent growth models of class careers","abstractText":"<p>It remains an empirical corner stone of social mobility research that social class continues to strongly affect the life chances of people in Britain and other advanced industrial countries. Such continuities have persisted despite the restructuring of employment relations which have been especially marked since the onset of de-industrialisation from the mid 1970s. In the context of these changes, the project aims to revisit the arguments developed by Savage et al. regarding the importance of divisions within the middle classes for a full understanding of the dynamics of social mobility and reproduction. Focusing on the dynamic nature of class careers, the project will examine how class fractions may have specific mobility trajectories which demand a more nuanced account than that which currently exists. This endeavour requires an engagement between economics and sociology, and a methodological focus on occupational class careers.</p> \n<p>The project focuses on class career, understood as a sequence of occupational classes that an individual occupy in the labour market. The analysis will employ recent methods of longitudinal data analysis, eg Markov models, semi-parametric growth models, and latent class growth curve models.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1937","grantId":"RES-000-22-1937","fundValue":"78520","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gindo  Tampubolon","coPersons":["Mike Antony Savage"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
