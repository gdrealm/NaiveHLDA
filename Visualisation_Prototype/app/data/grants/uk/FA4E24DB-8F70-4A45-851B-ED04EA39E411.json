{"id":"FA4E24DB-8F70-4A45-851B-ED04EA39E411","title":"Writing Our History, Digging Our Past Phase 2","abstractText":"This programme aims to sustain longer-standing collaborations between UoN researchers with non-academic historians and archaeologists, build on recently-launched projects, and foster the emergence of new community groups researching their own heritage. \n\nThe All Our Stories projects that we will be working with focus on oral histories, archive-based research and understanding the built, buried and natural environment. In response, we have put together a project team that can support the needs of the groups with a mix of historians, archaeologists and cultural geographers. With a combination of expertise in political, social and economic history as well as a thorough knowledge of the history and geography of the East Midlands, the research team bring a diverse range of intellectual perspectives which will enhance the capacity of the community partners to understand, interpret and assess their projects in a range of related contexts. In support of the project team, a larger academic body can be called upon to respond to community group needs, with dedicated research time and access to specialist facilities enabled through a Challenge Fund targeted to cover any core costs incurred which cannot be met by the community groups' AOS funding.\n\nOur programme of engagement will include three milestone events (launch, mid-term showcase and final showcase) and a programme of enabling workshops focused on the key requirements of the groups as articulated through a consultation process which enabled the Phase 1 project team to identify the key training and skills development needs. This programme will deliver networking and knowledge exchange opportunities between the community groups and between the community groups and non-academic partners and the academic team.\n \nKey to the success of the project are the three Early Career Researchers (Johnson, Mills and Veale) - they will act as direct support for the core projects and the point-of-contact (through a dedicated hotline) for general enquiries from other groups. Working with the NCCPE and other sections of the University (Centre for Advanced Studies, Community Partnerships and Information Services) they will facilitate access to relevant, specialist academic support and University facilities for All Our Stories community groups.\n\nThe programme will benefit from strong institutional support from the UoN including the Centre for Advanced Studies, Community Partnerships, Information Services and the University Museum. It will also draw on the UoN's non-HEI partners including Nottingham City Museums and Galleries, Derbyshire County Record Office and Trent &amp; Peak Archaeology (part of York Archaeological Trust). \n\nOur programme will be taking place between February and December 2013 to time with the life-cycle of the All Our Stories projects.\n\nThe benefits of the programme will be the enhancement of existing community-based research, the fostering of new community groups and the co-design of research bids for HLF funding. In the longer term, the programme will build new capacity for academic engagement with volunteer researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007696/1","grantId":"AH/K007696/1","fundValue":"69127","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Writing our History, Digging our Past was an AHRC-funded Connected Communities project (Research for Community Heritage strand) to assist community groups in the East Midlands and beyond delve into their local history and archaeology, by providing access to the expertise and resources of professional arts and humanities researchers.\nOver the course of two years, the University supported more than 20 local heritage projects with training in research skills and digital technology, funding and expertise for historical and archaeological research, and workshops and showcase events to bring community heritage groups together. Many of these projects are continuing with ongoing research collaborations between University academics, local heritage organisations and community partners.\n\nWriting Our History, Digging Our Past ran in two phases in 2012 and 2013. The project was funded under the Arts and Humanities Research Council's (AHRC) Connected Communities initiative, which aims to encourage understanding of the changing nature of communities and community values and the impact which their heritage and cultural contexts have on our quality of life.\n\nThe project had objectives that were achieved through a combination of events, road-shows, workshops, a Challenge Fund and follow-up activities. They were:\n\n1. Promote and reinforce existing collaborative links between University of Nottingham researchers and non-HEI partners and community groups. The value and potential of collaborative projects was promoted to academics and community partners at a launch event on 18 February 2013, attended by academic staff from across the University, County Archivists, the York Archaeological Trust and representatives of existing community-based projects. \n\n2. Enable existing collaborative groups to extend their activities in terms of research and dissemination.\nThis was achieved by:\na) A Challenge Fund which extended and supported existing collaborations by providing money to pump-prime and scope pilot projects that would lead to community-led bids to the HLF. The Challenge Fund was used to provide support to HLF-funded groups to extend their projects in new and relevant directions or to meet unexpected contingencies for which funding was not available. The Fund was also able to accommodate requests from new community partners for small pieces of research work, as part of a pathway of modelling partnerships between academics and community heritage organisations.\nb) Development of a Community Heritage website by staff within Information Services, University of Nottingham. The site will be maintained by the University but its success or failure will depend on the willingness of the community partners to continue submitting material relating to their projects.\n\n3) to build long-term capacity within the University to develop research opportunities, by raising knowledge and awareness of the benefits of community collaboration and modelling a mechanism for working with such groups in a mutually-beneficial way. In addition to the Challenge Fund and Community Heritage website mentioned above, this objective was achieved by helping to enhance the skills of community partners through a series of training workshops and events conducted by University staff and external project partners.\n\nThe first element of activity was the provision of six training workshops in digital technologies for community heritage research, including website development, oral history and videoing, and the use of social media, organised by Information Services. These workshops were well-attended and received very positive feedback from the community groups. Training workshops on archival research skills, 'Introduction to Archives' and 'Preserving your Collection', in collaboration with Derbyshire Record Office, were scheduled during the project, as were training workshops in geophysical survey and the use of GIS for archaeological research. These were held in collaboration with Trent and Peak Archaeology [York Archaeological Trust].

If time is short, it is established and experienced groups, or groups with professional input from community arts organizations, that will benefit most from the programme. \n\nWhen we submitted our initial bid to Phase 1 of the scheme, we had hoped that we would be able to encourage disadvantaged or marginalized groups to explore their heritage and apply for HLF 'All Our Stories' funding. Our experience was that we would have needed more time to develop contacts and foster relationships than was available: effectively, we had only 3-4 months between the start of the 'Research for Community Heritage' funding and the deadline for the 'All Our Stories' applications to work with community groups on their ideas for an application.\n\nThe second lesson we learned is the vital importance of synchronizing AHRC and HLF schedules. For instance, there was a time-lag between the announcement at the end of October 2012 of HLF 'All Our Stories' awards, which then had to commence immediately, and the confirmation and start of the AHRC Phase 2 'follow-on funding', which could only start in February 2013. This time-lag created uncertainty for the community groups in receipt of HLF awards, since they were not able to count on academic institutions receiving funding and could not factor such funding into their calculations, and a delay in the provision of essential academic input and support at the start of their projects.\n\nFinally, there are also lessons to be learned and risks to be highlighted to our own academic institutions. We will seek to press these home through our own internal channels, but we mention them since they may also be of relevance to researchers in other institutions. Thanks to the 'Research for Community Heritage' programme we have widened considerably our own and our colleagues' experience of working with community heritage groups, and we have in the process appreciated the access to the wider experience of the NCCPE in this area through the AHRC 'summits' and the NCCPE's training programmes. At the same time, we are aware that much of the positive energy and relationship-building will be dissipated if there are no resources to follow up and maintain the connections we have forged during the lifetime of the funded programme. We may in some cases have unwittingly created expectations on the part of community groups which are hard to fulfil. In addition, sustainability with regard to the maintenance of digital resources (for instance websites hosted by universities) is an issue that needs to be addressed. In ongoing and future projects, we anticipate building on and widening our experience working across disciplines (hitherto focused on history and archaeology) and establishing partnerships with external organizations.\nSome new cross-disciplinary connections and external collaborations have already emerged, other possible research directions are still at a speculative stage.\n\n1. Further collaborative projects have followed on from this project:\n(a) AHRC Follow-on Funding: Research for Community Heritage Digital Building Heritage: Phase 3 (P.I. Dr Douglas Cawthorne, Leicester De Montfort University; Co-I Dr Chris King, University of Nottingham; Co-I Dr David Petts, Durham University). This multi-disciplinary community heritage and archaeology project is being undertaken by three UK universities (De Montfort [lead], Nottingham and Durham) by staff who have all led or been Co-I's in AHRC Connected Communities projects in 2012-13 working with successful HLF 'All Our Stories' community heritage projects. The aim of the research is to understand how the explanatory and interrogatory potential of mobile device technology (software 'apps') can be used to build community-led analysis and interpretations, presentation and education within community archaeology projects. Academic researchers, computer scientists and community partners will work together through a series of workshops to design and test different 'app' models to visualise archaeological data and interpretations, and encourage feedback and input from community users. Critical lessons will be learnt and shared about the challenges and opportunities presented by these new technologies for small-scale community heritage organisations.\n\n(b) Early fabric in historic towns: pre-1750 buildings in Southwell: volunteer recording project (P.I. Dr Chris King, University of Nottingham; project partners: Trent and Peak Archaeology [York Archaeological Trust]; Southwell Community Archaeology Group [SCAG])\nEnglish Heritage announced a call under the National Heritage Protection Programme for new projects dedicated to early buildings in historic towns, to be led by established community groups. The Southwell buildings project provides training in building recording methods for SCAG, through a reconnaissance survey of early buildings in Southwell and detailed recording of a selected number of structures with a programme of tree-ring dating. Early response from the community has been very positive with over 30 volunteers joining the project. The outcome of the survey will be presented in both an academic article and a popular booklet about Southwell's historic buildings.\n\n(c) Manor Park, Toton (Friends of Toton Fields, Trent and Peak Archaeology [York Archaeological Trust])\nThe Friends of Toton Fields were provided with a ?750 grant from the Challenge Fund to enable Paul Johnson (ECR) to undertake a geophysical survey on the site of a historic watermill at Manor Park, Toton, with Trent and Peak Archaeology (project partner) providing professional support. This provided the basis for a larger HLF 'Our Heritage' project to survey the park and adjacent Toton Fields with a variety of techniques and to excavate the mill site and nearby post-medieval manor house as a community engagement venture and present these results to the public via on-site interpretation. The HLF has awarded the Friends of Toton Fields ?57,000 to make this project happen, with Trent and Peak Archaeology providing professional support.\n\n\n2. Other directions for future research can be considered which arise from this project. For example, a need to analyse and compare systematically the role of academics in relation to volunteer researchers exploring community heritage projects can be identified. \na) What are the factors that make for a successful genuinely co-designed and co-researched project, as opposed to a community research project to which academics provide advice and support?\nb) What are the appropriate outcomes of such a project and how do these outcomes meet the needs and expectations of the contributing partners?\n\n\n3. A potentially exciting prospect for future research would be to connect community heritage projects internationally. There could be different motivations for this but it seems that a compelling rationale for networking internationally would be to focus on projects which are inherently transnational in content; for instance, in relation to the history of trade, long-distance transport and mobility and the transfer of technology and knowledge across borders. Similarly, community histories in relation to 20th century conflict, or the history of migrant and diaspora groups where border-crossing has been fundamental to a community's identity, are also appropriate subjects for transnational consideration.
