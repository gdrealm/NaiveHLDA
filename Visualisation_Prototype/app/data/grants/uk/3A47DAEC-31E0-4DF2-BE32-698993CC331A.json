{"id":"3A47DAEC-31E0-4DF2-BE32-698993CC331A","title":"Nonparametric Methods for Empirical Finance and Microeconometrics","abstractText":"<p>This project consists of two specific proposals. The first is concerned with developing new methods for estimating a class of panel data models in which the functional form is allowed to be flexible, ie, to have some (low dimensional) nonparametric components as well as parametric ones. The setting we are interested in has both a large time series dimension as well as a large cross-sectional dimension. There are many contexts where this type of data is available and where nonlinearity may be important. For example in Finance we observe many firms over quite a long period of time. The second project is about the estimation of a new measure of polarization. Polarization is a concept that has been introduced recently in connection with the study of income distributions and poverty. We propose a nonparametric method of estimating this quantity. The advantage of this approach is that specific parametric assumptions regarding income distributions can be rather restrictive and can lead to misleading inferences. The nonparametric estimator we propose can have rather nonstandard behaviour and the project is partly concerned with developing a theory of how it should behave when computed on large samples and thereby how to conduct inference.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F015232/1","grantId":"ES/F015232/1","fundValue":"153039","fundStart":"2007-09-30","fundEnd":"2009-09-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Oliver  Linton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
