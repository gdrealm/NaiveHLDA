{"id":"2A63EFC4-AE79-425E-B2F7-14B325CA60AB","title":"The Saint-Aubins' 'Book of Arses': The Livre de Caricatures tant bonnes que mauvaises","abstractText":"The project focuses on the Livre de Caricatures tant bonnes que mauvaises (1740-1775), a volume of drawings by three Saint-Aubin brothers, who referred to it as their livre des culs ('book of arses'). Many drawings are crudely scatalogical; others, witty and cerebral. The work sheds light on political satire and caricature, popular and elite culture, public and domestic spheres, the sociability of laughter, and cultures of collecting in eighteenth-century France. The project will make the volume available through a digitised edition, and provide an in-depth and contextual analysis of it, drawing on an international and cross-disciplinary group of scholars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119397/2","grantId":"119397/2","fundValue":"204283","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2010-10-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin David Jones","coPersons":["Juliet  Carey","Pippa  Shirley"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
