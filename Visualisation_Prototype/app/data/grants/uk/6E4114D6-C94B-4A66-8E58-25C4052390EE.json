{"id":"6E4114D6-C94B-4A66-8E58-25C4052390EE","title":"Mapping LGBT Histories with Outstories Bristol","abstractText":"This project is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Bristol; the community groups, Outstories Bristol and Freedom Youth; Bristol City Council and Bristol Record Office. It follows on from the AHRC-funded grant, Know Your Bristol On The Move. The project engages lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) residents of Bristol in researching, writing and mapping LGBT history using digital tools. The aim is to mainstream LGBT history as part of the official history of Bristol, and through doing so, to raise the voices of LGBT people in the public eye, in the planning process and in local schools.\n\nNew material on Bristol's LGBT history will be gathered at a series of events, as well as through in-depth oral history interviews conducted by volunteers who will be trained over the course of the project. The collected material will be digitally photographed or recorded and, along with existing LGBT archive materials held at BRO, will be uploaded to Bristol City Council's online historical mapping website, Know Your Place (KYP). KYP is a visual representation of the Historic Environment Record which Bristol City Council refers to for placemaking and when making planning decisions. The inclusion of LGBT history on the map, and therefore on the Historic Environment Record, provides a way for LGBT voices to intervene in the formal planning process. \n\nIn order to ensure that collected material is readily accessible to LGBT communities and can continue to be added to beyond the lifetime of the project, we will create a user-friendly interface embedded in Outstories Bristol's own website. This interface will also be published as a generic open-source Wordpress plugin that can be downloaded and used by other community groups to display their own historical map layer from KYP or, indeed, any other Arc-Gis map database. Since KYP is set to expand across the South West, the potential user base for this is very high. \n\nThe material collected by volunteers will also be used to produce a series of new resources, including digital story-maps (digital stories where each image or text links to a place on the map) that highlight the distinctive experiences of different groups within the LGBT community (e.g. lesbian, transgender), and a mobile app that will enable engagement with Bristol's LGBT history through walking tours. Working with the LBGT youth group, Freedom Youth and Bristol University's student society, LGBT+, we will co-develop and co-deliver a series of Key Stage 4 curriculum resources. A key outcome of the schools work will be tackling homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools.\n\nWhile the university's role here is key, it is by no means the lead partner. This project was initiated by Outstories Bristol and has been co-designed with them. This process of co-production is central to the project's innovative nature and will play an crucial role in its success.\n\nThe project will reach a section of the Bristol population which has been historically marginalised and is largely invisible in mainstream historical accounts of the city. It will allow this group to intervene in the planning process and promote intergenerational dialogue and support through the connection between older interviewees and Freedom Youth. It will mainstream LGBT history by including it on the official Bristol City Council digital history map, Know Your Place, and by embedding it within the curriculum in local schools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N001729/1","grantId":"AH/N001729/1","fundValue":"77439","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Josie  McLellan","coPersons":["Robert  Bickers","Nathan  Eisenstadt"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
