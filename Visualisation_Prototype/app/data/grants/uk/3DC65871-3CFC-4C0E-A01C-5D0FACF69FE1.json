In the first (LHCb at the LHC) we will investigating primarily the phenomenon known as CP violation, which is important to understanding the present matter /anti-matter asymmetry of the known Universe. We will do this through precision measurements of parameters in decays of the b-quark and anti-b-quarks where we will search for differences in their behaviour. In this experiment it is also possible to see evidence for new unknown physics processes through what are known as 'virtual particles'. In the second thread (ATLAS at LHC) we will be looking for new discoveries at the high energy frontier. ATLAS will collide protons at the highest energy ever achieved in a laboratory. From the particles produced we may discover dark matter and the Higgs boson, as well as a host of other possible new phenomena. We will also retain an interest in studies for future colliders an detectors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H000909/2","grantId":"ST/H000909/2","fundValue":"738696","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Playfer","coPersons":["Franz  Muheim","Peter  Clarke","Philip  Clark","Victoria Jane Martin"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
