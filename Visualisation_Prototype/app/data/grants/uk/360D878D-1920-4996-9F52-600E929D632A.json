Of crucial importance will be the new results coming from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The proposed research will improve our ability to predict the effects of the strong interactions (QCD) on the processes that will be studied at the LHC and develop efficient methods to determine the properties of any new states of matter discovered there. Both analytical and numerical methods will be used to study the properties of hadrons, strongly interacting bound states of quarks. Our research will seek to determine what lies beyond the Standard Model of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, with the ultimate goal of providing a fully unified theory, including gravity. The most promising candidate theories will be studied, including Grand and superstring unification and theories with additional space dimensions. Laboratory, astrophysical and cosmological implications will be analysed to determine the most sensitive experimental tests of these theories. We hope these studies will lead to a complete understanding of the origin of mass, including an understanding of the quark, charged lepton and neutrino masses, mixing angles and CP violation, as well as of the nature of dark matter. In addition to having direct relevance to the LHC program, our research will have relevance to present and future neutrino and astroparticle experiments and to astrophysical and cosmological studies. In particular a concerted effort will be made to understand the nature of the dark matter and optimise strategies for detecting both direct and indirect signals. The implications of particle physics models for early universe processed such as inflation will also be studied.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000507/1","grantId":"ST/J000507/1","fundValue":"989202","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Subir  Sarkar","coPersons":["Michael  Teper","Giulia  Zanderighi","Francesco  Hautmann","Andre  Lukas","John  March-Russell","Ulrich Andreas Haisch","Joseph  Conlon","Andrei  Starinets","John  Wheater","Graham  Ross"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
