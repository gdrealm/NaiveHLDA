{"id":"637A26A2-5D5D-4EDC-8E7D-4701085BD4C6","title":"Modernist Magazines: A critical and cultural history","abstractText":"This project aims to document and analyse the role of 'little magazines' in the period 1880-1945, and to consider their contribution to the construction of generic and variant modernist formations in Britain, Europe and North America. 'Little Magazines' were innovative publishing ventures in which most of the major contributors to modernism were first published. The project will shed much new light on the overall nature of modernism by uncovering the significant role of minor contributors and contemporary debates in such magazines. The study will survey the magazines' editorial positions, their diverse contents, visual design, sponsorship and readerships.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119175/2","grantId":"119175/2","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Brooker","coPersons":["Andrew John Thacker"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
