{"id":"79591520-917A-4AB5-AAEF-77939C265537","title":"ACTION-MEDIATED VISUAL ATTENTION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN","abstractText":"The ability to attend to stimuli in the environment that are relevant to our behavioural goals is crucially important for survival. To date, most studies into the factors that determine visual attention have concentrated on the basic properties of stimuli to which attention is drawn / for example, their size, orientation, or colour contrast. We have recently shown that, in addition to these basis properties, attention is also determined by the presence of action relations between objects. For example, neurological patients who have problems attending to multiple stimuli find it easier to do so if the objects appear as if in use together (Riddoch et al., Nature Neurosci., 2003). These data may be fundamentally important for understanding how attention operates, and would be relevant not only to evaluating human attention but also for the design of artificial attention systems. In the planned project we aim to assess if action relations between objects affect the allocation of attention in normal observers, to show that prior results are not 'special' to brain injured populations. We will then proceed to explore the neural basis for the action effects. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging will be used to assess which brain regions respond to action information, and whether there is modulation of a network of brain regions (including primary sensory regions of the cortex). fMRI will inform us about the spatial localisation of these action effects in the brain, but it provides coarse information about quickly any effects emerge. To examine the time course of action effects, we will record event-related brain potentials, which generate a detailed picture of the time at which effects arise. Finally, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to affect ongoing neural processes in targeted brain regions (identified through fMRI), to test whether these regions are necessary for action effects on attention to emerge. The results will enable us to construct a detailed neural and functional account of the effects of action on human attention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E006175/1","grantId":"BB/E006175/1","fundValue":"396860","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":["M.
