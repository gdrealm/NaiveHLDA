The loss of empire in the 1960s, however, met with little public reaction. Scotland's changing role within empire and changing attitudes to colonialism in 20th century Scottish society have as yet been little explored. The research will investigate reinterpretations of Scotland's imperial role and its displacement as a dominant representation of national identity in the period c 1918- c 1970.</p>\n\n<p>Key aims of the research are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>map civil society organisations concerned with empire in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow;</li>\n\n <li>provide in-depth case studies of two key Scottish institutions demonstrating a continuing interest in empire, the Church of Scotland and the Scottish Trades Union Congress;</li>\n\n <li>assess the influence of these organisations on debates on empire and on representations of Scotland's role within empire.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will use archives of case study organisations, other organisational records and publications, newspapers, and oral history interviews. Examination of evidence will focus on representations of Scotland's role in empire and of Scottish identity, using categories of analysis such as class, gender, religion, race and nation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1790","grantId":"RES-062-23-1790","fundValue":"285950","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Esther  Breitenbach","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
