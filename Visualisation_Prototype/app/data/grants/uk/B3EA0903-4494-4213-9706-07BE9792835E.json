Provision of curated cultured adapted human ES cell lines and their early passage non-adapted counterparts.\nFrom existing panels of human ES cell lines we will curate and characterise sets of normal and culture adapted sublines\nthat exhibit altered growth and differentiation characteristics. These will include sets that we have already well\ncharacterised, e.g. from the H7 human ES cell line, as well as others that we have banked, including normal/abnormal pairs\nof the human ES cell lines Shef4, Shef5, H1, H9 and H14. Many of these involve karyotypic changes. However, we also\nhave stocks of late passage ES cells that have acquired altered growth patterns but with out overt karyotypic change,\nperhaps due to sub-karyotypic genetic change or to epigenetic change. These together with additional lines provided by\nNeusentis, grown under defined culture conditions, will also be assessed for various parameters of culture adaptation (see\nbelow). Cell extracts will be prepared from normal and culture adapted sublines from the curated panel and provided to\nCellzome. Key parameters will be assessed on cultures corresponding to those provided to Cellzome, to ensure\ncomparability and to facilitate correlation analyses.\n\n2. Parameters of Culture Adaptation\nThe properties of the cells will be analysed for genotype and phenotype, and by high content clonogenic assays for\nsurvival, proliferation and differentiation, and time lapse microscropy to assess cell motility parameters. By comparison of\nthese with data generated by the Cellzome platform we will identify criteria that will provide the most robust indictors of\nculture adaptation.\n\nGenotyping: Cell lines will be assessed by standard G-Banding karyology. The presence of small populations of cells with\ngains of specific chromosomal regions will be assessed by interphase FISH. We will also assay the genotype of the cells\nusing a Illumina1M Quad BeadChip, the same platform as used in the ISCI-2 genetic stability study, which will allow cross\ncomparison of the cell lines in our study with over 120 other human ES lines whose karyotype and CNV status is known\nand with reference CNV data to enable the identification of culture induced CNV's.\n\nPhenotype: All human ES cells will be assessed for the expression of the panel surface antigens that are characteristic of\nhuman ES cells. Since these markers identify the undifferentiated cells, they can identify the extent of spontaneous\ndifferentiation in a culture of ES cells, a parameter that may change in concert with culture adaptation. Gene expression\npatterns will also be assessed using the TaqMan Low Density Array Q.PCR system designed for the International Stem\nCell Initiative. This array includes key markers of undifferentiated human ES cells and their differentiated derivatives; in\nconjunction with surface antigen data these data will provide further indicators of culture adaptation. For example, we have\nfound evidence that some cases of culture adaptation is characterised by loss of an ability to generate specific cell\nlineages, notably endoderm.\n\nHigh content clonogenic assays for survival, proliferation and differentiation: Clonogenic assays of human ES cells will be\nanalysed using the GE Healthcare InCell Analyzer. Assessment of numbers of colonies, size of colonies and phenotype of\ncells within colonies wil provide detailed information about the growth properties of ES cells including their growth rate,\nability to survive culture stress and their propensity for differentiation, including their pathways of differentiation.\n\nCell motility: We have recently observed that the survival and motility of normal and culture adapted human ES cells under\nmarked changes when observed by time lapse microscopy of single cells and their progeny. These parameters will be\nassessed for all sublines provided for Cellzome analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021407/1","grantId":"BB/J021407/1","fundValue":"273824","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results of this research have not yet had an impact outside our research group and their potential is currently being assessed.

Specifically we have identified an enzyme encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1 associated with cholesterol metabolism and subject to amplification during culture adaptation. Amplification of this gene may provide variant cells with a selective advantage both by alterations to cholesterol metabolism and by regulating apoptotic pathways in the cells. We are currently validating the findings that have been made to date and testing how the gene amplification identified might impact on the proliferation of genetically normal human ES cells and variant cells carrying different chromosomal aberrations. These results will be taken forward by the Pluripotent Stem Cell Platform, one of the Hubs formed under the UKRMP, to optimise conditions for scale up of human Pluripotent Stem cell growth while retaining genetic fidelity Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
