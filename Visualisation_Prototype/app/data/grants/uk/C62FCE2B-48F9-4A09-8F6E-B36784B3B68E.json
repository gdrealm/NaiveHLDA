Analysis of new data generated from a study with the same population (funded by SIDA, through FAO) which looks particularly at the impact on agricultural livelihoods, will be undertaken for this study. By using the data from both studies we can look in more depth at the impact HIV-related infection and AIDS deaths have had on broader livelihoods in individual households and wider family groups.</p>\n\n<p>The study will contribute to building an understanding of the long-term impact of HIV and AIDS and contribute to the design of policies and programmes for impact mitigation. The project will also facilitate data sharing and discussion on the impact of HIV on demographic change with researchers working with population cohorts in Tanzania and Malawi.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H000089/1","grantId":"ES/H000089/1","fundValue":"80210","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Yes.
