Since relatively minor damage can significantly reduce performance, the 'no growth' approach (i.e. damage propagation from a defect constitutes failure) is now the mindset of the composites industry. This has led to excessively heavy components, shackling of innovative design, and a need for frequent inspection during service. However, the research community has made considerable steps in understanding damage modes and the development of robust failure models. A step change in composites technology could be achieved by adopting a philosophy in which some damage growth can be tolerated (i.e. be 'damage tolerant' or 'fail-safe); this would provide considerable weight and cost savings and offer designers greater freedom to formulate new designs. Furthermore, there are numerous applications in which a component is expected to tolerate significant damage growth yet still be fit for service; for example, collision damage to a transport vehicle. In such an application, severe damage is introduced whilst the structure is under significant load, and subsequently crack growth is highly likely; a no-growth criterion cannot be used, and damage propagation must be tolerated. An effective approach to achieve this is by employing CRack Arrest and Self-Healing COMPosite Structures (CRASHCOMPS). Uniquely, composites offer the freedom to 'tailor' internal architecture, hybridise and introduce novel features in order to achieve such a capability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005648/1","grantId":"EP/G005648/1","fundValue":"627742","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emile Smith Greenhalgh","coPersons":["Joachim Hans Steinke","Alexander  Bismarck","Lorenzo  Iannucci"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We successfully predicted and experimentally a means to arrest a rapidly (1km/sec) growing crack in a composite structure.
