The nature of the platform grant is primarily to support salaries of researchers and support staff. The areas of research to be supported under this grant are:(i) Sensors based on nanostructured films deposited on optical fibre devices(ii) Sensing technology based upon micromachined optical fibres and silica nanowires(iii) Optical Coherence Tomography(iv) Optical instrumentation for aerodynamic applications(v) Optical instrumentation for geotechnical applications(v) Optical fibre sensors for composite material process monitoring (vi) Optical gas detection","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H02252X/1","grantId":"EP/H02252X/1","fundValue":"1149470","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This is a Platform Grant. The objectives are to provide continuity of employment for RAs between standard research grants and to undertake feasibility studies. The grant does not complete until September 2015. The findings from the feasibility studies have been used to prepare submissions of full grant applications to the research councils. As part of the RA development several RAs have been involved as Researcher CIs and more recently CI.\n\nThese include:\nEP/M010473/1 Improved post-operative vision using advanced optical measurement techniques. PI: R P Tatam, CI: HD Ford\n\nEP/L014637/1 OCT for 2D and 3D velocity measurement in micro-fluidic flows.
