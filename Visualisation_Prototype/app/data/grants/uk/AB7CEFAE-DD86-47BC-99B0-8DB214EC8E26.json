{"id":"AB7CEFAE-DD86-47BC-99B0-8DB214EC8E26","title":"Exploring the Living Canvas","abstractText":"The 'Living Canvas' initiative aims to explore the novel expressive potential of using the performer's body and clothes as a versatile projection surface. Through precisely detecting the posture and silhouette of the performer, certain body parts can be specifically projected onto which will enable the performer to wear numerous outfits, images, textures and videos whilst also enabling text to be read across their body. \\n\\nThis has the potential to make a major breakthrough across the performing arts world opening many possibilities for a new diverse performance language to be embraced which will benefit the arts world within the UK and beyond. The 'Living Canvas' will enable the performer to 'wear virtual costumes' generated by a visual artist and for the first time the audience will watch a performer change before their very eyes on stage.\\n\\nThe Living Canvas is a collaborative project between the Digital Design Studio of the Glasgow School of Art and Theatre Cryptic in Glasgow. It brings together computer science with the performing arts in a truly interdisciplinary effort.\\n\\nAn initial study, funded by AHRC under the practise-led and applied route, has proven the feasibility of key technological elements, having successfully projected onto a performer's body. The proposed project takes this technology further with the aim of developing the 'Living Canvas' system to a much larger scale, flexibility, and ready for deployment in a high-profile production which will tour the UK and Europe in 2010. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F018673/1","grantId":"AH/F018673/1","fundValue":"108577","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  ChapmanMartin  Naef","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Glasgow School of Art","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
