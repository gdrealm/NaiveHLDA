Estimates suggest that obesity now affects around 1.5 billion people. This is worrying because the health and economic consequences are very clear. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and some cancers. \n One of the key observations about obesity is that not everyone becomes obese, even when they live in the same community, or even the same family. This means that some people appear to be 'protected.' Obesity researchers are interested in understanding why this is the case because this protection may hold the key to an effective treatment, or even a way to prevent obesity in the first place. \n For a long time, researchers and health professionals have suspected that obesity is associated with a particular eating style, eating quickly in particular. Indeed, it is sometimes said that we should chew our food several times in order to feel satisfied and to 'aid digestion.' Recently, researchers have begun to explore this idea systematically. The results are striking. For example, under controlled conditions, it would seem that eating at a slower rate produces both an increase in self-reported fullness and a reduction in meal size. Moreover, when we look at people across an entire country, we find that eating rate is a good predictor of bodyweight, even in large-scale studies. In 2010 researchers started to look at ways to reduce eating rate to see if this might be used to lower bodyweight. Their results were impressive. They used device called a mandometer to encourage children to eat at a slower rate. This training produced a clinically significant reduction in bodyweight, which was sustained 12 months post treatment. \n The prospect that we can manipulate eating behaviour to reduce energy intake is tantalizing because this approach has potential as an effective treatment for obesity. Moreover, an opportunity exists to change our eating behaviour by manipulating the physical characteristics of food. If this can be achieved then we may be able to design foods to encourage behaviours (e.g., slow eating) that reduce our calorie intake from meal to meal. Importantly, for these benefits to be realised, we need to discover the underlying mechanism. This is an important objective of this project. \n In the first instance we will develop a method to quantify and characterise 'eating topography' - collectively, the pattern of behaviours associated with eating; swallow rate, bite size, eating rate, and so on. With this tool, we will run a series of experiments to identify specific aspects of eating topography that influence our food intake.\n In a second set of experiments we will focus on the mechanism. Two hypotheses will be tested. Firstly, we will explore the prospect that a causal relationship exists between specific aspects of eating topography and the hunger and fullness that we experience at the end of a meal and during the period between meals. There are two reasons why this relationship might exist. Eating topography may change levels of hormones that control our appetite. Alternatively, it may influence the formation of memory for a meal - a process that is known to influence the amount of food that we eat at a subsequent meal. \n Our second hypothesis relates to the eating topography that is associated with particular foods. If a food is eaten with a topography that makes us feel full then we may remember this relationship. In future, when we encounter that food again, we may expect the food to be more filling and select a smaller portion. By this account, eating topography influences our energy intake by changing the way we make decisions about portion size, before a meal begins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J005622/1","grantId":"BB/J005622/1","fundValue":"203145","fundStart":"2012-07-31","fundEnd":"2016-01-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project is ongoing (completion date: End of January 2016) and our findings have not been used yet.

Recently, researchers have begun to explore this idea systematically. The results are striking. For example, under controlled conditions, it would seem that eating at a slower rate produces a reduction in meal size (Robinson et al, 2014). These acute effects could be meaningful because differences in eating rate predict variability in body mass index. Moreover, training obese adolescents to moderate their rate of eating produces a clinically significant and sustained reduction in bodyweight (Ford et al., 2010).\n\nIn the first phase of this project, we first developed a novel method to quantify and characterise 'eating topography' - collectively, the pattern of behaviours associated with eating; swallow rate, bite size, eating rate, and so on. This methodology uses simultaneous recordings of; i) mouth movements and ii) plate weight during eating (the research team has written its own custom software to do this). To our knowledge, this is the first time that this combination has been compared across foods and over the course of an entire meal. To extract the data from these recordings, we have also developed; i) a standardised video coding scheme that can be used to quantify a range of oral processing behaviours, and ii) a MATLAB script that filters dynamic plate-weight data to plot cumulative food intake curves (CICs). We plan to publish and make freely available the computer code associated with this methodology.\n\nWith this tool, we have run a series of experiments to identify specific aspects of eating topography that influence our food intake. In Study 1, female participants (N=12) attended the laboratory over 20 lunchtime sessions to consume a different 400-kcal meal. Prior to consumption, expected satiation was assessed. During each meal, oral processing was characterised using; (i) video-recordings of the mouth, and (ii) real-time measures of plate weight. Hunger and fullness ratings were elicited pre- and post-consumption, and for a further three hours. Foods that were eaten slowly delivered more satiation/satiety and had higher expected satiation. Building on these findings, in Study 2 we selected two meals (identical energy density) from Study 1 that were equally liked but maximized differences in oral processing. On separate days, participants (N=24) consumed a 400-kcal portion of either the &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; meal followed by an ad libitum meal (either the same food or a dessert). When continuing with the same food, participants consumed less of the slow meal. Together, these findings suggest that natural variations in the oral processing of pre-packaged meals can promote fullness after consuming a fixed portion and it can also reduce meal size. Further, differences in food intake during the ad libitum meal were not compensated at a subsequent snacking opportunity an hour later. Altering food form to encourage increased oral processing (albeit to a smaller extent than in experimental manipulations) might represent a viable target for food manufacturers to help nudge consumers to manage their weight.\n\nWe have also completed other experiments exploring the prospect that beliefs about the satiating quality of a food and visual cues of portion size can have a direct effect on how we eat a food. In a recent study we showed that eating rate is modified by visual feedback associated with the perceived rate of change in food volume during a meal. We are the first group to expose this implicit process. This work suggests that eating rate is not determined solely by the structural properties of food being eaten (Wilkinson et al., In preparation).\n\nWe are now in the second phase of our project and we are completing a set of experiments where we will focus on the mechanism underlying effects of eating topography on energy intake. Two hypotheses are being tested. First, we are exploring the prospect that a causal relationship exists between specific aspects of eating topography and the hunger and fullness that we experience at the end of a meal and during the period between meals. There are two reasons why this relationship might exist. Eating topography may change levels of hormones that control our appetite. Alternatively, it may influence the formation of memory for a meal - a process that is known to influence the amount of food that we eat at a subsequent meal. Our second hypothesis relates to the eating topography that is associated with particular foods. If a food is eaten with a topography that makes us feel full then we may remember this relationship. In future, when we encounter that food again, we may expect the food to be more filling and select a smaller portion. By this account, eating topography influences our energy intake by changing the way we make decisions about portion size, before a meal begins. We see three areas where our project could have considerable social and economic impact:\n\n1. FOODS FOR WEIGHT MANAGEMENT\n\nSeveral sources indicate that eating topography (eating rate in particular) influences energy intake from meal to meal. Indeed, this relationship appears to have an accumulative effect on energy balance because it is a good predictor of BMI in large population studies. For the first time, we will expose the underlying process. In addition, we will identify the key aspects of eating topography (chew rate, inter-bite interval, etc) that influence energy intake. In collaboration with our industry partner, we will use this understanding to explore ways in which foods might be modified to encourage these specific patterns of eating. If this is successful, then this approach might be applied to enhance the efficacy of commercial products that are designed to confer benefits for weight loss. We also note that this project is submitted under the LINK scheme. During our meetings with our industry partner (Nestle) we have discussed ways in which our results might be exploited and applied to promote weight loss. More generally, both the PI and Co-I have regular contact with researchers in several major food companies. We will use this network to ensure that our findings can be exploited at the earliest opportunity.\n\n2. TREATMENT OF OBESITY\nIn part, our interest in eating topography stems from the recent discovery that by manipulating eating rate it is possible to achieve a significant and sustained (12 months post treatment) reduction in BMI and body fat in otherwise obese children. As a direct result of this project, we will have a better understanding of how this intervention works. Moreover, with this understanding we will be well-placed to identify ways in which it might be improved, simplified, and implemented more widely and cost effectively. To achieve this impact we have collaborated with Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, who was directly involved in the clinical trial establishing the efficacy of the mandometer. We have already agreed to explore ways in which our research findings might be implemented in a clinical setting. \n\n3. PROMOTING BEST PRACTICE IN DIETARY BEHAVIOUR\nOur research has considerable potential to inform policy makers and heath professionals. By the end of this project we will be well-positioned to comment on ways in which distraction and specific eating behaviours contribute to overeating. To assist with evidence-based practice, results from our research will be submitted to target journals that are likely to reach a broader audience of health professionals and policy makers (e.g., the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition).
