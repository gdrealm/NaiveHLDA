{"id":"3651A2A5-8CDE-45E1-9318-83FAD3331655","title":"Wave Hub baseline study","abstractText":"This proposal has been designed to fill urgent scientific gaps in relation to baseline studies in renewable energy test sites and to take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by the development of the Wave Hub demonstrator site. While this proposal will benefit from the simultaneous characterisation of other ecosystem components by PRIMaRE scientists, we will complement current efforts by obtaining research quality data for the oceanographic characteristics of the site. It is essential to obtain this information prior to deployment of infrastructure if we are to understand the impact of arrays of wave devices together with the Wave Hub infrastructure. This opportunity has already been lost at other wave energy device testing sites (such as at EMEC, Orkney), because devices, together with infrastructure such as moorings and cabling have already been installed. We will deploy multidisciplanry field teams in time to obtain high quality, spatially resolved field data ahead of the Wave Hub construction. For this, we have therefore suggested a modest budget to ensure that this information is collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Our approach will be to obtain: (i) Detailed oceanographic study at the Wave Hub site and surrounds - covering the whole range of physical, chemical and biological parameters before the deployment of Wave Hub infrastructure and wave energy devices. (ii) Ensure data acquisition in time and space to allow development of physical and ecosystem models at scales relevant to wave arrays. Ultimately models will allow us to make predictive assessments of the extent, timescales and intensity of ecosystem impacts and perturbation resulting from implementation of wave energy arrays. (iii) Engagement of environmental economists to ensure these same data can be used to develop economic valuation estimates of critical life supporting ecosystem services at scales appropriate to arrays of wave devices for comparison with other uses of marine space. This proposal is also driven by the need to expand the science capability and resources over the next five years to address the questions which have arisen directly in respect of marine renewable energy development and sustainable use of marine resources. Hence, many of the activities are also viewed as capacity building and skill development within PML-PRIMaRE that are pivotal to address the scientific requirements of the renewable energy sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I015094/1","grantId":"NE/I015094/1","fundValue":"48147","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The data collected represent a novel snapshot of nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton distributions in the wavehub area that straddles both the mixed shallow region and the deeper stratified area. The data in combination with future modelling efforts and post device installations surveys can help evaluate potential ecosystem impacts of energy extraction in shelf regions with weak stratification (many parts of the UK shelf).

In 2012 we visited the wave hub and collected water for nutrient and phytoplankton analyses at 3 depths at 14 Stations and carried out zooplankton nets deployments. Additionally, we deployed 4 moorings (two wirewalker, one ADCP and one thermistor string) that were in operation for 12 days. The data have been submitted to BODC. The data are currently feeding into a model validation exercise under NERC project FLOWBEC and the PhD dissertation of Marcus Zanacchi registered at University of Plymouth. The data are being used by Marcus Zanacchi as part of his PhD studying the sensitivity of the wave hub frontal area to wave and wind mixing in addition to tidal energy dissipation.
