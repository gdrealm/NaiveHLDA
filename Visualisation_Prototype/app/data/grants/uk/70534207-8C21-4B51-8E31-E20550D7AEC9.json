{"id":"70534207-8C21-4B51-8E31-E20550D7AEC9","title":"Development and validation of functional cell therapies for Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases","abstractText":"Involving neural tissue transplantation in the brain, as well as stem cells, human embryos and animal experiments, this research is high profile in the general as well as scientific news media. In addition to publication in peer reviewed journals, the results of the present project will be widely disseminated to the biomedical research community, to NHS and clinical professions, and to interested charities and the lay public, through lectures and seminars in the normal way as well as in media interviews when appropriate. The PIs already have extensive experience in public communication of research results. We strive to achieve the best balance between the competing demands of proper disclosure of publicly funded science, public education, promoting enthusiasm for science and support for the MRC and biomedical research, but without raising false or premature hopes for cures that remain distant. The credibility of the team is enhanced by the close collaboration of the two PIs, one a basic scientist and the other a clinical scientist, combining resources and expertise to develop a translational programme for novel cell-based treatments for crippling human neurodegenerative diseases, spanning basic cellular, molecular and behavioural science through to clinical delivery in patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500794","grantId":"G0500794","fundValue":"1601160","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen B.
