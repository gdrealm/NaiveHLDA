These are plasmas existing on the micro-scale. These discharges, due to their small dimensions, can be struck at high pressure (&gt; 200 Torr) but at low discharge voltages and can take many different forms, varying in size from several 100 microns down to a few microns. The development of these devices has opened up a new scientific front and the possibility for new technological exploitation in application areas including MEMS, lamp technology (EUV, VUV sources), micro-chemical analysis, high-rate spot processing (micro-machining), high dialectic media (THz wave interactions), and nano-particle synthesis to name a few.However, interest into pursuing fundamental research and the exploitation of microplasmas has come largely from outside the UK. To address the lack of UK activity and to stimulate the science in this field, we propose to visit a strong and active microplasma network in Japan and set up new collaborations. We are particularly interested in focusing upon the area of micro-plasma development for plasma surface chemical tailoring of materials. This is designed to link with our current joint research interests.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D038847/1","grantId":"EP/D038847/1","fundValue":"13313","fundStart":"2006-03-25","fundEnd":"2006-06-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James William Bradley","coPersons":["Paul Martin Bryant","R  Short"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
