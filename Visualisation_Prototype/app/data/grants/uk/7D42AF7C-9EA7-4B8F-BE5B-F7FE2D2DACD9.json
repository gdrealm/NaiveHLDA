It has two parts where two novel, complementary mechanisms contributing to the resource curse are modeled and evidence is gathered to test them. The hypothesised mechanisms revolve around competition for political control of the country, or power struggles. In the first mechanism an abundance of natural resources leads to ethnic conflict, and through it to slower or negative growth. In the second mechanism struggles over natural resources shorten the planning horizon of ruling elites, distorting their investment decisions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F018797/1","grantId":"ES/F018797/1","fundValue":"81234","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesco  Caselli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
