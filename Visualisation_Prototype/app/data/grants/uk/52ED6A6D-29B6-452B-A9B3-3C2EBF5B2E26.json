{"id":"52ED6A6D-29B6-452B-A9B3-3C2EBF5B2E26","title":"BIVISTA: multi-modality imaging for improving surgical intervention","abstractText":"Major cancers such as pancreatic and breast cancer (worldwide incidence of over 277,000 and 1,383,000 respectively) rely on surgical intervention. The challenge is to reduce the mortality rate for these and other types of cancer through interventional imaging techniques that can assist clinicians and surgeons at the time of operation. Clinical diagnosis forms the basis for improved patient management and we propose that high quality imaging at the point of care will contribute to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes for patients.\n\nGamma cameras are used routinely in many areas of medicine to image different tissue types and processes using radioactive 'tracer' compounds injected into the patient. The resulting images are of great value to the clinician in the staging and treatment of a variety of conditions. The combination of multi-spectral imaging, inherent in the BIVISTA system, will improve diagnosis and hence treatment management in a wide variety of cancers and other diseases. A patent application has been filed on the BIVISTA concept. \n\nThe advantages of the BIVISTA versus larger-field gamma cameras include:\n\n Uniquely combines gamma and optical imaging\n\n Much higher resolution which allows imaging of smaller areas of tissue or the study of other processes such as lymph drainage\n\n Compact and mobile device offering real time imaging that can be used in a variety of environments, for example at the bedside and in the operating theatre.\n\n Multi-modality imaging: simultaneous optical and gamma ray and the ability to map fluorescence markers; an emerging technology in surgical practice. \n\n High spatial resolution information of 3D distribution of activity within the patient\n\nBIVISTA will deliver significant healthcare benefits to a range of patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007987/1","grantId":"ST/M007987/1","fundValue":"24259","fundStart":"2015-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Christopher Perkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
