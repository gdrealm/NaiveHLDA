However, much of the evidence for the health effects of vitamin D comes from observational studies, and conclusions based on these studies may be affected by methodological problems such as bias and confounding. In this study, we will use a novel approach based on genetic information (so-called Mendelian Randomisation) and our aim is to see if the associations between vitamin D and the risk of various diseases can be replicated. If replication is found, this would give further support for a causal association between vitamin D and the outcome of interest. We will use data from the nationwide 1958 British birth cohort, in which over 7000 participants have been followed-up over four decades and detailed information has been collected on genetic markers and a wide-range of health related factors, including vitamin D status, lifestyle, diet, and indicators of disease risk.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601653","grantId":"G0601653","fundValue":"402514","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elina  Hypponen","coPersons":["Mark Ian McCarthy","Christine  Power"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
