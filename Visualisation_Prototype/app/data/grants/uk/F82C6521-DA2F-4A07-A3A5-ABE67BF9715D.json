{"id":"F82C6521-DA2F-4A07-A3A5-ABE67BF9715D","title":"Nanoparticle and Element Distribution Studies of Ion Implantation Processes","abstractText":"Ion implantation to modify the surface and sub-surface microstructure of substrates is a core process in materials and device technology. In particular the combination of ion implantation with annealing sequences is known to generate a variety of nanostructures, ranging from clusters of few atoms to extend nanoparticles, tunable by implantation energy and annealing parameters. Progress in characterisation techniques now makes it possible to observe and analyse the essential annealing step inside an electroni microscope. Ultra-high resolution through aberration correction techniques allows approaching single atom visibility for high contrast cases. Another major advance in technology is the aplication of heat treatments and gas reaction cells within special attachments to the TEM goniometer.The project will explore the basics of cluster and particle formation, explore the lateral distribution of clusters, and its relationship to the ion beam parameters. Materials and nanostructures which will be generated range from metals (e.g. Zn) over metal oxides (e.g. ZnO), to ferromagnets (e.g. Co), with a choice of isotropic (silica) and uni-axial (A1203-0001) substrates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F062710/1","grantId":"EP/F062710/1","fundValue":"394726","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Guenter  Moebus","coPersons":["Nianhua  Peng","Michael Richard John  Gibbs","Anthony George Cullis","Beverley  Inkson"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" - Successful development of novel method of how to laterally pattern substrates by ion implantation on the nanoscale\n\n- Successful development of novel method of how to generate ultra-low aspect ratio nanochannel pore arrays \n\n- Successful development of novel method of how to inspect patterns achieved through masked ion implantation via usage of electron transparent membranes as substrates for direct TEM imaging and chemical analysis with nm-resolution.\n\n- Achievement of Co cluster distributions in SiO2 and Si3N4, patterned through 80nm pores into zones of high implantation dose separated spatially from non-implanted regions\n\n- Findings of unusual nanochannel-membrane modulated ion distribution patterns including bell- and ring-shape implantation zones, previously unreported for the nanoscale. This has implications as a novel method of assessing nano-capillary focusing effects for charged particle beams. Beneficiaries include the industrial sectors of information storage, light harvesting, sensors, surface engineering, electronics &amp; integrated circuits, scaffold patterning. \nResearch outcomes are well publicized through journal papers and conference papers and can potentially be transferred to other research fields, such as applied device patterning, not covered in the project so far. The joint know-how between the University of Sheffield's NanoLAB research centre and the University of Surrey's Ion Beam Centre will remain available for follow-on projects in this field.
