Phases 1 and 2 (2012-13) will focus on teaching and developing online resources for 3 pioneer Universities committed to developing the teaching of quantitative skills across undergraduate degrees in social work (Bath, Bedfordshire and Queen's Belfast).</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to provide specialist teaching and increase the use of quantitative data across all elements of the course. This will be supported through an interactive web-based facility will be developed to combine a variety of resources for academics and students, including teaching aids, key texts and interactive lesson plans and activities.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 3 (2013-14) will involve the roll-out of teaching through three 1-day courses, two advanced courses and a mentoring system based on learning sets to up to 12 other universities. In Phase 4 the web resources will be finalised and made available to the whole of the social work academic community.</p>\n\n<p>The project will be evaluated by comparing the knowledge and views of students and staff prior to any changes, after the first year and then at the end of the RDI. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011754/1","grantId":"ES/J011754/1","fundValue":"75880","fundStart":"2012-01-08","fundEnd":"2015-01-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Donald McColl Forrester","coPersons":["John Samuel Carpenter","Barbra  Teater","Jonathan Bryn  Scourfield","John Joseph Devaney"],"organisation":"University of Bedfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
