The use of existing dormancy-breaking treatments, developed for stone fruit crops, will be assessed for their efficacy in blackcurrant, their use optimised, and their mode of action evaluated at a physiological/biochemical level. From this, a new improved product for blackcurrant and 'best practice' guidelines for growers can be developed. Additionally, models predicting responses to the chilling environment for different varieties will be established, and this information will be used to direct the use of dormancy-breaking treatments to improve yield and quality. The project outcomes will directly influence future blackcurrant production in the UK, and will also be applicable to other perennial fruit crops, many of which have high chill requirements and are most productive after cold winters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M026205/1","grantId":"BB/M026205/1","fundValue":"230772","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Vincent Cross","coPersons":[],"organisation":"East Malling Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
