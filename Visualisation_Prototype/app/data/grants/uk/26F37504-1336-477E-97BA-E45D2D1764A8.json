Central to recent shifts in practice and redefinitions of self and community are local Islamist movements, which are engaged in long term projects of transformations of religious practices and subjectivities. Local Islam is enhanced by modernity, the rise of a new middle class and intensifying links to global reformism - factors identifiable from the 1920s, but intensified post 1970s, with the revitalisation of economic life and transformation of Kerala society generally which result from increased migration and business within the Persian Gulf region.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113160/1","grantId":"113160/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-04-02","fundEnd":"2006-07-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Osella","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
