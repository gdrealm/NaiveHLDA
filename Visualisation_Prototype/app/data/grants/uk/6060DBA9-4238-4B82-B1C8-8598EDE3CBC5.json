It is not clear how he had obtained this, and this project forms stage 2 of a modularized investigation of this problem, part of what is now known as 'Radical Enlightenment'. This stage looks at the quarrel in the Royal Society (RS) in 1734, provoked by Bishop Berkeley's publication of The Analyst: a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician, aiming to pick out any evidence of links with France among the discussants and discussions in the Society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119426/1","grantId":"119426/1","fundValue":"26795","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marian Elizabeth Hobson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
