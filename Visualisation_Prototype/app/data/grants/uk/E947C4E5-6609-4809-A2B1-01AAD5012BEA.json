The chicken is a useful animal model because their eyes are a comparable size to humans. \nUsing a genetic approach we will find the defective genes which cause blindness in these birds. The corresponding human diseases will also be found by searching the equivalent human gene for defects in DNA samples from patients with various different inherited eye diseases. \nThis work will increase our understanding of the way the eye works normally, and of ways in which it can go wrong. The identification of the corresponding human condition will allow the early detection of carriers before vision loss has occurred, which will improve the chances for therapy. Where that is not possible, patients and their relatives will benefit from knowing whether they carry the disease, as they will gain a clearer picture of their likely outcome. The availability of chickens with diseases directly equivalent to human eye disease will also help in the search for better treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501050","grantId":"G0501050","fundValue":"288630","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Manir  Ali","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
