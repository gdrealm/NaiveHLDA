{"id":"F722C0D8-0E77-4053-91C5-8CB9E6BC154E","title":"An experimental investigation into the feasibility of MIMO techniques within the HF band","abstractText":"Multi-element antenna arrays have long been employed at receiver sites to obtain spatially separated samples of the incoming wavefield at a receiver which are then combined by a variety of techniques ranging from the simple to the complex to reduce the deleterious effects of multi-path fading. In recent years, the mobile radio community has been investigating techniques in which arrays of antennas are employed at both the transmitter and receiver (rather than just at the receiver as previously) with the aim of significantly increasing the data throughput capacity within a fixed bandwidth by exploiting the presence of multipath propagation. These are known as MIMO (multiple input / multiple output) systems. The aim of this proposed project is to undertake an experimentally based investigation on the potential applicability of MIMO techniques to communications within the HF band.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D036666/1","grantId":"EP/D036666/1","fundValue":"198275","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The US navy has put out a tender to carry out further research on the subject.
