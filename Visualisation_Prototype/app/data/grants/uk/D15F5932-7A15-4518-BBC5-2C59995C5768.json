These activities have created great wealth, but they have also produced huge quantities of solid and liquid waste, known collectively as 'mine waste'. It has been estimated that the quantity of solid mine waste generated throughout the world matches that of Earth materials moved by fundamental global geological processes, at approximately several thousand million tonnes per year. Mine wastes contain toxic antimony (Sb) in concentrations that pose serious hazards to ecosystems, health and livelihoods. Humans can develop problems such as DNA damage and lung cancer from ingestion or inhalation of Sb-bearing particles. The risks posed by exposure to Sb can be mitigated by the formation of insoluble minerals that take up the Sb so it has low bioaccessibility. One such mineral is scorodite, hydrated iron arsenate oxide (FeAsO4.2H20). No one has evaluated the potential for scorodite to take up Sb, even though Sb and As (arsenic) have similar chemical properties, and they have been shown to substitute for one another in other minerals. We have discovered an Sb-rich scorodite in decomposed mine tailings from Bolivia, but the full potential of scorodite to take up Sb has not been investigated. Therefore, this study is aimed at answering the questions 'How efficient is scorodite at taking up Sb compared to As?', What are the chemical and mineralogical properties of Sb-rich scorodites?', and 'What are the predicted bioaccessibilities of Sb-bearing scorodites?' By answering these questions, we will be able to design schemes for remediating Sb-contaminated mine wastes using Sb-bearing scorodites, and thus improve the lives of 10s to 100s of thousands of people worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J01303X/1","grantId":"NE/J01303X/1","fundValue":"49106","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings have not yet been used.

The major source of Sb is mine wastes, in which Sb almost always occurs with arsenic (As). One of the most common As-bearing minerals in these wastes is scorodite (FeAsO4.2H2O), which has the lowest As-bioaccessibility of common mine waste minerals. Natural samples of scorodite were aanalysed by electron microprobe, and these had extremely low concentrations of Sb. We also synthesised scorodites with varying amounts of Sb, and this work showed that the Sb was not taken up in the scorodite, but instead precipitated as the very insoluble phase tripuhyite (FeSbO4). We conclude that Sb is not taken up in scorodite (perhaps due to its larger ionic radius compared to As), and that tripuhyite is a highly stable and perhaps underestimated Sb-sink. We are intending to use the results of our work to apply for a NERC Pathfinder grant, and if this is successful, a Follow-on grant to investigate the antimony phase tripuhyite further.
