Near-IR light provides a good tracer of the mass in evolved stars, and so this survey will be used to constrain the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the evolution of clustering of samples of galaxies selected by stellar mass.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I003088/1","grantId":"ST/I003088/1","fundValue":"1580","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Loveday","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
