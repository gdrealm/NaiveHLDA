{"id":"EC7D7502-92BD-4860-AA7E-9DF5EB80DBA0","title":"Electrophoretic deposition of structured, microwave composites: proof of concept","abstractText":"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a simple cheap way of depositing powders onto a conducting surface. The deposition is uniform and complex geometries can be coated with relative ease. In this short study visit, Paula Vilarinho will help establish the EPD technique at the Department of Engineering Materials, University of Sheffield via technology transfer from her own laboratory. The main purpose is to fabricate thick ceramic films with low dielectric loss that are suitable for filters in microelectronics. Ultimately, it is anticipated that composites can be also be deposited, formed from two components with different permittivities. In this manner the filter frequency can be tailored by altering the volume ratio of the two components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F026889/1","grantId":"EP/F026889/1","fundValue":"29992","fundStart":"2007-11-12","fundEnd":"2008-08-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The techniques introduced to Sheffield by Prof. Vilarinho became the cornestine for the development of an aqueous EPD process which was used to fabricate multilayer antennas for a UK company Sarantel. This has resulted in two large KTP (TSB) grants.\n\nEPD is a process whereby particulates in a suspension are attracted to an electrode in an electric field. The work was first performed on ceramic particles but adapted for polymers and used to develop prototype antennas for GPS.\n\nBeneficiaries: Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics Societal,Economic","person":"Ian Michael Reaney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Electrophoretic deposition techniques were introduced to Sheffield by Prof Vilarinho.
