An alternative, but poorly characterised, potential source of human variation is ?epigenetic? in nature and involves stable changes in the marks and signals that influence local gene activity. Epigenetic phenomena are increasingly invoked as critical factors that affect health. With the exception of cancer, however, the data supporting a role for epigenetics in disease is limited and inconclusive. We have chosen a specific epigenetic phenomenon, CpG island methylation, and will screen human DNA samples from a variety of tissues to look for differences that correlate with age, sex or disease state.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800026","grantId":"G0800026","fundValue":"634247","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Bird","coPersons":["Colin  Smith","Julian  Parkhill"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
