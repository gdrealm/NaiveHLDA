The Programme will provide access to genome analysis for those UK biologists and clinicians who are less used to managing, manipulating and analysing extremely large sequence data sets. CGAT will take advantage of the analytical expertise readily available both from within the MRC Functional Genomics Unit, and from strong interactions with others in the UK genomics research community. The Strategic Programme will aim both to fulfil the promise of high-throughput genome data in answering the most important questions in genetics and human disease, and to train a new generation of genomics researchers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_EX_G1000902","grantId":"MC_EX_G1000902","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2010-04-27","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"","coPersons":[],"organisation":"MRC Functional Genetics Unit","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
