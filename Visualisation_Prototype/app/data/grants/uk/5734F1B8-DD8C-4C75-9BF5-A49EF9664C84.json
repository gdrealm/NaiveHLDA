Fieldwork was carried out in individual communities on the islands Alor and Pantar. Numerous speakers of Alor-Pantar languages were trained in linguistic research methods and made valuable contributions to data collection and analysis. We also invited five language consultants to attend the International Conference of Austronesian Linguistics (ICAL12) in Bali/Indonesia in July 2012, to offer them the opportunity to experience an international linguistics conference and meet an international group of linguists working on languages of Indonesia. Our colleague Marian Klamer from the Leiden subproject gave a talk introducing our research to a general audience on the DOBES (Documentation of endangered languages) Workshop on &quot;Potentials of Language Documentation: Methods, Analyses, and Utilization&quot; at the Max PIanck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, 3-4 November 2011. The Alor-Pantar project produced trilingual dictionaries of the languages Kamang and Teiwa and a 127-item vocabulary for five languages (Adang, Abui, Teiwa, Kaera and Wersing). These were distributed to the local communities.

This AHRC project was part of a larger EuroBabel Collaborative Research Project (CRP), co-ordinated by the European Science Foundation. We worked with colleagues from Leiden University, the Netherlands, who investigated numerical systems and spatial reference in the Alor-Pantar languages, and colleagues from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who worked on language prehistory and toponyms. When the Alor-Pantar CRP started three years ago relatively little was known about these languages. Documentation had only recently begun, and the theoretical linguistic community was largely unaware of the data. The CRP investigated the implications the Alor-Pantar data have for language classification, migration patterns, and morphosyntactic and semantic typology.\n\nIn the Surrey subproject, we investigated the development of the different pronominal marking systems in the languages using a carefully created set of video stimuli, which allowed us to control for different factors.\n\n\n\nKey finding 1: While the forms of the argument-indexing prefixes are very similar in all Alor-Pantar languages the conditions under which arguments are indexed by a prefix on the verb are very different.\n\n\n\nWe investigated the different impact of various semantic factors, such as affectedness, volitionality and animacy, on the patterns of pronominal indexing. For example, Teiwa, a language spoken on Pantar, indexes animate objects on the verb with a prefix, e.g., g-ayas [3SG-throw] 'throw to him/her', whereas inanimate objects are typically not indexed with a prefix. We used cutting edge psycholinguistic elicitation techniques. Starting from existing descriptions of the Alor-Pantar languages and the existing literature on argument realization and semantic alignment, the Surrey project developed a set of 42 video clips and a questionnaire, designed to elicit how various Alor-Pantar languages mark their arguments and the conditions on this marking (one vs. two participants in the event, animacy and volitionality). The video stimuli have been successfully used by the fieldworkers from the other two subprojects and by ourselves. Altogether we covered seven languages: Teiwa, Western Pantar, Adang, Abui, Kamang, Sawila, and Wersing.\n\n\n\nThe results provided by the video elicitation and the questionnaire on pronominal marking are furthering our understanding of the conditions on argument marking both in the Alor-Pantar languages and in a cross-linguistic perspective. While the forms of the argument-indexing prefixes are very similar in all Alor-Pantar languages we found that the conditions under which arguments are indexed by a prefix are very different. There is massive variation in the indexing patterns even between closely related languages. That is, the forms have stayed the same but their uses in different languages vary dramatically.\n\n\n\nKey finding 2: There is a cross-linguistically relevant correlation between semantic alignment and the type of semantic factor involved.\n\n\n\nFollowing on from our investigation of the conditions which individual Alor-Pantar languages impose on how they realize arguments, which was done with the help of the video clips, we studied the distribution of these conditions more closely. We found a cross-linguistically relevant correlation between semantic alignment and the type of semantic factor that is involved. Factors like volitionality and affectedness, which describe a relationship between an event and a participant, play an important part in those languages with semantic alignment (Abui, Kamang), whereas animacy and arbitrary assignment of a verb to a particular class are more important in the syntactically aligned languages (Teiwa, Adang). These results inform current research on the role of referential hierarchies in argument marking as opposed to lexical stipulation.\n\n\n\nKey finding 3: While the agreement typology has clear extremes (i.e., anaphoric vs. grammatical agreement) the Alor-Pantar languages show the need to develop the middle ground of the typology (ambiguous agreement).\n\n\n\nWe extended our work on pronominal marking patterns and applied the perspective of Canonical Typology to the question of what the Alor-Pantar languages can tell us about the standard typology of anaphoric, ambiguous, and grammatical agreement. While the extremes of the typology are clear, the middle ground occupied by ambiguous agreement has to be further articulated by appealing to the facts we find in the Alor-Pantar languages. This research plugs directly into the topical debate about the nature of agreement and its typological variation. \n\n\n\nKey finding 4: Cognates in the Alor-Pantar languages lie at different points on a continuum from independent lexical verbs to clitic postpositions.\n\n\n\nFor this, we concentrated on the role of polyfunctional verbs in the Alor-Pantar languages, i.e., verbs with the basic meanings 'come', 'hold', 'take', 'be in', and 'be on', where we found that cognates in the languages lie at different points on a continuum from independent lexical verbs to clitic postpositions, a finding which is of significance for the typology of word classes.\n\n\n\nThe success of the Alor-Pantar CRP lies not only in the results of the individual subprojects but in the continuing collaboration between the subprojects. The initial design of the video stimuli was subsequently improved, drawing on the local knowledge of our colleagues to make the clips adequate in the cultural context of the Alor-Pantar languages. The data collected in the field by means of the video stimuli helped refine our typology of pronominal marking patterns and the interpretations drawn from the analysis of these data led to further hypotheses which could then be tested in the field. Due to the collaborative nature of the Alor-Pantar CRP we contributed to the other subprojects, but we also gained from the insights of their work, allowing us to achieve more progress than we could have made alone.\n\n\n\nIt is vital to have done this work now: the Alor-Pantar languages are severely endangered but still have sufficient vitality to provide additional supporting documentation without difficulty. The quality of Alor-Pantar language data is likely to decline significantly over the next two decades as language shift progresses. Our findings can be used by typologists to refine their typologies of syntactic and semantic alignment systems and their typologies of the impact of semantic factors, such as animacy, volitionality and affectedness, in the encoding of participants in an event. Our findings also can be used to better describe and further the Alor-Pantar languages, all of which are severely endangered and need to be documented and described now.\n\nOur video stimuli can be used by linguists doing empirical research.\n\nAll findings and results can be accessed at http://www.alor-pantar.surrey.ac.uk/ Education","dataset":"gtr"}
