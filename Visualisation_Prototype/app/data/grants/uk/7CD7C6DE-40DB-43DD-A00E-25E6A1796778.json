This event caused widespread disruption over much of the region, and captured national attention when extreme weather conditions prompted a full scale emergency response to extreme local and regional flooding; and widespread erosion of hillslopes and river channels. Erosion during extreme events in upland and mountain regions dominates erosion over the short-term and conditions longer term landscape development. However, little is known about these events and in particular, the relative contribution of slopes and river channels to erosion. This is important because future climate change scenarios suggest an increased frequency of high intensity storm events which can remobilise old contaminated sediment stores typical of many upland industrialised landscapes. Quantifying erosion during extreme events is therefore crucial so that effective hazard management can be undertaken in the short term and long-term spatially targeted management strategies devised. When documenting flood events an urgent response is required so that key evidence of the flood is not lost as subsequent rainfall erodes landslide scars and debris deposits; and floodplain high water marks (wrack lines) and sediments are rapidly masked by vegetation or disturbed by clean up operations. Capturing 'fresh' evidence means that processes can be catalogued directly and not inferred at a later date. The project is split into three phases: intensive fieldwork; data compilation and management; and GIS analysis/sediment budget construction. This will enable us to (1) clearly establish linkages and pathways of sediment flux in upland catchments; (2) determine the relative importance of bare and vegetated slopes in contributing sediment to upland river channels; and (3) evaluate the significance of storage in controlling the downstream flux of sediment. The project will build on previously funded NERC research in the same catchment by using existing data sources and scientific understanding to evaluate the significance of this event. This includes a unique catchment geomorphic baseline survey, of a similar large flood from January 2005, which already includes a GIS describing the topography, soil, geomorphology and vegetation of the catchment and an extensive data base of soil properties (geotechnical properties, bulk density, etc.). The occurrence of two very large upland floods in 2005 and 2008 in the same catchment allows direct comparison between the floods in the same valley in terms of sediment dynamics and the persistence of flood related geomorphic features in the landscape. In particular we can identify useful characteristics for differentiating landslide scars of differing age which are closely clustered in time. Establishing 'best practice' for identifying evidence from a single flood is very important for extreme event analysis and statistics which rely on 'substantially complete' inventories of erosion features from single events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G015309/1","grantId":"NE/G015309/1","fundValue":"10905","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Publications from this work are still only in draft form.

Erosion during extreme flood events in upland regions dominates sediment fluxes over the short-term and conditions the longer term geomorphic activity of river systems. However, the sediment dynamics of extreme floods cannot be easily quantified due to lack of background data. This research assessed slope and river sediment dynamics in response to an extreme upland flood which occurred in a small mountain catchment (6 km2) in Northern England (October 2008). The study is unusual because the 2008 flood occurred in the same catchment where a sediment budget had just been completed for a previous flood in 2005 and during the project a third large flood (November 2009) also occurred. This provided an exceptional opportunity to gather a complete sediment budget of the 2008 event and compare the floods in terms of sediment dynamics and the persistence of flood related features in the landscape. \n\n\n\nIntensive field survey and spatial analysis using a detailed catchment geomorphic baseline survey which includes topography, soil properties, geomorphology and vegetation are used to construct a sediment budget. Survey has documented flood extents and produced an inventory of geomorphic features which include: several large landslides (showing a range of channel coupling - including uncoupled, partly coupled and fully coupled); gully erosion and first order channel incision; extensive channel erosion (scour holes, local incision and widespread bank undercutting); extensive sedimentation (overbank splays and major channel avulsion). Based on this information it was possible to satisfy four of the primary objectives:\n\n• Undertake rapid reconnaissance and field survey of the main impacts of the flood concentrating on slope and channel erosion and sedimentation features (completed).\n\n• Quantify the significance of landslide events in terms of hillslope sediment production and delivery to stream channels.\n\n• Quantify the magnitude of channel erosion and floodplain sediment storage within the tributary and main stem channel.\n\n• Combine this information into a sediment budget model, with a full error budget will also be constructed to constrain uncertainty of the valley sediment system in order to determine the relative significance of slope and channel erosion. \n\n\n\nResults could then be compared with measured impacts in the same valley from the January 2005 and November 2009 flood events. Results demonstrate that sediment transfer is an inefficient process in upland catchment systems but differs according to the dominant geomorphic process (debris flow, landslide, stream incision) and spatial occurrence. Generally, high rates of erosion only manifest themselves at the local scale with areas of catchment disturbance (historic mining) acting as significant sediment sources. Low sediment delivery results from inefficient coupling between slope-channel linkages and headwater-mainstream channels. Overall, upland sediment systems are complex systems and need full (catchment) sediment budgets to fully understand them. These include:\n\nThe National Trust, Lake District National Park Authority, Environment Agency and Natural England.\n\nResults have been used to help inform choices of appropriate responses to upland flood events and discussing catchment zones that are 'at risk' from erosion and sedimentation. As part of the project a number of key stake holders have been involved. These include the National Trust, Lake District National Park Authority, Environment Agency and Natural England.
