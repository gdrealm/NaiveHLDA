Differenttheories have been used to elucidate different aspects of turbulentvortex motion. All models, except for the microscopically accurate GP model thatcan not be used to study large-scale dynamics, are largelyphenomenological. Our research will allow a cross-fertilisation between these theories and will replace mostly phenomenological models withrigorously derived stochastic equations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D032407/1","grantId":"EP/D032407/1","fundValue":"140840","fundStart":"2006-03-13","fundEnd":"2009-03-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalia  Berloff","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
