{"id":"77678CF7-FC73-4814-B389-A95683B39F4A","title":"Support for the UK Car-Parrinello Consortium","abstractText":"Many technological advances in modern day life are dependent upon the development of new materials or better control and understanding of existing materials. Understanding the detailed properties of materials has therefore never been more important. The development of high quality computer simulation techniques has played an increasing significant role in this endeavour over recent years. The UK has been at the forefront of this new wave, and the UKCP consortium has played an important part, in both developing computer codes and algorithms, and exploiting these new advances to increase our understanding of many industrially relevant materials and processes.The research described in this proposal will make significant impacts on many areas of future technology, such as the development of new materials for hydrogen storage which will be necessary for zero-pollution cars in the future, the development of new materials for alternative computer memory technologies, and the development of new carbon-based nano-sized electronic components that could replace silicon altogether.Other parts of this proposal seek to develop new algorithms and theoretical improvements that will increase our simulation abilities, either by increasing the accuracy and reliability of calculations, or by enabling us to simulate bigger systems for longer. These will enable the next generation of simulations and further widen our computational horizons.The research proposed does not easily fit into any of the traditional categories of 'physics' or 'chemistry' etc. Instead, the UKCP is a multi-disciplinary consortium using a common theoretical foundation to advance many different areas of materials-based science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037325/1","grantId":"EP/F037325/1","fundValue":"7706","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The DNA Radiation Damage project has received a significant attention from the academic community, and also some from Cancer researchers closer to the clinical stage. This research underpins the molecular mechanisms for radiation damage, and thus is it quite remote from a direct impact. It is, however, expected that in the future these ideas will serve to the design of radiotherapies, but this is no in sight yet.

The nature of the research carried out was quite varied, but essentially focused on the study of irradiation processes in a variety of systems.\n\nThe main focus was on damage of biological matter. The study was started in 2009 with PhD student M. Smyth, and two papers in top journals were published, which were the basis for the subsequent activity, still running. This study showed that electrons generated by ionization of the biological medium are very rapidly captured by DNA components, and then lead to bond breaking due to the weakening effect of the captured electron. The bonds broken are related to DNA strand breaks, which are connected to the ability of cell to replicate. If sufficient DNA breaks are accumulated, then the cell arrest cycle is triggered.\n\nA second application was the study of the irradiation of amorphous solid water by Carbon (neutral and ionic) projectiles, in a first attempt to understand the dynamics of the formation of organic molecules in the cosmic environment, e.g. due to solar wind and other sources. We have discovered a range of mechanisms that start from the formation of HCOH, the isomerization to formaldehyde, and the successive route to the synthesis of methanol. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms of DNA radiation damage is particularly relevant within the context of radiotherapies, and also in the assessment of dangers posed by radiation to living creatures. For example, harnessing the full potential of various types of radiation with minimal collateral damage requires a molecular-level understanding, which depends on the particular source of radiation.\n\nAlso, the same methodology was used within a different context, which is the degradation of solvents used to store radioactive material. The main message is that it can be used to study any situation in which excess electrons are generated by irradiation. Chemicals,Energy,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
