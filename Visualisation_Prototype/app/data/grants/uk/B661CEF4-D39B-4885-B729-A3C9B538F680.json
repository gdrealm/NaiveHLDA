NV centres can be grown-in, produced by irradiation damage plus annealing where by pre-existing\nsubstitutional nitrogen captures a mobile vacancy, or produced by nitrogen ion implantation plus annealing. In the bulk\n(typically 10 mirco-m from the surface) NV centres can have exceptional quantum properties but these are typically\nsignificantly degraded close to a surface due to subsurface damage (e.g. micro-cracks, trapped charge, parasitic spins,\nstrain) produced by polishing. Even though diamond can be mechanically polished (e.g. with small diamond particles\nembedded in a cast iron wheel) with low surface roughness (&lt; 1 nm), the sub-surface regions are damaged. As grown\nsurfaces are not sufficiently flat for many applications but current &quot;polishing&quot; technology significantly impairs the\nperformance of near surface NV centres so a new technology that can be easily transferred to production is required.\nThis project focuses on the implementation and optimisation of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of single crystal\ndiamond to achieve both low (&lt;&lt; 1 nm) surface roughness and low surface damage such that the touted supreme and\nexploitable quantum properties of near surface (&lt; 50 nm) NV centres are fully realised. Moreover, this work will facilitate the\nroutine production of very thin (&lt; 30 mirco-m) large area single crystal diamond plates with optimised surface finishes.\nThere is considerable demand for this material for a variety of photonic and quantum technologies; here CMP is an\nenabler.\nThe research programme will provide irrefutable evidence that CMP of diamond is a quantum technology enabler.\nTraditional polishing techniques such as standard resin bond and scaife polishing are known to produce different damage\nprofiles that affect the near surface NV centres. ICP etching is currently the standard tool used to make quantum devices\nout of diamond but is also known to impart damage to the diamond. Hence, studies on NVs near to a variety of differently\npolished, etched and as-grown surfaces, as well as those in the bulk will be employed to bench-mark against the CMP\nprocess.\nCharacterisation of near surface NV centres will be achieved using (i) high resolution single centre confocal\nphotoluminescence microscopy which enables statistical analysis of the properties of NV's e.g. probability of production,\nstability, sensitivity to surface termination etc., with respect to distance from the top surface and surface processing\nmethodology (e.g. CMP, etching, termination etc.) and (ii) optically detected magnetic resonance, using state of the art high\nthrough-put equipment under ambient conditions and at cryogenic temperatures. This provides information on the allimportant\nspin lifetime of individual centres as a function of depth, surface preparation and processing. There is expected to be a significant statistical variation of the NVs properties due to other uncontrolled parameters on the nanoscale (i.e.\nlocation of 13C, substitutional nitrogen, dislocations, surface spins, surface charges), hence the statistical analysis is\nessential.\nNear surface NV centres will be implanted (and annealed) after and before the CMP polishing process using low energy ion\nimplantation (via collaboration, at no cost to program, with Jan Meijer, Leipzig University) and fully characterised. Low\nenergy ion implantation provides the ultimate control in NV positioning ideal for device manufacture, and is an ideal way to\ndemonstrate that CMP can significantly improve the yield of useful near surface implanted NV centres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508305/1","grantId":"EP/M508305/1","fundValue":"95983","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Edward Newton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
