{"id":"FD75232B-6FCF-4BFB-AA13-DA326F4A8324","title":"Warwick Symposium on Algebraic Geometry 2007-08","abstractText":"Algebraic geometry studies the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. These solution sets are called algebraic varieties, and are viewed as geometric locuses, generalising the circle and hyperbola of analytic geometry. Algebraic geometry is a mature subject, and the geometric points of view and the extensive toolbox it provides for studying varieties apply to a great many problem in mathematics and its applications.Algebraic curves occur as the locus f(x,y)=0 in the plane, where f is a polynomial function of x and y; in low degree (conics and cubics) one gets useful conclusions by explicit manipulations of the equation, but as the degree of f increases, the kind of conclusions one hopes for are more abstract, and necessarily involve more theoretical machinery. One eventually learns to stop worrying that the points of the curve are not parametrised in terms of anything more elementary, and to accept the curve as a primary object of nature, possibly complicated, but to be understood in its own terms and used in subsequent constructions.Rather than the degree, a better invariant of an algebraic curve is its genus, that is, the number of handles (donut-like holes) in its topological model. Especially important is the case division between the three cases g=0 (a sphere) or g=1 (a donut) or g&gt;=2 (a surface with many handles); the case g=1 gives the elliptic curves, that played a key role in Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. For algebraic curves or Riemann surfaces, this trichotomy was clearly perceived already in the 19th century, together with its interpretation in terms of positively curved, flat, or hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry; the picture of the three cases g=0 or g=1 or g&gt;=2 serves as an icon for the whole subject.The same trichotomy was a distant model for Mori theory or the classification of higher dimensional varieties, one of the most intensively developed area of algebraic geometry from the late 1970s; this work led to Mori's 1990 Fields medal. This classification is at present the subject of a major breakthrough, with the recent announcement of the proof of the minimal model program in all dimensions. The first component of the Warwick symposium will develop and disseminate these new result, and exploit its many applications.Algebraic varieties, the solution sets of simultaneous polynomial equations, provide examples and techniques in number theory and in theoretical physics, in algebra and singularity theory and in other branches of geometry. Even in analysis, which mostly deals in infinite dimensional spaces, the ultimate aim is frequently a reduction to a finite dimensional solution set modelled on algebraic geometry. The Warwick symposium will include components on each of these topics, together with applications of algebraic geometry to other areas of mathematics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E060382/1","grantId":"EP/E060382/1","fundValue":"164568","fundStart":"2007-08-15","fundEnd":"2010-08-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Miles  Reid","coPersons":["Samir  Siksek","Alessio  Corti","Gavin Dennis Brown"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" The 2007-2008 Warwick EPSRC Symposium on Algebraic Geometry ran an extended program of workshops and research activities involving many UK, European and world experts. One of the main highlights was the recent breakthrough on the Higher Dimensional Minimal Model Program based around finite generation of canonical rings. This topic formed the backdrop to several of the workshops, but the symposium also contained periods promoting explicit methods in algebraic geometry, arithmetic algebraic geometry, commutative algebra methods, moduli theory, and other topics in modern algebraic geometry.
