{"id":"368DC486-B2F1-47DD-82FD-5193CCC12EA7","title":"Digital Building Heritage: Phase II","abstractText":"De Montfort University has world leading expertise in the development and use of digital technologies to explore, visualize, interpret and present historic buildings and the people and artifacts associated with them. This project gives eleven community heritage groups in the UK the opportunity to work with De Montfort University to learn how to best use these technologies to understand and present their own buildings and the physical and cultural heritage associated with them. Working with these community heritage groups De Montfort University will prepare 3D digital reconstructions of their buildings, each one specifically tailored to the needs of each community heritage group and will assist with enabling the presentation of these reconstructions and associated information by the groups on mobile devices (Apps), mobile enabled web-sites, digital museum displays and exhibition installations. The groups will be also be assisted in techniques of information gathering, survey, and archival searching for the information required to build these reconstructions and will take an active part in developing, testing and evaluating the on-line and exhibition presentation of the results. Experience has shown that this form of initial, assisted engagement with digital technologies rapidly leads to self selected, in-house uptake within community heritage organizations. Part of the reflective aspect of this project will be for De Montfort University researchers to learn from the community heritage groups in a process of co-production about how these digital technologies may be most appropriately developed and used in the in the future to meet the aspirations of society for tools to better explore and shape our understanding of built heritage and its wider historical context. The project will continue to have a public presence based around the existing high quality website linking community heritage groups, De Montfort University and the wider public and will be further developed to act as a best-practice vehicle for the eleven projects that that will be co-produced by De Montfort University with its community heritage group partners under this programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007610/1","grantId":"AH/K007610/1","fundValue":"71671","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings of this project have been influential in shaping an approach to co-production of digital heritage visualization and interpretation assets which fully involves community heritage groups in promoting their aims and objectives.

It substantially enabled them to co-produce with De Montfort University substantive digital heritage assets that ultimately assisted them in their organisational aims and objectives. De Montfort University held a highly successful AHRC sponsored conference/open day and technology fair in May 2012 which started this process and led to this grant award. It also held two one day workshops in November 2012 to flesh out the specifics of potential projects with eleven community heritage groups and firmly established collaborative partnerships between De Montfort University and the eleven community heritage groups. This project then began in January 2013 with the overall objective of making exemplary use of digital technologies to further their organizational aims and assist them in exploring, visualizing, interpreting and sustaining the historic buildings, artefacts and the wider local heritage they care for. Specifically the project met its aims of:\n1) Providing opportunities for real knowledge exchange, support and enablement between De Montfort University researchers and community heritage groups.\n2) Affording substantive opportunities for early career researchers and established academics to develop co-produced community heritage oriented research pathways that explore the interface between history and digital technologies.\n3) Broadening the engagement of De Montfort University as a positive moral and practical agency with the wider public interest in local, regional, virtual and remote communities' heritage.\n4) Contributing to the ongoing development by the HLF of a digital archive of community heritage.\n5) Assisting the AHRC, the HLF and the NCCPE in reviewing and evaluating the Research for Community Heritage initiatives and contribute to on-line forums, liaise as necessary with the HLF and participate in related outreach activity and events. The digital heritage outputs co-produced with the eleven community heritage groups are all in the public domain and and have encouraged by a range of other groups and businesses to adopt digital technologies for understanding and interpreting their heritage. This project and its findings has led to a further Research AHRC funded research project Grant Reference: AH/L013290/1, Title: Digital Building Heritage: Phase 3 to explore with two further community heritage groups in collaboration with the Universities of Nottingham and Durham more technologically advanced methods of self determined heritage interpretation by community heritage groups.
