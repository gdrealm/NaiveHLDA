{"id":"F4DE2ACC-11A6-49ED-8726-D13364D2C0CA","title":"The natural history and NHS service use of women with depression and impact on children in a multi-ethnic inner-city population","abstractText":"Between 5 to 13 percent of women have symptoms of depression during or after a pregnancy. Some of these women go to their GP with symptoms, are correctly identified as depressed and undergo treatment. However, for various reasons some women who feel depressed do not go to their GP. Some will go to their GP but will fail to be recognised as depressed and so will not be offered treatment. Older research indicates that about half of all women at risk of depression remain undiagnosed (either do not go to the GP or fail to be diagnosed by their GP). This estimate may be out of date. Untreated, in addition to the poor quality of life experienced by the woman, it is well documented that maternal depression can affect some children and families; leading to relationship breakdown, poor child behaviour and emotional well-being and reduced cognitive development. For some children, this translates in later life to difficulties in school, problems with relationships, increased levels of aggression and poor mental health themselves. These potentially preventable disabilities come at great personal cost, as well as high financial costs to the NHS and social care agencies, the criminal justice system, and wider society. \n\nOur research involves examining electronic GP records for a large number of mothers (~13,000) who have already elected to participate in a research study. The women live in an ethnically diverse economically deprived city in the UK; factors that make them more at risk for depression than the general UK population. They have consented for us to look at their NHS records. Using record linkage in this way allows us to look at routine NHS data in addition to extensive social, economic data and measures of mental health that have been collected through the research study. This is called an enhanced dataset and will allow us to explore a number of issues that are important to the health of mothers and their families. \n\nUsing this enhanced dataset we can calculate the number of women who have been identified by the research study as being depressed during their pregnancy but have no GP record of depressive symptoms. We can then provide an updated estimate of the percentage of women whom we already know to be depressed, but who are unidentified to the NHS as depressed. We will then look at the economic and social profiles of three groups of women; those who are unidentified as depressed, those identified as depressed and those who are not depressed. This will enable us to understand in what circumstances unidentified women live and may provide clues about how the NHS can provide services to reach them. \n\nOne in ten of these women (~1,300) have been followed up with questionnaires about their lifestyle, circumstances and mental health every six months or so since the birth of their child. These children are now around 3-4 years old and their mothers have recently assessed their child's behaviour using a standardised questionnaire. We can combine this assessment of child behaviour with our classification of the mother's mental health (not depressed, treated for depression, not identified as depressed) to estimate any impact on children. This information might help future researchers more accurately predict how much untreated depression costs the NHS. We can also use the enhanced dataset to understand whether the circumstances of some of the women, for example their ethnicity, their marital or economic situation, and their parenting skills protect their children from having behavioural problems. This will help us understand mental health inequality and identify groups of children most at risk of developing behavioural problems so services such as parenting programmes can be targeted.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J013501/1","grantId":"MR/J013501/1","fundValue":"176930","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate Elizabeth Pickett","coPersons":["John  Wright","Simon Martin Gilbody","Stephanie  Prady","Emily  Petherick"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
