{"id":"B1E2A412-0255-4152-BCFE-D810FE273CF7","title":"Regulation of axon growth; the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta","abstractText":"The proper functioning of the nervous system depends on the connections that nerve cells form with each other and with tissues such as muscle. Nerve cells form connections in the embryo by extending fine processes called neurites that grow through the embryo seeking their appropriate connecting cell. At the tip of a growing neurite is a motile structure called a growth cone that masterminds the search in the embryo for the connecting cell and leads the neurite to it. The formation and growth of neurites and their growth cones involves the building of a skeleton (cytoskeleton) within the cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure and growing nerve cells exploit this property to support the extension of neurites and the motility of the growth cone. The research proposed will try to understand how the neurite cytoskeleton is organised in growth cones so that neurite growth and growth cone motility can occur properly. In particular, how an important class of filaments called microtubules, that form part of the cytoskeleton of neurites and growth cones, are organised and their dynamic behaviour controlled will be studied. This research will not only help us to understand a fundamental process in nervous system development but it will also contribute to the effort to repair damaged nervous systems in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400034","grantId":"G0400034","fundValue":"497981","fundStart":"2004-11-15","fundEnd":"2008-07-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Phillip Robert Gordon-Weeks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
