{"id":"2E541CFF-6142-4910-ABB1-57B6D8AB9772","title":"Bio-functionalised Nanomaterials for Ultrasensitive Biosensing","abstractText":"This proposal aims to transform the way that we can currently detect disease through innovations in the design and development of nanomaterials-based systems. The proposed ultrasensitive detection of disease biomarkers in clinical samples is very broad in impact and important for diseases as diverse as cancer and global health applications. The proposed technologies will offer significantly greater sensitivity than current standard tests, and will constitute a significant step-change towards a new generation of sophisticated and high performance point-of-care diagnostic platforms. They will combine the advanced functional properties of custom-engineered nanomaterials with tailored biomolecular recognition chemistries to create sensors capable of rapidly detecting extremely low abundance biomarkers and yielding quantitative information through easily interpretable signalling mechanisms (e.g. simple by eye detection of colour changes). Importantly, the work will be performed in close collaboration with clinical partners to maximise translational potential.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K020641/1","grantId":"EP/K020641/1","fundValue":"1545350","fundStart":"2013-10-14","fundEnd":"2018-10-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are currently engineering a variety of diagnostic technological systems so that they exhibit the best performances as biosensing technologies with potential for translation.
