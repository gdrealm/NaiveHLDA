{"id":"D7385EC5-DD1E-49BE-9A7D-85C1F387548B","title":"Negotiating identity and representation in the mediated Armed Forces.","abstractText":"<p>This research is about how British military personnel (primarily members of the British Army) are portrayed and represented. The ways in which the figure of the soldier is represented, particularly in the print media, are significant to contemporary public debates about the role of the military in society. These representations are important because for most of us the media is the primary source of our information about the Armed Forces and the men and women who serve in it. Furthermore, these representations are important not so much because they may be ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, but for the more nuanced and slippery messages and understandings that media portrayals convey. We will be studying key national mass-circulation daily and weekly newspapers, looking at both text and image to investigate how soldiers are portrayed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> \n<p>But what about people serving in the Armed Forces themselves? We are interested not only in civilian views of the Armed Forces as they appear in the print media, but also in military personnel’s views of themselves and how they relate to civilian culture. We will therefore be looking at how military personnel represent themselves by talking to serving and former soldiers about their snapshots and other photographs. We think that this will give us a valuable insight into soldiers’ views about themselves to compare with the portrayals we will observe in the print media.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-0992","grantId":"RES-000-23-0992","fundValue":"74994","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Findings of interest to academics working on military topics.
