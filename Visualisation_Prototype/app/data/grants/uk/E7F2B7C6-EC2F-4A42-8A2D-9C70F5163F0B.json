Interest groups have become key vehicles for transmitting diverse interests to public policy processes. There is, however, some controversy regarding ‘bias’ in the group system. The implication being that the mobilisation of different interests is uneven and, further, that access to, and participation in, the public policy process is also uneven.</p> \n<p>Against this backdrop, the research will address the pattern of mobilisation by organised interests (such as interest groups and civil society organisations) within political systems, using Scotland as a case study example. The broad aim of the project is to empirically map the incidence and mobilisation of interest groups in the Scottish ‘group system’.&nbsp;This will be achieved through analysis of public consultations conducted by government in Scotland, before and after devolution. The involvement of groups will be noted on an issue by issue basis, and then issue level data aggregated to develop a Scotland wide picture.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E007074/1","grantId":"ES/E007074/1","fundValue":"75954","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Darren Richard Halpin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Robert Gordon University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
