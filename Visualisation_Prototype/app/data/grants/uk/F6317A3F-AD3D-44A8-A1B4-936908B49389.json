Prevention, early detection and strategic mitigation are all critical to effective policy intervention, especially in domains where coordinated responses are required. Every day, about 10,000 incidents are reported by citizens, recorded and geo-referenced in the London Metropolitan Police Service Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) database. Today, impending funding cuts bring new pressures for central accountability and improved efficiency, while community empowerment initiatives bring new opportunities and challenges to policing. Timely understanding of how criminality emerges and how crime patterns evolve is crucial to anticipating crime, dealing with it when it occurs and developing public confidence in the police service. It is widely understood that policing, crime and public trust all have strong spatial and temporal dimensions. An integrated approach to space-time analysis is needed in order to analyse crime patterns, police activity patterns and community characteristics, so as to understand and predict the when, where and what of how criminal activities emerge and are sustained.\n\nThis research will consolidate achievements in integrated spatio-temporal data mining and emergent network complexity to uncover patterning in crime, policing and citizen perceptions at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Each dataset of police movement, crime (and disorder) reported in the CAD, and citizens making '999' calls constitutes a spatio-temporal network (STN), which has its own characteristic patterning and behaviour in space-time, and which interacts with the other STNs. The (geotagged) deployment of police manpower in space and time, the spatio-temporal patterning of crime and disorder, and the perceptions of members of the public are likely to be interlinked to differing extents. The first of these purportedly both anticipates and responds to the second, while the third is a lagged response to the first two, giving reason to anticipate that all three networks should be tightly coupled. The project will first analyse spatio-temporal patterns of individual STNs, then associate the patterns among these STNs via integrated spatio-temporal data mining developed using innovative statistical regression and machine learning.\n\nThis research will utilise a range of disciplines (crime, geography, geoinformatics, and computer science) to help engineer effective practical solutions to crime problems. It proposes a new method for exploring crime patterns and integrating information on crime and police activity. It systematically addresses a structured programme of analytical issues in spatio-temporal data mining, which are becoming core to Geographical Information Sciences. It will advance the theory, methodology and application of research into network complexity by evaluating the forms and interactions of the networks that characterise crime and other socio-economic phenomena. This will make it possible to not only understand activity networks but also to use them for prediction and decision making. \n\nThis addresses the aims of RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme in crime, terrorism, and ideologies and beliefs. It will extend our appreciation of the subtle interplay of different forms of complex systems, in ways that will contextualise tactical and strategic responses to terrorism and organised crime. It will enable intelligent policing of London Met Police by granting unforeseen levels of prediction. The best practice of individual Metropolitan boroughs can be extended to others in the UK. The methodology developed here will be transferrable to other international cities using similar incident report systems. This will directly benefit people who live, work and visit London and those cities to make them feel safe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J004197/1","grantId":"EP/J004197/1","fundValue":"1400230","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At this stage of the project lifecycle, there are no explicit uses of CPC research outputs outside of academia. Nonetheless, by fostering an interdisciplinary discussion about the ways in which our research can have positive impacts on policing and public satisfaction, we are now well-placed to deliver practical solutions in the next phase of the project. \n\nBy engaging with the MPS, through a day trip to the communications centre, a meeting with the Chief Superintendent of Camden, and regular discussions with our industrial representative, we have made a contribution to policing by stimulating discussion. In demonstrating the potential of the CPC project, we have improved awareness amongst the MPS of the current state of the art in spatio-temporal data mining and predictive policing, as well as indicating our expectations for future advances. In particular, we anticipate that CPC will contribute to 'Digital Policing' through improved policing efficiency, higher crime capture rates, lower patrol costs and higher public confidence and satisfaction.

This represents a highly interdisciplinary consensus of the complex issues involved in modern police patrol, the ways in which new spatio-temporal approaches can contribute and support police, how such methods should be assessed for accuracy and operational usefulness, and the interplay between crime, policing and citizens' perception of the police. This definition is a formalised and detailed statement of the core vision of the CPC project and is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive and interdisciplinary overview of the problem area constructed to date. We are currently preparing a review article describing our findings.\n\nThe CPC project has also made several major advances in each of the three areas: crime, policing and citizenship.\n\nCrime - We have developed three novel, complementary approaches to provide forecasts of where and when crimes are likely to occur. Each of these represents an important methodological advance, and articles are being prepared for submission in each case. First, we have identified a quantitative measure of street connectivity that shows significant correlation with real crime events. Second, we are extending an established predictive model of the spread of crime using the street network as the underlying spatial structure. The result, combining aspects of machine learning and network theory, is a more realistic representation of the processes leading up to crime events. Third, spatio-temporal clustering methods are being developed to forecast emerging regions/streets with significantly elevated crime.\n\nPolicing - We have developed a comprehensive agent-based simulation of police vehicle movements within Camden, based on the Camden street network and real reported crime data. Police officers' actions are simulated following a comprehensive set of tasking rules, developed through conversations with active police officers. The construction of such a set of rules is an important output, since it formalises the complex process of police patrols in an algorithmic sense. By analysing various scenarios this simulation allows us to test a wide range of hypotheses concerning aspects such as police route choices, response to emergency calls and the effect of police station closures. We are in the process of submitting a journal article describing this simulation framework and the associated findings. We have also developed machine learning techniques to describe observed foot patrol movements, enabling the direct comparison of behaviours of different foot patrol officers. \n\nCitizenship - Using data from the Public Attitude Survey, we have carried out a thorough analysis of the factors that affect public perception of the police within London. Survey responses have been combined with a London-based geodemographic classification, indicating that public satisfaction varies much more by borough than by geodemographic group. This finding has important implications for the MPS, which is currently seeking to improve public satisfaction. A paper detailing these results has been submitted. A local spatio-temporal model for public perception of policing is being developed that will address the large observed variation by time and location. The outputs from the CPC project have important implications for several key stakeholders.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, the outcomes of CPC represent several important contributions to the fields of crime science, spatiotemporal data modelling and mining, and applied network theory. We have taken many opportunities to engage with the wider scientific community through conferences, invited talks and seminars. Through the involvement of other academic groups, we hope that the findings of CPC will be applied in a wider context and in areas beyond the scope of CPC. For example, the network-based models may also be applicable to road safety, the movement analysis methods have applications in movement ecology, and the cluster detection methods are related to indicators of disease outbreak.\n\nA second key stakeholder is the London MPS, an industrial partner in the CPC project. We have engaged with the MPS chief superintendent for the London borough of Camden in order to gain an expert opinion on how our findings might be made operationally useful. This is a very important aspect for CPC since one of the project's main aims is to improve and support police. The development of operational policing software is beyond the scope of CPC, however we aim to develop the methods underlying an integrated police support application. This would provide patrolling police officers with a real-time guidance application that aids their decisions to optimise crime reduction, visibility and public satisfaction. The findings of CPC will naturally be transferable to policing in other big cities in the UK, EU and world-wide.
