Hakluyt's landmark work, The Principal Navigations, is the single most important collection of English travel ever published. This massive 3-volume folio, comprising approximately 1.75 million words, was instrumental in promoting English expansion through colonial and trade ventures around the globe and in defining an understanding of English identity. Yet, despite its significance, no critical edition of The Principal Navigations (1598-1600) with explanatory annotations has ever been published. \n\nThe new edition of Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations will be published in 14 volumes in a rolling programme beginning in 2016, and finishing in 2019. The new edition will satisfy a widely perceived scholarly need and answer a general demand for a quality edition of Hakluyt's text with full editorial apparatus. The edition will be unabridged and presented with minimal modernization. Editorial apparatus will make Hakluyt's text more comprehensible and available, and will create a new generation of readers able to appreciate the scope and depth of this definitive record of early English maritime enterprise and travel.\n\nHakluyt organised The Principal Navigations by geographical region. For this edition, the text has been divided into 14 regional volumes. It is anticipated that when complete each edited volume will be approximately 200,000-250,000 words. The first folio volume of The Principal Navigations (1598), which covers the north and north-east, has been divided into 4 volumes for this OUP edition. Volume 1, Medieval Voyages, will be edited by Professor Sebastian Sobecki, University of Groningen; Volume 2, Medieval Voyages and the English in Muscovy will be edited by Dr Angela Byrne, National University of Ireland, Maynooth and Professor Sebastian Sobecki, University of Groningen; Volume 3, Persia and Muscovy Voyages will be edited by Professor Ladan Niayesh, University of Paris VII and Professor Ralph Cleminson, University of Portsmouth; Volume 4, Muscovy, Iceland, Armada, Cadiz will be edited by Professor Anna Agnarsd&oacute;ttir, University of Iceland, Professor Michael Brennan, University of Leeds, and Dr Felicity Stout, Sheffield University. Byrne and Stout are Early Career Researchers, and though both have been paired with established and experienced academics on their respective volumes, the planned Editorial Workshops will be particularly helpful in supporting their work.\n\nThe General Editors, in consultation with the publisher, have appointed an international Editorial Board and Editorial Advisory Board of experts who will provide advice on editorial philosophy, textual scholarship, geographical and historical context; navigational issues; place names; translations, and other key matters. The Editorial Board has been convened to assist the General Editors and to provide oversight for the project, and the Editorial Advisory Board has been established to offer advice on specialist aspects of the text. Key members of the Editorial Board, including the Project's Textual Editor, Anthony Payne, will attend the proposed Workshops. It is intended that developments in editorial policy arising from the 3 Editorial Workshops will be disseminated amongst the volume editors of the remaining 10 volumes in order to encourage best practice in volumes published later in the rolling programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L000687/1","grantId":"AH/L000687/1","fundValue":"27258","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Elaine Jowitt","coPersons":["Daniel  Carey"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" The organisation of Editorial Workshops (June 2013 and June 2014) by PI/CI enabled existing editorial protocols to be reinforced amongst attending team members, and emergent issues that volume editors were experiencing or finding difficult to be discussed and resolved. The workshops both enabled the refinement of processes, e.g. in the editing of Neo-Latin, and allowed them to be communicated to the team. \nVolume Editors are currently editing the travel texts included in their volumes in line with project protocols. At each workshop an editor presents to other editors and members of the project Editorial Board a draft of a text s/he has edited and it is discussed, critiqued, and best practice is shared. Each editor then revises the text and uses the insights generated and clarification of procedures in their subsequent editorial work. The Workshops have been invaluable in allowing team members to develop their skills and communicate their work to other members of the team. The Editorial Workshops were for editors of the first volumes to be published by OUP (in a rolling programme commencing 2016/17). New editorial protocols have been incorporated into the Style Guide, and distributed to the whole project team. OUP and The Hakluyt Society, which publishes scholarly accounts of travel and exploration, is kept informed of editorial processes and decisions.
