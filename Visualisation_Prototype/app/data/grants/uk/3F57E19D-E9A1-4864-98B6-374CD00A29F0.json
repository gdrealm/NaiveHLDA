SOA consists of particles that are generated when terpenes and other compounds react in the atmosphere. It is visible as the haze generated in photochemical smog episodes, and has implications for health because the size of the particles is such that they are easily inhaled and lodge in the lungs. Furthermore SOA impacts on cloud formation, and so has significant implications for climate change. Experiments will be carried out using a static reaction chamber and flow reactor that will be interfaced with Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers, which are instruments that allow particle numbers and size distributions to be determined. The characterisation of particles will be performed as a function of time and reaction conditions, and where possible will be mapped against related experiments examining the chemical composition of the aerosol. In this way we will be able to obtain information about how the chemical components impact on aerosol formation (nucleation) and yield. In addition, the static chamber and flow reactor will be interfaced to an acoustic particle levitator. This is a novel technique that allows single seed particles to be suspended under conditions close to those that pertain in the atmosphere. The seed particle will become coated in SOA and we can examine it using a special microscope (Raman) that allows us not only to determine the size, but also to gain information about the chemical composition of the coated particle. We can then examine the ageing of aerosol in the presence of ozone and dinitrogen pentoxide, which are important oxidants in the atmosphere. The experiments will provide information on: the identity of the nucleation species; its mechanism of formation; and the ageing process. The results of the study will provide vital information that will inform atmospheric chemistry models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G019231/1","grantId":"NE/G019231/1","fundValue":"377031","fundStart":"2010-01-18","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"George  Marston","coPersons":["Christian  Pfrang"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
