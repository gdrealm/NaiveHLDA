{"id":"E4999DCF-B587-4A50-9A62-4A3D4B13C9A5","title":"The building of Elizabethan and Jacobean England","abstractText":"The building of Elizabethan and Jacobean England explores issues of urban and rural renewal in the century after the reformation. It challenges the 'Great Re-building' debate by demonstrating that the approach to building in this period focused on the adaptation and modification of monastic sites and various church properties rather than the creation of new buildings. The book looks at the way language shaped attitudes to buildings through an examination of government legislation, contracts and accounts and verbal description. It places all kinds of structures, including a civic building, schools, alms houses, country houses and urban dwellings within a common framework.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113155/1","grantId":"113155/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maurice  Howard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
