We may lose sleep over the performance of our pensions schemes, our under provision for increasing old age and the wobbling value of our homes but the UK banking system will at least guarantee the value and continued solidity of our nest eggs. Or will it? The collapse in the 1991 of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International Bank caused widespread loss to depositor funds throughout the UK and, as ever, the lawyers and Courts are still to this day busy picking over the carcass. This project uses the extensive amount of material that both the Bingham Report (a judicial inquiry into the Bank of England's supervision of BCCI) and reported case law provide as an opportunity to ask some fundamental questions about expectations of our regulatory guardians in the financial markets when faced with the enormously difficult judgment call of assessing both the level and nature of risk posed in the world's increasingly global and interdependent financial markets. For ultimately, it is how such risk are managed that will govern the soundness of our sleep at night.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112715/1","grantId":"112715/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Gray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
