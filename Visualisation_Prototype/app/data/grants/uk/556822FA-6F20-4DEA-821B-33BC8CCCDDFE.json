Current treatment fall into two broad areas - either involving drug treatment or with psychological therapy (particularly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: CBT). Although patients often receive a combination of these treatments, the research on each treatment type is typically carried out separately.\n\nThe current proposal explores how both treatments affect responses to emotional information in patients suffering from panic disorder, using both behavioural measures like facial expression recognition and brain scanning methods. By exploring the effects of both treatment types together we can gain information about their similarities and differences and also how these treatments may affect each other (i.e. perhaps drug treatments improving the effects of CBT, or vice-versa). \n\nIt is predicted that both treatments will decrease automatic brain responses to threat and reduce dysfunctional beliefs relevant to panic. However, it is hypothesised that the drug treatment will first affect automatic processing of threatening cues with effects on these beliefs emerging later. By contrast, CBT is predicted to directly target beliefs and behaviour which take time to unravel automatic processing biases. This proposal therefore aims to understand the mechanisms underlying two different successful treatments for anxiety disorders. Such an approach may help develop more optimal combinations of drug and psychological therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501223","grantId":"G0501223","fundValue":"324629","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine  Harmer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
