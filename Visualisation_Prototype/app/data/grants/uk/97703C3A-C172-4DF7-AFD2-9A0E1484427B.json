{"id":"97703C3A-C172-4DF7-AFD2-9A0E1484427B","title":"Laboratory Experiment of Physical Power Systems for SUPERGEN Projects through International Collaboration","abstractText":"Dr. Haifeng Wang has worked on two projects in the EPSRC SUPERGEN 1 / Future Network Technology Consortium on FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) and one project in the EPSRC SUPERGEN 3 / Energy Storage Consortium on EES (Energy Storage Systems) applied in power supply systems considering renewable generation. Those three projects have achieved significant step progress with novel ideas and theoretical methods proposed. However, the main tool he has used so far to evaluate and demonstrate his theoretical research results for these three SUPERGEN projects is computer simulation, as in the UK there is no laboratory of physical power systems available for him to conduct experiment. Because in power system research and development, physical experiment is a vitally essential step of work towards field trial and applications, this proposal seeks the support from the EPSRC Collaborating for Success through People (CSP) scheme for him and his Research Officer to carry out laboratory experiment of physical power systems for his SUPERGEN projects through international collaboration. The proposed experiment will be conducted at the Physical Power System Laboratory (PPSL), College of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and technology (HUST), Wuhan, China. The support required from the EPSRC CSP is to cover the cost of people-based activities for the proposed physical experiment, while the Chinese collaborator will cover the cost of equipment and consumables.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F012845/1","grantId":"EP/F012845/1","fundValue":"60726","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Haifeng  Wang","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
