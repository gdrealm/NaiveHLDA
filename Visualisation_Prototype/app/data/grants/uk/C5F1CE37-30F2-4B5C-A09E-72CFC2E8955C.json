Preliminary work is promising reductions in adverse incidents (including fatalities), but careful collaborative work is essential with contributions from computer science, human factors, and clinical fields. The goal is to progress the research and to lay solid foundations for international proposals.Extending two adjacent conference trips where Thimbleby will be presenting three refereed papers is an excellent opportunity to network and develop existing relationships with international researchers at US universities (at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Houston). Some companies will also be visited.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H017895/1","grantId":"EP/H017895/1","fundValue":"14823","fundStart":"2009-07-03","fundEnd":"2009-10-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Harold  Thimbleby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
