{"id":"12455A97-973B-4E2B-B37B-C7DFEC39A7C3","title":"Periodic paralysis: from molecules to mice","abstractText":"Periodic paralyses (PPs) are a group of muscular disorders with episodes of total or partial muscle paralysis lasting hours to days. Disease onset is often in the first or second decade. The estimated prevalence of PPs is 0.3-1 in 100 000. The episodes of paralysis are often associated with reduced or increased serum potassium levels. In addition to episodes of paralysis, some PP patients present with myotonic stiffness of muscles between the episodes. Treatment of the PPs remains inadequate and patients often experience significant loss of mobility including disabling permanent weakness.\n\nPPs are dominantly inherited genetic disorders. Genetic studies of PP patients have identified mutations affecting genes that code for skeletal muscle ion channels. Ion channels are proteins found in membranes of all living cells that control the passage of ions across the cell membrane. The activity of ion channels controls the electrical signals responsible for many important functions in our bodies. For example, after receiving a signal from neurons, ion channels in skeletal muscles initiate an electrical signalling cascade that controls the muscle contraction. Mutations in the skeletal muscle ion channels disrupt this signal. Myotonic stiffness is caused by inability of the muscle membrane to switch off the electrical signal that controls the contraction. In the case of paralysis, the muscle cell membrane is unable to initiate the electrical signal, resulting in flaccid, non-contracting muscle.\n\nOur overarching aim is to understand the fundamental mechanisms that lead to episodes of paralysis and to permanent weakness, and the mechanisms of therapies to prevent these conditions. In this proposal we aim to find answers to several questions: How does a mutation affect the function of an ion channel? How does a defunct ion channel make the cell unable to send electrical signals that control the muscle contraction? And, what changes in the electrical properties of the muscle cell when the muscle becomes permanently weak? We will evaluate the effects of available and new therapies, and wherever possible, develop personalized therapies in order to intervene in the identified pathophysiological changes caused by a specific mutation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M006948/1","grantId":"MR/M006948/1","fundValue":"464146","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roope Sakari  Mannikko","coPersons":["Michael  Hanna","Stephanie  Schorge","Dimitri Michael Kullmann"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
