This LE disruption leads commonly to a severe and debilitating neurodegeneration and premature death during childhood. I am proposing to use the advanced genetics of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster as a system for identifying novel LSD genes and the molecular signaling pathways that are perturbed in LSDs. I intend to do this to further our understanding of the LE and LSDs since many of the genes encoded by LSD loci are important to LE function. D. melanogaster can manifest all of the LSD symptoms. This fact, allied to the advanced genetics available in this organism plus publication of its genome sequence makes work rapid, novel and informative to the understanding and treatment of LSDs in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400580","grantId":"G0400580","fundValue":"241515","fundStart":"2005-06-30","fundEnd":"2008-06-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean  Sweeney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
