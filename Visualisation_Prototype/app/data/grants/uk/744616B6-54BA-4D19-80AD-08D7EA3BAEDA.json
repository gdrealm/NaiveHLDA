{"id":"744616B6-54BA-4D19-80AD-08D7EA3BAEDA","title":"Proposal for UK Involvement in the Operation of Advanced LIGO","abstractText":"Within the next five years, and before the end of the period covered by this proposal, Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) is confidently expected to detect gravitational waves and hence to open a new era in astronomy. In this proposal we request support for essential infrastructure and travel costs required to ensure that the UK maintains its place among the leaders in the field and partnership within the project.\nThrough the design and construction project &quot;Advanced LIGO UK&quot;, the UK has succeeded in making unique and fundamental contributions to major aspects of the aLIGO gravitational wave detectors in the US, primarily by transfer of silica suspension technology originally developed for GEO600. The resulting suspensions are absolutely central in enabling aLIGO to meet its sensitivity target. During the first phase of operations, the UK supplied equipment has been installed and integrated into two aLIGO detectors. As a direct result, UK groups are in a position to exploit the rich science data that will be produced by these detectors and their observing partners during the current decade. We propose to maximise the UK position by providing the support and infrastructure necessary for full involvement in the operation of the aLIGO detectors and therefore to remain active partners in the user-community group, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), through which data rights are earned and distributed. \n Of similar importance is the need to ensure that UK-delivered equipment and facilities for the aLIGO detectors are fully exploited to maximise the potential scientific output. This is true both in terms of their implementation within aLIGO, and later when it is planned that aLIGO will be further upgraded. \n The UK membership of the LSC is considerable - currently 12% by authorship. The ALUK project and exchange of data from GEO600 have allowed us to leverage data access and science return for a relatively small investment in the aLIGO hardware. As set out in our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with LIGO, we have been given top-level project management roles, up to and including a seat on the project Oversight Committee for an STFC representative. It is essential that we maintain involvement at the highest level as set out in detail in this proposal. We therefore request continuation of travel support for observing duties, resources to allow us to provide technical support during detector commissioning and operations, and computer infrastructure support to provide a solid basis for exploitation of aLIGO science data within the UK. \nAt the LIGO sites, first tests of the completed detectors are underway, and in November 2014, just a few months after first operation, the LLO detector achieved sensitivity to coalescing binary neutron stars at over 50 megaparsec (Mpc) distance - well on target for initial science runs to start in 2015.\n We request funding for the period 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2019.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N000080/1","grantId":"ST/N000080/1","fundValue":"42205","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2019-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Edward John Daw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
