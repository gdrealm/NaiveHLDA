At the same time, there has been substantial research effort into the development of computer-based simulators of human biology. Future risk assessments should be able to combine advanced biology simulators with relevant non-animal experiments to help risk assessors make predictions about adverse health effects without the use of animals.\n\nCurrently, toxicologists are far from having the same confidence in these computer-based risk assessments as they do in traditional animal-based assessments. This is partially due to most investigations of the use of the computer models focussing on just a small aspect of the risk problem. We consider the complete risk assessment process to provide more scientifically relevant information for human safety assessment. In our research, we build a coherent framework with which the non-animal experiments and simulators can be harnessed to develop new approaches for safety assessment. These approaches could give a better prediction of potential effects in humans, reduce the time and monetary costs of reliable risk assessment, and reduce the reliance on animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/K001280/1","grantId":"NC/K001280/1","fundValue":"81195","fundStart":"2013-05-08","fundEnd":"2015-05-07","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"John Paul  Gosling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
