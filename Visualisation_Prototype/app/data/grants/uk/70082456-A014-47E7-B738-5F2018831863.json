The research will both address immediate challenges in terms of improving process efficiencies and broadening the range of acceptable feedstocks; and encourage diversification into the novel area of industrial anaerobic biotechnology through the development of new bio-based products and processes. The underpinning research required is interdisciplinary, with molecular biologists and microbial ecologists working on the role of metabolic pathways and community structure, through to process scientists and technologists translating these insights into practical processes. Process engineers will consider how these can best be implemented in novel reactor designs and operating protocols, and how to maximise resource efficiency by advance process integration and optimisation; while environmental and social scientists will analyse the potential benefits and impacts of these new technologies and evaluate their implications for industry, society and the environment. The purpose of the Network is to create an integrated AD research community which draws these specialists together. To achieve this, support is needed for integration and expansion of the existing research base, along with effective means of dissemination and stronger engagement of the academic community with the various industry stakeholders. The Network will encourage academic/industry interaction by means of themed workshops organised in conjunction with the main trade associations, including the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association (ADBA) and the Renewable Energy Association (REA). All potential Network members were initially canvassed concerning their interest in proposed working groups. More than 120 positive responses have been received from ~85 organisations (~70 academic, ~50 industry). Once officially launched, the Network is expected to expand further as research students and junior researchers become involved in its activities. The Network itself will be based around research-focused working groups with co-Chairs from industry and academia. These will identify the research needed to support end-user businesses in developing competitive bio-based technologies in both the bioenergy and biorefinery fields. Proof-of-concept funding will be provided for a range of highly innovative projects. This with other networking activities will encourage the formation of cross-disciplinary consortia, and thus put UK teams in a prime position to respond to national and international research calls such as the BBSRC IBBE Catalyst and the EU's Horizon 2020 programme. Through its prestigious International Advisory Group it will also raise the profile of UK scientists and help to establish the UK's position as a leader in this branch of industrial biotechnology. The Network is thus a vital element in developing the UK's position as a world leader in innovative anaerobic technology with the potential to open up new markets and research areas. A 5-year duration has been chosen to ensure long-term development of strong collaborative research at both UK and international levels, reinforced by research events, secondments and exchanges. The proposed scale is essential both to encompass all the required disciplines and types of expertise, and to secure the establishment of an effective and interactive AD research community that will endure beyond the BBSRC funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L013835/1","grantId":"BB/L013835/1","fundValue":"705651","fundStart":"2014-03-19","fundEnd":"2019-03-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Banks","coPersons":["Orkun  Soyer"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
