We shall make extensive use of the paradigm of a soliton, that is a structure (e.g., bell-shaped) which is localised in space and possesses a stationary profile which remains unchanged in time. Typical examples of soliton-relevant contexts include tsunamis and rogue/freak waves in the ocean, optical pulses in fiber optics, signal transmission across membranes, and others. Solitons owe their remarkable properties to a delicate balance between dispersion and nonlinearity, also undergoing generic physical mechanisms, such as perturbations, dissipation, noise (due to turbulence in the background), to mention but a few. In an idealised picture, solitons survive through mutual collisions, which makes them significant entities to support information and signal transcmission in various media (nonlinear optics, condensed matter physics). In plasma physics, solitons occur in the modelling of propagating localised electromagnetic/electrostatic modes, which occur in abundance in experimental or Space observations. Notwithstanding the different scales of parameters involved, localised structures are ubiquitous in plasmas at all levels, including laboratory plasmas (e.g. experiments on low-temperature discharge plasmas and on laser-matter interactions at the host Centre, CPP/QUB), Space plasmas (e.g. in the magnetosphere, the physics of the bow shock, or the Earth's aurora), astrophysics (pulsar radio emission is associated to solitons) and dusty plasmas in the interstellar space. We therefore expect our findings to be of relevance in various areas of plasma physics and certainly of interest to researchers in the UK and overseas. We aim at studying the dynamics of electromagnetic solitons in laser plasmas. Laser-plasma interaction (LPI) is perhaps the fastest evolving area in modern plasma science. Apart from its challenging relevance in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) schemes, the area of LPI bears a vast field of applications in industry and technology (e.g. laser design for microelectronics application, perspective for improved laser based appliances). A great amount of fundamental (theoretical) and experimental research is now carried out in the UK and worldwide, boosted by tremendous possibilities of new generation lasers producing ultrashort pulses at ultrahigh intensities. The host Centre (CPP/QUB) boasts some of the leading experimental groups in the UK in LPI.The aim and scope of the proposed research consist of a comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of intense electromagnetic pulses in plasmas, employing analytical and numerical techniques from nonlinear fluid plasma theory. Our aim is to investigate previously unexplored aspects of EM solitary wave propagation, in particular focusing on two-dimensional (2D) geometry effects on EM soliton propagation. A number of relevant areas will be investigated. The derivation of two-dimensional (2D) soliton evolution equations will be undertaken from the fluid-Maxwell model. The soliton equilibrium equations will be solved to obtain the field profiles associated with the soliton. A two dimensional fluid code will then be developed. The numerical soliton solution will be used as initial condition for the time evolution studies. The propagation of 2D solitons in uniform as well as non-uniform plasma will be investigated using a fluid code, by considering different types of density inhomogeneity. If the solitons are found stable in homogeneous plasma, mutual collisions among two solitons will be studied in a realistic parameter regime. This should provide the possibility for a direct comparison of these solitons with the known topological solitons. Furthermore, we envisage to focus in particular on an extensive multiscale analysis of laser pulse dynamics to extend and improve earlier theorie","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I031766/1","grantId":"EP/I031766/1","fundValue":"99778","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our research findings have resulted in a number of publications and conference proceedings (listed elsewhere in this database). \n\nBeyond the standard research impact (visibility in the research and academic community), these results have:\n\n- contributed to the understanding of the dynamics of energy and charge transport mechanism in energy production (via laser-assisted fusion) mechanisms;\n\n- contributed to the development of a fluid simulation code for collisionless shocks and solitary waves, which formed the basis of the work of an intern (Mr Guisset, ref. &lt;secondments&gt; section) and will also form the basis of future publications, currently in preparation;\n\n- led to various events and factors playing a role in the career development of the main two researchers involved in the project (Dr Kourakis, Dr Saxena), including:\n\n - Dr Saxena has successfully landed a researcher job offer at DESY research centre in Hamburg, Germany, where he works at the current date (2014); \n\n - Dr Kourakis has been appointed at Editorial positions and Reviewer panel membership assignments, as explained in the &lt;Activities&gt; section of this database. \n\nFinally, our findings have formed the basis of a number of Master's projects, within the MSc in Plasma Physics Curriculum at Queen's University, and have thus contributed to training a new generation of researchers, with evident impact to the local economy.

In various physical contexts, nonlinearity may combine with the intrinsic dispersive property of a physical medium, leading to the formation of robust localised structures, in the form of solitary waves (pulses), or shocks. Manifestations of this mechanism may range from Tsunami waves and freak waves formation in the open sea, signal transmission in optical fibres and charge transport across human membranes, to mention but a few. \n\n\n\nIn the framework of charged matter (plasmas), this mechanism is associated with the formation of localised electrostatic or electromagnetic structures, which may bear the form of potential pulses, combined with localised electric/magnetic (EM) field disturbances propagating at a stationary profile and speed. Given their remarkable stability properties, such localised structures are good candidates for the modelling of localised lumps of electromagnetic energy launched and propagating stably in the plasma. \n\n\n\nWithin this project, we have focused on laser-plasma interactions, that is, during the propagation of EM beams in (and their dynamical interaction with) the plasma. We have employed a fluid plasma description, in combination with Maxwell's laws, as basis for an analytical description of plasma dynamics, and to model shocks and soliton pulses via computational simulations. A variety of plasma configurations and wave propagation effects have been considered, including (but not limited to) the interaction between overlapping EM pulses (solitons), and the dynamics of superluminal laser pulses in electron-positron plasmas. We have also considered multidimensional aspects of the dynamics of electrostatic shocks and pulses in electron-ion and electron-positron-ion plasmas. Finally, the effect of nonthermal (non-Maxwellian) particle distribution was also considered through this research. Both one-dimensional (for simplicity) and two-dimensional geometries have been considered. This research contributes to modelling of EM beam interaction with plasmas, applied for instance in long distance wave propagation in the magnetosphere, for telecommunication purposes. Furthermore, the elucidation of energy and mass localisation mechanisms is applicable to a wide range of problems where complex (nonlinear) dynamics is involved, e.g. in finance and in the propagation of social spatial patterns. Fundamentally speaking, our research is also relevant with energy production (fusion) schemes, where harnessing the behaviour of energy lumps is of outmost importance in managing energy deposition on a solid target. Possible applications of this research range include energy transport within the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) scheme for energy production, shock formation in space plasmas, and the dynamics of collisionless shocks and EM pulses in laser-matter interaction experiments.
