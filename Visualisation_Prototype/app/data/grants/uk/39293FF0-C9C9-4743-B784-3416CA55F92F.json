Methods developed under this grant were embodied in software tools (CAM), workbooks and publications that now support the creation of reliable, high-quality, cost-effective products. The EDC added Design Practice and Design Management to its existing research portfolio, retired the Service Design theme and added one lecturer to its academic staff.\nMany of the discoveries of note are captured in the academic papers, but highlights include: the delivery of a design process rational capture tool into a leading aerospace company; the further development of a design process modelling tool (Cambridge Advanced Modeller) and its application in a number of engineering companies; the publication of a book on design process improvement; the delivery of a project on risk management in healthcare to the Department of Health; the publication of an inclusive design toolkit and its delivery into school and industry. Many of the findings from this grant were developed further by the Cambridge Engineering Design Centre under new grants. Numerous collaborators also independently developed the findings. All key work was put in the public domain to encourage use by others.
