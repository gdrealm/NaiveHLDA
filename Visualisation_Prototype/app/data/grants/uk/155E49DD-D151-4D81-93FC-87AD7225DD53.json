The whole process of Vision itself begins with a small group of proteins (known as opsins) which perform the unique task of absorbing light and translating it into an electrical/biological signal. In the retina, it was traditionally assumed that these opsins were confined to the rod and cone cells, known collectively as photoreceptors. These photoreceptor cells are the functional equivalent of the pixels in the CCD array of a digital camera. It has more recently been discovered that there is actually a rich diversity of additional candidate opsins produced in alternative cells in the retina, however their function remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, these same light sensitive proteins are also found in the brain in places like the pineal organ. Collectively these observations indicate that the whole process of light detection is far more complex than originally thought. Here in the current program we propose a systematic study of these potentially light sensing proteins by looking at the whole diverse opsin photopigment family in the zebrafish, a common model organism. Initially, we will insert the DNA that codes for these proteins into host cells grown in culture conditions. In this way we can measure and compare their functional properties as well as studying how they might interact with one another. This will allow us to define which of these possible photopigments can confer photosensitivity in cells which normally do not respond to light. Finally, it is very hard to measure the real function of these light sensitive proteins in the retina or brain because they are only found in relatively few cells and as a result they are simply very hard to find. We will therefore use new techniques to genetically modify zebrafish, so as to generate animals where the cells that normally produce these photopigments are modified to glow with a fluorescent marker. These approaches will help us explore and understand the whole range of new light detection mechanisms present in the eye and brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E021670/1","grantId":"BB/E021670/1","fundValue":"961472","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Hankins","coPersons":["Russell  Foster","David  Whitmore","Stephanie  Halford"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
