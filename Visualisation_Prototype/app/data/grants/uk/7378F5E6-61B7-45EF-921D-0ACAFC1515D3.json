The high expression of this protein may therefore play a role in the development of cancers associated with EBV infection that include Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, post-transplant lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Our research aims to obtain further information on how RGC-32 regulates growth and how its expression can be controlled by cellular and viral proteins. This research will therefore increase our understanding of how overproduction of RGC-32 may contribute to cancer development.\n\nSpecifically we will determine:\n\n1. How EBV proteins and cellular factors regulate RGC-32 RNA expression in EBV-infected cells.\n2. How short RNA molecules (microRNAs) and RNA binding proteins control RGC-32 protein production.\n3. How RGC-32 controls cell growth.\n\nOur research will provide important information for basic scientists and clinicians working in the fields of cancer research and treatment. The long term beneficiaries of this research could therefore include patients suffering from diseases in which RGC-32 expression is altered.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K01952X/1","grantId":"MR/K01952X/1","fundValue":"518061","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michelle Joanne West","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
