{"id":"F7B75EE0-9FE0-49FF-B58F-4BB301C530B8","title":"Group actions in function approximation spaces","abstractText":"In 1987, Britain experienced a hurricane that was famously not predicted by the UK Met Office.The PI heard that mathematicians working at the Met Office decided, after due deliberation, that the reason was that the numerical code used to predict extreme weather had a particular subtle flaw: that a conservation law, known as potential vorticity, was not built into the computer code. This kind of conservation law is guaranteed by a famous theorem, proved by Emmy Noether in the early 1900's, which links the symmetries of the physical model directly to the conservation laws.The long term aim of the line of research of the project is to build such laws, exactly, intonumerical code that models physical systems. This involves first understanding how the physical symmetries, which are understood in terms of smooth actions on smooth spaces,are mapped into actions in discrete or digital spaces; actually, onto the approximate functions on such spaces used to model the smooth functions. The second part involves investigatinghow Noether's theorem transfers to the discrete case in a concrete and practical way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H024018/1","grantId":"EP/H024018/1","fundValue":"292604","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  (1) The meteorologists are keen for our methods conservation of potential velocity to be finalised.\n(2) We have used the resulting numerical schemes in consultancy projects with fish innovation ltd.

We did this by proving a weak form of the law that was achieved for any mesh, and that this could be made as close as desired to the smooth law by an adaptive scheme.\n(2) we have shown that for smooth variational problems, moving frames can be used to elucidate the structure of the conservation laws, in the general case (arbitrary dependent and independent variables, general Lie group actions)\n(3) We have accumulated evidence for two conjectures that overthrow the conventional wisdom, namely, that potential vorticity can indeed be conserved in a numerical scheme, and secondly, that one can indeed conserve both energy and a symplectic form. Meteorologists are keen to have conservation of potential vorticity. This was thought to be impossible in a numerical scheme.\nThe conservation of energy and momenta are endemic in the landscape of mathematical models for physical and engineering problems. To achieve this a priori in a numerical scheme will have wide impact.
