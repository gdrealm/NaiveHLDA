Using sociocultural, theoretical frameworks to address the circumstances of theatre and performance for a range of dramatists, Kwei-Armah, Williams, River, Tucker Green, and Daley produces questions regarding cultural inheritances, diasporic and theatrical; where the legacies of restriction and exclusion interface with traditional British theatre heritage as formative influences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119528/1","grantId":"119528/1","fundValue":"6498","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Deirdre  Osborne","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
