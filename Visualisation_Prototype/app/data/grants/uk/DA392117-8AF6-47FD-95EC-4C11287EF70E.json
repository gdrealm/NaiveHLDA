Of crucial importance will be the new results coming from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The proposed research will improve our ability to predict the effects of the strong interactions (QCD) on the processes that will be studied at the LHC and develop efficient methods to determine the properties of any new states of matter discovered there. Both analytical and numerical methods will be used to study the properties of hadrons, strongly interacting bound states of quarks. The research will also seek to determine what lies beyond the Standard Model of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions with the ultimate goal of providing a fully unified theory, including gravity. The most promising candidate theories will be studied, including Grand and superstring unification and theories with additional space dimensions. Laboratory, astrophysical and cosmological implications will be analysed to determine the most sensitive experimental tests of these theories. We hope these studies will lead to a complete understanding of the origin of mass, including an understanding of the quark, charged lepton and neutrino masses, mixing angels and CP violation, one of PPARC's cornerstone aims. In addition to having direct relevance to the future LHC program the research under this grant will have relevance to present and future neutrino experiments and to STFC's programme of astrophysical and cosmological studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G000492/1","grantId":"ST/G000492/1","fundValue":"1900750","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Ross","coPersons":["John  Wheater","Andre  Lukas","Francesco  Hautmann","Giulia  Zanderighi","Frank  Close","Michael  Teper","John  March-Russell","Dumitru  Ghilencea","Subir  Sarkar"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
