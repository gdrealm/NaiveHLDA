The objectives are fourfold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>to investigate the institutional economics of energy biomass and biofuel production from local to national and global scales</li>\n\n <li>to undertake a technical assessment of resources and conversion routes</li>\n\n <li>to combine the institutional and technical analyses to devise ways for community cooperation on sustainable energy production</li>\n\n <li>to transfer the knowledge gained to a wide international audience. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The energy garden concept originates from an idea developed by the Hassan Biofuels Park in India and will follow their approach for using local plant species as the source of biofuels, thereby avoiding loss of biodiversity as much as possible, and using marginal land to avoid competition with food crops.</p>\n\n<p>The project is a partnership of four organisations in Nepal and the Hassan Biofuels Park. The objectives will be achieved through a combination of policy analysis, reviews of plant species, analysis of technical options and field work in the villages. The aim is to test the feasibility of expanding the successful Energy Garden approach to Nepal and worldwide.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K011812/1","grantId":"ES/K011812/1","fundValue":"78372","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project is still ongoing, but already the preliminary findings have been used to launch the 'Energy Garden Ambassadors' school programme in Nepal, and the project concept has been extended to Africa under the Royal Society-DfID Renewable Energy Capacity Building network Education,Energy,Environment Cultural,Societal","person":"Jonathan  Lovett","coPersons":["Sara Felicity  Oldfield","Andrew Barry Ross"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The greatest potential for deriving energy from plants is the fact that appropriate local species can be grown in different environments all round the world. So it is possible to grow 'Energy Gardens' using a range of plant species to produce different forms of energy. Using energy gardens, farming communities, perhaps living in remote areas, can grow their own fuel. Traditionally this has been wood fuel, but new technologies and innovative ideas are opening the possibility to grow and process biofuels, or combine sanitation with energy production. The energy garden project will focus on the social science of creating new links across disciplines and exploring how novel technologies can be transferred to communities for energy production. The project concept is being extended to Africa through a Royal Society-DfID Capacity Building for Renewable Energy network. Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
