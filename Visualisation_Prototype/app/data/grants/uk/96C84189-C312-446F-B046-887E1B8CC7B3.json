One requirement is for high efficiency multijunction solar cells (MJSCs) to extract power from concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, which are expected to become central to the delivery of solar power to national and super-grid systems. At present such MJSCs must combine different materials systems, and are usually limited by the requirement to lattice-match the individual cells to avoid efficiency losses due to defects. In this proposal we aim to circumvent these problems by investigating solar cells based on InxGa1-xN, which has a direct band gap of 0.7-3.4 eV, spanning most of the visible spectrum, thus promising MJSCs from a single materials system. To avoid the problems of lattice mismatch and of material quality, which limit prototype solar cells based on InxGa1-xN epilayers to low x (x&lt;0.3), we will grow the InxGa1-xN in nanorod form, merging the nanorods using methods we have already developed to provide a solar cell template. The team assembled, which combines complementary expertise in growth and device fabrication (U. Nottingham), structural characterization (U. Bristol), nanoscale optical and electrical characterization (Arizona State U.) and solar cell design and characterization (NREL), aims to explore the properties of InxGa1-xN single junction cells over the full composition range (0","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I035501/1","grantId":"EP/I035501/1","fundValue":"429592","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been published and add to understanding of InGaN nanorod growth.

The work demonstrated that the nanorod structures could be grown defect-free for all compositions x, and graded across the entire composition range without introducing defects. Nanorods of all compositions could be also overgrown with continuous layers as we proposed. However, the research also revealed that the nanorods developed a complex core-shell structure where the core and shell were respectively In-rich and In-poor, and, for some compositions, the core was decomposed into In-rich and In-poor platelets. This led to a new theory of nanorod growth which may be of general applicability to nanorod growth. Research through separately funded PhD projects is ongoing to determine the effect the core-shell structure has on solar cell properties The work has been very successful in achieving the structures required, and current work is aimed at clarifying how the core-shell structure affects solar cell properties and, if so, for what compositions. Once completed, the work will provide the basis for solar cells based on InGaN, using the method we have patented Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
