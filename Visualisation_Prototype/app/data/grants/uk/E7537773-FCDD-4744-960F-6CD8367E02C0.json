Its funding arrangements and organisational structure have been described as a premature exemplar of the European Research Area at work.</p>\n\n<p>ESRC funding will make a contribution both to the central coordination costs of ESS Round 5, and to the preparation of the ESS's longer-term existence as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). The ESRC has, on behalf of the UK Government, proposed the UK as the host country of the new ERIC&nbsp;- an offer welcomed by all other participating nations. City University London has offered to set up and house the new ERIC. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-627-25-0003","grantId":"RES-627-25-0003","fundValue":"1229070","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  JowellRory  Fitzgerald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
