Here they are viewed as a product the nuclearisation of extended families and breakdown of community relationships. The literature suggests instead street children gain acceptance through forming street families. However, it is rare for street children to severe all ties with home, and research is needed to fully explore these connections. </p> \n<p>This research draws on Beck's individualisation thesis as a framework for understanding the changing nature of South African communities, exploring the idea that contemporary economic, social and political contexts have impacted upon families and children's subsequent integration into, and exit from, street life. Using street researcher and biographical approaches, the project will explore street children's social, spatial and temporal relationships. In particular the research will consider children's freedom to access the street without being tied to moral obligations of the extended family and how this affects their investment in, and maintenance of, street and family relationships. </p> \n<p>In addition, the research will consider the changing nature of street children's relationships over the life path exploring the effects of street life on their subsequent re-integration into communities and later family-formation and child-rearing practices.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1286","grantId":"RES-000-22-1286","fundValue":"7211","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorraine  Van Blerk","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
