{"id":"6BB851BD-BC52-4FFA-9B9B-BE5632C97C42","title":"Infant Pain Mechanisms- short and long term effects","abstractText":"Many children are exposed to considerable pain as a result of disease processes, surgery or intensive care therapies but despite this, too few paediatric patients receive adequate pain relief. This problem has largely arisen because of lack of a scientific basis for clinical pain management. This proposal focuses upon developing pain pathways in the rat with the aim of providing the fundamental knowledge required to understand and prevent paediatric pain. A better understanding of the short and long term effects of infant pain will be gained by studying the underlying synaptic reorganisation and strengthening of nociceptive circuitry within the dorsal horn over the critical postnatal period and how that circuitry may be altered by excessive or inappropriate noxious inputs in early life. Specific questions addressed are A. How does the sensory dorsal horn circuitry underlying spinal pain processing become organised over the postnatal period? B. What are the mechanisms of action of key analgesics on dorsal horn pain processing in infants? C. How does alteration of sensory activity through early pain and injury influence developing sensory pathways? The study will increase our basic understanding of pain processing in young children and how it can be controlled by pain relieving drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400572","grantId":"G0400572","fundValue":"1086080","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Fitzgerald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
