{"id":"EAEFFE0C-405B-4093-A6B3-8B004DDC9050","title":"Modelling for Diversity: Academic Language and Literacies in School and University","abstractText":"<p>As the UK school and university student populations become increasingly linguistically and culturally diverse, there is an urgent need for an informed view on how the education system can support students' academic language and literacy developments.&nbsp; This research is focused on the English language and literacy demands experienced by two categories of students at school and university: UK-based 'non-traditional' students from social/familial backgrounds where participation in university education has not been an established norm, and ethnolinguistic minority students who comprise both UK/EU-based students and (particularly in university) international students from other parts of the world.&nbsp; Many of the latter group are speakers of English as an additional/second language (EAL).</p>\n\n<p>This ethnographically-oriented study will investigate academic language and literacy practices of staff and students in three academic subjects as case studies of the range of academic language and literacy practices that students encounter. The research will focus on: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>differences and mismatches between student and tutor expectations regarding academic writing</li>\n\n <li>deployment of the range of language registers and genres conventionally associated with a particular subject or discipline.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The findings will also enhance our understanding of policy consequences in terms of classroom realities associated with current government initiatives on widening participation. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G022763/1","grantId":"ES/G022763/1","fundValue":"190482","fundStart":"2009-02-02","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Constant  Leung","coPersons":["Brian Vincent Street"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
