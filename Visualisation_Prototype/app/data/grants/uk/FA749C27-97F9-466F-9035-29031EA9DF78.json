In the absence of an effective vaccine, understanding the mechanisms by which the virus replicates has provided several targets for the design of potent antiviral drugs. HIV-1 encodes a number of accessory genes whose function is to subvert host defence systems that have evolved to combat viral infections. We have shown that one such accessory protein, Vpu, is required by the virus to overcome the action of a human protein known as tetherin or CD317. Tetherin levels in cells are activated by viral infection. HIV-1 viruses that lack a Vpu gene are blocked in their replication because tetherin prevents new virus particles leaving the cell, thereby inhibiting the spread of the virus. However, the importance of Vpu and tetherin in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease in infected individuals has not been studied.\n This grant proposal aims to study the role of Vpu and tetherin in patients by using samples stored in the King?s College Infectious Disease BioBank. We will isolate Vpu genes from the blood of HIV positive individuals with different rates of disease progression and examine their ability to counteract tetherin, to see if variation in Vpu function is associated with clinical outcomes. We will also examine the regulation of tetherin expression in various primary cells that HIV-1 targets, and if genetic variations in and around the tetherin gene can affect these expression levels. Finally, we will use functional Vpu variants isolated from patients as tools to identify cellular proteins required for its ability to overcome tetherin. These studies will achieve the following objectives: (1) To determine whether Vpu and tetherin functions affect the susceptibility of patients to faster rates of disease progression; (2) Identification of mutant Vpu genes that encode non-functional proteins will allow us understand the basis for its anti-tetherin function; (3) Finally, determining an in vivo role of Vpu and tetherin in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis will provide compelling rationale to develop strategies to target Vpu function for new antiviral drug design.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801937","grantId":"G0801937","fundValue":"603012","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart John Neil","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
