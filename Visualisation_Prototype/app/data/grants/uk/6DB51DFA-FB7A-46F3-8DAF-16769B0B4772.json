It draws on the practical experience of two action research Connected Community projects and the methodological discussions of a third. It uses creative practice to inspire, organize and share community-generated research as radio/podcasts. The academic team will monitor three diverse regional groups devising this content and test the effectiveness of knowledge exchange over a wider geographic and social spread. Each case study area will choose and research a topic and make a radio pod/broadcast to share.\n\nOf the many AHRC Connected Community projects funded this year, two stand out for their radical methodology, successfully bringing together community groups to conduct research and learn from each other. The project proposed here combines these exemplars, Participants Utd and Stimulating Participation in the Informal Creative Economy (SPICE), with a research network into craft practices, Connecting Craft and Communities (CCC) where the focus was on novel forms of expression through making, to extract the DNA of the processes that culminated in community researching and sharing (Light et al 2011). The CARM project focuses on the methods and methodology that exemplified these three Connected Community research activities to demonstrate how they support communities in creating identity and cohesion. It builds on insights into how using action methods, community media and creative production techniques, such as recording drama and narrative for reflection and sharing, could enable community groups to collect and share know-how and to communicate what makes them special. In constructing a model of 'community-appropriated research', CARM will provide a reproducible means for groups to share their perspectives and identify cohesive and identity-making practices, be that virtuous behaviour cycles, social entrepreneurship, significant events or engagement in local activities, considering issues such as the nature of rigour in analysing and reporting on experiential learning and how to engage diverse communities. In this way, CARM will offer a development of theories of community engagement while equipping communities as both research producers and research users to spread best practice and build capacity in a period of transition from centrally provided to locally provided services. It will also produce an archive of community podcasts for use on community radio and other forms of community, inter-community and inter-generational activity.\n\nLight, A, Wakeford, T, Egglestone, P and Rogers, J (2011) Research on an Equal Footing?

It has changed their practice, leading to more work on skills exchange and promoting different methods of group reflection in community groups. The work has fed into the policy and practice of the Community Media Association, who was an advisor to CARM, and led to the subsequent close working partnership of AH/K006630/1, which has led to media guidance for the Conneected Communities Programme and a storage for media (the Connected Communities Media Collection), both of which have the potential to benefit communities and how they are represented, raising such issues as the nature of group consent. The folow-up project CARE has seen skills exchange taken forward across a broader cross-section and explored culturally for impact as well as creating a custom software platform.

Although networks and their power to connect have been observed as an outcome of the information age, much analysis has centred on new communities of interest gathering across space and how this changes the relations between individuals, or at a broad political level. CARM tackled questions of education and communication across different types of community-based organization, finding that the act of bringing people together locally to reflect on how they care and share can also be the means of involving others facing similar issues. Three groups made media to share with those sharing similar concerns. In each case, the act led to great reflection within the group and worked to stimulate reflection with others. However, there seemed limited interest in widespread sharing of knowledge in this way. The project explored the potential that groups have to learn about themselves and others through the reflective practice of media-making, producing a new structure of programme and some guidance about what was found to work. Follow up questions include:\n- How is listening together a different experience to listening individually and alone? Our advisory group of practitioners and media specialists could see great value in community listening around shared topics.\n- How might community groups establish tighter relations with community media organisations to swap expertise, producing more participatory programming by equipping local organisations to share their experiences? \n- What might be the resultant media genres of value to communities? Recommendations for these new practices can be found at http://howwemadeithappen.org/research-results/ but follow-up research on format, approach and audience is required. Methodology and methods are needed to define a genre of value to groups. \n- How far would groups use this methodology on their own without the prompt of academic interest and funding? For instance, few showed interest in learning about the recording and editing process. Will running training sessions for older people in Cornwall encourage them to get involved in this work?\n- What are the ethics of group consent to broadcast, since group identity is not synonymous with multiple individual identities? Can the people of the group in the broadcast speak for absent others? How might anonymisation come into play?\n- How far can issues of power and protocol be managed, between community groups working with media professionals, or indeed academics? \n- How might such issues be partially solved by a new role for individuals who emerge from the 'making groups' with self-identified expertise to drive the generation of community sharing, reflecting and doing?\n- \nFurther work in progress:\nCC &quot;CARE &quot; (2013-14) used skill exchanges and the potential of podcasts to promote reflection and reflexivity through shared interests in crafting as a tool for working with makers on co-design. \n\nCC &quot;Conserving and Sharing Community Media&quot; (2013-14) has created media guidance and an archive to store the digital media outputs of the Connected Communities programme. It arose as a result of making the podcasts in CARM in collaboration with the Community Media Association.
