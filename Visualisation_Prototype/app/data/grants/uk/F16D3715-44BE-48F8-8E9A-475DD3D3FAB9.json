The mission will consist of two separate spacecraft, an ESA-led Jupiter-Ganymede Orbiter and a NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter. This mission will allow us to better understand how the gas giant planets and their satellites formed and evolved and will shed light on the potential emergence of life in our solar system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I002170/1","grantId":"ST/I002170/1","fundValue":"75220","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Coates","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
