{"id":"58B8C5C7-7230-465E-8254-12A4E6995207","title":"Sun|trek - Reaching Out","abstractText":"The main aim of this proposal is capitalise on the recent work with Sun|trek, iSun|trek and Sun|trek Facebook, and to reach out to UK schools, to promote Sun|trek, in particular the Classroom Resources and Projects, as widely as possible. This will be achieved over a two year period by updates and improvements to the Sun|trek site (and related iSun|trek site) and by actively promoting Sun|trek, in particular the classroom resources and projects available for schools, more widely across the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland) and Ireland. The wider aim is to enhance the UK resources available to teachers, which can be used to enthuse students about solar astronomy and to encourage students to study the physical sciences at sixth form and beyond. Particular efforts will be made to target inner city schools (with diverse ethnic groups) for example in Birmingham, Leicester, Bedford, London and Slough. As an example, the recent inspirational video interviews with ethnic minority scientists by Benjamin Zephaniah were posted on Sun|trek facebook. In addition, as many females as possible are used as role models on Sun|trek (see solar guides). The legacy will be the provision of resources, but also the involvement of young solar researchers to continue their own outreach work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K005715/1","grantId":"ST/K005715/1","fundValue":"9200","fundStart":"2013-03-08","fundEnd":"2015-03-07","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Helen Elizabeth Mason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
