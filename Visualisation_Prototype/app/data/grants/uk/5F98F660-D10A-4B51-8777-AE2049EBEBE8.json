The programming model exposed by such multi-core\nprocessors depends crucially on a &quot;memory consistency model&quot; (MCM), a contract\nbetween the hardware and the programmer, which essentially specifies what\nvalue a read can return. On the hardware side, one key mechanism to implement\nthe memory consistency model is the &quot;cache-coherence protocol&quot; (CCP), which\nessentially communicates memory operations between processors. However, the\nconnection between the CCP and the MCM remains unclear. This is especially\ntrue for modern CCPs and MCMs, in which CCP design has been divorced from the\nrequirements of the MCM. We argue that this has negatively impacted the\nscalability and the verifiability of CCPs. \n\nOn the scalability front, there are serious question marks about sustaining\ncache coherence as the number of cores continue to scale. On the verification\nfront, the application of existing verification techniques, which do not\nverify the CCP against the MCM, are arguably broken. \n\nIn the C3 proposal, we propose a family of CCPs that are &quot;aware&quot; of, and\nverified against the MCM. Our approach is motivated by the fact that both\nhardware and programming languages are converging to various relaxed MCMs for\nperformance oriented reasons. We use such relaxed MCMs as inspiration to\nresearch CCPs that can take advantage of them. Specifically, we will research\n&quot;lazy&quot; CCPs where memory operations are batched, and the cost of communicating\na memory operation can be amortised. We will also, for the first time,\nformally verify the relationship between the hardware CCPs and the\nprogrammer-oriented MCM they provide. We will investigate rigorously the\ngains to be had from such lazy CCPs. We will do this by creating a multi-core\nsilicon prototype of our proposed CCP, leveraging our experience in the design\nof industrial-strength micro-architectures and their implementations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M027317/1","grantId":"EP/M027317/1","fundValue":"668897","fundStart":"2015-11-09","fundEnd":"2018-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vijayanand  Nagarajan","coPersons":["Paul Bernard Jackson","Paul  Holt","Susmit  Sarkar"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
