If we can understand how individuals respond to an infection within hours after exposure to a pathogen it will help in the development of vaccines and therapies. Cholesterol has been extensively studied in the context of heart disease. Importantly, however, new evidence shows a connection between immune responses to infection and the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Specifically, cholesterol can alter how we respond to a virus and, conversely, immune responses to infection have been shown to influence cholesterol transport, storage and removal from the body. \n\nHypocholesterolemia, abnormally low levels of cholesterol in the blood, often accompanies infectious diseases and has been suggested as a prognostic marker in hospitalized patients. Notably, the reasons for how and why cholesterol levels change in infection are not known. We have previously shown in tissue culture and animal models that suppressing the cholesterol synthesis pathway plays a role in defence against infection and this requires an immune hormone, interferon. Here we explore the mechanism for linking lower cholesterol levels and interferon.\n\nPreliminary data suggests that this response is at least partly due to the action of a specific microRNA. MicroRNAs are a recently discovered family of small molecules produced by cells that act to regulate a wide-range of processes such as embryonic development or the development of disease. MicroRNAs function to decrease the abundance of molecules known as messenger RNAs that are used as templates for protein production in the cell.\n\nIn tissue culture models, we have shown that interferon induces the production of a microRNA in immune cells called macrophages. Macrophages are multi-functional white blood cells critical to the development and maintenance of immunity to a wide range of infections. Our microRNA of interest acts to reduce the abundance of a protein called SREBP2 - a master regulator of cholesterol synthesis. This leads to a decrease in the amount of cholesterol in the cell and, in doing so, creates a virus resistant state.\n\nHere, we propose an investigation focused on characterising the mechanisms underlying these observations. In brief, we will characterise how interferon induces the specific microRNA in immune cells. We will then proceed to experiments focused on elucidating: the role of this miRNA during a viral infection in vivo, effects of the microRNA on metabolic and other cellular pathways and antiviral functions of the microRNA.\nThis will advance our understanding of responses to infection and will aid in the design and development of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in the treatment of infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K019112/1","grantId":"BB/K019112/1","fundValue":"652377","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Ghazal","coPersons":["William James Griffiths"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
