The purpose of this research will be to investigate the effectiveness of TRCB in addressing the trade and investment losses associated with the erosion of non-reciprocal tariff and quota preferences in small, middle-income countries. The research will focus on six cases which have historically enjoyed favourable access to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) markets as a result of preferential trade, namely, Jamaica, Belize, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mauritius and Fiji. Specifically, this research will: (1) examine the origins and consequences of trade liberalisation measures affecting preferential trade and map out the social and economic impact of these in the countries identified above; (2) explore the role of TRCB in the post-liberalisation adjustment policies promoted by aid donors and adopted by the countries in question, and assess the extent to which these have been implemented successfully; and (3) evaluate the above both in terms of assisting post-liberalisation adjustment within small states and in facilitating more effective global policy coordination among bilateral and multilateral aid donors.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G000255/1","grantId":"ES/G000255/1","fundValue":"129585","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"T  Heron","coPersons":["Anthony  Payne"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
