Very often, the embryo will not implant because either the embryo is abnormal or the uterus is not properly prepared to receive the embryo. Poor fertility leads to much human suffering and a significant economic loss for farmers. This project is about identifying the nature of the dialogue between the mother and the embryo (so-called blastocyst) during the critical period of development that leads up to the implantation of the embryo in the wall of the uterus. We believe that a complex sugar molecule called Hyaluronan (HA) that is present in most animal tissues plays a vital role within the mother-embryo communication system. Information from ourselves and others suggests that HA has a very important role in this process, and we have evidence that modified HA can assist embryo implantation in sheep. We shall investigate its role in implantation. Exactly how HA works in signalling to the mother that an embryo is implanting is a further question that we will try to answer. We believe that progesterone (dominant hormone during the period of embryo growth and implantation), is vital for HA production and function. In order to answer this second question we will investigate how HA is made, and how it is processed to become active in the mother-embryo communication system. The purpose of this application is to secure the funding required to further our investigation into the function of HA in the embryo implantation process. Our investigation requires that we use animals for the experiments. However, we will also use animal tissues from abattoirs for a significant part of the project thus keeping the number of animals required for the project to an absolute minimum. We have planned the following experiments for these investigations: 1. Two methods will be used to determine the effects of progesterone on HA production: A) Uterine cells will be treated with progesterone in culture dish. B) Sheep which have had their ovaries removed (ovaries produce progesterone) and therefore have been deprived of progesterone, will receive progesterone replacement. Uterine cells from the culture, as well as the uterus and oviducts of the progesterone /treated sheep, will be collected and analysed for HA as well as HA modifying enzymes. 2. Two methods will be used to generate embryos and to determine the effects of HA on development of embryos to blastocyst stage and blastocyst quality: A) Sheep treated with hormones to induce multiple ovulations will be allowed to mate and become pregnant naturally. B) Oocytes will be obtained from abattoir ovaries and mixed with sperm to generate embryos (IVF). Embryos produced through either method will be exposed to chemicals that are known to affect the levels of HA. Embryo development to blastocyst stage will be quantitatively monitored and the quality of the blastocysts will be assessed after embryo staining. 3. Two methods will be used to determine the role of HA on blastocyst implantation. A) Blastocysts, produced in the lab and will be cultured together with uterine cells. Agents that modify levels of HA will be added during days 14-17, when implantation would occur in the uterus. The embryos will be examined for development and the uterine cells for their production of HA and associated molecules. B) Uterus in naturally mated sheep will be infused with similar agents one day before the expected day of embryo attachment (day 15 after mating). Uterine tissue will be collected after slaughter of half the sheep (day 17) to assess blastocyst attachment and to study of expression of known genes and proteins related to embryo implantation. The remainder of the sheep will be slaughtered on day 35 to assess foetal survival and pregnancy rate. This project will potentially lead to improvements in fertility following either in vitro fertilization or natural conception.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G008620/1","grantId":"BB/G008620/1","fundValue":"416234","fundStart":"2009-04-14","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The impact of HA and its mechanism of action on embryo development has helped wider use of HA and its' related product in human an animal embryology Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Ali Akbar Fouladi-Nashta","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Veterinary College","findingsText":" My research has discovered \n1. The critical role of an important enzyme Hyaluronisade II in supporting preimplantation embryos development. It is produced by the uterine tube (oviduct) where the embryo spends early days after fertilisation. IVF culture media and practice removes this important factor through regular washing of the embryos. Supplementation of Hyal-2 to embryo culture media will compensate for its deficiency in IVF system and improves the rate of embryo development and embryo quality leading to improved pregnancy rate after embryo transfer.\n2. In contrast to the beneficial effect of Hyals in embryo development, my research data has revealed an important fact about the obstructing role of HA in embryo implantation. Presence of HA at the embryo implantation site blocks embryo adhesion to uterine way and embryo implantation, whereas, blocking HA production at the time of embryo implantation significantly improves pregnancy rate.\n3. Production of HA and Hyals are regulated by steroid hormones oestradiol and progesterone. High oestradiol during first stage (follicular phase) of reproductive cycle, stimulates production of large size HA which is important for oocyte maturation and fertilisation and dilation of cervix. This is followed by high progesterone after formation of the corpus luteum, which stimulates production of small size HA and Hyals to support embryo development and prepare uterus for reception of embryo. Small HA have angiogenic activity and prepare the uterus for embryo implantation. Manufacturers of embryo culture media both for human and animals will be able to produce Hyal-2 based culture media to improve blastocyst rate. I have been in discussion with Vitrolife one major producer of culture media for human assisted reproduction. Unfortunately, the lengthy discussios have not resulted in practical commitment by this company. Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
