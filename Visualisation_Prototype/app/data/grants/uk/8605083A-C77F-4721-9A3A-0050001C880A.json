Waves in the broad sense are characterized by time dependent fields transporting energy. However this point leads to a difficulty in General Relativity since the theory lacks a localized definition of energy and hence gives no simple account of how energy is extracted from the sources. Furthermore, up to now there are no exact solutions to Einstein's field equations that explicitly make manifest the production of these waves.We aim to look in detail at the simplest collapse situation capable of radiating, namely cylindrical collapse. We shall try to find new shear-free solutions and match them to a radiating exterior, and similarly study dust solutions (it has been conjectured that such solutions cannot radiate). We also aim to study limitations on equations of state for such bodies, and to examine dissipative and charged spherical collapse.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E063896/1","grantId":"EP/E063896/1","fundValue":"16288","fundStart":"2007-05-17","fundEnd":"2007-08-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm Angus Hugh  MacCallum","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
