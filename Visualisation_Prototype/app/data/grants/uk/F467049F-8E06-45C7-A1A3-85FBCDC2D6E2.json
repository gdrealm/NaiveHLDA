Its focus is on addressing methodological challenges in the modelling of biases and complex structure in observational data, in particular surveys, longitudinal studies and small area data. These challenges include data linkage and methods which combine data from different databases; methods for modelling bias due to survey non-response; longitudinal and spatial analysis, including extension of multilevel models to handle multiple time series and improved methods for handling spatial autocorrelation, scale issues and estimating distributions of small area statistics. Bayesian graphical and hierarchical models are used as a tool for linking many different sub-models and data sources and accounting for important sources of heterogeneity and patterns of correlations in observational data. Applications include a range of social science problems covering topics such as crime, voting behaviour, ageing, health and policy evaluation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />BIAS II also runs a programme of training events to help build capacity in advanced quantitative methods – particularly Bayesian methods. The training programme includes specialist workshops, mentoring schemes and visiting fellowships, and freely available software tools to implement many of the methods developed by the node.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-576-25-0015","grantId":"RES-576-25-0015","fundValue":"1034490","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola Grace Best","coPersons":["Sylvia  Richardson"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
