Very rarely is social mix planned for wealthier neighbourhoods, which raises questions about the motivations and the politics behind the concept.&nbsp; Furthermore, what kind of social mixing actually takes place in gentrifying neighbourhoods?&nbsp; Despite a significant amount of research taking place that addresses these issues, there has been no organised debate/interaction between researchers and practitioners, and this seminar series proposes to bring people together to discuss these policy-relevant issues in depth.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0340","grantId":"RES-451-26-0340","fundValue":"17475","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy Stephen Close  Butler","coPersons":["Loretta  Lees","Tom  Slater","Gary  Bridge"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
