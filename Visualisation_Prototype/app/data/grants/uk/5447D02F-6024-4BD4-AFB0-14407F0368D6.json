They aim to explorecontemporary and future challenges for caring and carers in the UK as well as ways of improving carers quality of life and those they support in the 21st century. As a coherent evidence base about cost-effective policies, services and interventions is central to these improvements, these seminars will also make a timely contribution to the development of such an evidence base.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of specific issues being discussed are the use of technological innovations, the impact of personalisation on carers, the role of general practice in supporting carers, carers and end of life care, meeting the diversity of carersâ€™ needs and support for unpaid carers in employment. During the last seminar a carers research network will be established. This network will progress the carer research agenda with a view to informing the future policy and the nature of investment in services for carers. Although the seminars series is by invitation-only (and is full) details of the presentations, discussions and debates can be found on the seminar website at www.dmu.ac.uk/carers-21. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021229/1","grantId":"ES/J021229/1","fundValue":"15361","fundStart":"2012-09-10","fundEnd":"2013-09-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Larkin","coPersons":["Anne  Arber","Diane  Seddon","Alisoun Janice Milne","Catherine Ann Robinson","Julia Dawn Tabreham"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
