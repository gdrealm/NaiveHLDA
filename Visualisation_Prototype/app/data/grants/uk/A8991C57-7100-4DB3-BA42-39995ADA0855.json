{"id":"A8991C57-7100-4DB3-BA42-39995ADA0855","title":"Downhole Gas Compressor Motor Drive for Production Enhancement from Gas Fields","abstractText":"This joint S2B collaboration is focussed on the design, development and engineering of an innovative Integrated Power Electronic Matrix Converter (IPEMC) for driving high power permanent magnet brushless motors. The key inventive step involves the elimination of all of the bulky inductors that conventionally are used to shape the new AC wave form, using a novel inverter and control topology. It is a key enabling technology for the Downhole Gas Compressor (DGC) application where the machine must operate in an extremely small space envelope in a hostile environment. By being able to locate the DGC down hole and pressure boost close to the reservoir, large increases in rates of production (in range 28-42%) are achievable as well as significant increases in Ultimate Recovery (UR). This unique project results in significant miniaturisation of the power electronics for all industrial applications, while also increasing high temperature performance and ruggedness and reducing EM radiation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/E005764/1","grantId":"DT/E005764/1","fundValue":"87632","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Wheeler","coPersons":["Stephen John Pickering"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
