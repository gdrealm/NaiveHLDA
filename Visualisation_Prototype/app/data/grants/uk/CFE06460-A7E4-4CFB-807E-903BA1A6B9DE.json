{"id":"CFE06460-A7E4-4CFB-807E-903BA1A6B9DE","title":"Implementing Whole Life Carbon in Buildings","abstractText":"The project aims to bridge the gap between whole life carbon (WLC) theory and its practical implementation in assessing\nlife cycle carbon emissions of buildings, by developing a common WLC calculation framework, including certification, to be\nused across the building industry. Currently there is goof background in WLC principles and methodology but a lack of\nconvergence in their interpretation within the actual calculations, bringing about significant variations in the results. These\ndiscrepancies lead to low credibility that prevents the wide adoption of the WLC approach. The project brings together two\nspecialist carbon consultants, two highly respected interdisciplinary design firm, the RICS and the University of Cambridge\nto devise a valid carbon calculation methodology which both complies with current international standards and is\neconomically viable for commercial clients. The agreed methodology will ensure consistent outputs and will boost trust in\nthe calculation of embodied carbon of buildings, encouraging further take up of CO2 benchmarking by clients, and opening\nup the way to resource efficiency and carbon reduction. Besides tackling climate change, successful delivery of this project\nwill also leverage UK competitiveness in the growing sustainable buildings market and stimulate markets in low carbon\nconstruction products and carbon consultancy services.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509024/1","grantId":"EP/N509024/1","fundValue":"79300","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Moncaster","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
