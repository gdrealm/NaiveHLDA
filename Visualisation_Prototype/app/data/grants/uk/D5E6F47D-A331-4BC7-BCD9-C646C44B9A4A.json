{"id":"D5E6F47D-A331-4BC7-BCD9-C646C44B9A4A","title":"Low-dimensional topology and the complex of curves","abstractText":"Topology in dimension three is the most accessible field ofmathematics; this is because three-dimensional space is the realm ofeveryday experience. Established by Poincare in a series of inspiringarticles in the late 1800's much of the work in low-dimensionaltopology was combinatorial in nature. In 1979 Thurston revolutionizedthe field by revealing deep connections to many other, more geometric,areas of mathematics.The geometric theme in low-dimensional topology has expanded to include coarse geometry. One striking success of this theme was the work of Masur and Minsky [1999, 2000]; they introduced the idea of using coarse geometry to understand the complex of curves. The complex of curves, defined by Harvey, is a combinatorial analogue of Teichmuller space.The novelty proposed here is to use the methods of Masur and Minsky tostudy and solve combinatorial problems, some first encountered byPoincare, in low-dimensional topology. The themes running through theproposal include handlebodies and Heegaard diagrams, the recognitionproblem for the three-sphere, the structure of the mapping classgroup, and the cobordism group of automorphisms of surfaces.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I028870/1","grantId":"EP/I028870/1","fundValue":"88321","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Saul  Schleimer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
