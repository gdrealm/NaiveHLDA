In particular, it considers family structure as an independent contributor to health disparities, as a factor that explains some of the observed ethnic and socioeconomic health inequalities, and as a factor that works together in complex ways with ethnicity and socioeconomic status to create disparities. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, family structure and family transitions are expected to influence:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>the quantity of time that parents spend with their child; </li>\n\n <li>the quality of parental time;</li>\n\n <li>the quality of children's physical environments within and outside of the home.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The project uses data from two nationally representative birth cohort studies that follow children from birth through middle childhood: the Millennium Cohort Study and the US Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study.&nbsp; Both contain detailed information on family structure and children's health, and both have substantial socioeconomic and ethnic diversity</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H036415/1","grantId":"ES/H036415/1","fundValue":"262070","fundStart":"2009-11-16","fundEnd":"2014-10-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings are being developed for the final report which is due in 3 months time.
