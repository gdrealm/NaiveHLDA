This has not, as yet, been confirmed by research. </p> \n<p>The first objective of the proposed research is to develop a measure that uses both individual and area characteristics to capture the multiple dimensions of social exclusion associated with life in an impoverished area.<br /><br />The second is to examine the consequences of social exclusion for physical and mental health and whether these are ameliorated or exacerbated by area regeneration. A classification of small areas will be developed that reflects their regeneration status, in terms of intensity (eg, amount and duration of funding) and focus (eg, generic or specific). </p> \n<p>The research will inform future social and health policy aimed at improving the life chances and the health of poor people living in poor areas. Is regeneration an effective means of achieving this? If not, what alternative policies are suggested by the evidence produced by this research?</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0469","grantId":"RES-062-23-0469","fundValue":"136921","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah Jane Baker","coPersons":["Stephen  Barrow"],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
