Aims of the Node are as follows: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To understand the extent to which the level of complexity in interdisciplinary applications determine approaches to communication and joint goal setting in interdisciplinary work. </li>\n\n <li>To understand how theoretical and practical solutions to support interdisciplinary work, both academic and policy-related, can be developed to support future research. </li>\n\n <li>To demonstrate that eSocial Science solutions can be deployed to support various facets of integrative research through the development of appropriate tools. </li>\n\n <li>To promote awareness of the Semantic Grid vision and supporting technologies amongst social scientists, and to facilitate training through workshops, etc.</li>\n\n <li>foster interdisciplinary research between social and computer scientists. </li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-149-25-1075","grantId":"RES-149-25-1075","fundValue":"874263","fundStart":"2009-05-27","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The nature of the project funding, with its focus on eSocial Science (and later Digital Social Research) meant that our emphasis was always on academic researchers and tools to support them. However, through partnerships with a number of external stakeholders, there may be scope for non-academic impacts in the future. This includes policy makers and the wider evidence-based policy agenda.\n\nUPDATE October 2014\nWork has recently begun with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) representing Scotland's Environment Web (SEweb), to transfer some of the technologies developed within PolicyGrid into SEweb. The project seeks to develop innovative tools to make Scottish research information, data and expertise, easily accessible and understandable to the widest range of users (including public bodies, academics, businesses, and interested members of the public), and to promote Scotland's Research Excellence to European stakeholders. These tools will help maximise the impact and reach of Scottish environmental research to a wide range of environmental data and information users. \n\nAspects of the PolicyGrid-II provenance framework (including technologies for representing and reasoning about policies) have also been exploited in the context of the 'Trusted Tiny Things' project - exploring transparency and trust issues in the context of the Internet of Things. This work is in partnership with Swirrl ltd and Aberdeenshire Council.

The research involved close working with three interdisciplinary case study groups to There is scope for a number of audiences to take forward the project outcomes. The provenance infrastructure has potential application in any domain that requires a mechanism to support transparency and/or audit. We are already working with partners in healthcare, transport and environment to explore these issues further.
