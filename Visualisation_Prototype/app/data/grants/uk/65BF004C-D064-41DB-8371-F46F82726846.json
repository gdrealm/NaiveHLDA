Emerging information society technologies (IST) are very powerful, supporting a wide range of functions.&nbsp;As such, the main question to ask is not “What&nbsp;can this technology do?” but “What can users do with this technology?” A key issue is accessibility. Universal access for all is defined as access for all, irrespective of technology, location, ability, disability or social membership. However,&nbsp;this requires a substantial, multidisciplinary effort, including psychology, statistics, computing, education, sociology, engineering, policy makers, designers and IST vendors.</p> \n<p>The seminar series is co-ordinated by the Collaborative International Research Centre for Universal Access (CIRCUA), and aims to tackle the problems of accessibility in general,&nbsp;including e-accessibility in particular, by&nbsp;drawing together new and existing researchers, policy makers and practitioners.&nbsp;The workshops have four themes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>User diversity, modelling and profiling;</li> \n <li>User sensitive design and methods;</li> \n <li>Design standards &amp; legislation for accessibility; and</li> \n <li>Essential practitioner skills.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>Planned outcomes include: the identification of solutions to accessibility problems; a multi-author publication; and the creation of partnerships for further research and application.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4280","grantId":"RES-451-25-4280","fundValue":"11680","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ray  Adams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
