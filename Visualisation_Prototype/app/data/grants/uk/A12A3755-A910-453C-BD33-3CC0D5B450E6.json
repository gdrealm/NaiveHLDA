The complexity of refugee representation (by refugees and others) as it relates to globalisation and fears about national security will be explored via a series of activities, including workshops, symposia and internet discussions. While highlighting performance as an exemplary medium through which to explore questions about identity, belonging, refuge, corporeality, surveillance and ethics, the network also aims to involve scholars from other disciplines to expand and energies' specific, performance-based research work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119540/1","grantId":"119540/1","fundValue":"20627","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Gilbert","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
