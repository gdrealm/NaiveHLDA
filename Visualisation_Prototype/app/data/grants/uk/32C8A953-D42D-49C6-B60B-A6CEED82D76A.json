In order to reach beyond the limitations of conventional fluid dynamic models, we propose new collaboration and knowledge exchange between leading research groups at the University of Strathclyde, the University of Michigan, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Together, we will create a unique suite of computational tools for the highly dilute gas conditions found at the microscale and in upper planetary atmospheres, that will bring to the UK a new international capability to tackle some of the most challenging engineering flow problems over the next 20 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J005924/1","grantId":"EP/J005924/1","fundValue":"97152","fundStart":"2012-01-16","fundEnd":"2013-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom  Scanlon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
