{"id":"DF4CC6DC-1A4D-42A6-87E3-D7735ABE5129","title":"Applying strategic Management Education in Practice: Patterns and Drivers of Adoption in UK Business Schools Alumni","abstractText":"Despite increasing concerns about business school relevance, there is relatively little evidence about whether graduates use the tools, techniques and concepts taught during management education. This lack of evidence is a problem not only for business schools but also for organizations, employees and the business sector more widely. An important question, therefore, is; which tools and concepts taught in management education are applied by graduates in the workplace, what factors influence application, and how and why are these tools used?\n<br />\n<br />This project aims to evaluate the extent to which business school alumni use within their workplaces, a specific set of strategic management tools and concepts that are typically taught in foundation courses within business schools. A survey method is used to analyse the level of awareness and intensity of use of commonly taught strategy tools by domestic and international business school alumni, in the strategy processes of a range of organisations spanning from private to public, large to small and local to multinational, within a range of sectors. The project will provide systematic evidence about the context and conditions of tool use and the degree of satisfaction with specific tools in terms of their applicability to different business functions. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G020477/1","grantId":"ES/G020477/1","fundValue":"78034","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paula  Jarzabkowski","coPersons":["Monica  Giulietti"],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
