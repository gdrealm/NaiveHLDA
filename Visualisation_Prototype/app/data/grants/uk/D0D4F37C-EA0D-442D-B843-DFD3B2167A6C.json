Sometimes one can solve a problemjust using topology, which describes the rough shapeof an object. But topology is not always enough to tell uswhether a given equation can be solved. We are led to set upmore subtle theories such as algebraic K-theory whichinclude more information about which algebraic equationscan be solved. But mathematicians face massive challengesin trying to compute algebraic K-theory. This problem includestwo of the Clay Institute's famousmillion-dollar problems, the Hodge conjectureand the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.The proposed research seeks to compute algebraic K-theoryand related theories for a special class of examplesbased on groups. Group theory is the mathematical theoryof symmetry. In this situation, we see the prospectof complete calculations of algebraic K-theory and relatedtheories. Our calculations willcontribute to ancient and difficult classification problemsin algebra, such as the classification of quadratic forms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E01786X/1","grantId":"EP/E01786X/1","fundValue":"273990","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"B  Totaro","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
