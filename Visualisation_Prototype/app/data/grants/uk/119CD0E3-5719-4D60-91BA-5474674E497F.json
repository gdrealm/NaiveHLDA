The role of the personnel within this grant submission is to facilitate the smooth running of the cruises bringing to bear many years of experience on past scientific voyages to help the Principal Scientists to have a successful and less stressful experience, particularly with first time cruise leaders. Scientific liason will be maintained along with co-ordination and planning of the individual cruise scientific objectives for each research cruise.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E014208/1","grantId":"NE/E014208/1","fundValue":"56893","fundStart":"2006-11-10","fundEnd":"2008-11-09","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This was a practical programme that facilitated the cruises for SOLAS. The fact that the cruises were successfully carried out and with minimum problems is a testament to the success of the grant provision.

This it did as required in the proposed aims of the funding. The cruises were facilitated successfully and everything was carried out efficiently. The allowed the successful future grant funding for UK-Geotraces and also the UK Shelf Seas NERC programmes. Knowledge and experience gained will be used for future projects in order to allow them to be facilitated correctly. As it was not research as such there is no exploitation possible.
