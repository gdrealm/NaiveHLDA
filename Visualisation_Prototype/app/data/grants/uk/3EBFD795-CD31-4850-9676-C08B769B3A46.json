{"id":"3EBFD795-CD31-4850-9676-C08B769B3A46","title":"W.G. Sebald: Modernity and the Archive","abstractText":"The widely acclaimed writer W.G. Sabald is often seen as a 'holocaust Author', especially by Anglo-American critics. This approach however, ignores the fact that his works constitutes a sustained engagement with modernity that goes back to the radical changes that took place in European societies around the time of the Industrial Revolution. These included new ways of producing and organising knowledge about the world and the human subjects who inhabited it. Taking Sebald's extensive concern with archival practices as its focus, the project will analyse the implications of Sebald's representations of the archive for an understanding of his critique of modernity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112994/1","grantId":"112994/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Long","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
