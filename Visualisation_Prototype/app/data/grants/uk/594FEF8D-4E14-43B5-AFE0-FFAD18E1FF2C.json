Adenoviruses, which naturally infect people, can be made incapable of growing and causing disease by removing parts of their genome DNA, and then foreign gene sequences can be added in their place to create a gene delivery vector. When the vector infects a cell, the foreign gene is efficiently taken into the cell but, ideally, no further events of the infectious cycle occur. Instead, the foreign gene becomes operative in the cell and has a beneficial effect. However, many earlier versions of adenovirus vectors suffered from two related problems: the gene delivery effect did not last very long and powerful immune responses were generated to viral proteins made from the so-called 'late' genes that had not been removed from the genomes of these vectors. Adenovirus late genes provide proteins that are essential for the vector to be grown in the laboratory. If you take the late genes out of the vector, you cannot grow the vector particles that you need to use in therapy unless you provide the proteins in a different way. The two options are to mix the vector with a second virus that still has these late genes, so it can help the vector to grow, or to make special cells that contain the missing genes and to use these to grow the vector. In the first case you end up with a mixture from which you have to separate out the vector particles that you want, which is difficult on a large scale, while in the second case, persuading cells to make all these proteins in the large amounts needed has so far been impossible. We have been working on a new way to prevent the production of these late viral proteins when a vector is used, that works without actually removing all the genes. This means that the genes can still be used to provide the necessary proteins when growing the vector in the laboratory. The trick is to remove the genes for just two late proteins, which we have discovered turn on the production of all the others. When these two proteins are provided the vector grows well but otherwise, none of the late genes it carries will work. We have made cells that will make these two key proteins 'on demand' / the cells cannot be asked to make them all the time because they harm the cells / and have used them to grow a virus that has the two genes removed. Now we want to find out how this deleted virus behaves when used for gene delivery. First of all, we need to study its basic properties, such as how easy it is to grow and how stable its particles are. Then, we are planning to use it to study the delivery of a test gene into cells and tissues, to find out how long the gene stays around and keeps working.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E014550/1","grantId":"BB/E014550/1","fundValue":"355117","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Within my research website (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/kleppard/), I provide content specifically designed to explain my work to the public via a 'For the Public' page, where the broad thrust and purpose of what I do is explained in layman's terms.\nIn September 2009, I gave a live TV interview from my laboratory during the wave of public concern about papillomavirus vaccine safety following the death of a vaccinee locally. \nI and my research team developed and presented a hands-on demonstration of adenovirus gene delivery vector design for a public awareness event arranged by the British Society for Gene Therapy in 2007, and before that contributed to public understanding events at the ThinkTank in Birmingham. \nFinally, I explain my work to visitors at university open-days, usually via a demonstration of confocal microscopy.

This involvement was previously unsuspected, 22K having been described only as a packaging factor needed for viral genome insertion into progeny particles. (Published 2009)\n\nDiscovery of a dedicated L4 promoter, proof it is required during the intermediate phase of the adenovirus life cycle to achieve normal late gene expression, and description of the viral and cellular factors that activate it. This discovery explains how the L4-22/33K proteins, previously thought to be expressed only from the MLP, can have essential functions in MLP expression. This new understanding constitutes a significant revision to the long-established view of the adenovirus gene expression cascade.

The existence of the L4 promoter opens up new possibilities for controlling the unwanted expression of viral late proteins from vectors being used for gene therapy applications.\n\nThe cell line technology that we developed and reported in 2010 is generic and may be used by anyone wishing to make cell lines with predetermined levels of transgene expression.
