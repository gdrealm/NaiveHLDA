For example, the structure of DNA has been discovered, and the genetic information encoded in its structure has begun to be worked out. We know that many biological molecules are associated with particular types of behaviour in larger organisms: for example some people have a genetic predisposition to particular diseases. However, understanding the complex links in the chain between a single molecule inside a cell and the behaviour of a person is a very difficult challenge. We can focus in on individual molecules and understand their structures and behaviour in great detail, but every human body contains vast numbers of molecules of many different types, and the challenge is to try to put together the complex systems of interactions between molecules that go on inside each cell; the relationships between cells that lead to the function of tissue; and the way that tissues and organs are integrated into a whole person. When a person discovers they have cancer, for example, there is a strong chance that the disease began with a change in a single molecule; but this will have initiated a staggeringly complex cascade of knock-on chains of cause-and-effect that led to the formation of the disease, and modern epigenetics is also suggesting that a complex chain of cause-and-effect may very well have preceded that initial change. Untangling this web of interactions is an enormous challenge but it is undoubtedly the most important problem facing biology at present.\n\nIt is clear that biological systems function on different length scales (molecules/cells/tissues/people) and the challenge is to integrate understanding across the length scales. The ways that biologists think about molecules are very different from the ways that they think about ecosystems, for example, even though a molecular event can trigger a change in an ecosystem. Physics has been addressing the problem of integrating across length scales for many years. At the most extreme, quantum gravity tries to integrate the laws of quantum mechanics (which deals with the smallest building blocks of matter) and general relativity (which describes the behaviour of planets, stars and galaxies). Importantly, physicists have been thinking about detail and also how to integrate across length scales to develop a picture of very large systems. We believe that this gives physicists unique insights that may potentially help biologists to integrate their thinking across the length scales too. The goal of this Network proposal is to stimulate engagement between physicists and biologists to tackle this important challenge together.\n\nThe Network will provide a range of activities designed to help physicists and biologists build new partnerships devoted to finding a framework to understand biology across the length scales. Three initial events will focus on key challenges (How do many molecules come together to form a living cell? Can we build synthetic systems that replicate cell behaviour and allow us to understand how the integration from molecules to cells functions? How do many cells work together in tissue, biofilm or other forms?) Following these initial events a series of activities will be developed to provide the means of bringing leading physicists and biologists together to address the important challenges identified.\n\nOur goal will be to provide a framework from within which physicists and biologists can work together to understand biology across the length scales. The rewards for this effort are many, including the development of a better understanding of disease (for example, cancer), ecosystems and the environment, photosynthesis and biological energy harvesting, biotechnology and biofilms. Inevitably this will contribute substantially to the many bioscience-related industries in the UK and to the health and quality of life of its citizens.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000594/1","grantId":"EP/K000594/1","fundValue":"247084","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Leggett","coPersons":["Jamie  Hobbs"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" It is too early to say.
