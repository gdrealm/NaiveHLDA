{"id":"A7311183-83AF-461E-BB5C-3BA9845AC42D","title":"Research Collaboration between WMG and IIT Kharagpur","abstractText":"Summary: The University of Warwick and the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) have signed an agreement to work together to meet challenges of importance to the UK and India - in particular the technologies for low-carbon economies, for advanced healthcare, for efficient non-polluting transport systems, and for secure ICT systems. These technology challenges will be met through a multi-disciplinary partnership, working across institutions, across sciences, and across academia and business to create and apply innovative solutions that we need. Building on the existing links between WMG (Warwick Manufacturing Group) at Warwick and IIT-KGP, the agreement sets out an exciting agenda of future R&amp;D collaboration and the creation of 'cells' for IIT-KGP at WMG and for WMG at Kharagpur as a focus for exploitation. WMG and IIT-KGP will focus their partnership initially on three themes of economic, environmental and quality-of-life importance to India and the UK: low-carbon vehicles, medical technology and ICT/e-security. This proposal seeks support for travel costs for the WMG research theme leads for the three themes, and lead academics in their teams to work at IIT-KGP. Research funding is covered by existing grants and, in particular, industrial funding for collaborative programmes. The seed corn funding sought in the Overseas Travel Grant proposal will support the travel costs of academic staff and lead researchers at WMG to travel to IIT-KGP to develop, progress and help exploit collaborative research in the three themes. Over the three year period approximately 35 visits to IIT-KGP will be supported, each of typically a week's duration. Research will be undertaken by existing and new research students and researchers. The Initiative will be self sustaining after EPSRC funding completes with full links having been established between the research teams and funds to continue collaboration being sought through industry and government sponsored research projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I002456/1","grantId":"EP/I002456/1","fundValue":"25051","fundStart":"2010-09-07","fundEnd":"2012-09-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John Dashwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
