{"id":"6AD91454-8D53-4CCE-9AF1-D30EAE252013","title":"Qualitative Innovations in CAQDAS (QUIC)","abstractText":"QUIC (“Qualitative Innovations in CAQDAS”) will deliver a core, well-established Training and Capacity Building programme in qualitative software and also explore three breaking developments. The first concerns qualitative software support for integrating qualitative and quantitative data in mixed method research. The second relates to multi-stream visual data. Social science increasingly uses visual data, and a new technology called 'Access Grid' allows people at many locations to participate in 'virtual fieldwork' or teaching sessions convened by a host site. QUIC will document how to analyse AG multi-stream visual data using CAQDAS, and deliver training via AG. The third development concerns a technology many drivers have encountered, the GPS navigating system. Geo-referencing qualitative software will enable users to add a spatial dimension to qualitative data analysis. QUIC will explore the three new areas by applying them to the field of environmental risk. Two will be tested in mini-research projects concerning social factors in response to natural environmental risk arising from climate change, and the third in social environmental risk arising from crime/disorder. QUIC will derive exemplars, teaching datasets, and self-learning materials from each mini-research project and transfer these to its Training and Capacity Building programme.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-576-25-0002","grantId":"RES-576-25-0002","fundValue":"784324","fundStart":"2008-09-15","fundEnd":"2011-09-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Fielding","coPersons":["Raymond  Lee","Jane  Fielding"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
