{"id":"1082E4E3-9844-4FDE-B334-94CB5FCD4DE2","title":"Development of Bioemulsifier Production to Advance Commercial Explotation Opportunities","abstractText":"This proposal aims to exploit a suite of natural emulsifiers (bioemulsifiers) that show exceptional\npromise as ingredients and production process agents in industries such as healthcare and food and\nbeverages. Emulsifier use is widespread because of the need to mix 'oil and water' in many\nproducts. Bioemulsifiers are microbially produced surface-active molecules that are promising\nalternatives to the chemically synthesised varieties because they are natural, have potentially lower\ntoxicities and improved functionality (e.g. foaming, stabilisation; tolerance to extremes of\ntemperature and pH). This project aims to significantly increase bioemulsifier production to\nfacilitate commercial exploitation opportunities, by: (i) induction and selection of hyper-producing\nmutant strains using non-GM methods; (ii) optimise microbial fermentation; and (iii) improve\nrecovery and purification processes. Through market research we will identify market opportunities\nand potential barriers to commercialization and develop and extend existing collaborations with\ninterested parties and explore commercially uses for these bioemulsifiers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E523272/1","grantId":"NE/E523272/1","fundValue":"81249","fundStart":"2007-04-16","fundEnd":"2008-04-15","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The research has identified fundamental properties of the bioemulsifiers that is relevant to marine biogeochemistry. The research has also enabled development of subsequent biopolymers for future commercial exploration. Results from this grant yielded a bioemulsifier product that was of application interest to two commercial companies. However, the production level that was achieved was still deemed insufficient to warrant these companies trying to develop this product further.

Conservative increases in yield were achieved, but these increases were still insufficient to be considered 'economic' for either of two companies interested in these bioemulsifiers. Therefore, the aim of commercialising these bioemulsifiers was not achieved. In parallel work identifying the biochemical characteristics of these bioemulsifiers, we identified that these biopolymers are likely to be important in binding essential trace elements such as iron for the bacteria, but also that these biopolymers may make some metals more bioavailable to algae these bacteria live in association with. Furthermore, these biopolymers could bind a range of heavy metals, which may be an important ecological property, but also raises the possibility of using these biopolymers to remediate waters of heavy metal contamination. The environmental and ecological implications for why these biopolymers are made is being developed as a research direction examining the role of bacterial biopolymers (and bacteria) may have in accessing essential trace elements from terrestrial humic material. The research knowledge and skills are being used to develop new biopolymers for commercial exploitation.
