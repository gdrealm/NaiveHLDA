Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is extensively employed to measure or compare distances in such macromolecules, especially nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Fluorescence is highly sensitive so that it can be studied at the level of a single molecule and it can be performed inside cells. \n\nFRET results from a coupling between two fluorescent groups attached at known positions in the molecule of interest. This is through space, not requiring physical contact. The efficiency of this process depends upon the distance between the groups, and can be arranged to be in the length range that is optimal for studies of biological molecules. In studies of single molecules this can be used to analyze distances between selected segments of a molecule, and how this changes as a function of time in dynamic processes. Such information is particularly powerful in the study of DNA and RNA structure. However, a well-known complication is that the magnitude of FRET depends on both distance and orientation of the fluorescent groups. If the latter is not properly treated the distance information obtained can be very misleading. This has severely limited obtaining reliable quantitative data from FRET in the past. On the other hand, if the orientation of the fluorescent groups is understood, this can generate reliable distance estimates together with valuable angular information. \n\nRecent work in this laboratory has demonstrated that when certain fluorescent groups (called cyanines) are used in FRET measurements in nucleic acids, they stack onto the ends of double helices where they are oriented in a defined manner. We have used this property to show that we can measure angular information from FRET data, and consequently more reliable distance information. This puts FRET measurements on a reliable quantitative basis and we now wish to develop this as a method to study the structures of DNA and RNA in solution. This should have a major impact in the structural biology and dynamic properties of nucleic acids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017094/1","grantId":"EP/J017094/1","fundValue":"342609","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At present results have been published in professional journals and at scientific conferences.

This project is still on-going, but is proceeding very well. For example, we have determined the structure at a three-way helical junction in the RNA of a special element in the hepatitis C virus that allows a ribosome to bind internally and begin protein synthesis. This work continues. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 170 million people worldwide. Individuals with persistent HCV infection are at significant risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no vaccine, and current therapies are poor. The IRES element could be its 'Achilles heel' and structural work could lead to therapeutic intervention.
