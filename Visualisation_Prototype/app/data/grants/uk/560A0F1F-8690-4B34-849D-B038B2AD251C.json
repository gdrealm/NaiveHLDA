The book will consider how certain writers have taken responsibility of the circulation of culture (where circulation is construed not simply economically but as a ventilation of values), showing how the writers in question figure, feature, and treatise and in various other ways ensure such transmission. Taking enthusiasm as an over - arching term for these practised, Essays on American Enthusiasm will consider how and why books are passed on.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112757/1","grantId":"112757/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Herd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
