These genes could potentially be involved in important biological cell functions and could represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. A major undertaking for biology is therefore that of identifying the function of these uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. The challenge for bioinformatics is then to develop algorithms that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function.\n\nComparisons of sequences from complete genomes have revealed that gene duplication, divergence and rearrangement are predominant mechanisms that drive the expansion of the set of proteins of a given organism during evolution. This means that proteins can be grouped into families, where members are likely to perform similar functions. The identification of these protein families is therefore central as it can provide important clues for the function of proteins.\n\nProteins are often composed of several domains. A domain is segment of protein sequence that can evolve independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and it can appear in a variety of different proteins. Protein function depends on the mutual interplay between the distinct domains and the links between them. In other words, protein function depends on the domain architecture of the protein.\n\nTherefore we would like to have a tool that can group proteins into families according to their architecture: all proteins with the same architecture should belong to the same group. The development of such a tool is exactly the goal of this project. Moreover the tool that we plan here will also be able to suggest possible functional roles for the various architectures.\n\nOur tool is aimed at working on very large sets of proteins. The amount of calculations for problems of this size is only feasible by taking advantage of the latest advances in graphical processing unit (GPU) technology. Modern GPUs are very efficient for graphics but their highly parallel structure makes them extremely effective for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel - even more effective than general-purpose CPUs. \nThe use of GPU technology will allow us to create a web application that will be used by scientists to obtain the architectures for very large set of proteins together with possible functional roles for the various architectures. Importantly, we shall periodically run our system on the major genomes available and we will thus be able to through our web server architectures and relative annotation for all the proteins in those genomes. All these web services will be made freely available to the scientific community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K004131/1","grantId":"BB/K004131/1","fundValue":"114627","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are aware of ConSAT being used by two independent research groups which are actively working with organism of a high practical interest for crop production and for biofuel production.\n\n1) Pablo Sotelo, from the Universidad Nacional de Asuncion (Paraguay) is working with the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, a plant pathogen affecting more than 500 plant species (many crops among them). ConSAT has been used to produce a functional annotation of the proteome of this fungus, which is the first step for its characterization and is aimed at finding better and more targeted mechanisms for pest-control. Paraguay is one of the largest producers of soya in the world, this work has important economic implications for the country.\n\n2) Matteo Pellegrini (University of California, Los Angeles) leads a lab with a high interest in algal genomics. The lab is currently sequencing the genome of the unicellular alga Cyclotella cryptica, a model organism for lipid accumulation. This work has application in the biofuel production industry. The Pellegrini lab has been using the functional predictions provided by ConSAT to annotate this algal genome.\n\nIn our group, we have used ConSAT to participate in the second CAFA challenge, a competition of protein function prediction. Although this activity is within the academic domain, we think it has been important for acquiring visibility and engaging further collaborations.\n\nFinally GoSSToWeb (our web tool for computing semantic similarities between gene products), although it was published very recently (August 2014), has been used numerous times by more than 50 different researchers. We have also received more than ten communications from different users (mainly life scientists) showing interest in the tool and asking different queries regarding its usage.

Knowing the sequences of an organism is a necessary step for their understanding at a molecular level: certain sequences may represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. However, the process of obtaining these genetic sequences needs to be followed by the understanding of the role (function) played by each one of these genes or their corresponding proteins. A fundamental goal is therefore to identify the function of uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. It is difficult to design functional assays for uncharacterized genes so a major current challenge in bioinformatics is to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated experimentally.\n\nComparisons of sequences from complete genomes have revealed that gene duplication, divergence and rearrangement are predominant mechanisms that drive the expansion of the set of proteins of a given organism during evolution. This means that proteins can be grouped into families, where members are likely to perform similar functions. The identification of these protein families is therefore central as it can provide important clues for the function of proteins. Besides, proteins are often composed of several domains. A domain is a segment of protein sequence that can evolve independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and it can appear in a variety of different proteins. Protein function depends on the mutual interplay between the distinct domains and the links between them (the domain architecture of the protein).\n\nWe have produced a computational method that can group proteins into families according to their architecture. All proteins with the same architecture belong to the same group and therefore this can be used to assign them properties (functions) within that group. We provide two types of functional descriptions: (a) Gene Ontology terms (functions from a controlled vocabulary of biological functions which is a de facto standard in biology); (b) English words with an associated numerical score (weight), describing the protein in plain English terms. Moreover:\n\n1) we have built a tool (ConSAT) aimed at working on very large sets of proteins (i.e. whole genomes) and produce functional assignments for each sequence. This tool is written in Python and it is available at https://github.com/alfonsoeromero/ConSAT with an free software licence (GPLv3), which means that anyone is free to download, modify and use it for any purpose. \n\n2) we have precomputed a functional assignment for all UniProtKB proteins (all the publicly available protein sequences) and we have displayed our prediction on the ConSAT webserver http://paccanarolab.org/consat. On the website the user can query, browse and download the predictions for any given protein or set of proteins. The website is freely available for any user at no charge. ConSAT is of high interest to researchers focusing on protein domain architectures and functional genomics. To name a few, potential beneficiaries of this project are:\n\n1. The biological community at large, interested in comprehensive annotation of genomes.\n\n2. Genome database annotators involved in curating model organism resources like Flybase (Drosophila), Wormbase (round worm), ZFIN (zebra fish), MGI (mouse), TAIR (Arabidopsis) etc.\n\n3. Agriculture: predicting function for plant genes should enable to design genetic methods to improve plant performance.\n\n4. Structural genomics projects that try to understand 3D structure and function of domains with only sequence information.\n\n5. Genome researchers interested in comparative genomic tools and applications for understanding how organisms evolve and species radiate.\n\n6. Researchers interested in designing molecular switches through domain engineering strategies. \n\n7. Pharmaceutical companies looking to attack species-specific pathways containing a certain protein domain architecture.\n\n8. New sequencing efforts: this method could enable researchers to rapidly assign putative function to new genes in freshly sequenced organisms. \n\nSo far we are aware of our work being used by researchers of the second group (Rajkumar Sasidharan, at TAIR), third group (Pablo Sotelo, Asuncion) and the eighth group (Matteo Pellegrini, UCLA).
