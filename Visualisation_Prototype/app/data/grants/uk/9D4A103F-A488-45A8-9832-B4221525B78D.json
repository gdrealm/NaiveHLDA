Thompson Groups.","abstractText":"The proposed project is a workshop, with primary focus the theory of the extended family of R. Thompson groups. \n\nThe extended family of R. Thompson groups are an important family of (generally) finitely presented simple groups (or, nearly simple) which contain the first known examples of finitely presented infinite simple groups. The theory of this family intersects other areas of mathematics in often surprising and profound ways; providing examples and counterexamples to questions from areas such as logic (R. J. Thompson), solvable and unsolvable problems in group theory (R. J. Thompson and R. McKenzie), homotopy and category theory (P. Freyd and A. Heller), shape theory (J Dydak and H. Hastings), Teichmuller theory and mapping class groups (R. Penner) and various other areas as well.\n\nThe workshop will serve to both educate new and established researchers on the State of the Art in this dynamic area, as well as highlight some of the many connections between the theory of these groups and other areas of Mathematics. In particular, the workshop will host three mini-courses on the connections of the extended family of the R. Thompson groups to various outward-reaching areas of mathematics. The titles and presenters of these workshops are given below:\n\n1) Semigroups, 'etale topological groupoids, C*-algebras, and Thompson groups; Mark V. Lawson.\n2) Braids, logic and geometric presentations for Thompson's groups; Patrick Dehornoy.\n3) Thurston's piecewise integral projective groups; Vladimir Sergiescu.\n\nThe workshop will also host a problem session focussing on these groups and the broader topics associated with them, and will publish summaries of the minicourses and the problem session discussion in a topical research journal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L000113/1","grantId":"EP/L000113/1","fundValue":"17182","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant award lead to the creation of a successful workshop with 35 participants from around the globe, which has helped to educate UK researchers (new and established) in current international research in the extended family of R. Thompson groups. This has lead to some new collaborations, as well as submissions from many participants of short surveys of their immediate research area, to be edited by the conference organisers for eventual publication in a conference proceedings. We also have video recordings of many talks which we plan to post on YouTube. One of these recorders has very detailed historical information about the amenability question for R. Thompson's group F which information seems not to be commonly known.

The workshop seemed of great value as well to the graduate student participants, who had exposure to researchers whose work, previously, they had only read. Also, the workshop engendered at least two new collaborations/draft papers for the main organiser, as well as invitations to other institutions in different countries to give talks and embark on new research. We have received short surveys from many of the speakers for publication in a conference proceedings, which surveys provide detailed `Entry to research' roadmaps for researchers trying to branch out in their research to new, but related areas of focus. We also have videos of many of the talks which we hope to place on YouTube after some processing (to raise the volume streams of the recordings, which are audible, but quiet). The intention is to publish these surveys and videos to engender well-aimed further research by a broader research base of workers.
