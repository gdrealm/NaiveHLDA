{"id":"73717BE5-A2FF-4FCD-95BD-055C8E657807","title":"Interrogating cultural value in the 21st Century: the case of 'Shakespeare'","abstractText":"Using the Royal Shakespeare Company's Complete Works Festival as a test case, the project explores the potential of English literary heritage to meet the diverse (and possibly conflicting) social and commercial demands made of it with a view to informing future cultural policy in this area. The research will investigate the different ways of talking about the value of 'Shakespeare' in literary criticism, educational and cultural policy and theatre practice. It will disentangle aesthetic values from those of heritage culture and distinguish both of those values from the social desiderata of inclusivity and equality of access. In doing so, it will demonstrate how those different meanings of value became intertwined at different historical moments in the twentieth century. Its focus is on educational and theatrical practice because it will explore the extent to which these cultural and policy contexts underpin the extension of Shakespeare into film and digital media and it concentrates on England because the values accorded to Shakespeare in the other nations of the UK - and indeed globally- are informed by different histories, policies and institutions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D001021/1","grantId":"AH/D001021/1","fundValue":"358435","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathleen Elizabeth McLuskie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
