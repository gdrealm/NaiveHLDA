{"id":"AD0205C4-73BF-4CE6-A6B0-DFCB5A4EC358","title":"Study Of Trial Policy Of Interim Trucation-2 (STOP-IT-2)","abstractText":"A recent review 143 randomized trials that stopped earlier than \nplanned because of a larger than expected treatment effect showed \nthat such trials are increasingly common but often show implausibly \nlarge treatment effects. This study (STOP IT-2) aims to understand \nhow biased such early stopping is, and how we might fix the problem. \nTo do this we will find and summarise all other research trials that \nanswer the same questions as those that stopped early and compare the \nresults. The results will have considerable importance to the \ninterpretation of trials that stop early, and will help clinicians, \npolicy makers and consumers in interpreting such trials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600561","grantId":"G0600561","fundValue":"222366","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Glasziou","coPersons":["Stephen  Walter","Gordon  Guyatt","Dirk  Bassler","Rafael  Perera"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
