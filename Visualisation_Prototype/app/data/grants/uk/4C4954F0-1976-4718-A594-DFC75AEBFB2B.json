It will examine how such courses can be enhanced to widen participation of those at risk of marginalisation and drop out from participating in mathematics.&nbsp; It will compare two mathematics programmes: an inquiry based, applied programme ‘Use of Mathematics’ (UoM) and traditional A/S mathematics.&nbsp; We ask:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How effective is UoM in comparison to traditional A/S level mathematics in promoting important learning outcomes?<br /></li>\n\n <li>How can different pedagogic cultures mediate different learning outcomes for students, especially those at risk of marginalisation?<br /></li>\n\n <li>How do different pedagogic cultures mediate students’ mathematical identities and aspirations for further study and how is this influenced by gender, social class and ethnicity? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will address these questions using a combination of (i) a quasi-experiment incorporating measures of attainment, self efficacy, and intention to participate in F&amp;HE (sample size 800); and (ii) a multiple case study of classrooms (approximately 20 classrooms in 10 institutions) with nested case studies of 45 individual learners identities.&nbsp; Overall the project will further our understanding of how pedagogic cultures can support participation in mathematics, especially for our targeted, non-traditional, potential HE learners.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0241","grantId":"RES-139-25-0241","fundValue":"262780","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julian  Williams","coPersons":["Laura  Black","Geoffrey David Wake","Graeme Donald Hutcheson","Pauline  Davis"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
