{"id":"6FF9858A-F278-4A0C-8147-F8C0BAF30D52","title":"Conflict within and between Communities","abstractText":"This initial scoping study seeks to examine conflict within and between communities - with respect to the role of communities in helping to defeat and/or endorse terrorism and the interface with policing efforts to counter terrorism. The research highlights the tension created by often simplified notions of community from policy perspectives, in contrast to the complexity of community as defined and experienced by members. Key findings build around the notion of 'connectors', who stand at the intersections of the different communities involved in the counter-terrorism arena, and whose complex positionalities illustrate both the challenges of community connections, and the possibility for change and conflict transformation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J501251/1","grantId":"AH/J501251/1","fundValue":"27667","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Basia  Spalek","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
