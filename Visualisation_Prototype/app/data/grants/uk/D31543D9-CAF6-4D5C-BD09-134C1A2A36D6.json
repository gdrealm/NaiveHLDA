The course will cover the following topics: (i) electronic properties of the recently discovered new 2D material - graphene, review of the recent progress in quantum Hall effect and spin-Hall effect; (ii) carbon nanotubes, Luttinger liquid in quantum wires and the bosonisation technique, Kondo effect, functional renormalisation group methods; (iii) quantum information processing, phase coherence and de-coherence in qubits, coherent exciton dynamics and optical properties of quantum dots and microcavities, adiabatic and non-adiabatic dynamics of quantum condensates of finite dimensions. The lectures in theoretical methods will be complemented by reviews of advanced experiments and focused research seminars. The lectures and the seminars will be delivered by leading specialists from the USA, the UK, Germany, etc (a full list is in the case for support).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F010125/1","grantId":"EP/F010125/1","fundValue":"15325","fundStart":"2007-07-17","fundEnd":"2007-10-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Igor  Lerner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
