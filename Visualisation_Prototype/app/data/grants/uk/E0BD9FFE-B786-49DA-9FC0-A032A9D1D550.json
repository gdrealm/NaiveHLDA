{"id":"E0BD9FFE-B786-49DA-9FC0-A032A9D1D550","title":"St Andrews Robotically Automated Crystallography","abstractText":"Crystallography is the most useful tool for determining the detailed arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. Unlike other techniques it has not yet been 'automated'. We wish to interface a robotic system with our recently installed high sensitivity diffractometer and develop the technology to produce an automated data collection and structure solution system. The project requires a robot to be installed and software linking together a number of currently available programs to be written. Some 'expert'software will also need to be written and integrated into the system. Once constructed the new automated facility will go on line and support the 70 academic staff/500 researchers in EaStChem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D061768/1","grantId":"EP/D061768/1","fundValue":"803668","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexandra Martha Slawin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
