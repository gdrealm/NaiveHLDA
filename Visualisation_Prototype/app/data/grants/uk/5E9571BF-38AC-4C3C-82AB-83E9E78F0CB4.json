Previous attempts to directly identify in humans the gene explaining differing susceptibility to pneumococcal disease have been without significant success. In order to develop new hypotheses that can be tested in humans, in this project we will exploit the possibilities offered by using animals.\nPreviously we showed that different mouse strains vary in susceptibility to S. pneumoniae and identified part of the mouse chromosome 7, containing about 200 genes, as the location of a gene that determines susceptibility. This region of the mouse chromosome is very similar to part of a human chromosome. This project aims to identify the key mouse gene and to investigate how the gene influences the development of pneumococcal disease. \nThe project will use a programme of mouse breeding known as speed congenics, to narrow the ?susceptibility region? to about 10 genes. Each gene within the narrowed region will be assessed by comparison of its DNA sequence in susceptible and resistant mouse strains and by comparison of the expression of the genes in the tissues of these mice. The resulting hypothesis on which gene is the cause of susceptibility will be tested by determining how resistance and pathology is changed when we replace the candidate gene in the resistant strain with the gene from the susceptible strain. Identification of the candidate gene will increase our understanding of pneumococcal disease and will provide plausible candidates for future studies in humans and could lead to new drug targets and therapeutic approaches therapy. \nWe are committed to better public awareness of research issues through involvement with industry, healthcare providers, patient associations and the general public. Our press office has effective contacts with the media and on several occasions the media have interviewed us about pneumococcal disease and research issues. We present ourselves to the public via open days, public lectures and presentations to alumni. We have a policy of sharing results with external parties, after consideration of IPR. Therefore we will have a web-based database of findings and produce technical dossiers to explain results to different stakeholders including industry. We are committed to the publication of the project results in prestigious journals and at presentations at scientific and medical conferences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501416","grantId":"G0501416","fundValue":"780410","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter William Andrew","coPersons":["Aras  Kadioglu"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
