First, a co-authored paper targeted at the journal Progress in Planning being drafted, with a submission target in early 2014. Second, one of the co-ordinators of the project Dr Xuefeng Wang has been invited to join ISPRE for the application for National Social Science Fund of China on a proposed research project for preparation of the 13th Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan, which is seen as a master plan for China's development policy published every five years. Third, a paper titled Place-based approaches to regional development: global trends and Chinese implications co-authored by professor John Tomaney and Dr Xuefeng Wang, and a paper titled City-region: a way for China's urbanisation written by Dr Xuefeng Wang were selected as book chapters by Shanghai Jiaotong University for their annual book series of China metropolitan regional development, which itself is funded by China's national project called &quot;985&quot; programme. Fourth, Professor Andy Pike has been appointed as a distinguished guest professor by East China Normal University, Shanghai, and Dr Xuefeng Wang's paper Transferable Lessons from British New Towns Movement to China's Rapid Urban Expansion has been included as part of China's National Key research project for preventing and tackling urban problems during the rapid urbanisation in China, which is funded by the national Ministry of Education of China. Fifth, Professors John Tomaney and Andy Pike and Dr Xuefeng Wang have been invited to be Visiting Professors to ISPRE. Sixth, Professor Andy Pike was invited and funded to give a keynote speech to China's Regional Science Association (RSAC) annual conference in Tianjin, October 2013. The RSAC is based in Peking University and led by a Chinese leading economic geographer, the vice-president of Peking University. RSCA has 3000 members mainly from Chinese higher education institutions and governments' arms-length research organisations and think-tanks. By taking the advantages of the funded trip, Dr Xuefeng Wang was also invited to give several lectures to PG students in Peking University, Nanjing University, China North West University, and Wuhan University. Seventh, RSCA has also proposed to collaborate with CURDS on its newly launched postgraduate programme MA Regional Development and Spatial Planning.

Key findings from this cross-national dialogue included: the divergence in approach between policymakers in Britain and China and the different ways in which people and place-based approaches are being handled and integrated; the shifting scales of policy responses to spatial disparity focused upon rebalancing regional development at the sub-national (super-provincial level) regional level, paying no attention to sub-provincial regional disparity, which has led to the significant widening of gaps between regions at this level in China, and changing from regionalism to localism in England in the UK context; and the central importance of governance and institutional arrangements in addressing and underpinning approaches to spatial disparities and policy. Demand for participation in the seminars has been very strong. The feedback from participants at each of the seminar events has been overwhelmingly positive. Key positive points included the importance of seminar series to underpin cross-national research and dialogue around common issues, raising awareness of current conceptual and theoretical approaches to empirical work, and engagement between academics and policymakers.\n\nSecond, the academic researchers have engaged and impacted upon policymakers in the UK and China through the seminar events. Policymakers in China have benefitted from increased awareness of new concepts and theories of local and regional development, new approaches to governance and institutional arrangements and the importance of continuity and stability in long-term strategies. Policymakers in the UK have learnt about the importance of long term plans and frameworks for development, balanced and integrated economic and spatial planning, and connecting infrastructure financing and development. \n\nThird, the emerging international research network on this topic has been further developed and consolidated by the seminar series, facilitating and nurturing the relationships between individuals and institutions in the UK and China. The network developed through the project has also triggered research collaborations. Academic researchers from the UK and China have identified many common interests in spatial disparities and policy responses to be explored in further research grants. Joint applications for research have been developed and some have been successful and funds were secured. CURDS has a Memorandum of Understanding for a joint research centre for research in this area with Shanghai Jiaotong University. In addition, the openness of the seminar series to postgraduate students has stimulated research development and relationships between the UK and China in this area. CURDS has developed and is launching a new MA Regional Development and Spatial Planning in 20114-15 to further this agenda. Partnership Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with several of the partners in the seminar series including Shanghai Jiaotong University.\n\nFourth, given the cross-national nature of the seminar series and its underpinning international network, some publication outputs have been produced by individuals involved in the network and for further development several collaborative joint publications are planned and in progress. A series of publications are in preparation arising from materials presented at the university. These include a paper for Urban Studies and a contribution to Progress in Planning. Members of the research network are participants in a NOK 6 million (approx. ?700k) proposal to the Norwegian Research Council for a comparative Europe-China study of regional disparities. Building upon a recent research project undertaken by CURDS for the Henan Provincial Government Development and Reform Commission, a further project is being developed focusing on sub-regional disparities and policy.
