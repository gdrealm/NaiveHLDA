We have identified a type of molecule which assembles into large polymeric structures only after it is modified by an innocuous external factor. This provides exquisite control of the process of assembly, and will allow us to direct what is manufactured and where it is manufactured. A team of leading biologists will collaborate intimately with a team of leading polymer physicists to understand the theory of polymerisation of these materials, and to control the type of structure which can be built using derivatives of our initial small molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601798","grantId":"G0601798","fundValue":"100723","fundStart":"2007-10-15","fundEnd":"2008-10-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Colyer","coPersons":["Tom  McLeish"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
