{"id":"8D5C8BA9-CFC3-4ECE-A4DA-4A4A7D93B9B8","title":"EMpower","abstractText":"The UK peak electricity operating margin is at historic lows and DECC are looking to incentivise reductions in peak demand. Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) are looking at peak demand limits to reduce investment for network reinforcement. EMPower will develop a technology solution, which enables communities to improve their energy efficiency by co-operatively scheduling electricity usage and using local generation and storage. The technology will enable communities to secure revenue by offering the electricity market a reduced peak demand on the UK supply to realise significant savings on electricity bills through maximising the use of electricity generation and storage on site, and through automated shifting of loads to achieve the greatest community benefit. The solution needs to be customer-focussed to\nmaximise participation, minimise disruption and provide benefits that directly relate to current and future customer needs. Our solution to this is to tackle the challenges of peak demand reduction at a community level providing greater cost benefits to customers and a more robust and low-risk business case for DNOs.\n\nThe major benefit of the proposed solution to the DNOs and National Grid will be capacity for peak load reduction and limiting the need for traditional and expensive grid reinforcement. We will work with DNOs to construct commercial frameworks to reward communities that limit their peak demand, and develop the delivery vehicle for this finance incentive to determine the potential for wider application. Our 18-month project will prepare the solution for market in 2016 when we expect rising electricity prices, the threat of peak-time power cuts, electric vehicles and maturity of electricity storage to make our solution attractive. \n\nOur project will pilot our technology solution through partnership with Bath and West Community Energy (BWCE). This pilot project will provide greatest benefit within the timescale and budget by focusing specifically on demonstrating the value of the management of on-site solar PV generation in conjunction with battery storage and load shifting to provide a reduction on grid demands during peak periods. This first release of the product will demonstrate the commercial case, prove the technology with real customers and a real community, and provide the foundation for a progressive product enhancement and development strategy as the market develops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506722/1","grantId":"EP/M506722/1","fundValue":"148367","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Sumner","coPersons":["Mark  Gillott"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
