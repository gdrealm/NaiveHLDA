To do this, an existing static, read-only web site will be developed into an interactive, commmunity-driven and commmunity-contributed resource which will encourage participation and ownership by Latin American women themselves.\n\nThe existing web site www.genderlatam.org.uk, resulting from the AHRC-funded project 'Gendering Latin American Independence' (2001-2006), consists of a wealth of data (2300 people, 3900 events, 330 images) which provides an important research tool. Since 2006 it has been widely disseminated across the UK and abroad, mainly in the context of the bicentenaries of Latin American Independence, to academic and general audiences with funds made available by the AHRC (pilot dissemination) and the University of Nottingham (Centre of Advanced Studies, School of Modern Languages and Cultures). However the web site was built in the early 2000s using the technology available then and, as such, is limited in coverage and above all functionality. The follow-on funding will enable a second stage of development with new technologies to provide new faciltilies to encourage public engagement thus radically strengthening knowledge exchange. The aim is to empower Latin American women so that eventually they can take ownership of the resource thus ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nTo this end target users have been identified in the UK and in Latin America who will work closely with the project team to develop the resource by providing input, testing funcionality, experimenting and piloting. These users are a) Latin American women migrants in the UK who will be actively involved in the project by means of collaboration with the project partner, Latin American Women's Rights Service (London) and b) Latin American women in selected locations in Latin America who will be actively involved by means of collaboration with the second partner, the Women's Museums Network (www.womeninmuseum.net), principally in Buenos Aires. The expectation is to make this a three-way collaboration with LAWRS and the Museums, focusing on the theme of women and Independence in Latin America past and present. The target users sourced by the project partners wil be given password protected access to the developing web resource which will enable them to input, manipulate and interpret data in new ways. They will work with the team members to select and edit materials. The project team will establish a set of community editors (on the Wiki model) and opportunities for contributors to be promoted to editors within their ranks to support the site in future. A flagged and patrolled revisions system will be implemented to oversee the Facebook facility enabling unknown contributors to also participate.\n\nIt is enormously important that the activities relating to the development of the new digital resource feed into the educational programmes offered by LAWRS and the museums network which are specially designed to engage with and empower Latin American women. The project activities planned with LAWRS and the museums will form part of a larger framework already in place in the partner organizations which aims to promote debate on gender issues, improve women's rights and opportunities, and encourage learning about opportunities, aspirations and autonomy. The aim is to raise women's awareness of the contribution women made to nation building in Latin America, and the potential for women's political leadership in Latin America today. The users will be given scope to develop the resource in ways that are meaningful to them and will receive training in web skills from the project team. The joint project with LAWRS, entitled Libertadoras, will be captured in a photographic exhibition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013757/1","grantId":"AH/J013757/1","fundValue":"94131","fundStart":"2012-05-21","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They have been used in work with the charity Latin American Women's Rights Service leading to a project with young women of Latin American migrant families in London involving photography and drama workshops; three photography exhibitions in Manchester, Southwark Council offices and City Hall London, and scheduled for showings in Nottingham, London and Oxford; digital technology experimentation with NFC and a new app; work with school children using the app and the webpage; translations workshops with students in Argentina; collaboration with the Women's Museum in Argentina on the topic of women and Independence in Latin America; work with Southwark Council involving the Latin American community and council employees; collaboration with Latin American embassies and diplomatic missions in UK.

The project can have beneficial impact for many people outside academia in ways that were unforeseen at the time of application. It can also lead to spin-offs in other fields of research, notably digital technology. It can be very satisfying but takes a lot of time and effort to bring to fruition. The findings have been taken forward by the creative economy sector, in the form of photographic exhibitions in London and Manchester, and by the digital economy sector, in the form of a new app and other digital projects with NFT. They have also benefited a local council.
