{"id":"648E8ADB-F602-47BA-96A2-943D19ABBA83","title":"17th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory","abstractText":"In 2007 London will be hosting the world's foremost meeting on transportation and traffic theory, the 17th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT17). Of great importance to established and aspiring academics and researchers, this series of symposia provides a highly selective outlet for new theory and important empirical results. Each symposium has been open to the submission of papers on any topic relevant to transportation and traffic theory and its application. The coverage is determined by which submissions are judged by international peer review to be the most significant, providing a fertile environment for seminal contributions. Since its inception in 1959, these symposia have provided a powerful stimulus for advances in theory and practice in the transport field, and have inspired continuing research in and across several countries. In keeping with tradition, the 17th symposium will be selective in terms of the contributions but inclusive in terms of attendance, in particular by junior academics and researchers, so a shortfall between registration fees and costs is anticipated. As with EPSRC support of other symposia, for example GR/S56764/01 (graded outstanding ), this proposal would provide a UK forum for seminal scientific contributions, bring international recognition to younger UK researchers, and stimulate international collaboration with UK universities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D037506/1","grantId":"EP/D037506/1","fundValue":"49721","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Bell","coPersons":["Benjamin  Heydecker"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
