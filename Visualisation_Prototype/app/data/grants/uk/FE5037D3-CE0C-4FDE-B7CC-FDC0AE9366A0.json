{"id":"FE5037D3-CE0C-4FDE-B7CC-FDC0AE9366A0","title":"Engaging with rivers in a period of uncertainty","abstractText":"<p>The sustainability of communities will be closely associated with their use of water. In particular, people will need to have a well-informed relationship with their local rivers, for example in relation to water purity and risks from flooding. It can be difficult to engage communities in river management because people need to understand processes at the catchment scale, which are often complex and unseen. One approach which has been used effectively in certain settings is ‘imaginative engagement’, where art is used to raise people’s awareness by helping them to visualise the realities behind complex, abstract phenomena. </p> \n<p>This research will involve collaboration between Oxford and Sheffield Universities and the Environment Agency, in order to investigate how arts-based methods can be used with stakeholders in relation to river management. The approach is mainly based on a case study of a built-up catchment where there have been particular issues of water quality and intense flooding. The research will also bring together evidence from a range of previous exercises where local stakeholders have participated effectively in river basin planning. Feedback from participatory events will be used to gauge whether the use of visual arts and creative writing has helped to raise people’s ‘catchment consciousness’.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-182-25-0006","grantId":"RES-182-25-0006","fundValue":"72876","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Harry Selman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
