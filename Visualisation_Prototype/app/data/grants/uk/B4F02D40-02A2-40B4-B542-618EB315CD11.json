To be effective, significant obstacles including minimising loss of activity during transit and controlling the dose delivered must be overcome. Our technology is designed to overcome these obstacles and uses the human commensal gut bacterium, Bacteroides ovatus (Bo) to deliver therapeutic agents in the gut in response to the dietary plant based sugar, xylan. This drug delivery platform technology will be further developed using a characterised model Bo strain producing a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can effectively treat and prevent gut inflammation. Determining optimal dosing and delivery regimens and the impact of Bo and xylan dosing on resident gut bacteria and demonstrating functionality in the large bowel will achieve this. The final output will be a robustly characterised delivery technology with pre-clinical proof of safety and functionality for the delivery of therapeutic proteins","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004291/1","grantId":"BB/L004291/1","fundValue":"831445","fundStart":"2013-12-02","fundEnd":"2016-06-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Richard Carding","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
