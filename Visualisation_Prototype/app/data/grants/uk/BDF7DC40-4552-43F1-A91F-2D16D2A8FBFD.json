We are interested in mapping the ways in which engagement with private law might by turns enhance and restrict political engagement between opposing groups and between the citizen and the state. Many critical legal and political scholars worry that our politics are hollowed out by over-reliance on litigation and regulation to fulfil political aims. A number of questions flow from this position:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Is the difficulty amplified when the law at issue is private rather than public law?</li>\n\n <li>Is a resort to private law inevitably a depoliticizing move, or does private law open up novel means of political struggle?</li>\n\n <li>Does the formal, technical nature of private law generate peculiar advantages for political actors?</li>\n\n <li>Does private law inevitably bolster existing disparities in political power, or does it contain means by which imbalances can be addressed?</li>\n\n <li>Are contract and tort cases ever as significant for politics as civil rights litigation, or does private illegality inevitably lack political cachet?&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021903/1","grantId":"ES/J021903/1","fundValue":"14503","fundStart":"2013-01-17","fundEnd":"2015-01-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mairead  Enright","coPersons":["Illan Rua Wall"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" Not applicable this year Not applicable this year Other","dataset":"gtr"}
