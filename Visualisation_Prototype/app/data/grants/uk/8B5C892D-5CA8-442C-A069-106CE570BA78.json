{"id":"8B5C892D-5CA8-442C-A069-106CE570BA78","title":"Strategic Capacity Planning in the Energy Sector","abstractText":"The proposed research will lead to the development of an optimization-based framework for the strategic planning of energy production. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in: (i) the simultaneous consideration of aspects such as technology change, distributed potential of renewable resources, infrastructure constraints, and environmental regulations; and (ii) the modeling of multiple sources of uncertainty. While the methods we will develop will be general, our initial efforts will focus on the production of liquid fuels from renewable resources.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01074X/1","grantId":"EP/J01074X/1","fundValue":"49609","fundStart":"2012-03-05","fundEnd":"2012-08-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lazaros  Papageorgiou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
