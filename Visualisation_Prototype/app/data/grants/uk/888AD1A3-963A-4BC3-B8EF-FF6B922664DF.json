{"id":"888AD1A3-963A-4BC3-B8EF-FF6B922664DF","title":"Reconfiguring the Canon of Twentieth-Century Russian Poetry, 1991-2008","abstractText":"The cultural changes that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet Union created an opportunity to reassess Russian culture of the twentieth century. This project aims to explore how the century's literary culture has been reassessed in the context of institutional changes in Russian education, publishing, and scholarship. In particular, it will investigate ways in which this process of reassessment has affected the canon of twentieth-century Russian poetry from 1991 to the end of Vladimir Putin's second term as Russian President in 2008. It will explore issues of canonicity in relationship to the prominent role that continues to be ascribed to high literary culture as a focus for educated values and national identity, while also assessing the extent to which the very idea of a canon has become contested. The project will examine the relationship between changes to the canon and the search for a post-Soviet identity, at a time when Russian nationalism started to make itself more widely felt in the cultural, as well as in the political sphere.\\n\\nThe process of canon revision to be investigated came after several decades during which the Soviet state played a dominant role in determining the composition of the canon, prescribing certain themes and styles, controlling what could be published, and what was to be studied in schools and universities. By the early 1970s an underground culture of self-published books (samizdat) and 'informal' associations of writers and artists existed alongside officially sanctioned culture, giving rise to the development of a parallel underground canon, and the impression that the literary world was split between two mutually hostile entities. In fact, the boundaries between establishment and 'underground' were not absolute, and many writers existed on the margins, outside both establishment and 'underground' canons. Moreover, the state-authorized canon should be seen less as a monolith than as a work in progress, discontinuous rather than purely linear in its development. Starting with the destalinization process of the mid-1950s, the canon underwent gradual but significant revisions until the late 1980s when numerous works by &eacute;migr&eacute; poets and poets suppressed by the state were published. The collapse of the Soviet Union gave new impetus to this process of revision.\\n\\nThis project will investigate what became of the canon following the breakdown of the institutions that shaped both official and 'underground' canons, the development of a free market, and the rapid expansion of poetry publications on the internet. It will examine how various canon-forming institutions, such as publishing, literary scholarship, and educational curricula combined to reshape contemporary Russian understanding of the twentieth-century poetic canon. It will assess the extent to which current views on the canon suggest that a broad consensus on its nature and composition has been reached, or whether such a consensus is even seen as desirable.\\n\\nThe emphasis will be on determining how the canon represented in official publications of the early- to mid-1980s has changed, exploring the mechanisms involved in canon revision, and examining critical responses to these changes. Key issues for discussion will be the changing position of figures and groups who have either been 'canonized' or 'de-canonized', including those thought to represent the heritage of 'classic' Soviet poetry and the variety and experimentation of the Silver Age; also to be considered will be those poets with no strong affiliation either to 'official' or 'unofficial' Soviet culture, who have tended to be excluded by perceptions of Russian twentieth-century literary history shaped by binary division rather than a continuum.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039619/1","grantId":"AH/H039619/1","fundValue":"450757","fundStart":"2010-09-30","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To introduce a broader public interested in Russian culture to a wider range of twentieth-century Russian poets, making a less familiar area of European culture more approachable to non-specialists. Part of this has been done by creating and publishing new translations of some relatively less well known poets (in a special issue of the journal Rossica), by running a translation workshop, and by organising a reading of translations by respected literary translators.

We have found that the composition of the post-Soviet canon has become more diverse, as previously excluded figures, for example emigre poets like Joseph Brodsky, have been incorporated. There are clear signs of a move from a centrally controlled and unified canon to something far looser, perhaps even a multiplicity of competing canons. Whle there was some appetite for questioning the need for cultural canons at all, particularly in view of the way that the internet has enabled people to share texts and discuss their preferences, nevertheless initial attempts to bring about radical changes have been followed by signs of a more conservative approach, and some attempts to set up a canon in which tradition is valued over innovation, and ?migr? groups are being reclaimed as part of a single Russian literary culture. \nIn relation to the role of institutions in canon formation, the part played by education, through the curriculum and assessment, has shown initial departures from the traditional canon have been gradually reduced. Since the early 2000s there have been signs of a more confident state signalling the value of canonical literature in the education of young people. The emergence of rival literary groupings with competing cultural agendas informed 1990s discussions on revisions to the literary canon, but the cultural environment has since then seen the parallel existence of rival groups which are increasingly unlikely to engage with other groups, but promote their own versions of the poetic canon. In the field of publishing there are signs that the market, a relatively new phenomenon which emerged in the early 1990s, has had an effect on the selection of poets whose work is published, but particularly on the kinds of publications that have emerged: biography and memoir accounts reflect readers' interests in poets' lives and personalities; their texts are less prominent, though it is clear that fears voiced in the early 1990s about the demise of poetry publishing have not been fully realised. Works by previously little known figures who avoided contact with professional published literature during the Soviet period have emerged, if in small print runs, and the internet has made available an enormous and diverse range of poets' work.\nCollaborative workshops were an effective way of developing ideas through dialogue and responding to important overarching questions. The interactive database has made it possible to trace the frequency of publications by and about poets, and opened the way for further investigation of the relationships between poets (e.g. which are published together), leading to plans for more work on the activity and influence of poetic groups in Soviet Russia. Members of the project team have presented their work at international conferences and successfully shown the value of using the canon as a way to interrogate post-Soviet cultural change. Project findings have enabled the team to evaluate the state of the post-Soviet canon of twentieth-century poetry, particularly the ways it has changed since 1991. These findings would be of use to publishers considering an anthology of twentieth-century Russian poetry. The project has made it possible to put forward a new version of the twentieth-century canon which reflects recent Russian views of the canon, rather than taking outdated Anglophone versions as a point of departure.
