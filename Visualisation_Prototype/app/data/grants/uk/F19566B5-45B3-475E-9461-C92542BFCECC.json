However, the underlying empirical studies are dependent upon the quality of their data sets, yet this is a surprisingly neglected topic. Our aim during the visit is to find a means to demonstrate the reliability, or freedom from noise-effects, of data-driven software engineering research results.We propose a new method for assessing the vulnerability to noise of an empirical research result, based on sensitivity analysis and a laddering technique, to determine the tipping point of published empirical studies.If successful, this will provide the software engineering research community with a general purpose method of assessing the potential impact of data quality upon their study conclusions.This research is extremely important as it proposes a solution to the problem of not knowing how vulnerable our research is to potentially problematic data sets. Given the stated aim of this research is to influence practice, this will have considerable societal impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H050329/1","grantId":"EP/H050329/1","fundValue":"10762","fundStart":"2010-09-20","fundEnd":"2010-12-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Shepperd","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
