As such, the transition from the Last Interglacial Complex to the Early Pleniglacial, 67-85 thousand years ago (ka), represents an important case study for gaining insights into the interaction of orbital and short-term climate variability and ice sheet growth. This interval is characterized by a series of millennial-scale climate oscillations, while sea level fell by about 50m, reflecting the expansion of ice sheets in northern high latitudes. For ice sheets to expand a supply of warm, moist air to cold regions is required, so that ice accumulation exceeds ablation. Reconstructed Greenland temperatures show a series of warm events (interstadials) during this period, but corresponding changes in atmospheric methane concentration are subdued, pointing to reduced emissions and a weakening of the hydrological cycle. In parallel, new evidence from ice cores has revealed the presence of centennial oscillations in Greenland temperatures during this interval. These are accompanied by variations in atmospheric methane concentrations, underlining the large geographical extent of these climate changes. This project aims to deliver better constraints on changes in terrestrial environments and the hydrological cycle and on links between key parameters in the climate system during the interval 67-85 ka. This will be achieved by generating a high-resolution pollen record, linked with sedimentological and palaeoceanographic proxies within the same reference marine sequence from the S Portuguese margin. In recent years, the S. Portuguese margin has emerged as a critical area for tracing millennial-scale variability and linking marine and terrestrial records. A key aspect is the geographical setting of the area where the combined effects of the Tagus River and a narrow continental shelf lead to the rapid delivery of terrestrial material, including pollen, to the deep-sea environment. Joint pollen, sediment and palaeoceanographic proxy analysis within the same sequence allows a direct comparison between ocean and terrestrial changes, bypassing timescale and correlation uncertainties. More specifically, the project aims to establish: (1) the strength of the hydrological cycle at mid-to-low latitudes during interstadials: given that changes in vegetation in southern Europe are mainly controlled by variations in the continental hydrological balance, a pollen record for this interval will provide an independent index of changes in the strength of the hydrological cycle, which can be compared with that inferred from the atmospheric methane record. (2) the response of vegetation to sub-millennial events and impact on erosion: while work on the Portuguese margin has established the immediate response of vegetation to millennial-scale variability, sub-millennial variations have not been previously documented. A new ultra high-resolution record of changes in sediment composition in the reference marine core has now revealed the presence of sub-millennial events, coeval with variations in ice core records. By increasing the resolution of the pollen record during these events, the project will investigate whether the oscillations in sediment composition were accompanied by vegetation changes. This, in turn, will test the hypothesis that the rapid changes in sediment composition reflect variations in the terrigenous supply from the Tagus River, which are ultimately controlled by the interplay of the hydrological balance and extent of vegetation cover. The results will have implications for understanding moisture sources for ice sheet growth during transitions into full glacial conditions and the response of terrestrial environments to short-term climate variability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I017534/1","grantId":"NE/I017534/1","fundValue":"52574","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Polychronis Constantinos Tzedakis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The transition from the Last Interglacial Complex to the Early Full Glacial, 67-85 thousand years ago, represents an important case study for gaining insights into the interaction of orbital- and millennial-scale climate variability for ice-sheet growth. For ice sheets to expand a supply of warm, moist air to cold regions is required, so that ice accumulation exceeds ablation. Greenland temperatures show a series of warm events (interstadials) superimposed on the overall cooling trend and the fall in sea-level by ~50m. These interstadials may have played a key role in intermittently providing the necessary moisture supply for ice expansion. However, corresponding increases in atmospheric methane concentration are very subdued, pointing to a possible weakening of the hydrological cycle in low latitudes. This has been attributed to the decline in summer insolation, which would have led to a southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), reducing the strength of the hydrological cycle in low latitudes and methane emissions. It is possible, however, that the subdued methane increases do not, in this instance, represent low-latitude changes but may be caused by reduced emissions from high-latitude sources because of ice expansion. Independent proxies for the strength of the hydrological cycle are therefore needed to understand the nature of changes during this period and the origin of the moisture source for ice sheets.\n\n\n\nThe first main objective of the project was to establish the strength of the hydrological cycle at mid-to-low latitudes by generating a detailed pollen record from a reference deep-sea sequence in the S Portuguese margin. Our results point to an increased summer moisture supply for ice-sheet growth, which was driven by orbital-scale changes (causing a steeper meridional insolation gradient and a stronger meridional atmospheric transport), rather than millennial-scale variability.\n\n\n\nThe second objective was to assess the response of vegetation to centennial-scale events that have recently been identified in Greenland temperatures. Our results showed the presence of centennial oscillations in tree cover at the onset and end of Greenland Interstadial 21, coeval with changes in the composition of deep-sea sediments. Understanding the transition into a glacial state is an important area of investigation, with regard to the processes that contribute to ice-sheet growth. In this respect, our results can be of value to climate modelling efforts aiming to constrain the strength of the hydrological cycle and moisture sources for ice sheet growth during glacial inception and the relative importance of orbital vs millennial-scale climate changes.
