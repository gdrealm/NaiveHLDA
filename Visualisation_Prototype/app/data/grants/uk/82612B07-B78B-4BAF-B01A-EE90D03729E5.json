Importantly, in the longer term, children who had severe lung infections as infants are much more likely to develop wheezing and asthma. Recent studies found that prevention of lung infection in infants reduces the likelihood of those children developing asthma - supporting the idea that there is a direct causal link. We now wish to understand how infection as an infant can lead to long term changes in the health of the lungs. To do this, we have developed a mouse model of newborn lung infection. If mice are infected with Respiratory Syncytial Virus as newborns, they develop much worse symptoms if they experience another lung infection later in life. We will study different types of challenges to the lungs, and determine how they are each affected by the experience of having had a lung infection as a newborn. We will ask which cells in the lungs become altered as a result of neonatal infection, and how genes controlling these cells differ in the lungs, changes which could underlie the long-term effects we observe. This work will enable us to gain far greater understanding of how early-life infections can have long-term impact, in particular on the health of our lungs. We hope that by understanding these processes, we can arrive at new interventions, which could prevent or treat childhood asthma and wheeze.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001763","grantId":"G1001763","fundValue":"500338","fundStart":"2011-10-10","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona Jane Culley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
