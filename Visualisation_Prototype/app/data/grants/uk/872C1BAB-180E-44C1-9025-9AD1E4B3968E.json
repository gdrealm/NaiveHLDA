Firms facing more competition are predicted to withhold this information, which may aid their competitors. More profitable firms are also predicted to withhold this data, as rivals may mimic their strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The results of previous studies on the relationship between competition, profitability and disclosure, are mixed. This is posited to be due to their examining public companies, where pressure from capital markets provides incentives to disclose, even when product market competition is fierce. These confounding incentives make it difficult to isolate the effects of competition in the disclosure decision. Using a sample of private firms, which are usually bank-financed, enables the exclusion of capital market incentives from the analysis. </p>\n\n<p>A postal survey of 5,000 manufacturing firms will ask managers about the level of competition they face. The results of the survey will then be related to firms' disclosure choice. Profitability and other accounting data will be drawn from the FAME (Forecasting, Analysis and Modeling Environment) database.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3119","grantId":"RES-000-22-3119","fundValue":"56202","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elisabeth  Dedman","coPersons":["Clive Steven Lennox"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
