{"id":"D7622AF7-135B-4DA6-81BE-0A15A7F661A2","title":"An ultrasound study of lingual coarticulation in children and adults","abstractText":"Coarticulation, one of the central issues in experimental phonetic research, refers to the articulatory overlap of neighbouring sounds, resulting in acoustic and perceptual modifications of these sounds. Studies of the development of coarticulatory patterns in children have produced conflicting results concerning adult-child differences. This research compares coarticulatory properties of speech in children and adults, using innovative articulatory measures derived from ultrasound imaging. The aims are to establish how children’s patterns of coarticulation differ from adults’, and to attempt to explain the observed coarticulatory patterns, as well as the nature and the degree of variability found in adults and children.\n<br />\n<br />Synchronised ultrasound and acoustic data will be recorded using the Queen Margaret University ultrasound system. Consonant-vowel syllables in real sentences will be produced by ten normally developing children aged 7 years, and ten adults, all speakers of Standard Scottish English. Child and adult productions will be compared according to an ultrasound-based measure of coarticulation, and any significant differences in amount of coarticulation and degree of within-speaker variability will be established. Qualitative examination of individual variation will help to establish the nature of any differences between children and adults in the organisational structure of speech in terms of segments, syllables and words.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F040598/1","grantId":"ES/F040598/1","fundValue":"77732","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalia  Zharkova","coPersons":["Nigel  Hewlett","William John  Hardcastle"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":" In the comparison of anticipatory lingual coarticulation across age groups, consonant-specific differences were reported in vowel-on-consonant coarticulation. Specifically, the postalveolar fricative was coarticulated more in the children than in the adults, while the alveolar fricative did not show evidence of coarticulation in the children. These findings suggest that developmental shifts in the degree of coarticulation of individual speech sounds may be affected by changes in articulatory constraints on the tongue with age.\n\nThe results also showed that adults and children differ in the degree of individual variability in coarticulatory patterns, children being more variable than adults. The strong within-speaker variability may be because the children are still in the process of tuning their speech production system to the adult-like degree of trade-off between speed of tongue movement, speech timing and amount of tongue travel. - The database collected during the project is available to academics and students upon request\n- The methodology of recording and analysing tongue movement data from children can be used in further studies\n- The results on consonant-specific coarticulation, as well as on age-related differences in variability, can be drawn upon in further studies of speech motor control development Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
