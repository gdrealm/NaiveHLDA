For more than two decades, users of high performance architectures, both uniprocessors and homogeneous parallel computers, have been able to rely on scientific software libraries, such as LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, to provide a high-level programming approach in which the library software encapsulates much of the programming effort that is required to achieve scalable and portable high performance. In this proposal, we plan to initiate research that aims to develop self-adapting run-time strategies that will enable future HPC Numerical Linear Algebra software to take advantage of emerging algorithmic and programming techniques for the emerging multi/many-core architectures. Initially we will focus on one-sided factorisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H009574/1","grantId":"EP/H009574/1","fundValue":"22135","fundStart":"2009-05-21","fundEnd":"2009-10-20","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"T Len Freeman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
