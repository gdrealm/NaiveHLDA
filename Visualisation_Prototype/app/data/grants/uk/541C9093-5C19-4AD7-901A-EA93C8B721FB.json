For the last 50 years or so our understanding of short-term memory has been dominated by the idea that the brain has bespoke, relatively isolated, processing modules - so-called processing primitives - dedicated to storing information over the short-term. </p>\n\n<p>This project challenges this notion and suggests instead that short-term memory is parasitic on brain systems developed mainly for processing sensory information and planning (but not always producing) gestures, of which speech production is one. In a series of eleven studies the project re-examines canonical features of short-term memory performance that have been taken as evidence for the 'primitive' view, and seeks to re-construe the findings from the 'parasitic' standpoint. One of the key goals of the work is to integrate phenomena traditionally associated with short-term memory with those associated with perception and action with a view to bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that short-term memory is understood.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D000815/1","grantId":"ES/D000815/1","fundValue":"251873","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Dylan  Jones","coPersons":["W  Macken","Robert Wyn  Hughes"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
