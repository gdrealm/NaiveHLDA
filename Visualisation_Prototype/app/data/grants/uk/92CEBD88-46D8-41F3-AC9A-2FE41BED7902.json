Learning in such places has been under-researched and under-theorised, hampering the field's ability to address policy and broader concerns around impact. Participants will prioritise issues that natural history museums most need to address in order to serve diverse audiences. These topics are likely to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>models for facilitating interaction between the public and museum educators</li>\n\n <li>scientists and curators</li>\n\n <li>learning from objects. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Numbers will be limited to 30-35 participants in order to encourage high quality, in-depth participation. An advisory group will also meet following each seminar to support translation of the discussions into the emergent research agenda, as well as to help develop subsequent seminars.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00125X/1","grantId":"ES/L00125X/1","fundValue":"29926","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin  Dillon","coPersons":["Jennifer Eileen DeWitt"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
