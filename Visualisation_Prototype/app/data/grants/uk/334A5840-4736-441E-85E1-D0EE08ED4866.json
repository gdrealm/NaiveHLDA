{"id":"334A5840-4736-441E-85E1-D0EE08ED4866","title":"NDR kinase signal transduction pathways in Trypanosoma brucei","abstractText":"The African trypanosome parasite causes Sleeping Sickness, a fatal disease which threatens the lives of millions of Africans. No vaccine exists and drugs available to treat the disease are not always effective and can cause serious side effects, even killing the patient. New drugs, which kill the parasite without damaging human cells are urgently needed. Targeting essential enzymes required for trypanosome cell division (and therefore multiplication) in the human host may be an effective strategy to develop new drugs. Trypanosome cells divide differently from human cells, and hence there are also differences in the signalling pathways that control cell division. These differences could be exploited to develop a drug that only inhibits an enzyme in a trypanosome pathway but not in a mammalian pathway. In their simplest form, signalling pathways are a cascade of molecular reactions where ?kinase? enzymes add a phosphate molecule to the next enzyme in the pathway, an event termed phosphorylation. Phosphorylation may activate an enzyme so that it can, in turn, modify another enzyme. Our knowledge of cell division signalling pathways in trypanosomes is limited, and many of the enzymes involved have not yet been identified. This project will begin to fill this gap. Starting with two kinase enzymes, PK50 and PK53, that we have shown are essential for trypanosome cell division, we will use innovative and cutting edge biochemical techniques to identify the enzymes that work just above and just below PK50 and PK53 in signalling cascades. We will test how PK50 and PK53 are affected by being phosphorylated by kinase enzymes above them in these pathways, and how, in turn, PK50 and PK53 phosphorylate enzymes or other proteins below them. This will, for the first time, provide detailed information about the signalling pathways regulating cell division in trypanosomes and provide an insight into how enzyme activities are controlled. We have started to develop chemical inhibitors of PK50 and PK53, and new information about how these enzymes work may help to generate improved inhibitors in the future that could be developed into drugs to treat Sleeping Sickness. The techniques we develop during this project could also be exploited to identify additional pathway enzymes. It is likely that other enzymes in these pathways will also be essential for cell division. We will test whether this is the case for the new enzymes we discover and in this way hope to identify several new putative drug targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900239","grantId":"G0900239","fundValue":"464900","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tansy Charlotte Hammarton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
