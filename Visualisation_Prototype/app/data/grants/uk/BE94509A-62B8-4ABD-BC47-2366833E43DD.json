{"id":"BE94509A-62B8-4ABD-BC47-2366833E43DD","title":"Lasing of Erbium in Crystalline Silicon Photonic Nanostructures - LECSIN","abstractText":"This project focuses on the control of radiative emission of Erbium ions in photonic crystal nanostructures made of crystalline Silicon, with the goal of achieving laser emission around 1.54 micron wavelength. To this purpose, photonic crystal waveguides and nanocavities will be fabricated in Si membranes containing Erbium ions. Photonic structures will be designed such that the high-Q cavity modes be resonant with the narrow lines corresponding to Er emission, in order to tailor the radiative dynamics and to enhance optical gain. Micro-photoluminescence and pump-probe experiments under suitable pumping conditions will probe the radiative emission of Er, to achieve net gain and lasing threshold. Theoretical studies of Er emission coupled to nanocavity modes will allow exploring cavity quantum electrodynamics effects. The proposal builds on a new partnership involving a number of Young Researchers by leading groups with complementary expertise in Silicon photonics, nanotechnology, nano-photonics, and quantum optics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00680X/1","grantId":"EP/H00680X/1","fundValue":"321399","fundStart":"2010-02-25","fundEnd":"2013-02-24","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Cheap light sources with narrow spectral linewidth are important component for optical biosensors, optical communications and many other applications.

Regarding materials processing, the emission level was increased by taking three routes. In all the three cases\nthe emission was further enhanced by coupling it with a photonic crystal (PhC) cavity via Purcell effect. \n1. The first approach involved the incorporation of optically active defects into the silicon lattice by hydrogen plasma treatment or ion implantation. This process results in broad\nluminescence bands centered at 1300 and 1500 nm. By coupling these emission bands with the photonic crystal cavity, we demonstrated a narrowband silicon light\nemitting diode at room temperature. This silicon nano light emitting diode has a tunable emission line in the 1300-1600 nm range.\n2. In the second approach, a narrow emission line at 1.28&micro;m was created by carbon ion implantation, termed &quot;G-line&quot; emission. The possibility of enhancing the emission intensity of this line via the Purcell effect was investigated \n3. The third approach involved the deposition of a thin film of an erbium disilicate on top of a PhC cavity. The erbium emission is enhanced by the PhC cavity. Using this method, an\noptically pumped light source emitting at 1.54 &micro;m and operating at room temperature was demonstrated. A practical application of silicon light source developed in this project in gas sensing is also demonstrated. As a first step, we demonstrated refractive index sensing, which is a\nsimple application for our source and demonstrates its capabilities, especially relating to the lack of cheap fiber coupling schemes. We also investigate several options for extending\napplications into on-chip biological sensing Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
