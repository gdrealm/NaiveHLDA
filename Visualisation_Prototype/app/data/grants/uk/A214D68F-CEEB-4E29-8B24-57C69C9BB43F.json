{"id":"A214D68F-CEEB-4E29-8B24-57C69C9BB43F","title":"Emerging Sustainability","abstractText":"Sustainability is a key challenge for modern social systems. This project will explore sustainability as an emergent property of the interactions between and among people, societies, technologies and the built and natural environments. We will investigate the conditions and factors which allow or hinder the emergence of sustainability in domains including health, organic agriculture and urban water systems. More significantly, the project will experiment with open source knowledge space as a method of facilitating the emergence of new knowledge about complex systems. We hypothesise that open source interaction between theoretical and methodological developments in complexity theory and expert and practitioner knowledge in specific domains will lead to rapid and unanticipated advances in both fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E062075/1","grantId":"EP/E062075/1","fundValue":"400509","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2011-03-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This project aimed to identify necessary conditions for sustainability to emerge across different sectors. It used an open-source online methodology, which proved difficult to develop and hindered the level of engagement that was originally intended. The research showed that complexity theory provides a useful framework for analysing sustainability across different disciplines and sectors, but that interdisciplinary work and collaboration with industrial and community based partners requires long-term sustained engagement using simple tools and methods.

Developing an on-line collaborative tool for sustainability research was technically challenging at the time of the research project. New software and platforms have emerged since the project that could be utilised for enhancing academic and practitioner engagement in the future.
