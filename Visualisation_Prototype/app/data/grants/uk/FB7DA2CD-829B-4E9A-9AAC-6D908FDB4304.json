{"id":"FB7DA2CD-829B-4E9A-9AAC-6D908FDB4304","title":"Long term labour market effects of male military conscription and female civilian conscription","abstractText":"Professor Bob Hart (Economics Department, University of Stirling) will evaluate quantitatively the long term effects of conscription on real wage and related labour market outcomes of men and women. Three episodes of conscription are to be considered: (a) males called up to the armed services during World War II; (b) females called up to serve in either auxiliary services or, more importantly, in essential industries during the World War II;(c) men called up to post-war National Service between 1949 and 1960. The study will provide a major new application of the so-called regression discontinuity method. It will test whether the returns to women conscripts of acquiring general industrial skills differed from those of men who obtained more military-specific training and experience.&nbsp; The analysis will also test the extent to which differences in schooling attainment between conscription and post-conscription cohorts played a role in determining long term labour market returns. The data samples consist of 12 years of birth cohorts affected by conscription and 12 years of post-conscription cohorts. The principal data source is the New Earnings Survey Panel, while the General Household Survey, Labour Force Survey and Family Expenditure Survey will also be used.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2899","grantId":"RES-000-22-2899","fundValue":"39633","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Hart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
