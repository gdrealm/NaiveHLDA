They represent a key pathway for reducing petroleum dependence and promoting transportation sustainability (provided the electricity generation mix has been successfully decarbonised). If EVs displace most petroleum vehicles then they will represent a very significant new and additional demand to be serviced via electricity networks. EVs also present opportunities for power network operation; their charging also represents a very large discretionary load that can be managed to provide Smart Grid services and assist the integration of clean energy.\n\nEV integration can also contribute industrial economic growth and high quality employment. A recent study for the UK Department for Business Innovation and Skills identified a potential for 130GW annual installation of power electronics for EV in the UK and perhaps 5,000 GW worldwide. This level of installation presents huge opportunities both for energy savings (even relatively modest efficiency gains in each installation will aggregate to large energy savings) and for economic benefits from the design and manufacture of high valued-added power electronic system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L00089X/1","grantId":"EP/L00089X/1","fundValue":"940888","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Jon Finney","coPersons":["Lie  Xu","Timothy  Green","Paul David Mitcheson"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
