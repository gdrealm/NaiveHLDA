{"id":"B84BB05A-EE9E-452D-93E0-982FC837F877","title":"The neural basis of temporal processing in predictive learning","abstractText":"Animals are able to anticipate the occurrence of important events in the environment, such as the availability of food or imminent danger, by learning that particular cues signals those events. Predictive learning is achieved most readily when events occur together in close temporal proximity. Theories of learning state that animals learn temporal contingencies between events by processing of the temporal information provided by those events. However, there are a number of ways in which temporal information can be used in predictive learning. For example, in addition to learning that events happened close together in time (coincidence detection), temporal information can be used to calculate the relative rate at which a particular event occurs, or can be used to form a temporal map of events such that one cue can provide information of when a particular event will occur. \n\nCurrently, little is know about the neural basis of temporal processing that allows predictive learning to occur. However, my recent research suggests that the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA receptor for the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate plays a role in temporal processing. GluA1 is known to be important for the some functions of the hippocampus, a brain region that is vital for learning and memory. However, in contrast to the role of GluA1, the hippocampus, and in particular, hippocampal NMDA receptors appear to play a rather different role in temporal processing. The aim of the grant is to identify the neural basis of temporal processing in predictive learning. This will be achieved by testing different accounts of the function of GluA1 and hippocampal NMDA receptors in predictive learning. Genetically modified mice that lack the particular receptor subunits will be tested in learning tasks that assess different components of temporal processing.\n\nThe work will provide a crucial advance in understanding of how learning is achieved in the brain. Importantly, by understanding the neural basis of learning this will then help to identify the causes of impaired learning and cognition that occur in aging and in disease states such as psychosis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M009440/1","grantId":"BB/M009440/1","fundValue":"395066","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Sanderson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
