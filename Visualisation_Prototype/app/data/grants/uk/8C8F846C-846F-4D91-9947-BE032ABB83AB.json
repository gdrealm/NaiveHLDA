The purpose of the Ganga project is to provide physicists with an easy-to-use interface that gives them access to the distributed resources in a transparent way. Ganga performs this task by providing a user interface that hides the complexity and heterogeneous structure of the underlying systems. At the same time Ganga serves as a light-weight book-keeping tool for large scale analysis, thus relieving users from repetitive and tedious tasks. Ganga forms a cornerstone in the LHCb computing model and as such requires continued effort to ensure that the project will satisfy the requirements as they evolve in the data taking period. Ganga is used by an increasing number of scientists to support their computing tasks on the Grid. Examples include the data analysis in ATLAS and LHCb, searches for drugs to combat avian flu, the commercial Camtology projects for image classification and the Monte Carlo production system for the MINOS experiment in HEP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F006446/1","grantId":"ST/F006446/1","fundValue":"114655","fundStart":"2008-10-06","fundEnd":"2011-10-05","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ulrik  Egede","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
