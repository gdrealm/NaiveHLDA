{"id":"5B1663BA-D356-4C5C-8C8E-A82EF99A0992","title":"Yogavacara Traditions in Theravada Buddhist Societies","abstractText":"Theravada Buddhism is regarded as a conservative form of Buddhism that preserves 'early' Buddhism, in keeping with early Buddhist texts, while other forms of Buddhism (broadly Mahayana and Vajrayana or tantric Buddhism) developed new expressions. However, it is clear from manuscript and practitioner lineages that Theravada is not monolithic. Yogavacara designates a system of Theravada practice open to lay and ordained practitioners that involves incorporating qualities of the Buddha into the body and applying the power thus gained to soteriological and practical ends, e.g. healing and protection in warfare.\\nThere are striking similarities between yogavacara and Vajrayana in terms of somatic practice and ritual enactment, although there is no evidence of non-Theravada terminology or pantheon. It is our view that these similarities relate to the shared influence of developments in understanding of such sciences as embryology, alchemy, and group theory mathematics throughout the Indian subcontinent and broader region. Yogavacara can be seen not as a corruption of Theravada, but as its development in keeping with the science and world view of pre-modern Asia.\\nPartly under the influence of European colonialism, reforms swept Theravada countries during the 18-20th centuries. These based themselves on early canonical materials predating yogavacara developments. They also sought to present Buddhism as consistent with Western science, but emphasised the superiority of Eastern mind-culture in the face of the apparent superiority of Western somatic culture. The result obscured forms of Theravada such as yogavacara which did not fit with this model of Buddhism. We have clear evidence of this struggle between reform and traditional Theravada in French Cambodia. \\nAs a result of such reforms and exacerbated by the destruction of Buddhist lineages and material culture-e.g. under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia-yogavacara today is marginal, surviving in lineages in Cambodian boran Theravada (now in a process of revival), in Thailand in dhammakaya practices (under threat) and in a small number of Bangkok temples, and possibly in some Bangladeshi and Burmese 'non-orthodox' lineages (subject to secrecy). Textual remains, especially meditation manuals, are also found in some Sri Lankan and Southeast Asian collections, but have been little documented, identified or edited because their content has not been recognised or understood by classically-trained (in canonical Theravada) scholars.\\nThere is nevertheless an increasing scholarly recognition of the importance of yogavacara. It needs to be established whether yogavacara was the dominant form of Theravada in the pre-reform period. Put another way, is the perceived similarity of modern Theravada to early Buddhism the result of reform rather than continuous tradition and did pre-modern Theravada look more like the esoteric forms of East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism?\\nThe researchers on this project, Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell, working on Sri Lanka and Thailand respectively, have noted a range of evidence for court and high-ranking monastic sponsorship of yogavacara in the 18-19th centuries. In this project they will, through archival research, seek to clarify the extent to which yogavacara was the dominant form of Theravada and what led to its demise and marginalisation. They will also bring together the primary and secondary materials relevant to yogavacara studies on a single website, through which the planned database will be accessible. Interested academics and other stakeholders will be invited to join a discussion network based around a LISTSERV-style email list. In addition to writing scholarly articles on the transition of yogavacara's standing during the reform and colonial periods, they will incorporate the findings in teaching materials, including the forthcoming Wiley-Blackwell Theravada Buddhism, to ensure the findings feed directly into broader representations of Theravada.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H009132/1","grantId":"AH/H009132/1","fundValue":"61143","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Henrietta Kate Crosby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"School of Oriental & African Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
