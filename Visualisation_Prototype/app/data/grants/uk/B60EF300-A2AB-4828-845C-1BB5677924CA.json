{"id":"B60EF300-A2AB-4828-845C-1BB5677924CA","title":"From Dynamic Combinatorial to Systems Chemistry","abstractText":"The field of dynamic combinatorial chemistry has been growing exponentially over the last decade, with the UK playing a leading role. We have been at the forefront of this rapid expansion, thanks to uninterrupted support from the EPSRC over the last 10 years. As a result, dynamic combinatorial chemistry is now a powerful and established method for the development of synthetic receptors. But this is only part of the promise that dynamic combinatorial chemistry holds: the technique has largely untapped potential for exploring self-assembly by making use of molecular recognition between library members and for exploring the folding of synthetic molecules by making use of molecular recognition within library members. Both of these dimensions of molecular recognition should respond to externally added templates, which represents a third dimension of recognition. The first part of this grant is about developing dynamic combinatorial chemistry to study the interplay between these three dimensions. The second part explores a conceptually new area of systems chemistry, focussing on the new properties that may emerge from the interplay between molecules in a complex mixture. Through this work we aim to establish systems chemistry as a new discipline.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F035888/1","grantId":"EP/F035888/1","fundValue":"1486640","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  Sanders","coPersons":["Sijbren  Otto"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" How to use an evolutionary approach to study molecular recognition Further funding was provided by EP/J01110X/1 Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
