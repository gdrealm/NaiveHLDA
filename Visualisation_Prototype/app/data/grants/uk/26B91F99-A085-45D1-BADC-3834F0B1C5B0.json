{"id":"26B91F99-A085-45D1-BADC-3834F0B1C5B0","title":"Cold War Anglia: the culture and landscape of the Cold War in East Anglia","abstractText":"The Cold War is often presented by writers, historians and film/documentary makers as a secret conflict, when specialists on both sides waged a struggle largely invisible to the general population - a war of nuclear strategy, secret agents, 'high-tech' bombers, and clever civil servants. Much historical research has reflected this view, concentrating on high level policy-making and military strategy, or national movements for and against the conflict. Little attention has been focussed on the Cold War in Britain at a community level: on its effect on the region, the village, the town. Yet, the front line of this 'secret' war lay in the heart of Britain's communities, both rural - where nuclear weapons sites, listening stations, airbases and laboratories sprang up next to small villages and at the end of leafy lanes - and urban, where the rapidly expanding armaments industry drove the development of new towns. In consequence, villages and small towns across the nation faced the prospect of devastation at the hands of Soviet nuclear and conventional weapons that was unprecedented, even between 1939-45. \n\nFurthermore, these hitherto largely secluded communities had to deal with the arrival of the organs of the modern state in close proximity to them, as government reached into areas of the country that had, in many ways, been overlooked previously. The construction of state facilities across the country created a network of outposts of the central state that over-rode local government and introduced a whole new type of government in the regions. \n\nCold War Anglia intends to examine the Cold War from a regional and community perspective by encouraging local communities to research and record the histories of the Cold War in the region. East Anglia is unusual in the UK because it contains the full range of Cold War sites, including nuclear weapons stores, nuclear missile launch sites, military airbases, radar stations, intelligence stations, ground-to-air missile sites, nuclear and conventional research laboratories, as well as new towns built around high-technology defence industries. This makes it especially suitable for this work, but many of these locations are under threat and their preservation is a pressing issue. \n\nHistorians of landscape and the Cold War from the University of East Anglia, along with our partner organisations, would support research into the history of these locations undertaken by community research groups with training sessions in local history research techniques, landscape research and oral history. This training will assist these local partners to undertake valuable historical research on this hitherto neglected topic. They will be able to record the stories of those who worked inside Cold War bases and also those who lived outside them, in the farms, villages and towns nearby. In addition, this training will help community partners to undertake fieldwork where they can record the current condition of this Cold War landscape, which is under considerable pressure and lacks significant historic protection. \n\nOur community partners would upload the results of their research directly onto the project website, which would be designed and maintained by the University in consultation with these partners. This website will also provide a platform for computer-generated reconstructions of these locations, which will be part of a wider programme of dissemination of the project team's findings. \n\nThe project's findings will be made available on the website and advertised by the University and our institutional partners. We plan to create visitor centres at some locations, along with a programme of walks, which will be 'self-guided' by means of documents downloaded from the website or by interactive applications available via the internet. Additionally, the research team will produce at least two articles, and a book that will present the project's outcome in a more traditional manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007734/1","grantId":"AH/K007734/1","fundValue":"41639","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The impact has been most swift in the partnership with our local partner, the private owner of the former nuclear weapons storage facility at Barnham near Thetford. The project has been instrumental in helping him to develop and open a visitor centre on the site. This space is designed to help interested people understand how nuclear weapons were seen in the local community and to integrate that local view into a global perspective. We have helped him to plan, design and open the centre, especially helping with the design and construction of interpretive displays in the centre using data about the Cold War gained from the project. The most important of these is the video element. We have created a series of films based on research carried out in the project that will be shown in the visitor centre that address the military role of the nuclear weapons held at the base, the local impact, the post-nuclear story of the base and the heritage and environmental story at the location. The films will be used in activities with groups of all ages. \nThe project also created a computer-generated model of the site that helps visitors understand the location better. The model shows the site as it was originally, and is presented as a 'fly-though' view from all angles. This will help in explaining the operation and design of the site.\nThe project also worked with the National Trust at the former nuclear weapons testing establishment at Orford Ness to identify and to begin work on computer reconstructions of buildings that existed at the site until the end of the Cold War that have now disappeared. This has helped the National Trust to begin work on a re-evaluation of the heritage significance of the site, which is already a Site of Special Scientific Interest environmentally, that will assist them in improving their preservation policies at the site and their communication strategies.\nThe project also conducted interviews with members of the public who had lived in the region during the Cold war to create an oral history resource, which has been deposited with the Norfolk Record Office.\nThe project also found a number of government civil defence films that had not been previously digitised and in conjunction with the East Anglian Film Archive has digitised them.\nIn the longer term the project will provide data that will be used in a forthcoming book and article on British nuclear culture.

What was clear from our research was that, whatever was thought in central government, those involved at a local level we convinced of the worth of their activity. \n\no Important new research resources were identified by the project, the most significant of these being some civil defence films that have been digitised.\n\no The project has also led to new research question regarding the way in which nuclear weapons were thought of by those involved in planning local responses to nuclear war. \n\no We have also gained a greater understanding of the ways in which the current population think about former military sites from a heritage point of view. For example, the population around the former airfield at RAF Coltishall consider that the runway is an integral part of the site and are strongly opposed to any redevelopment that removes what they perceive to be an iconic aspect of its heritage.\n\no We have also gained greater understanding of how the visitor experience to such sites might be improved and the sort of information that the Cold War heritage audience sees as relevant. Working with our partners in Thetford and Orford has given us experience that has altered our approach to one that is far more focussed on genuine partnership and the exchange of information and ideas than it had been previously. \n\no We have begun to develop a greater understanding of the impact on the local region of the Cold War. We have gained greater understanding of the process by which the new Cold War military bases in the region gradually became an integral part of the area's life and the effect this military presence had on all the landscape and culture of East Anglia. \n\no We have also now created a set of visual, oral and written resources that we hope to develop to create a web-based learning location about the region in the Cold War for use by schools, colleges and other interested parties. This will require further funding, however. The findings can be used by interested parties who are looking into Cold War heritage and preservation policies and by educators who are looking for new resources to consider this important aspect of twentieth century British history.
