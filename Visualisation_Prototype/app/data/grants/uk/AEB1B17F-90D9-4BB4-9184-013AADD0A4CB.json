{"id":"AEB1B17F-90D9-4BB4-9184-013AADD0A4CB","title":"Innovative Technologies for Stratified and Experimental Medicine","abstractText":"We aim to build scientific and computing infrastructure in the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of Cambridge that will allow us i) to develop new technologies for measuring and imaging molecules in humans, and ii) to apply these technologies directly and immediately to major research programmes for understanding and treatment of cancer, metabolic disorders, and many other therapeutic areas.\n\nOur strategic vision is that many diseases, that are traditionally diagnosed and treated as if all patients with the same diagnosis were largely the same, will become increasingly stratified. We expect that advances in biomedical science will demonstrate that there are in fact many different genetic and molecular pathways to the same clinical diagnosis. This has potentially important implications for more precise targeting of treatment: more refined diagnostic stratification of patients could identify more exactly which patients were most likely to respond to specific treatments. To realise this vision, we propose to create three new high-tech facilities for clinical research in Cambridge; a Stratified Medicine Core Laboratory (SMCL), a Molecular Imaging Centre (MIC), and a High Performance Hub for Informatics (HPHI).\n\nThe SMCL will allow us to measure a large number of peptides and other molecules in blood or other tissue samples with enhanced accuracy and sensitivity. The SMCL will also provide new facilities for next generation sequencing of DNA so that genetic variants driving disease can be identified in individual patients with sufficient precision and reliability to optimize diagnostic stratification and to inform clinical management immediately.\n\nThe MIC will allow us to measure molecules by imaging of patients, rather than by lab analysis of tissue samples. The MIC will comprise a new whole body scanner that can simultaneously collect MRI and PET data, as well as new facilities for manufacturing and administering labeled molecules as imaging probes to patients. The new radiochemistry facilities in the MIC will allow us to produce a much larger range and volume of radioactively labeled molecules that can be detected by PET imaging. The MIC will also support the technological development of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This is a radically innovative method of molecular imaging which could potentially allow us to detect labeled molecules by MRI and without exposing patients to the risks of radioactivity. We will also upgrade one of our existing MRI scanners and locate it closer to the main focus of experimental medicine research in Cambridge.\n\nThe HPHI will provide the computational resources required to store and analyse the very large volumes of data produced by the SMCL and the MIC. It is also crucially important that the results of clinically actionable molecular analysis and imaging can be linked to individual patient records. This is key to &quot;pulling through&quot; the benefits of new technology to deliver stratified medicine in clinical practice. It is also important that the &quot;big data&quot; generated by the SMCL and MIC can be shared with the wider scientific community including our research partners elsewhere in the UK. We therefore propose to invest in new facilities for data storage, computational analysis, secure and ethically approved linkage of research data to clinical records, and data sharing. This computational hub will be managed as part of the University of Cambridge's new high performance computing facility.\n\nThese infrastructural investments have been planned to create an integrated platform for molecular and genetic stratification of human disease. They will enhance the impact of internationally leading research groups already established in Cambridge and they are coordinated with major infrastructural programmes already funded by the University or other agencies. They will underpin a step change in our capacity to harness the potential of new technologies to deliver our strategic vision.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M009041/1","grantId":"MR/M009041/1","fundValue":"14621400","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick Henry Maxwell","coPersons":["Fiona Jane Gilbert","Kevin  Brindle","Stephen  O'Rahilly","Carlos  Caldas","Edward  Bullmore","James Derek Brenton"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
