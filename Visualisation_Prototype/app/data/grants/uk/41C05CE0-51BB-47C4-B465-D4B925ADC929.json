{"id":"41C05CE0-51BB-47C4-B465-D4B925ADC929","title":"Renewal and Development of the Leeds EPSRC Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Equipment Facility (LENNF)","abstractText":"This proposal aims to provide significant external access (a total of 140 days over 3 years) to state-of-the-art instrumentation as well as appropriate expertise for nanotechnology researchers specialising in both inorganic nanosystems and also in hybrid inorganic/ organic systems / i.e. bionanotechnology. Accessible facilities will include a synergistic (&quot;one stop shop&quot;) combination of inter-related basic techniques for both characterisation and structural and device fabrication: environmental and low voltage scanning electron microscopy (ESEM and LVSEM); atomic force microscopy (AFM); transmission electron microscopy (TEM); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); focused ion beam (FIB) and electron beam lithography (EBL) together with associated cleanroom access. We believe that this integrated analytical approach will ultimately provide a much more productive service both in terms of overall scientific understanding and also productivity, as opposed to the piecemeal provision of many separate specialist activities. We also believe that, as a grouping, we possess the combined experience and facilities to deliver this fully integrated service successfully and efficiently. In addition we would also offer access to some unique specialist facilities such as: a variable temperature, UHV STM: a combined SEM and 4 STM Nanoprober for four point electrical measurements: a combined TEM-STM holder (Nanofactory): a Nanoman virtual reality AFM/ Nanomanipulator: and Magnetic tweezers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K023853/1","grantId":"EP/K023853/1","fundValue":"487543","fundStart":"2013-04-08","fundEnd":"2016-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The original LENNF grant has a good track record of promoting collaborative research: the initial 3.5 years of LENNF led to: a total of 156 (68 unique) users, from &gt; 25 institutions and an allocation of over 400 instrument days; support for over 110 EPSRC grants of facility users; a total of 48 journal publications with users (including the Nature, ACS, J.
