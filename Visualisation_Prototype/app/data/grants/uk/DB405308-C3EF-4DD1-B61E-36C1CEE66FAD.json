{"id":"DB405308-C3EF-4DD1-B61E-36C1CEE66FAD","title":"Investigation of therapeutic causal pathways in anti-hypertensive trials using longitudinal data.","abstractText":"The most important test for a new drug - whether it reduces the risk of future disease or early death - is addressed in clinical trials. The question of how it works will have been addressed at earlier stages in its development but often much can still be learnt from data collected on patients, especially data collected from patients monitored in trials. Data that has already been collected does not involve any extra cost and thus offers an economic way of addressing such questions. \n\nUnder recent guidelines (NICE) to doctors for treating hypertension, beta blockers are no longer a preferred option. One hypothesis about the causal pathways of such medications is that they ?work? by lowering blood pressure which in turn reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, but there might be other effects ? positive or negative - say on cholesterol or blood glucose, operating simultaneously. Quantification of the strength of different pathways is important because it can strengthen previous hypotheses about mechanisms, suggest new ones, feed into the development of new better drugs and might even reveal unintended biological effects. \n\nCorrect statistical analysis of data from trials is important to prevent biased answers about effects. While scientists agree on the correct method to address: ?Does the treatment work?, methods for quantifying the strength of different causal mechanisms are more complex and less developed. We wish to strengthen this methodology by combining the best ideas from two fields of statistical research; we would then apply the chosen methods to two large trials of beta blocker therapy for hypertension. The study would provide answers to questions about direct and indirect effects for this group of drugs. It would also provide new methods for analysis and these could be used by other studies asking similar questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601643","grantId":"G0601643","fundValue":"333252","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Roseanne  McNamee","coPersons":["(John) Kennedy  Cruickshank","Jianxin  Pan","Graham  Dunn"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
