These changes may have a large impact on the health of older people. The effects of retirement are likely to be different depending on when and how people retire, as well as how they are able to adapt to life in retirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this study is to investigate how determinants in later working life, during the retirement transition, and in early retirement influence for how long older individuals are able to live actively and healthily. Using longitudinal data from five European countries representing three different welfare regimes, the study will address the following research questions:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To what extent are factors in the psychosocial and physical work environment determinants of health beyond retirement?</li>\n\n <li>How do continued labour market participation and different routes of labour market exit impact on the health and health behaviours of older people?</li>\n\n <li>What impact do modifiable health behaviours among older people have on healthy life expectancy?</li>\n\n <li>How do trajectories of health and health functioning interact with environmental factors over time in determining healthy life expectancy?</li>\n\n <li>Do these relationships differ between the participating European countries?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K01336X/1","grantId":"ES/K01336X/1","fundValue":"71984","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Anne Head","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
