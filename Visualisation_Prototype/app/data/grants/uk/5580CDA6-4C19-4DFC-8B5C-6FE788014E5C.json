This is a batch process of two or more stages.\nMost research into Li-ion batteries focuses on the electrodes especially to increase capacity; these are then incorporated in the conventional battery fabrication method. Little research is undertaken into the electrolyte and separators and even less on developing more cost effective fabrication methods and alternatives processing routes.\n\nAdvantages of the Leeds technology\n\nThe Leeds polymer gel electrolyte and extrusion lamination technology differs from the conventional in that the electrolyte acts as both separator and ion conductor. The highly conducting polymer gel electrolytes possess excellent mechanical toughness and electrochemical stability. The laminated gel electrolyte binds the cell together from within, can be produced on continuous single process, requires no rigid container, and is flexible and formable. Instead of separate components of electrolyte, binder and separator these electrolytes can act as all three.\nThe development of a thermoreversible gel electrolyte enables melt extrusion of the gel and continuous production of battery cells at high extrusion rates of at least 10m/minute. The elimination of the expensive porous film separator and the high speed extrusion lamination process significantly reduce the cost of battery production.\n\nThe programme of research\n\nThe Leeds process has been developed and demonstrated for a number of years. It is now poised to take the technology forward to develop the process for the reliable production of multilayer laminates which can be immediately incorporated into batteries.\nThe development of the process will require a study of the formation of gels at the fast extrusion rates that are required for commercially viable processing.\n\nFuture commercial developments\n\nThis programme will demonstrate that the technology can produce mainstream cost effective Li-ion batteries with enhanced safety and high specific capacity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J013811/1","grantId":"EP/J013811/1","fundValue":"124021","fundStart":"2012-01-05","fundEnd":"2013-07-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A novel high-throughput extrusion-lamination process for lithium-ion battery manufacture has been developed.
