The overall project aims are to demonstrate the controlled emission of entangled photons from\nan LED structure emitting at a fibre-compatible wavelengths. Devices operating at this wavelength will be required to\nachieve commercially significant Quantum Communications technologies. There is a significant epitaxy challenge in\ndeveloping this technology by Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) at these wavelengths and there have been\nno demonstrations of entangled LEDs to date.\nThe Sheffield team will develop Indium Arsenide on Indium Phosphide quantum dots by MOVPE , complementing and\ncontrasting with the development by the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) method in the Cavendish laboratory. To\ndemonstrate single photon emitters at these wavelengths is challenging and there is a need to investigate the properties of\nthe quantum dots by both techniques to understand how the quantum dots form and what controls the fundamental\nproperties that will generate photon entanglement; including aspects such as the exciton spin splitting value. The work will\nbuild significantly on the prior work carried out at shorter wavelengths in Sheffield, Toshiba and Cavendish laboratories\nusing a different material system. In particular at Sheffield the result of quantum dot structures developed under an EPSRC\nProgramme Grant will benefit the project strongly since many of the physical properties may be similar. The demonstration\nof high quality devices at this wavelength will be a significant milestone in matching Quantum Communications to the\ncurrent non-quantum fibre-communications infrastructure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508275/1","grantId":"EP/M508275/1","fundValue":"100479","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Heffernan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
