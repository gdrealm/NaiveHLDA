They adapt by altering patterns of gene expression in response to environmental and metabolic cues. The bacterium Escherichia coli is one of the best-characterised life forms. It is a model organism and much of our understanding of the fundamental processes of life has been revealed by intensive study of this bacterium. Yet there is still much to learn. For example, we do not know the function of approximately one third of all E. coli genes. This project aims to better understand the central metabolic processes of bacteria by using molecular biology and biochemistry to investigate the function of a protein (YfiD) that is important in adaptation to a number of different environmental conditions. Specifically, we would like to determine the function and extent of the influence of YfiD on bacterial central metabolism, how this contributes to the ability of the bacterium to adapt to different environments, and the molecular mechanism by which YfiD exerts its influence. A deeper understanding of how bacteria adapt and survive in a range of environmental conditions, some of which relate directly to pathogenesis, will help to underpin the search for new therapeutics. In addition, the project findings will be of interest to biotechnologists using E. coli as a factory for the production of recombinant proteins and chemicals by improving the efficiency of such processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E019943/1","grantId":"BB/E019943/1","fundValue":"344325","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2011-04-16","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Improved quality of life by increased understanding of a fundamental biological process.

This success is at least in part due to the ability of bacteria to adapt to changes in environment, and this adaptation is rooted in their capacity to alter patterns of gene expression in response to external and internal cues. A key environmental parameter that is monitored by many bacteria is oxygen concentration. We are particularly interested in the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) because it is able to thrive both in the presence and absence of oxygen. When present in the gut of a host E. coli experiences an environment lacking oxygen but when it is evacuated from the host it is exposed to oxygen. Exposure to oxygen inhibits the action of a key enzyme (PFL) that acts on a key metabolite (pyruvate) to allow further metabolism in the absence of oxygen. Our project aimed to better understand the central metabolic processes of E. coli during adaptation to changes in oxygen availability and in particular how the metabolism of pyruvate was affected by PFL damage. Our results showed that exposure of E. coli to oxygen inhibited PFL and because there was a delay in producing alternative enzymes, the amount of pyruvate in the cell increased, causing pyruvate excretion and the activation of genes encoding new metabolic activities by a regulator known as PdhR. We have also made progress in understanding the role of a small protein (YfiD) that repairs damaged PFL by showing that YfiD is produced only under conditions when PFL is damaged The work undertaken provided a better understanding of the metabolic adaptations that occur in cultures of the model organism E. coli in response to changes in oxygen availability and maybe of interest to those using E. coli as a cell factory in IB processes as well as those interested in bacterial physiology.
