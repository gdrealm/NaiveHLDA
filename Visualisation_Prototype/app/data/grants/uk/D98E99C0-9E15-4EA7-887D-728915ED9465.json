Examples for these 'novel' processes are the oxidation of reduced sulphur species or ammonium coupled to manganese reduction, processes driven by the isolates investigated in this study. The manganese-dependent oxidation of ammonium produces nitrogen gas and may be responsible for 90% of the nitrogen loss in marine sediments. Investigating this process is, therefore, not only important for the understanding of the biogeochemical cycles. As nitrogen is removed from the system and not available for primary production, this type of anaerobic ammonium oxidation may play an important role in avoiding eutrophication, particularly in coastal areas. Similarly, manganese-dependent oxidation of sulphur compounds (elemental sulphur, thiosulphate) is a so far unknown process. However, it connects the element cycles of sulphur and oxygen in marine sediments and helps solving a major biogeochemical problem: the transfer of electrons from sulphide to oxygen spatially separated in different sediment layers. As these compounds are present also in subsurface sedments and aquifers they might also provide a basis for life for the 'Deep Biosphere'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F00477X/1","grantId":"NE/F00477X/1","fundValue":"240953","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Some findings have been used for publications in scientific journals.

This may explain the apparent loss of ammonium in some deeper sediments.\nThere are significant differences in the nitrogen cycle at different temperatures. \nSome methanogens isolated during this project can utilize directly methylated amines. The number of known substrates for this group of microorganisms has been almost dounbled. We have discovered new metabolic pathways linking the carbon and nitrogen cycles. This will impact textbook knowledge. \nWe have been asked by colleagues for cell material for genomic studies.\nSome of the organisms studied in this project also degrade compounds used for carbon capture and sequestration and will be of interest for bioremediation studies.
