The aim is to further develop both empirical research and conceptual refinement, integrating into an interdisciplinary research field whose epistemological validity is supported by a solid anchoring in well-established research traditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E511112/1","grantId":"AH/E511112/1","fundValue":"13614","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2010-02-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Frith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
