It is vital we understand the causes of AD quickly to allow the development of preventative and therapeutic interventions. We have good evidence that genes play significant roles in AD development and that there are several remaining to be found. This research study will use new technological advances to test the influence of every human gene on the risk of developing AD. The success of this approach depends on using very large samples of AD cases and controls. This study is the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AD world-wide and is anticipated to identify 20 new risk genes and disease pathways AD risk genes pinpoint primary biological processes which trigger disease development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902227","grantId":"G0902227","fundValue":"1138360","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Williams","coPersons":["George  Kirov","Peter  Holmans","Valentina  Escott-Price","Michael  O Donovan","Michael John Owen"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
