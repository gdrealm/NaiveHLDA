{"id":"FCE13E34-27EB-4BD5-843A-42C6227811A0","title":"Optical Allusions: Photography, ethnicity and ideologies of ethnic conflict in Burma","abstractText":"<p>Burma has one of the most complex ethnographic landscapes in South East Asia and since independence in 1948 has suffered continued conflict. Many ethnic groups feel they have been inadequately represented in the main political developments at the centre, whilst many central political and military organisations feel that militant ethnic groups have fractured attempts to build a modern Burmese state. One dimension of these conflicts is the way that people imagine the ethnic 'other', and in this respect the historical production of images has contributed significantly to the production of ideologies of ethnicity, conflict and nationhood. This project will try to understand how photographic images in particular have played a role in these ideologies and conflicts. It will explore the introduction of photographic image-making in different parts of the country and how 'ethnic' images have been used and interpreted through Burmese and other indigenous language media to support, challenge and instrumentalise particular discourses on identity and the nation at Burma's centre, as well as in a range of non-Burman communities. Initially a data collection exercise, the hope is that substantive foundations can be laid for the development of further work on these issues in the future and in comparative contexts.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2668","grantId":"RES-000-22-2668","fundValue":"32627","fundStart":"2008-04-03","fundEnd":"2009-10-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mandy Joanne Sadan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
