{"id":"A46F798E-563C-492E-B0A1-359C71A68BBA","title":"Mapping Faith and Place in Leicester","abstractText":"Leicester is well known as an extremely diverse multi-ethnic city with one of the largest South Asian communities in contemporary Britain (in 2001, 30.6% of the city's population were of South Asian origin and the principal South Asian religions comprised: Hindu, 14.74%; Muslim, 11.03%; and Sikh, 4.21%). The expansion of multiple faiths in the city over the past 50 years has created a significant and complex architectural legacy of adaptive re-use and new construction of places of worship, and an equally rich inheritance of tangible and intangible religious practices, rituals, symbols and festivals that have transformed the urban landscape. The 'Mapping Faith and Place' Network hosted by the University of Leicester will bring together, for the first time, academics with research expertise in the fields of urban and migration history, urban landscapes, built heritage, and religious and cultural studies, with national and local heritage policy-makers and managers, the Leicester Museums Service and representatives of local interfaith networks and faith communities to create a richer understanding of issues of faith, place and cultural identity in the past, present and for the future.\\n\\nOne of the key aims of the Network is to create ongoing and meaningful partnerships between academics and non-HE stakeholders to critically assess the impact of current research agendas and policy frameworks on processes of cultural heritage curation and interpretation. We begin by asking: how does the material legacy of the historical development and ongoing prominence of religious pluralism create varied senses of place and belonging within the city's diverse neighbourhoods? What are the attitudes of ethnic minority communities to different aspects of their religious and cultural heritage and are they well served by current heritage policies and management practices? The need for a deeper understanding of Britain's diverse religious heritage is a clear priority for English Heritage and the research will provide a detailed contextualised study to focus this debate. In this, the Network aims to make a significant contribution to shaping the AHRC emerging theme: 'Care for the Future: Thinking through the Past', by investigating the historical emergence, current value and future significance of complex multi-faith and multi-ethnic urban landscapes in contemporary Britain, and providing new insights for public policy development and local community engagement in this field.\\n\\nThe Network will also ask: what does it mean 'to map'? The measurement and interpretation of the landscape is a vital part of academic research agendas in many disciplines, and is central to traditional understandings of urban history and to current historic landscape characterisation and management practices. However, the re-conceptualisation of processes of 'place-making' and the development of new digital mapping and visualisation technologies have led to a new understanding of our power to represent and interrogate the interactive processes by which spaces are made and made-sense-of; the stories people tell about places, movement and belonging which define their emotional and experiential qualities. Parts of the Network activities will be dedicated to exploring these different concepts and practices of mapping and will critically investigate the potential for using innovative digital technologies for mapping tangible and intangible heritage.\\n\\nThe Network will hold three themed seminars culminating in a public conference where different aspects of the research agenda will be developed and future research directions shaped. The Network's key findings will be shared through a public website hosted by the University of Leicester and peer-reviewed academic publications, and a core objective is to develop firm proposals for future research projects with a strong Knowledge Exchange element, focused on religious and cultural heritage in the city and region.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J001953/1","grantId":"AH/J001953/1","fundValue":"18974","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Young","coPersons":["Vivien Marion Golding"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
