The prediction is that the organic electronics market will be worth more than the traditional inorganic microelectronics sector in less than 20 years, and have value of more than $200 billion. Information displays lead this expansion with a fledgling industry already being sustained. Lighting, flexible displays and disposable electronics are following with organic photovoltaics a significant future hope. Although progressing rapidly, the ability of organic materials to fulfil their promise requires significant research effort since many fundamental properties of these materials and devices are still not well understood. This proposal addresses hole injection in organic electronic devices by investigating the electronic properties of novel organic - inorganic interfaces comprising transition metal oxides such as vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, nickel, tungsten, copper etc. Motivation arises from several sources; firstly as a replacement for the current state-of-the-art anode material, indium tin oxide, since indium is a costly and increasingly rare material; secondly as materials with which to integrate organic optoelectronic components with other existing advanced electronic technology such as CMOS to make devices such as microdisplays, sensors or lab-on-chip; thirdly as very high workfunction electrodes to enable the use of intrinsically more stable organic materials, since stability and lifetime still pose a barrier to widespread adoption; and finally with the possibility of utilising the rich ferromagnetic and electrochemical functionality of transition metals in organic-inorganic hybrid spintronic and electrochromic devices. This work will provide the first well-founded scientific study of the operation of transition metal oxides in organic electronic devices by investigating a wide range of materials using photoelectron and impedance spectroscopy. The findings of this work will enable improvements in the performance, processability and cost of devices such as light emitting diodes (OLED), field effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaics (OPV) as well as providing an opportunity to realise exciting new hybrid technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H049452/1","grantId":"EP/H049452/1","fundValue":"101936","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair Robert Buckley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
