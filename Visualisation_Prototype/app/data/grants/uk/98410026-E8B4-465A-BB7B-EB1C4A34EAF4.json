Currently LATs (people 'living apart together') constitute about 10 per cent of the British adult population - over 25 per cent of those who do not live with a partner. </p>\n\n<p>However, empirical, conceptual and policy understandings have largely presumed that 'single' in residential terms equates to 'single' in partnering terms, and/or that 'non-residential' means 'absent'. The existence of a relatively large number of LATs does not only mean that this presumption may be seriously inaccurate, it also means that we need to understand the nature and experience of being a LAT, and how this may vary.&nbsp; There is also disagreement as to whether LAT is a 'historically new family form' where participants can actively choose to live in a radically new way, or not much more than a 'stepping stone' on the way to cohabitation and marriage. </p>\n\n<p>This research will employ a multiâ€“scale quantitative and qualitative analysis involving:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>representative national survey information on types of LAT, motivations, attitudes, experiences and practices; </li>\n\n <li>semi-structured interviews to assess meanings and understandings about LAT; </li>\n\n <li>biographical-narrative interpretive interviews to examine the psychic benefits, conflicts and ambivalences of LAT. <br /></li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2213","grantId":"RES-062-23-2213","fundValue":"409353","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Duncan","coPersons":["Miranda  Phillips","Sasha  Roseneil"],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
