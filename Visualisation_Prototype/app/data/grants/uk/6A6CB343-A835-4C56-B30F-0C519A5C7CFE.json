{"id":"6A6CB343-A835-4C56-B30F-0C519A5C7CFE","title":"Innovative tools to enable exploration of complex and specialised data sets","abstractText":"In the age of Big Data, knowledge workers - individuals, companies and organisations whose primary focus is knowledge\nand information extraction and usage - find it increasingly difficult to search for and identify accurate and relevant\ninformation. In particular, in the domain of scientific literature and IP search, where the underlying corpora are growing at a\nhuge rate, this is a daunting task and human expertise and involvement remain critical. This project aims to develop a suite\nof techniques and methods that will enable users to search for and identify relevant information within a corpus more\nefficiently and effectively. The methods developed will deploy semantic-based analysis, domain and lexical linguistic\nontologies in order to first understand the user needs based on the underlying domain of application and subsequently\nenable more accurate information retrieval through enhanced search and cross-reference of information. In addition, the\nproject aims to offer advanced user services through sharing of search strategies which will be identified by observing and\nunderstanding patterns in users' search behaviours.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507106/1","grantId":"EP/M507106/1","fundValue":"106917","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Fasli","coPersons":["Vania  Sena"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
