These same molecules are also often triggers for our immune systems to develop antibodies, and are additionally used in assays to detect the presence of infectious bacteria. The studies proposed in this project aim to exploit the above principles by combining them with the emerging field of synthetic biology to develop new vaccine components and devices to rapidly detect potentially fatal pathogens. Synthetic biology uses the same principles from which life has evolved to design and develop novel life-reminiscent and biologically-active reagents.\n\nIn this study we aim to exploit our recent discovery that specified sequences of DNA can be used to assemble discrete 'nanoparticles' - chemicals with dimensions compatible with internal cellular sizes. We have combined a series of short lengths of DNA to form a ring-like structure we term a 'DNA nanoring'. These particles are all the same size, and their simple chemistry provides sites into which we can easily engineer other chemical groups. In this project we aim to incorporate a number of different groups at these sites, which are automatically multiplied by the symmetric construction of the nanoring. Through the addition of these inserted groups we will introduce both binding and sensing functionalities to the nanoring. These will: (1) enable nanorings to recognise and selectively bind to certain pathogenic bacteria; (2) change their chemical &amp; physical properties in response to pathogen binding, enabling sensing and detection of these bacteria; and (3) safely present multiple copies of bacterial surface proteins to the immune system as components of vaccines delivering an enhanced response, hence providing a new strategy for effective vaccine development. \n\nIf these uses can be successfully incorporated and demonstrated using the bacterial test systems in this study, these principles could be deployed against a wide range of pathogens including those believed to be incorporated in bioweapons. We propose their main uses would be in portable sensor units to detect pathogens in circulation, and in novel and improved vaccines targeting pathogens for which no effective vaccines currently exist. The nanorings therefore represent a novel development of new designed functionalities arising directly from the new field of synthetic biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J020087/1","grantId":"BB/J020087/1","fundValue":"122666","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Bacterial expression vectors for recombinant forms of two Franciscella tularensis marker proteins - EFTu (a genetic regulator) and PIL (a pilus protein intimately involved in infection) have been successfully prepared.

The existing published technology proved fickle and difficult to reproduce. We have derived an improved procedure which incorporates additional cycles of selection and amplification and has proven successful with test proteins. We believe this can be more broadly applied to many other proteins and will improve the successful application of this valuable technique. \n\nOur studies of oligonucleotides incorporating synthetic base pairs that contain a different hydrogen-bond profile have confirmed two important results: (1) that addition of these bases to DNA sequences leads to increased stability, and (2) that double-helical structures containing these replicate synthetic bases maintain overall structures virtually identical to equivalent oligonucleotides comprising only natural bases. We have also recently expanded our analysis to include hydrophobic base-pairs in which their pairing capability is derived from shape complementarity. These are important results as they indicate these synthetic bases can successfully be used to increase stability of DNA structures without distorting their overall conformation. This is an important development for the use of DNA as a building block in synthetic biology applications. For example, once aptamers are derived for a selected protein, our studies on synthetic base pairs demonstrate a procedure by which they can then be engineered to form more stable structures.
