A popular theoretical model has identified several features of working memory including components where information is maintained in memory and a 'central executive' involved in the control and manipulation of information stored within subsystems. Unfortunately studies of children with ADHD have used complex tasks that rely on multiple cognitive processes making it impossible to determine which components children are impaired in. The present study aims to characterise working memory impairment in ADHD using tasks specifically designed to systematically examine the ability to maintain and manipulate information across verbal and spatial domains. For comprehensiveness, children will also be assessed on standardised validated memory tasks from the CANTAB battery. Children with ADHD frequently show oppositional behaviour disorders (ODD). The present study will therefore compare the profile of working memory impairment in ADHD to children with ADHD and ODD and ODD alone enabling characterisation of the pattern of working memory impairment in the presence and absence of oppositional problems. The findings are expected to help in identifying the causes and mediators of the problem behaviour associated with ADHD and ODD.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2188","grantId":"RES-000-22-2188","fundValue":"80270","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sinead  Rhodes","coPersons":["DAVID ROCKWELL COGHILL","SARAH ABIGAIL SETH"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
