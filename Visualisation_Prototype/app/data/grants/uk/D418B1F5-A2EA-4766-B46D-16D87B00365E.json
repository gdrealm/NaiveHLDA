Four substantial Lives composed by Jocelin survive, namely of St Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), St Kentigern (patron saint of Glasgow), St Waltheof (abbot of Melrose), and St Helena of Britain (mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great). Jocelin worked under the patronage of prominent British and Irish ecclesiastical and secular leaders. These included Jocelin, bishop of Glasgow; Patrick, abbot of Melrose; and John de Courcy, conqueror of Ulster. \\n\\nJocelin's significance as a historical figure has been somewhat overlooked (although the significance of his saintly biographies is clear). No overview of his work has yet been published, perhaps because his work ranged across modern political boundaries. Neither Jocelin nor his writings belong to the history of one nation. As an author he displayed familiarity with Gaelic, English, French and Latin. Scholars have disagreed over whether he was English, Scottish, Irish or Manx, for his work also shows sympathy with the identities of different political groups. It is precisely to explore the cross-cultural significance of Jocelin's output that this project is being proposed. Jocelin wrote about relations between England, Ireland, Scotland and the Brittonic world at a time when national identities were still at a formative stage in their development. He did so under the influence of broader currents of ecclesiastical reform and political ideology and the concerns and connections of his community in Furness.\\n \\nThe project results will include a book containing complete editions and translations of two of Jocelin's Lives (The 'Life of Saint Waltheof' and the 'Life of Saint Helena') thus making these primary sources available for further research. Further chapters will cast light on the geographical and cultural context of Jocelin's works with a study of the cross cultural connections of medieval Furness and the Abbey (which had daughter houses in England, Ireland and the Isle of Man). The political circumstances of Jocelin's compositions will also be explored. Rather than mining hagiography as a source of 'facts' about saints, Jocelin's texts can be viewed as a commentary on contemporary cross-border relations. His works can provide an alternative viewpoint to charters and chronicles. Jocelin himself will be compared with other medieval hagiographers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries whose cultural interests were split between rival political groups.\\n\\nIn addition to producing a book, this project will raise awareness of Jocelin's work through the publication of an illustrated pamphlet and through a series of knowledge transfer activities, including a two-day conference, lectures and school visits. \\nThe potential applications and benefits of this project are varied. It will promote research by making primary sources available to a wider audience, by providing the first overview of the career of Jocelin as a significant medieval author, and by giving a new perspective on frontier relations. This project will also highlight the historical significance of Furness Abbey. The site is in a relatively deprived borough within the UK (see government statistics http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=1572&amp;theme=default). The heritage industry provides significant employment in South Cumbria and research on the area's medieval past can be directed in a positive way in partnership with the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society (See 'Project Partners'), local organisations and visitor attractions. Jocelin's writings also bear on the local history of other places including Glasgow, Melrose, Ulster and the Isle of Man. They invite consideration of thecomplex relationship between different Insular polities in the Middle Ages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H032819/1","grantId":"AH/H032819/1","fundValue":"162438","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1. Clare Downham was an academic consultant for the BBC 1 series 'Great British Stories: Regional Histories' episode on the 'Furness Journey'. Her scheduled interview at Furness Abbey for the programme in May 2012 had to be cancelled due to illness. The project work was nevertheless a springboard for some programme content about Furness Abbey and the cultural diversity of the Furness peninsular in the Middle Ages. Clare's article article about the project, called 'Britain's Medieval Identity Crisis', BBC History Magazine in March 2012, preceded the broadcast.\n\n\nPublicity arising from the Project conference at Furness, included radio interviews and newspaper interviews and summaries (including BBC Radio Cumbria, The Westmoreland Gazette and the North West Evening News). This brought the project to the wider attention of the inhabitants of north-west England, and promoted interest in the heritage of the Furness Peninsula. As per description above.\n\n2. The Project's Impact strategy aimed to improve knowledge of Furness Abbey and the writer Jocelin of Furness in the local area. This was of potential benefit since Furness Abbey is one of the main tourist attractions in the South Lakeland area. The local audience was engaged by talks to historical societies. Clare Downham has given presentations to the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society AGM in April 2010, to the 'Medieval Cumbria' day conference at Lancaster University in February 2011. She also gave the annual Bridekirk Lecture in June 2012 on cross Irish-Sea connections. Dr Fiona Edmonds will present the findings of the project to the Ingleborough Archaeology Group in April 2013 (meeting in Ingleton, North Yorkshire). Members of local history societies attended the project's day conference 'Medieval Furness: Texts and Contexts' in July 2011. The conference was partly funded and advertised through CWAAS which is the main local history society in the region. Information about the project was published in CWAAS newsletters and online. As per description above. Cultural Cultural,Societal","person":"Clare Elizabeth Downham","coPersons":["Fiona  Edmonds"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" One of the key methodological contributions of this project is the fact that it has crossed traditional historiographical divides. The Furness peninsula now lies in England, and so medieval historians have tended to set Furness's history in the context of governmental developments in the English realm. This project has been fully informed by Irish, Scottish and Manx historiography, and has therefore been able to explore a relatively neglected dimension of Furness's history. The project has also focused on several of the key sources for Furness Abbey, and has therefore set the understanding of the abbey's history on a more secure footing. For example, the investigation of the Furness filiation has led to the reappraisal of the account of the emergence of the Furness filiation at the front of the Furness Coucher Book. This account has been viewed with some suspicion since it was copied into the Coucher Book in the fifteenth century, but it has been possible to demonstrate that the account drew on earlier sources, including an early thirteenth-century narrative of the foundation of Erenagh and Inch Abbeys. This in turn reveals that texts were transmitted from Furness's daughter house, Inch Abbey, to Furness Abbey itself.\n\n\n\nThe project aims and outputs have shifted due to the generosity of Professor Richard Sharpe (University of Oxford) in providing access to Ludwig Bieler's incomplete edition of the Life of St Patrick by Jocelin of Furness which Bieler had been working on shortly before his death. The project therefore brings the final work of this eminent medieval Latin scholar to completion and brings a very important text to light which had been relatively untouched for decades. The work will be published by the Pontifical Institute in Toronto. The availability of this text will foster further study of Jocelin's work.\n\n\n\nThe first modern critical edition of the Life of St Patrick (it was last edited by the Bollandists in the seventeeth century). The work provides a significant leap forward in Patrician Studies, medieval hagiography and Irish Sea Studies. The edition is accompanied by an up to date English translation (the last published translation of the work dates to the mid-nineteenth century). The notes and accompanying text identify names, places and the sources of Jocelin's uita. The commentary illustrates how Patrician hagiography has developed from the seventh century until the twelfth century. A study of the text of Jocelin's Life of Patrick reveals significant parallels with the writings of another prominent twelfth century hagiographer Gerald of Wales and it is hoped that further exploration will be made of the links beyond the present study.\n\n\n\nThe first published translation of the 'Life of St Helena' by Jocelin of Furness. This uita was composed in 1198x1207 under the patronage of an unidentified religious community dedicated to the saint. The text is extant in three fourteenth-century manuscript. It has recently been edited by Antonina Harbus in Helena of Britain in Medieval Legend (Cambridge, 2002). Harbus's edition will provide the basis for the first published translation of this Life. The finished edition of the Life of St Patrick and the conference proceedings will be of use not only to academics but also to everyone interested in the history of Furness and its daughter-houses, especially those in Ireland and the Isle of Man. Also those interested in the legend of St Patrick (one of the few mediaeval saints who are still well known among the general public) will be happy to see that the last major piece of mediaeval writing related to Patrick finally made accessible in a modern edition and translation.\n\n\n\nThe Irish-Sea link has influenced the history of the Furness peninsula from prehistoric to modern times. The findings of the project can therefore be incorporated into a wider-ranging understanding of local history that embraces both the 'English' and 'Irish-Sea dimensions of the history of the Furness peninsula. There is considerable interest in Furness's medieval history at the moment as a result of the discovery of a new Viking-Age hoard on the peninsula in 2011 and the abbot's grave in 2012. Thus, interest in medieval history is currently very strong locally. \n\n\n\nThe dissemination of the project's findings through local history societies and schools has found a receptive audience, demonstrating its educational value and interest as well as highlighting historic links across the Irish Sea and the cultural diversity of medieval societies.
