{"id":"EFEB6B92-94D8-4B0F-9513-E2C7EAE5DAB7","title":"From 'corti&ccedil;o' to 'favela': Spatial Inequality in Brazilian Narrative","abstractText":"My project is a book-length study of how urban space has been represented in Brazilian narrative from late 19th-century onwards. A close-examination of most literary periods since the 19th century will reveal works that criticise and analyse Brazil's striking social inequalities and yet have been consistently ignored by Marxist and social literary critics. My book will demonstrate that by using Henri Lefebvre's notion of 'space production' ('The Production of Space', 2000) we can better understand the degree to which such works engage in deep social analysis. The titles to be studied are: Alu&iacute;sio Azevedo's 'O Corti&ccedil;o' (1980); Lima Barreto's 'Vida e Morte de M.J. Gonzaga de S&aacute;' (1919); Ant&ocirc;nio de Alc&acirc;ntara Machado's 'Br&aacute;s, Bexiga e Barra Funda' (1927), and 'Laranja da China' (1928); Patr&iacute;cia Galv&atilde;o's 'Parque Industrial' (1933); Carolina Maria de Jesus's 'Quarto de Despejo' (1960); Clarice Lispector's 'A Paix&atilde;o Segundo G.H.' (1964), and 'A Hora da Estrela' (1977); and Ademiro Alves's 'Graduado em Marginalidade' (2005) and '85 Letras e um Disparo' (2007). The aim is to examine how social inequality is inscribed in literary urban space from different time periods, two cities (Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo), and by writers from different social backgrounds. Following Lefebvre, Brazilian urban space will be defined in the project as a 'social product', i.e.,as the product of the hegemony of an elite which for three centuries depended economically on slavery, and which continues to rely even today on its legacy of extremely cheap labour and servitude. \\n\\nAlthough Lefebvre's notion of 'social space' serves as its main theoretical basis, 'From corti&ccedil;o to favela' will not be the application of a theoretical model to different literary works. As a non-orthodox Marxist analysis of space, Lefebvre's notions will relate intricately to other theoretical statements: the economic and social principles of Marx's 'Capital', Walter Benjamin's definitions of the 'fl&acirc;neur's as allegory, Michel de Certeau's 'The Practice of Everyday Life', and Franco Moretti's maps in the 'Atlas of the European Novel'. Methodologically, the work will combine close-readings of the works listed above with analyses of the social, historical, and cultural context in which they were written. The close-readings will rigorously concentrate on issues related to space, and will highlight literary techniques that are used to depict spatial inequality.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H004483/1","grantId":"AH/H004483/1","fundValue":"35464","fundStart":"2010-09-20","fundEnd":"2011-01-19","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucia  Sa","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
