The extensive research on working memory has been dominated by a theoretical framework that assumes a separation between verbal and spatial mental representations. Yet in everyday life, we perceive and process stimuli as integrated objects, not as independent features. </p> \n<p>The present project will investigate how verbal and spatial stimuli are integrated in working memory using laboratory behavioural experiments in which participants will be required to encode letters in spatial locations and judge whether a subsequent test stimulus was presented to them or not. </p> \n<p>Three key issues are addressed: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>The temporal dynamics of binding</li> \n <li>The role of attention in binding</li> \n <li>Whether the associations between verbal and spatial features are symmetrical or asymmetrical.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The project will have implications for our understanding of working memory and the processing of multimodal events. From a more applied point of view, research on information integration is important for users interested in multi-modal information systems, and for our understanding of certain conditions and of the cognitive decline accompanying normal ageing.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006469/1","grantId":"ES/E006469/1","fundValue":"271860","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Fabrice Benoit Parmentier","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
