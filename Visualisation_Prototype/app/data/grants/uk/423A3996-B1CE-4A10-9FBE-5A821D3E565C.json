This communication occurs at specialised sites of contact known as synapses. At these sites, an arriving nerve impulse causes the release of a chemical (neurotransmitter) from the presynaptic cell which then interacts with receptor molecules embedded in the cell membrane of a neighbouring postsynaptic neurone. Some types of these receptors (e.g. glycine and GABA-A receptors) possess specific ion-permeable channels. The opening of these channels in response to neurotransmitter alters the electrical state of the cell either transmitting or subtly altering the incoming nerve impulse. Neurotransmitters are then recovered from the synapse by transporters located in neighbouring glial cells or the corresponding presynaptic cell. The mechanisms that regulate synaptic transmission and nerve impulse activity are important in understanding normal and diseased states of the brain. Indeed, many drugs in use or under development act primarily via GABA or glycine receptors and their transporters. The therapeutic nature of these agents provides a compelling reason for further understanding the molecular details of the structure and function of these proteins. This proposal will benefit research in this area by enhancing our knowledge concerning transporters for GABA and glycine. In a recent study we were able to show that genetic defects in the glycine transporter GlyT2 were responsible for causing a rare illness called hyperekplexia. This affects newborn children and is characterised by noise or touch-induced seizures which result in breath-holding episodes. In some instances hyperekplexia can lead to brain damage or sudden infant death. Our major aims are: i) to study the consequences of GlyT2 mutations to reveal how these defects disable the transporter, and to investigate whether defects in a glycine transporter found on synaptic vesicles (VIAAT) or proteins that associate with GlyT2 can also cause hyperekplexia; ii) to determine whether genetic mutations in a second glycine transporter, GlyT1, is responsible for cases of a different childhood illness, glycine encephalopathy, which can lead to severe brain damage or death; iii) since defects in GABA receptors are found in some types of epilepsy, we will investigate whether mutations in GABA transporter genes also cause epilepsy. It is our hope that a detailed understanding of the genetic defects responsible for these illnesses will enable better diagnosis and treatment of affected individuals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601585","grantId":"G0601585","fundValue":"639117","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Justin Harvey","coPersons":["Mark Ian Rees","Kirsten  Harvey"],"organisation":"School of Pharmacy","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
