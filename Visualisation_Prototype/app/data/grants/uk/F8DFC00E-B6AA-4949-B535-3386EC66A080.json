This project examines the impact of this separation on strategies to widen participation in undergraduate education. Does it advance or inhibit a broadening of participation, or is its influence otherwise neutral?</p> \n<p>This influence will be investigated at three levels:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>At the system level, the findings of policy interviews and statistical studies will be compared with international evidence on analogous systems.</li> \n <li>At the institutional level, a typology of dual sector organisations, partnerships and networks will be developed from an analysis of national datasets and a survey of further and higher education establishments.</li> \n <li>At the level of learning and teaching, fieldwork conducted in four partner institutions will assess the significance and meaning of moving between further and higher education and between short-cycle and first-degree education.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>A key element in the study is research collaboration and capacity-building with partner institutions. Small-scale longitudinal studies of students and interviews with managers and tutors will involve regular visits to each institution over two years. The research team will work with four institution-based research associates, each seconded for one day a week.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0245","grantId":"RES-139-25-0245","fundValue":"246520","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Parry","coPersons":["David Norman Smith","Ann-Marie  Bathmaker","Raymond Glenn Brooks"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
