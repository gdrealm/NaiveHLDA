Risk-based auditing and taxpayers' responses (TARC 1)\nThis project applies agent-based simulation to model the tax compliance choices of heterogeneous taxpayers who interact via a social network. The analysis has considered alternative audit rules and has progressed to incorporate the implementation of predictive analytics within the agent-based simulation. These issues have not been previously addressed in academic research. The innovation in the analysis is the combination of social networks, learning, and the implementation of complex audit rules within the simulation. An increase in modeling complexity has been possible because of the provision of a high-powered computing system by the University of Exeter which reflects the commitment of the institution to TARC. The analysis highlights the role of self-selection by level of risk aversion into occupations, and the link between this and opportunities for non-compliance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of predictive analytics in increasing compliance and raising revenue. The initial results of the project were presented at the Shadow economy conference and more developed results presented at the Tax Compliance conference in Nuremberg. A paper based on the precursor work to this project is forthcoming in the Journal of Economic Psychology and a paper spanning the two projects is under review at Economics of Governance. A further paper on predictive analytics will be submitted to the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization.\nb. Taxpayer attitudes and motivations (TARC 16)\nInitial work in this project stream has focused on social norms and the way in which they influence individuals to comply with the law. A pilot project using conversational analysis techniques to investigate taxpayer on-line interactions is adding to both the theoretical and empirical literature in the field of tax compliance. A discussion paper on social norms has been completed for publication on the TARC website and two journal articles are in progress, following two conference presentations of the analysis. Discussions with HMRC indicate a need for additional discussion papers addressing theoretical and practical issues regarding psychological and social facts in tax compliance. These are in progress, dealing with the attitude-behaviour link and fairness, and will serve to outline the concepts and gaps in research, focused on how to design effective compliance campaigns.\n\nScientific Impact\na. Journal of Tax Administration\nTARC has been actively involved in the foundation of a new academic journal and the first issue of the journal is scheduled for publication in September. Financial support for the journal has been obtained from the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) which will cover the first three years of publication. The journal is owned by a partnership of the University of Exeter (acting for TARC) and CIOT. The three founding editors are Miguel Fonseca, Chris Heady, and Lynne Oats. The intention of the journal is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum for work on tax administration which will reflect the range of work undertaken by TARC. Many of the TARC international fellows will be on the editorial board and we will encourage submission of papers presented at our workshops. There is at present no journal that specializes in tax administration despite it being an increasingly active research field. There is a clear need for a focal point for the wide range of research on tax administration that is undertaken and wish to demonstrate that a multidisciplinary journal can be a success.\nb. International Conferences\nResearchers connected to TARC have been very visible at major international conferences over the course of the past year. Ten presentations were based on research directly produced by TARC and several others presentations were based on work related to TARC activities. At all the presentations listed below the TARC affiliation was prominent. The Association of Public Economic Theory conference in Lisbon included presentations by Miguel Fonseca, Nigar Hashimzade, Matthew Rablen, and Hana Yousefi (a PhD student associated to TARC). Gareth Myles gave a keynote lecture at the conference. Matthew Rablen presented at the Shadow Economy conference in Munster and Gareth Myles gave a keynote lecture. Miguel Fonseca, Matthew Rablen and Gareth Myles presented, and Lynne Oats was a panel member, at the International Tax Analysis Conference in London. Fonseca, Myles, Rablen and Diana Onu presented at the Social Norms and Tax Compliance conference in Nuremberg. Lynne Oats gave a keynote speech and Diana Onu, Gregory Morris, Rodrigo Ormeno and Carlyne Wynter all presented at the Fiscal State and Social Citizenship conference in Link&ouml;ping, Sweden. Lynne Oats gave a guest speech at the European Commission Fiscalis Risk Management Platform Workshop in Edinburgh. Lynne Oats, Diana Onu, Gregory Morris, Rodrigo Ormeno and Carlyne Wynter presented at the Fiscal State and Social Citizenship conference in Link&ouml;ping, Sweden. Myles also presented talks in Aarhus, Amsterdam, Boston, Boulder, Istanbul, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Norwich, Ottawa, Paris, Timisoara, and Washington. Jonathan Shaw gave a talk in Dublin.\n\nEconomic and Societal impact\na. Customer satisfaction\nThe purpose of the customer satisfaction project is to assess the impact on non-compliance of different levels of guidance and support within the tax filing system. The underlying hypothesis is that improved service will increase tax morale and improve compliance. The work undertaken has focused on the design of the experiment and the establishment of an initial treatment set. Particular attention has been paid to the flow of the experiment and the components that constitute the experiment to allow the measurement of error as well as non-compliance. The current position is that the initial prototype of the experiment has been reviewed by HMRC and design changes are currently being implemented. The key concerns have been usability and how best to help participants through the experiment without leading them. The pilot experiment is imminent, and the results obtained from this will feed back into further improvements before the full experiment is run with taxpayers as subjects. The pathways to the impact of this project are through the integration of HMRC as end-user of the research in the design and delivery of the project. The results will be presented to HMRC once available and processed. We are actively working to secure a research secondment to be attached to this project. This will result in direct knowledge transfer and contribute to capacity building.\nb. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)\nThe research is at a very early stage and so there has been no impact so far. The impact that the project is aiming to achieve is an improvement in the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that HMRC uses to analyze the likely impact of tax policy changes. This should lead to an improvement in tax policy making in the UK. There are two research strands to the work on CGE. Chris Heady is leading a project that will explore the links between income and consumption taxes in order to provide the CGE model with a richer set of interactions. The second project involves Chris Heady and Gareth Myles and aims to improve the modelling of the financial services sector in the CGE model, so that the impact of taxes levied on that sector can be analyzed more effectively. The pathway that will achieve these impacts is to work closely with the CGE modeling team in HMRC. This close working will necessarily involve an exchange of knowledge between the researchers on the project and the HMRC. In addition to these activities there are CGE masterclasses scheduled to take place in years 3, 4, and 5 of TARC to ensure knowledge exchange. Capacity building will occur through direct training of HMRC staff and through the engagement of a PhD student (from September 2014) to undertake research in CGE analysis.\n\nKnowledge Exchange Activity\na. National Audit Office\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) commissioned TARC to produce a report on tax reliefs. The report was part on the NAO project on tax reliefs under instruction by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. The report was produced by Nigar Hashimzade, Chris Heady, Lynne Oats, Gareth Myles, and Kim Scharf. The content of the report focussed on the description of a framework that could be used to design, cost, and monitor tax reliefs. The framework was intended to deliver a programme for the better governance of reliefs. It consisted of detailing the methods for the costing of reliefs and the evaluation of their success in operation. The project involved a series of meetings, discussions, and presentations at the NAO and final delivery of a seventy page report which will be published by the NAO.\nb. Tax Gap Masterclass\nTARC has committed to provide a programme of masterclasses that will benefit both academics and tax administrators. The first masterclass was held in November. The class was given by Brian Erard who has published on tax compliance and has extensive consulting experience with US Internal Revenue Service. The target was to attract 20 participants to the masterclass. This was considerably exceeded and eventually 39 participants registered. Over 70 percent of the participants were tax administrators, (including representatives from the Australian Tax Office, Canada Revenue Service, Danish Customs and Tax Administration, HMRC, and the Italian Revenue Agency. The academics participants were from the UK and Germany. \nThe class was focussed on the measurement of the tax gap. HMRC have a formal duty to report an annual measure of the tax gap and are continually seeking to improve the measure. Brian Erard has provided advice to the IRS on statistical methods to improve measurement of the tax gap. The participants valued this experience and the satisfaction ratings submitted at the end of the masterclass were excellent. The masterclass was a perfect knowledge exchange activity with two days of active discussion and interaction. \nErich Kirchler, professor of economic psychology at Vienna and editor of the Journal of Economic Psychology, has been contracted to give the second masterclass. This will take place in October 2014.\nc. HMRC/TARC Research Day\nA research day at which TARC will present its activities to HRMC staff has been arranged for 12 September 2014. This will provide an opportunity for TARC to showcase its research and to communicate its activities to a broader set of HMRC staff.\n\nInternational\na. Networking\nOne of the roles of TARC is to engage in international networking in order to facilitate knowledge exchange between tax administrators and tax researchers. Over the course of the past year TARC researchers have engaged with the US Internal Revenue Service, the Canadian Revenue Service, the European Commission, the Korean Revenue service, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. TARC has also increased the number of its international fellows to widen the range of its networking. TARC hosted a visit in November by Nina Ohlson who is the US Taxpayer Advocate.\nb. Collaborative\nSeveral collaborative projects have been initiated. Initial discussions on a link with Renmin University, China have taken place. Gareth Myles visited the tax research group at Max Planck Institute in Munich to discuss research collaboration. An email exchange has taken place with the Inter-American Center of Tax Administration (CIAT) in South American. TARC has also discussed the founding of a tax research centre with the South African Institute of Taxation.\nc. Academic\nResearchers from TARC have made a large number of international presentations at university seminars, and international conferences. Gareth Myles was a keynote speaker at shadow 2013 and successfully negotiated for TARC to host the conference in 2015. Fonseca, Myles and Onu attended the Nuremberg workshop on tax compliance. Contact was made with Alex Rees-Jones of the Treasury &quot;nudge&quot; unit and a joint research project on Italian compliance data was discussed with Alessandro Santoro (Milan Bicocca). They have also undertaken visits to international institutions. Myles visited the IRS in Washington where he presented a seminar and discussed alternative approaches to agent-based modelling (TARC1) with Kim Bloomquist who has considerable expertise in this area. Lynne Oats participated in an OECD workshop in London 3 - 4 March 2014 'Measuring Compliance Outcomes' and will contribute to the production of the report.\nd. Press\nTARC has provided articles on the taxation of multinationals for the Chinese People's Daily and on the transfer of the tax domicile of Fiat for the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano.\n\n3. Progress against Objectives\nProgress against each research theme/strand\nThe research of TARC is organised around four research themes and two long-run projects. The Analysis and Simulation research theme has made considerable progress on its first two projects. Papers from these projects have been presented at international conferences by Myles and Rablen and are under review at academic journals. Progress on the Estimation and Evaluation theme has been slower than expected because of considerable delays in the provision of the necessary data. It has been necessary for HMRC to establish a number of protocols and arrange methods of working that allow close collaboration with external researchers. They have also needed to find resources to produce datasets required by tax centre researchers and it should be noted that this can be costly. Through a process of collaboration and discussion many of these issues have now been addressed. The first set of data individual compliance data is expected to be available in Datalab on June 20, 2014. We envisage making progress using this data over the coming year. After a considerable number of discussions it is now clear that the data from Connect for the project &quot;Understanding the spread of information in networks&quot; will not be available in the short-term. An abbreviated version of this project should still be possible using the compliance data which will be available. Preparatory steps are being taken to allow work on the project &quot;Responses to capital gains tax and corporation tax reforms&quot; to begin towards the end of the coming year, and confirmation of the availability of data is awaited. The Economic and Social Experimentation theme has completed the project &quot;Taxpayer responsiveness to audits&quot;. The results have been published in a TARC discussion paper and are under review at an academic journal. The theme has appointed an excellent PhD student and the experiment for the second project is progressing to the pilot stage. The Interdisciplinary Qualitative Analysis theme is pursuing two projects with long-run time scales. A highly-skilled researcher has been appointed to the project and the initial findings are now being presented at international conferences. Discussions are being held with HMRC regarding the potential for this work to contribute to the Customer Perceptions and other studies undertaken by KAI. The project on Computable General Equilibrium had to overcome some initial hurdles concerning data disclosure. These issues have been resolved and preliminary work is underway. The project will become fully operational in October. A PhD student has been appointed who will undertake research in computable general equilibrium. The Tax Gap project has involved a masterclass and the appointment of a PhD student. The initial research is investigating the use of expenditure diaries to estimate the level of non-compliance. This research is being conducted in close collaboration with HMRC tax gap measurement team.\n\nCapacity building initiatives\nThe Centre is involved in several capacity building initiatives. There is one postdoctoral researcher in post and two first-year PhD students. Two further PhD students have been appointed and will join TARC in October. Our visitors have included a PhD student from Vienna. The masterclass provided training in recent developments in tax gap measurement. A secondment from HMRC to TARC is in process. The project to which the secondee will be attached has been agreed and TARC has offered financial support for travel and accommodation.\n\nProgress against agreed programme of major outputs\nTwo of the research themes (Analysis and Simulation and Qualitative Analysis) are proceeding at the planned pace with research papers being produced and submitted to academic journals (Journal of Economic Psychology, Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organisation, Economics of Governance). The experimental theme has completed one project and a paper is submitted (Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organisation) but an extended period of time has been required to reach agreement with HMRC on the details of the first new project. The project is now underway. The delay in the provision of data has prevented the empirical theme from making progress but a date (see above) has now been given for availability in Datalab. The agreed workshops (in January 2013 and March 2014) and masterclass (in November 2013) have been delivered as planned.\n\nProgress against agreed milestones for the reporting year\nThere has been good progress against milestones in most aspects of TARC's performance. Not all milestones have been met but resolutions are in place to make better progress on these. The number of discussion papers and policy briefs are below target but conference presentations are significantly above. All capacity building targets have been met or exceeded, with the exception of secondment from HMRC. The level of external funding obtained in the reporting year exceeds the target. International collaboration has not achieved the targets. \n\nSummary of progress against the communication and engagement strategy\nThe strategy has seen good progress in some respects. The website has been functional and is building a significant body of information. The use of the website has exceeded the targets for the reporting year. The use of social media is gradually developing with a flow of communications and a continuing increase in followers. Contributions have been made to international print media and radio. It is clear that additional research output is necessary before the communication strategy can become fully effective. There has been considerable engagement with HMRC, and with the NAO, OECD, and IRS.\n\n4. Summary of performance against Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nThe Tax Administration Research Centre has achieved excellent performance against many of the KPIs but there are areas for improvement. \nThe key achievements were the success of the masterclass which far exceeded its target for attendance and drew an international audience. The reviews of the masterclass were highly complementary. TARC has also been successful in securing external funding. CIOT have provided &pound;100,000 for the establishment of an academic journal and &pound;26,000 was received from the NAO. The TARC website has also exceeded the KPIs for visitors and downloads. The website was seen from the outset as a key communication device and the investment in design is being rewarded. TARC researchers were also very active in delivering presentations are international conferences.\nThere are two significant weaknesses that need to be addressed in the next year of operation. First, the number of discussion paper and policy briefs. In some areas the research programme of TARC has been slow to develop. We are now hopeful that the difficulties with the delivery data have been resolved and that the empirical research theme can begin operation. The limited research output has impacted directly on policy briefs which need to be informed by research. The outputs that have now appeared, or are due to shortly appear, from TARC1, TARC13, and TARC16 are suitable for distribution in policy briefs. These briefs will be produced over the course of the next six months. \nSecond, no secondment of HMRC staff has yet taken place. Ongoing discussion have identified a suitable project and the person requirements. TARC has also committed financial support for accommodation and travel. We are hopeful that the first secondment will take place in Summer 2014.

The purpose of the Centre is to engage in work on tax administration that combines academic excellence with policy relevance. During the reporting period for this annual report the Centre has appointed administrative staff, research staff, and PhD students. The research programme is underway and final outputs are beginning to emerge. These final outputs reflect the purpose of the research programme. The Centre has also held two annual workshops and provided a very successful masterclass. A working relationship has been established with HMRC and productive links are being developed. A wide variety of external engagement has taken place and the Centre is developing a significant international profile. This has been enhanced by our involvement in the Tax Research Network conference, the International Tax Analysis Conference, and the future hosting of Shadow Economy conference. The Centre has formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute for Taxation to found the Journal of Tax Administration which is a multi-disciplinary international journal.

The project to which the secondee will be attached has been agreed and TARC has offered financial support for travel and accommodation.\n\nProgress against agreed programme of major outputs\nTwo of the research themes (Analysis and Simulation and Qualitative Analysis) are proceeding at the planned pace with research papers being produced and submitted to academic journals (Journal of Economic Psychology, Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organisation, Economics of Governance). The experimental theme has completed one project and a paper is submitted (Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organisation) but an extended period of time has been required to reach agreement with HMRC on the details of the first new project. The project is now underway. The delay in the provision of data has prevented the empirical theme from making progress but a date (see above) has now been given for availability in Datalab. The agreed workshops (in January 2013 and March 2014) and masterclass (in November 2013) have been delivered as planned.\n\nProgress against agreed milestones for the reporting year\nThere has been good progress against milestones in most aspects of TARC's performance. Not all milestones have been met but resolutions are in place to make better progress on these. The number of discussion papers and policy briefs are below target but conference presentations are significantly above. All capacity building targets have been met or exceeded, with the exception of secondment from HMRC. The level of external funding obtained in the reporting year exceeds the target. International collaboration has not achieved the targets. \n\nSummary of progress against the communication and engagement strategy\nThe strategy has seen good progress in some respects. The website has been functional and is building a significant body of information. The use of the website has exceeded the targets for the reporting year. The use of social media is gradually developing with a flow of communications and a continuing increase in followers. Contributions have been made to international print media and radio. It is clear that additional research output is necessary before the communication strategy can become fully effective. There has been considerable engagement with HMRC, and with the NAO, OECD, and IRS.\n\n4. Summary of performance against Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nThe Tax Administration Research Centre has achieved excellent performance against many of the KPIs but there are areas for improvement. \nThe key achievements were the success of the masterclass which far exceeded its target for attendance and drew an international audience. The reviews of the masterclass were highly complementary. TARC has also been successful in securing external funding. CIOT have provided ?100,000 for the establishment of an academic journal and ?26,000 was received from the NAO. The TARC website has also exceeded the KPIs for visitors and downloads. The website was seen from the outset as a key communication device and the investment in design is being rewarded. TARC researchers were also very active in delivering presentations are international conferences.\nThere are two significant weaknesses that need to be addressed in the next year of operation. First, the number of discussion paper and policy briefs. In some areas the research programme of TARC has been slow to develop. We are now hopeful that the difficulties with the delivery data have been resolved and that the empirical research theme can begin operation. The limited research output has impacted directly on policy briefs which need to be informed by research. The outputs that have now appeared, or are due to shortly appear, from TARC1, TARC13, and TARC16 are suitable for distribution in policy briefs. These briefs will be produced over the course of the next six months. \nSecond, no secondment of HMRC staff has yet taken place. Ongoing discussion have identified a suitable project and the person requirements. TARC has also committed financial support for accommodation and travel. We are hopeful that the first secondment will take place in Summer 2014.
