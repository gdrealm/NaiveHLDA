It shall collect data through surveys of participants in three or four large-scale protest events per year in the period 2009-2012 in the UK.

We analyse data from 9 demonstrations and explore the differences between four groups of protesters: novices, returners, repeaters and stalwarts. We find that whilst aspects of biographical availability distinguish our four groups, they do not do so as a matter of degree. Structural availability and emotions to not distinguish the groups at all, but political engagement appears to increase in-line with increasing frequency and intensity of participation in demonstrations.\n\nA forthcoming piece in Global Environmental Politics by Rootes and Swedish project partners explores the relationship between climate change protests and global justice. By exploring climate protests in three countries, we are able to point to different mobilization contexts that contribute to different rates of identification with the GJM and variations in the framing of climate change.\n\nA conference paper by Saunders (2013) presented at the PSA in 2013 explores the relationship between formal political participation and protest. This paper finds that those who protest with the highest degree of intensity are not disconnected from formal political institutions. Whilst they are no more likely than those who do not protest at all to vote in a general election, they are more likely to identify closely with a political party and to have contacted a politician in the past 12 months.\n\nWhereas the three papers listed above relate most closely to our original research aims and objectives, the richness of the data means that we have also been able to address other questions. Rainsford (2013) has used the data to show that youth take a variety of paths into activism. Sotirakopoulos and Rootes (2013) found that the Occupy movement is the result of a concatenation of historical precedents, the current economic crisis and transnational diffusion. Roth et al (2013) note how Occupy participants have differential routes into participation but share emphasis on prefigurative politics. Olcese and Saunders (2013) find that student protests are not archetypal new social movements. And Van Troost and Olcese (2013) find that the relationship between framing and emotions is more complex than current theoretical approaches allow for. Our findings might be taken forward in the following ways:\n1. By scholars seeking for more nuanced data on protesters than available in existing socio-political surveys on political participation\n2. It can be used for statistical modelling and hypotheses testing of theories of protest and social movements\n3. By protest organisers, seeking to mobilise for demonstrations.
