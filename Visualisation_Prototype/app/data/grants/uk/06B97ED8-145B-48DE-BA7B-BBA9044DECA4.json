{"id":"06B97ED8-145B-48DE-BA7B-BBA9044DECA4","title":"Brunelleschi Lacan Le Corbusier: the architecture of the self","abstractText":"Description: 'BRUNELLESCHI LE CORBUSIER LACAN: the architecture of the self' will be a book length monograph, under firm contract for publication with Routledge in 2008. It argues that perspective is the paradigmatic form of spatial consciousness. This explains why perspective remains such a satisfying representational form - the form of space that we tend to call real - and why it remains the primary visual form of architectural space, despite recent experiments in representation that claim to challenge this canon. The argument begins with the observation that the diagram that the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan publishes of the structure of the psychoanalytic subject in what he calls the visual field (Paris, 1964) is similar to the diagram that could be drawn of Brunelleschi's demonstration of perspective (Florence, 1420). This link between the 20th Century structuralist discourse of the subject of perception and the classical historical account of the invention of space as we know it, has not hitherto been elaborated, let alone noticed, in the literature of either discourse. In the demonstration, Brunelleschi viewed a hallowed object, the Florence Baptistery; and this act of viewing involved a specific kind of framing and screening by his mirror apparatus. The text explains the similarity between the inner world of the psyche and the outer world of space, by proposing a psychoanalytic interpretation of Brunelleschi's demonstration, as opposed to the standard - and it is argued, deeply flawed - historiographic reconstructions (White, Gombrich, Krautheimer, Edgerton, Panofsky); in turn, it uses the architectural discourse of space to elaborate the key Lacanian and Freudian accounts of the subject of perception. It also proposes a new way to approach a problem that is one of the bugbears of modernism: modernism's relation to its past. \\n\\nContext: The use of psychoanalytic theory as an interpretive approach to problems of architecture and perception is an active and developing area of interdisciplinary research. My work references and extends prior research by, e.g., Tony Vidler, Beatriz Colomina, Hubert Damisch, Steven Pile. It will be a major contribution to this field.\\n\\nAims and objectives: The object of this interdisciplinary research project is to complete a 100,000 word monograph, the aim of which is to revise our understanding of architectural space and the spatiality of the psyche. It aims to draw strong conceptual links between key aspects of psychoanalytic theory that relate to space (dreams, drive, identity, and desire), and key aspects of the architectural discourse of space, in particular, the invention of perspective. The argument, which has been mapped out and is in the process of being fully developed in written form, is based on the close analytic reading of key texts in architecture and psychoanalytic theory. \\n\\nApplications and benefits: This research critiques the historical account of the invention of perspective - the foundational moment in the architectural discourse of space - and reinterprets it in ways relevant for today. It will open up new areas of research questions in this inter-disciplinary field. It will lead to a new understanding of our relation to architectural space and objects that will benefit designers and theorists of architecture; it will be of interest to psychoanalysts interested in how their work has bearing on fields outside their own. This research will be disseminated by publication of a monograph that promises to be a significant contribution to architectural theory. Material from this research will also be disseminated by several planned 'satellite' journal papers.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004938/1","grantId":"AH/E004938/1","fundValue":"30133","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorens  Holm","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
