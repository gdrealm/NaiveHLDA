{"id":"0D9CEA64-1615-482B-B15F-167DA662C7C8","title":"Serendipity in Science, Technology and Innovation","abstractText":"I present the Serendipity proposal, with SPRU (Sussex, UK) and Columbia (NYC, USA), to conduct a body of frontier work on the role, management and impact of serendipity on research performance. The project addresses major theoretical issues (related to the governance of research) that are of especially significant policy importance to the UK as it emerges from a major recession and moves towards a more knowledge intensive economy.\n\nThe key focus of the project is on the under-researched topic of &quot;serendipity&quot;, the notion in science policy that basic research leads to unexpected valuable outcomes, and since the outcomes of basic research are impossible to predict, research itself is difficult (perhaps even impossible) to manage or direct towards specific social ends. Serendipity has been a core idea in science, technology and innovation policy but there has been almost no research (with the exception of work by Merton, see later in Case for Support section) that has explored its relative importance, measured its magnitude or investigated its factors, and how it leads to social and economic benefits.\n\nThis is an important issue for the UK, given its relative innovation performance compared to Germany, USA and Asia. On the one hand, UK innovation policy is seen as being more blue-sky orientated than the USA (where the majority of publicly funded research is mission-orientated), yet on the other hand it is seen as missing (serendipitous) opportunities to exploit and 'translate' its research strengths into medical industries and patient benefits (Cooksey 2006). Pointing out that uncertainty means research cannot be micro-managed misses the more pertinent issue about whether UK science can be better managed in ways that enhance the social and economic value of serendipity for the UK. Research may be uncertain, but it is not random, and we know that industrial R&amp;D managers fund research in areas where they expect returns and organise research to maximise its impact. With public policy, the scenario is slightly different, but there is not yet a body of evidence to draw on to support policy making.\n\nTo address this research gap, this project brings together two of the leading research groups in the world working on science policy. The project will be led by myself (a junior/early career researcher with a double prize-winning publication record), mentored by Prof Ben Martin, (former Director of SPRU), and Dr Bhaven Sampat, (tenured Associate Professor at Columbia). The project will undertake a mix of fundamental basic research on the nature and history of serendipity, and its influence on research policy, together with applied policy-focused research on issues of direct relevance to government policy makers, medical charities and industrial R&amp;D managers. It will examine data and rare archives in the U.S. (that are accessible only on-location), with cutting edge quantitative and qualitative methods to generate large scale evidence as well six detailed cases studies. It will then focus on developing theory and implications to inform future UK policy on research governance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L011409/1","grantId":"ES/L011409/1","fundValue":"173601","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ohid  Yaqub","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
