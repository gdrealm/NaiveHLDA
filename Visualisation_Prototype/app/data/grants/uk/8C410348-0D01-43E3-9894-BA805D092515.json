The top performing funds were larger, nationally or internationally focused, provided significant managerial support, and were co-funded in ways that balanced risks and rewards. The indirect impact of these public policy schemes, in terms of future taxation take rather than financial returns to the government as an investor, were significant suggesting they represent good value for money for the taxpayer. \n\n\n\nB) In relation to innovation in financial technology and its exploiting the research highlighted the important role of business model innovation and the neglect of managerial attention to how the firm will capture value. The provision of financing has an important role in structuring which business models will be viable and in the UK these tend to be more asset-focused, directed towards acquisition, capable of leaving a significant runway of funding when firms enter into negotiations, and significantly compressed over time in how long the firms' life-cycle exists for. The provision of managerial support is an key feature of equity provision and government policy has overlooked its importance. The UK system is more effective at developing technology for large firms than it is at producing global firms, such as google, because of gaps in the existing financing system that constrain firms growth. This has led to human capital constraints and created a thin market in the provision of funding for innovative firms. We find little evidence of market failures in the provision of equity to the majority of firms in non-recessionary data. The weak performance of many funded firms suggests policy would be improved if it focused on quality rather than quantity, and aimed to increase the size of funds and investments. \n\n\n\nC) In relation to financial regulation the project supported previous research that suggests increases in banking equity are effective and are only more costly than current debt levels because of the higher risks involved. Since the point of capital provisions is to shift risk this increased cost is a reason for the policy rather than against it. The project also supported previous calls for increased competition in the UK banking sector, which may improve debt provision to SMEs, which is extremely difficult during the financial crisis (2008-2012 data). However, we also found a decrease in demand for debt, which is again consistent with previous studies and suggests supply side measures may be less effective than many policy makers hope. \n\n\n\nOur overall findings suggest that there are significant problems with the provision of data on SMEs with the result that poor performing firms are under-represented in datasets. As a result, the actual performance of SMEs is often significantly lower than is commonly thought. The project generated a practitioner book edited by Michael O'Neill and Michael M.
