{"id":"E915ADDA-CA0D-4DDA-ACBE-A8C7AF4C585A","title":"Models for selection bias, applied to controlled trials and observational studies of antiepileptic drugs","abstractText":"Epilepsy is a common disorder which affects about 3-4% of the populations over a lifetime: it often requires long term drug use. Information on the effectiveness and side effects of drugs is provided by various kinds of studies. It is not easy to combine the information from these different sources, as they refer to different groups of people with epilepsy. For example, response rates for an anti-epileptic drug, (gabapentin) range from 18% in controlled trials to 65% in studies which observed patients before and after they received the drug.\n\nIn order to provide reliable summaries across a variety of studies, methods to take into account the difference between patients and studies must be developed. Scientists are studying the issues using a variety of methods. This study concentrates on assessing treatments and side effects and models for the association between how well patients respond in clinical trials, and patients decisions to enter studies.\n\nThis research is important for doctors treating people with epilepsy, for managers within the National Health Service, and for scientists working in evidence-based medicine and evidence -based policy. The statistical methods can be used in health, social science and education. \n\nSummaries of the results about anti-epileptic drugs will be made available through self-help groups, newsletters, doctors and specialist nurses. Summary information with also be available on the web, in association with the Department of Neurological Science at the University of Liverpool.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400642","grantId":"G0400642","fundValue":"198554","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Luise Hutton","coPersons":["John  Copas","Anthony Guy Marson"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
