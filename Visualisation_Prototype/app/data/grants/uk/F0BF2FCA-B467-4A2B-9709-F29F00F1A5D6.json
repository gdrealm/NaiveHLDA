Yet, both realizing and understanding collective states of strongly correlated matter remain major scientific challenges. Among the unresolved puzzles, low-dimensional fermionic quantum systems play a pivotal role, because a number of intriguing effects such as high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates, the quantum Hall effect, and Luttinger liquid behaviour are intimately linked to reduced dimensionality. Of particular current interest is the non-equilibrium dynamics of these many-body systems. The understanding of emergent states far from equilibrium constitutes one of the grand challenges in Physics and is of great importance for applications, e.g. for the transport of energy or information in the next generation of quantum devices and in quantum computing. A major difficulty to be overcome is that dynamical experiments in the solid state often are overwhelmed by the strong coupling to the environment and the resulting decoherence destroys the genuine quantum dynamics already on short time scales. \nIn recent years, it has become possible to assemble strongly correlated quantum many-body systems in a bottom-up approach using ultracold atomic quantum gases. This novel approach has created the purest and most widely tunable &quot;materials&quot;, in which quantum many-body physics can be studied. They are considered ideal candidates for both unravelling the mysteries of observed, but not yet understood, effects in the solid state and for realizing completely new quantum phases, very much in the sense of Feynman's concept of a &quot;quantum simulator&quot;. Perhaps most importantly, cold atomic gases provide an ideal testing ground for non-equilibrium evolution because the tuneability is very rapid compared to the typical energy/time scales of the system and the dynamics remains coherent for long times by virtue of their weak coupling to the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J014885/1","grantId":"EP/J014885/1","fundValue":"203700","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  My results on non equilibrium dynamics have been used by researchers worldwide in their own research to improve our understanding of the behaviour of isolated many-particle quantum systems.

This is of relevance to experiments on trapped, ultra-cold atoms. A key achievement was the development of a new method in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 257203 (2013) to study the time evolution of so-called quantum integrable systems (these are systems characterized by a very large number of conserved quantities, and they have been (approximately) realized in systems of trapped, ultra-cold atoms) out of equilibrium. Over the last year this method has been applied by a number of groups worldwide. Together with my post-doc Maurizio Fagotti I obtained a new and detailed understanding of how the presence of conservation laws affects out of equilibirum time evolution for a particular example, the quantum Ising chain (Phys. Rev. B 87, 245107 (2013)). The ideas and concepts we introduced have since been accepted as basic principles by the community. Some of my finding have already been taken up and developed further by research groups in Europe. Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
