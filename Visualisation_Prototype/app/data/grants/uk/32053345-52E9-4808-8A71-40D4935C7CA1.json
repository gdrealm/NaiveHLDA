A Creative Development Grant from the Scottish Arts Council has already been awarded to contribute to associated material costs towards the development of new research work within this area. The Research Leave will allow further essential work in this area to continue and realise this research as a commissioned Artwork, following a national short listing, for 'The Cutting Edge', Scotland's Contemporary Crafts exhibition. The exhibition will tour nationally throughout the UK, and has the potential to tour internationally.\\n\\nResearch Aims:\\n\\nTo develop a range of new and innovative woven fabric which exploits coloured lighting effects in conjunction with unusual yarn types, optical fibre and laser cutting techniques;\\n\\nTo create novel time-based aesthetics which challenge our perceptions of art and technology through creative, artistic development; \\n\\nTo produce an artwork which addresses the possibility of programmable colour and lighting effects and which successfully humanizes and imaginatively exploits these technologies to bring about a heightened visual awareness.\\n\\nPotential Applications and Benefits:\\nThe research outcome will be of interest not only to artists but more product led designers, particularly within the field of textiles and within lighting design including academics involved in the development of multidisciplinary practiced-based design research. It will also be of benefit to those interested in all aspects of craft and design, collectors of crafts, pupils studying craft, technology and design and their teachers, art students and members of specific craft societies as well as the general public. It is anticipated that the research will inform and educate a greater awareness within this field and further inspire new development within contemporary craft practice and design.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E001327/1","grantId":"AH/E001327/1","fundValue":"21196","fundStart":"2006-11-03","fundEnd":"2007-02-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Elizabeth  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
