{"id":"7F7E5175-59B7-434D-AFD0-F6C601A0D88A","title":"Nanoparticulate chemotherapeutic drug transporters for delivery across the blood-brain barrier","abstractText":"This project is aimed towards the preparation and evaluation of polymer-based nanoparticulate vehicles that have an increased lifetime in the circulatory system and facilitate drug delivery (through the blood-brain barrier) to the brain, via specific transport mechanisms. The study will be centred on biodegradable nanoparticles that possess moderate-hydrophilic surfaces and that can be loaded with chemotherapeutic agents known to be active in a range of the central nervous system (CNS) diseases, but normally limited by the blood-brain barrier in reaching their site of action. This work will generate a range of well-characterised nano-formulations whose performance and toxicity will be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The results generated by this study are expected to bring a significant contribution to the process of developing effective drug targeting technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011865/1","grantId":"BB/F011865/1","fundValue":"449616","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eugen  Barbu","coPersons":["Geoffrey John Pilkington","Dariusz  Gorecki","J  Tsibouklis"],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":" This project was aimed towards the preparation and evaluation of polymer-based nanoparticulate vehicles that can permeate through the blood-brain barrier and facilitate drug delivery to the brain. The study was centred on biocompatible nanoparticles that can be loaded with fluorescent markers and chemotherapeutic agents known to be active in a range of diseases of the central nervous system, but their transport is prevented by the blood-brain barrier. This work generated a range of well-characterised nanomaterials that show high potential for delivering drugs into the brain. The results generated by this study are expected to contribute towards the development of effective technologies for the delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain.
