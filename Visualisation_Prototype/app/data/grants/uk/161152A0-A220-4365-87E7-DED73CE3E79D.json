{"id":"161152A0-A220-4365-87E7-DED73CE3E79D","title":"The Big Society, Localism &amp; Housing Policy","abstractText":"<p>The Big Society and localism have become buzz words since the formation of the coalition government in 2010, and their influence can already be seen in housing policy and practice in the UK. This varies, however, depending on how devolved administrations and local authorities use their powers and budgets. <br /><br />Devolving power downwards may therefore lead to greater divergence in housing policy than we have seen under devolution so far. A key aim of this ESRC funded seminar series is therefore to understand the varied geographical impact of these ideas. The audience will learn about, and exchange ideas relating to, the latest research and theories about the role of housing in new planning and Big Society policy agendas, and their impacts on communities throughout the UK. The seminars which will be held in Sheffield, Belfast and St Andrews during 2013-14 will seek to benefit policymakers and practitioners and to disseminate findings. They offer an opportunity to extend existing working relationships and to establish new ones.<br /><br />The event brings together leading scholars at the cutting edge of research to explore the latest issues and debates in the emerging fields of housing, localism and the Big Society across the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J021172/1","grantId":"ES/J021172/1","fundValue":"18095","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kim  McKee","coPersons":["Jenny  Muir","David Frederick Clapham","Edward Terence Ferrari","Duncan  Maclennan","John  Flint"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
