{"id":"6A808DFF-717F-4351-82C9-2D73107BAF33","title":"Structure/function of HGF/SF and MET","abstractText":"The most important cause of death in patients with cancer is the migration of cancer cells away from the primary tumour and the emergence of secondary tumours at distance sites in the body, a process called metastasis. At present there are very few effective treatments for metastatic cancer but this situation is bound to change in the coming years because the key signals that cause cancer cells to migrate are now known and the in depth study of these molecules will lead to new therapies. In this project we aim to determine the structure of HGF/SF and MET, two proteins critical for initiating the migration of cancer cells. We have carried out the background work necessary for this work and are confident that we can achieve the objective proposed and use this knowledge in order to contribute to the development of new treatments for metastatic cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800025","grantId":"G0800025","fundValue":"466173","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ermanno  Gherardi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
