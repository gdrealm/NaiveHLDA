Out of the readily available &quot;sea of information&quot;, unfortunately, some sources potentially important to decision-making have so far remained largely untapped. The UrbanData2Decide project therefore aims to extract and process information from two rich sources, namely public social media and open data libraries. This information, combined with advice from expert panels, will support local governments towards a holistic, sustainable and well-founded decision-making process which takes into account the views and perspectives of all relevant stakeholders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M010058/1","grantId":"ES/M010058/1","fundValue":"225680","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Bright","coPersons":["Tom  Heath","Stefano  De Sabbata"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
