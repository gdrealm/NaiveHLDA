Research suggests that inequalities over the life course, especially those related to the gender division of labour, continue into old age to influence need, capacity, and desire to extend working life. But the picture is complicated, with evidence that income interacts with work-family life history to influence working beyond state pension age. The ESRC study will examine:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The relationship between individualsâ€™ lifetime work and family history and working beyond state pension age</li> \n <li>How income interacts with work-family life history to influence the likelihood that an individual works beyond state pension age.&nbsp; </li>\n</ul> \n<p>Using the first 15 waves of the British Household Panel Study, the study will explore how work-family life history increases or decreases the likelihood of working beyond state pension age and whether life history predicts the number of years or average hours worked after state pension age. It will also examine how work-family history interacts with income to influence extending working life, and whether the relationship is different according to gender. The research will facilitate more effective policy with regard to shaping incentives for working beyond state pension age.</p> \n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F002033/1","grantId":"ES/F002033/1","fundValue":"69699","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Naomi Lisle Finch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
