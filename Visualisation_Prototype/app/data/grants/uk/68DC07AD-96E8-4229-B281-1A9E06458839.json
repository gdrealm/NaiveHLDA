According to a recent study, workers in the United Kingdom suffer high levels of depression than those anywhere else in Europe. The survey found that 1 in 10 employees had taken time off at some point in their working lives because of depression problems. Novel strategies for tackling the problem of depression and preventing suicides are needed. We believe that new emerging technologies, in particular mobile ones, together with the possibility of mining large amount of data in real-time can help to tackle this problem in new and more effective ways. \n\nExisting interview-based studies have shown that depression is significantly associated with a marked decline of physical activity. The goal of this project is to investigate how mobile phones can be used to collect and analyse mobility patterns of individuals in order to understand how mental health problems affect their daily routines and behaviour and how potential changes can be automatically detected. In particular, mobility patterns and levels of activity can be quantitatively measured by means of mobile phones, exploiting the GPS receiver and the accelerometers embedded in the devices. The data can be extremely helpful to understand the behaviour of a depressed person, and in particular, to detect potential changes in his or her behaviour, which might be linked to a worsening depressive state. By monitoring this information in real-time, health officers and charity workers might intervene by means of digital behaviour intervention delivered through mobile phones or by means of traditional methods such as by inviting the person for a meeting or by calling him or her by phone.\n\nIn order to support these novel applications, it is necessary to build mathematical tools for analysing the mobility traces in real-time for the detection of gradual or sudden changes related to the emotional states of the individual. More specifically, we plan to devise analytical techniques for studying the relationships between human mobility patterns and emotional states. We plan to use existing datasets of human mobility and to collect data by means of a smartphone application distributed to people affected by depression. This can be considered as a sort of pilot study for a wider deployment of these technologies and it will provide a sound theoretical basis for further studies in this area. Finally, a key aspect of the proposed research work is the implementation of mechanisms for preserving the privacy of the individuals involved in the study.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L006340/1","grantId":"EP/L006340/1","fundValue":"94821","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-05-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is still in progress (it started 6 months ago).

The application is now available for download on the GooglePlay website: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nsds.moodtraces&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_GB\n\nWe have also interacted with Prof. Rory O'Connor at the University of Glasgow and Dr. Paul Patterson for the definition of the questionnaires used in the data collection application.\n\nWe have identified some interesting research questions related to causality and analysis of mobility traces, which was not present in the original grant proposal. We believe that this will be a very interesting research thread in the project. The causality versus correlation question is indeed a fundamental aspect of the proposed research work. In fact, if we are able to detect causality in the traces, we might be able to infer a set of potential causes of depressive states, which might be very helpful for researchers and health officers.\n\nIn order to study the presence of a correlation between the mobility trace and the emotional state of an individual, we carried out a preliminary study exploiting the StudentLife dataset, collected from a single class of 48 students during a 10 weeks term at Dartmouth College using Android phones. StudentLife includes information about locations, stress and depression levels for each participant. Location data are collected at periodic time interval exploiting phone sensors (e.g., GPS and WiFi), stress levels are inferred from the answers to the surveys that are periodically administered to the participants by phone, whereas depression levels are obtained from the answers to the surveys that are administered only at the start and end of the term. Exploiting this information, we performed a preliminary study to understand the correlation between mobility traces and stress levels of individuals. The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible to derive some features from the mobility trace of an individual (e.g., total distance covered, coverage area, etc.) that can tell something about the stress level of that individual. First of all, we pre-processed the location data of each student using a clustering approach in order to identify when the student was moving and when he/she was still in a significant place. For each stress report, we used the obtained mobility traces to derive some mobility metrics associated to a time interval of some hours that precedes the stress report. We considered the following mobility metrics associated to that time interval: total distance covered, gyration (a coverage measure), and variance of the movements from one place to another.\n\nOur preliminary study shows that there is a correlation between the considered mobility metrics and the stress reports. When we consider the whole population of students, this correlation is not very strong. However, if we limit our study to the population of students experiencing a moderate or severe depression, such a correlation becomes significant. We consider other types of population obtained by clustering the users with respect to their personality - indeed StudentLife contains also the answers to standard surveys that are used for personality evaluation. The results show that for some personality traits the correlation between the considered mobility metrics and the stress levels is rather high. We plan to perform a similar analysis on the traces we are going to collect through MoodTraces. We believe that the proposed work can have a considerable societal impact, because it might lead to novel and more effective ways of providing prompt support and behaviour interventions for dealing with depression and preventing suicides. The impact will also be economic, given the non-negligible loss of productivity due to depression in the UK and the cost of providing medical and psychological help to patients. \n\nWith respect to the academic impact, we believe that the outputs in the area of data mining of mobility traces might be of strong interest for both computer scientists and social scientists, especially with respect to the techniques for extracting causality relationships from the data.
