These analyses will inform case studies of eight successful secondary schools (four in each country) across diversified school populations in different socio-economic contexts. Pupil surveys will also be conducted to explore their views on the impact of changes (or no change) in their schools and classrooms on their motivation to learn and achieve. The research will make a distinctive contribution to knowledge of how mandated reforms are enacted in schools for the improvement of pupil outcomes. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J017035/1","grantId":"ES/J017035/1","fundValue":"77129","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Qing  Gu","coPersons":["Christopher  Day"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" This project investigated how 'successful' secondary school principals in England and Hong Kong -leading schools in different socioeconomic contexts - enact government policies.\n\nIn the research, &quot;success&quot; defined as those schools that had shown sustained improvement in student academic outcomes over time (measured by pupil progress and attainment outcomes between 2003 and 2012) and as measured by national inspection results. The research identified principles and practices of effective leadership and educational practice in these schools and classrooms in the context of externally generated reforms; and through these, extend knowledge of how some school leaders and teachers are able to successfully maintain the broad educational purposes of learning and teaching in their schools and classrooms in times of change and reform. \n\nWe identified four key findings.\n\nKey Finding 1: Policy enactment is not the primary focus of successful principals' work. It is part of, not an addition to, their own purposes and processes of school improvement.\n\nIn successful schools in our research, policies are conceptualised as 'opportunities' and resources that leaders weave into the processes of school improvement to ensure that the policies serve their longer term, broad educational values. This is in contrast to Ball et al.'s (2011) findings in so-called, 'normal' schools. \n\nKey Finding 2: Sustained school improvement is built through the synergistic effects of the combination and accumulation of a number of leadership strategies that are related to the principals' judgements about what works in their particular school context.\n\nUsing structural equation modelling to analyse surveys of successful principals and their senior and middle leaders, complemented by case studies, the research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly promote improvement over time through tailoring their leadership strategies to their particular school contexts and to the improvement trajectories of their schools. The combinations and accumulations of these strategies are 'layered' within and across school development phases through which improvements in the school's work, culture and achievements are progressively embedded. \n\nKey Finding 3: Successful schools are driven by shared educational values and standards. Strategically mediating, integrating and embedding policies in ways that secure consistency and coherence with these values and standards is the key.\n\nThe connections made by successful school leaders between their values and how they position themselves (and their organisation) in relation to external policy are in contrast to the observation in so-called 'normal' schools where &quot;there is a dearth of values-talk in our data&quot; (Ball et al., 2012: 10). Related to this is that we also found a high level of consistency in perceptions of what constitutes of and contributes to quality and improvement between principals and their senior and middle leaders. \n\nKey Finding 4: Successful principals express their educational values and monitor standards through values-aligned staffing structures.\n\nSuccessful principals in our research re-designed systems and staffing structures in correspondence with the values that direct their schools' improvement agenda. They create new roles and responsibilities, building high performance middle and senior leadership with high levels of responsibility and clear lines of accountability. We organised an end-of-project testing seminar in England and Hong Kong involving experts from the academic community alongside school leaders and teachers from the case study schools and government agencies. We have also presented key findings in forms of papers and symposiums at key national and international academic conferences. These dissemination events have enabled us to verify the authority of the research findings and also provided us with evidence to envisage how our research outcomes might be taken forward:\n\n1) By academics: Our research has provided sound evidence to the academic community which suggests that more educational research needs to focus on successful schools and their leaders that do the right thing and do it right within the international contexts of 'high stakes' testing environments. \n\n2) By teachers, school leaders and their professional associations: The research- informed examples and accounts of how government reforms (mandatory and non-mandatory) are received and mediated by principals, senior and middle leaders in improved and effective schools serving communities of contrasting socio-economic advantage will be of direct relevance to the daily work of many schools and their leaders and teachers.
