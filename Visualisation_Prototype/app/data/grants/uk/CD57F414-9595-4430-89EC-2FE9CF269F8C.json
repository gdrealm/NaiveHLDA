{"id":"CD57F414-9595-4430-89EC-2FE9CF269F8C","title":"A Climatology of Atmospheric Iron Inputs to the Atlantic Ocean","abstractText":"Desert dust can be picked up by strong winds and transported great distances, sometimes thousands of kilometres, through the atmosphere. This process has some interesting effects on the climate of our planet. Iron makes up a small portion of the dust and this element is often in short supply for the plants (phytoplankton) that live in the ocean. Wind-blown dust can be an important source of iron to these organisms in some ocean regions and so dust supply can be linked to phytoplankton growth and the uptake of carbon from the atmosphere that this causes. While in the atmosphere, dust also alters the way that radiation is absorbed or reflect by the planet. It is therefore important to include dust transport in models of the Earth's climate system, but our current understanding of this transport is rather poor. One particular difficulty is the lack of measurements available to help constrain and develop such models. Some long-term monitoring sites provide information on changes in dust transport over time, but they are too few and too widely spaced to give adequate information on spatial variability. The UEA group has recently carried out 10 long-transect crossings of the Atlantic Ocean, sampling the atmosphere for the iron content of aerosol and rain. This is a unique dataset and will allow us to assess the atmospheric input of iron to the Atlantic directly, based on field data, for the first time. The results of our study will be shared directly with modellers at the Hadley Centre and the QUEST Earth System Science programme, so that we can ensure that the benefit of this extra information is passed directly to the modelling community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G000239/1","grantId":"NE/G000239/1","fundValue":"49541","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander Roberts Baker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Desert dust can be picked up by strong winds and transported great distances, sometimes thousands of kilometres, through the atmosphere.

One particular difficulty is the lack of measurements available to help constrain and develop such models. Some long-term monitoring sites provide information on changes in dust transport over time, but they are too few and too widely spaced to give adequate information on spatial variability. \n\nThe UEA group carried out 10 long-transect crossings of the Atlantic Ocean between the years 2000 and 2005, sampling the atmosphere for the iron content of aerosol and rain. This is a unique dataset and allows us to assess the atmospheric input of iron to the Atlantic directly, based on field data, for the first time.\n\nThe results of our study were compared directly to the results of three separate dust transport models. This comparison showed that all of the models performed well for some of the substances that we measured, in some parts of the Atlantic, but none could reproduce all of the measurements over the whole Atlantic. In one case the lack of agreement between observations and model was due to an over-estimation of rainfall in the model. Development of models that simulate the atmospheric transport of dust and its direct and indirect impact on the Earth System is on-going. Comparison of our results to existing models has helped to highlight areas where models can be improved. The observational database established during our project will continue to be useful resource for the validation of such models in the future. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
