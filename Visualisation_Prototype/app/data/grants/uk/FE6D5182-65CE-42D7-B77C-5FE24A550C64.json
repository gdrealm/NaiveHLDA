The sources prove the use of Western Yiddish in a remote rural Jewish community in Northwest Germany as late as in the early 20th century. They consist of words-list and armature plays, which show not only isolated words but phonological, morphological and syntactical features in context. The project aims a) to edit and analyse these sources and b) to present the sociolinguistic circumstances which allowed the variety to survive well into the 20th century.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112667/1","grantId":"112667/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Gertrud  Reershemius","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Aston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
