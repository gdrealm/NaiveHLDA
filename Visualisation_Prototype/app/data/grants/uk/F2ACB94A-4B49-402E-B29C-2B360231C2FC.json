However, this model lacks the dynamic motion which represents one of the physiological functions of the\nsmall intestine (peristalsis). In our research, we investigate the possible similarity between the static Caco-2 cell model and\nthe dynamic intestine by creating a dynamic in vitro environment using MICA technology. In order to obtain the dynamic\ncells environment, MICA Biosystems' technology was applied to the Caco-2 cell line. With this technology it is possible to\ninteract, by the application of an external magnetic field, with the magnetic core nanoparticles specifically attached on the\ncells membrane, and produce deformations on the membrane which mimic a dynamic cell in vivo environment e.g. in the\ncase of the gut similar to peristaltic contractions. Our results to date have shown that MICA' technology improves the\nabsorption of the selected drugs, and their permeability is more similar to that found in the human intestine. Our data\nsuggests that MICA' technology applied to Caco-2 drug permeability assay could be used to better predict, using in vitro\nassays, the in vivo human drug absorption rates. This feasibility study will enable us to test rigorously against the gold\nstandards and generate a new assay for the pharmaceutical market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506862/1","grantId":"EP/M506862/1","fundValue":"46019","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil D Telling","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
