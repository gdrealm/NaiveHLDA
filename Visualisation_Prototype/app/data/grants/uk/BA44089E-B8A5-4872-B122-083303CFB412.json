{"id":"BA44089E-B8A5-4872-B122-083303CFB412","title":"Staging Places: The Theatre of Thomas Heywood","abstractText":"My project is the completion of a monograph called 'Staging Places: The Theatre of Thomas Heywood'. Heywood was a prolific writer who worked in almost every genre, and his career stretched from the mid 1590s to the very eve of the civil war. There has not been a full-length study of his work for more than seventy years.\n\nThe first part of the book addresses the precision with which Heywood evoked the spaces of the early modern city. I show that the topographical specificity with which Heywood staged the streets and houses of London in 1599 was unprecedented in English drama, although it set the trend for plays about London for the following half century. I go on to show how Heywood developed this technique to address provincial and indeed domestic spaces.\n\nThe second part of the book, likewise, explores the way in which Heywood negotiated the texts of antiquity to produce scripts for performance in the commercial playhouses of his own day. Alone amongst his contemporaries, Heywood effectively translated entire plays by the Roman comic dramatist Plautus; I show that Heywood's understanding of the political, cultural and theatrical contexts within which those plays were produced was at once remarkably sophisticated, and quite unparalleled in the work of his contemporaries. With a detailed reading of his play 'Loves Mistris', I show further that his approach to the works of Apuleius and Ovid was similarly precise. In addition, I demonstrate that his techniques of modernization and anglicization were bold, innovative, and indicative of a most assured theatrical craftsmanship.\n\nIn the third and final section of the book I return to London, but this time to the politically and theologically divided London of the 1630s. During this period Heywood produced six of the last seven pageants with which the city celebrated the inauguration of its lord mayor. By a detailed examination of the archives of the livery companies who commissioned him, I show that Heywood, far from effacing the tensions that beset the guilds and their members, explored those tensions in the shows he wrote, contributing a combative intervention to the debates that were becoming increasingly intense as the civil war approached.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D500648/1","grantId":"AH/D500648/1","fundValue":"16884","fundStart":"2007-01-02","fundEnd":"2007-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Rowland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
