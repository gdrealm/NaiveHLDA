{"id":"DC27DD18-8D63-4BC2-B54C-88EFCA994F98","title":"Battlegrounds of Memory and Justice","abstractText":"Dynamics of Memories was established as an interdisciplinary research cluster of Lancaster University's Institute for Advanced Studies in 2008. The group's main aim is to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries in the study of the ways collective, cultural and social memories participate in the processes of dealing with a past of war and conflict, and the ways this inflects individual, national, regional and local identities. The group is shaped by a three-tiered structure of nine core members, and a number of associate and external partners. Our group now seeks to network extensively with a view to establish itself as a Research Centre for the Study of Memory in relation with war and conflict in the English North West. This centre would liaise closely with two recently-established centres (London and Warwick), as well as the editors of the new academic journal, Memory Studies, launched in 2008.\\nThe practical ways in which societies remember or reconstruct a past of which conflict, repression or war is central to our group. To study this, we have held a number of workshops (Memory and History, Dynamics of Memories, Memory and Justice, War, Poverty and Memory and The Uses of Memory in the Rise of Right-wing Extremism) and a seminar series. We organized this in 2008-10 with funds awarded from the Higher European Research Authority's Networking Scheme and Lancaster University. The group is currently strengthening its regional links with academics, museums, local NGOs, community officers and local branches of grassroots organisations and political parties. \\nFurthering our network's activities will enable us to elucidate answers to theories that claim that memory is always individual. We will trace the processes between remembering and reconstructing memories in the social and political arena of various countries, addressing how memories become history when one segment of society wins over the ideological battle for identity. Thus, we will examine the roles played by cultural memories in the construction of a narrative that serves national, local or group identity. Our approaches will trace the transition between remembering and reconstructing memories or memorials in order to imagine or invent a sense of communal purpose, in the sense of those terms given by Benedict Anderson (1992) and Terence Ranger and Eric Hobsbawm (1983).\\nIn order to consolidate our work, and lay the bases for future collaborations, we seek funds to hold three workshops and a series of seminars during 2011-12. For these, we will invite contribution and participation from local and international academics and experts in the field, as well grassroots and other professional organizations working on social and political issues related to memorialisation of conflict, judicial impunity and transitional or restorative justice.\\nThe relevance of our topic is clearly demonstrated by the upsurge in studies on issues related to the uses of collective memory that often surface in the media. While post-conflict communities may be a more obvious presence, this is by no means restricted to those groups, as the long-lasting effects of social traumas are often invoked in a variety of contexts. \\nBesides the actuality of Holocaust studies, the currency of memory studies can be seen in, for example, the BBC's use of personal memories in the reconstruction of World War II or the invocation of the Vietnam War in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, the access of working-class individuals, women and minorities to mainstream political life has also meant that autobiographies, memoirs and testimonies can no longer be excluded from a society's make up.\\nBecause of the obvious social, historical and political impact of our studies, there will be many opportunities in which to disseminate our work in the various forums where these issues have acquired a sense of urgency, especially, but not only, regarding human rights' violations and transitional justice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I021981/1","grantId":"AH/I021981/1","fundValue":"24047","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mercedes  Maroto Camino","coPersons":["David  Sugarman"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
