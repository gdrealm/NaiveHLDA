{"id":"54F753A6-8AF2-4179-928A-B057FBFEE529","title":"Our Criminal Past: Caring for the Future","abstractText":"'Our Criminal Past' aims to create a new interdisciplinary research network of UK-based scholars working in the field of the criminal, legal and penal history of Britain. The network will uniquely bring these scholars together with archivists and those engaged in an educational and heritage capacity in museums and prisons over a series of seminars, sustained through an web-based network resource. It aims to bring together scholars, researchers and heritage and penal stakeholders who are invested (academically and/or professionally) in 'Our Criminal Past'. However, this network is innovative in that its focus will be to concentrate on the future of our criminal past. Thus 'Caring for the Future' of the history of crime is fundamental to the network discussions, collaborations and outputs, both during the scope of the funding bid, and in the future. \n\nThe creation of the network is in recognition of the growing importance of 'Our Criminal Past' not only to academics but also to archives, heritage professionals, educationalists and other in the wider community who have an investment in how 'Our Criminal Past' is to be preserved, presented and transmitted. Through the sharing of good practice, the bringing together of expertise, this network will provide both innovation and value for money in its potential for strategic research planning and future collaboration. \n\nThe network will explore three inter-related themes: Digitisation, New Social Media and the Future of Our Criminal Past; Educating Historians of Crime: Classroom, Archive, Community: Representing Penal Histories: Displaying and Narrating the Criminal Past. Our intention is to create a dynamic network by developing a website, holding three one-day seminar/workshops and creating and maintaining a database of crime and penal history collections. \n\nThe aim is to enable a forum for discussion and debate about future research directions, the sustainability of research in relation to new technology and funding-streams; the role of individuals, communities and institutions in shaping and preserving our criminal past. By bringing together academics from a range of disciplines (history, criminology, education, tourism, cultural studies) with archivists, educationalists, librarians, heritage practitioners, the network and the activities will provide a forum from which to explore ideas that could lead to new projects in and resources for the history of crime. The themes have been identified as important areas of cross and multidisciplinary interest in terms of existing, current and future research and as themes that have contemporary and cultural significance beyond the academy. \n\nThe first theme will explore technological developments which are increasingly impacting on histories of crime. As well as exploring the priorities and futures of digitisation and role of new social media (such as blogs, facebook, twitter) it will consider the priorities and realities of funding the preservation and presentation of histories of crime. The second theme addresses the history of crime as an educational resource, recognising that education, in schools, in universities, in museums and archives and in penal institutions, is a powerful medium with the potential to influence the future shape of communities and their institutions. The third theme explores the specific presentation of crime history in museums, seeking to develop dialogues on the variation in practice and policy in cultural institutions. As academics involved in the research and publication of the history of crime we are uniquely placed to address these themes in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. The network, through the seminar days and website, will develop a broad intercultural dialogue on the preservation and presentation of histories of crime and its future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005766/1","grantId":"AH/K005766/1","fundValue":"24630","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This is ongoing. At present the Our Criminal Past network has fostered has achieved impact in the following ways:\n1. It has brought together academics, archivists, heritage professionals, educationalists and the public in shared discussions. \n2. It has done this both through a series of events, but also through maintaing a presence on social media (website www.ourcriminalpast.ac.uk; twitter-feed: @ourcriminalpast). Social media has generated interested beyond the normal academic networks. This is particularly demonstrated in our involvement with the CaP network (Crime and Punishments Collections) and with the Schools History Project, and Ben Walsh of the HEA. At present these impacts are ongoing. We would aim to extent our reach and impact through follow-funding which would enable us to provide events and activities which might further involve non-academic audiences.

We have been pleased to note the significant interest from and enhanced knowledge exchange with, archivists and heritage professionals. Meetings and collaboration between academics and such professionals have already arisen out of the events. For example, the PI attended a CaP (Crime and Punishments Collections) meeting in March 2014. The CI has submitted a short article on the history of prison closures to the Prison Service Journal (see publications). The CI and PI were also invited to give a paper to teachers and educationalists at the fringe session of the Schools History Project Conference at Leeds Trinity University in July 2014 (see Engagement Activities). Key areas of interest are in the further and deepening collaboration between higher education and schools education (see below); the place and role of social media, both in academic practice, but also in the dissemination of crime history research; the issue of ethics in relation to some of that dissemination. The PI and CI are currently involved in the planning for an event to be called the Canterbury Heritage Symposium, which will take place early in 2015. The event will bring together academics with museum and heritage practitioners to discuss the future of the site of the former Canterbury prison. The event will focus on the importance of conserving and researching the history of the prison and ensuring that this is represented both to students and the wider community. Dr Maryse Tennant, a network member, is the main organiser and approached Our Criminal Past: Caring for the Future, to be involved in the planning and delivery of the event. The PI and CI have also had discussions with Ben Walsh, the deputy president of the HEA, about a future event involving schools, academics and archivists, to share resources and to develop knowledge exchange and public engagement.
