This support enabled us to (i) develop techniques for the isolation of mutants aberrant in basic plant processes - the first step to identify the genetic basis of biological processes (ii) optimise a technique for genetic engineering by 'gene targeting' - a precision tool not possible in any other plant (iii) initiate a programme of gene discovery that has culminated in the complete sequencing of the Physcomitrella genome by an international consortium. Now we shall establish the final tool to enable the rapid and routine identification of genes that underlie abnormal mutants: the integration of the Physcomitrella genome sequence with its genetic linkage map. This will enable the international and UK plant science community to extract maximum value from the newly released Physcomitrella genome through the application of 'comparative functional genomics' - a BBSRC research priority. The value of comparative studies: Our understanding of complex biological processes has been revolutionised by genetic experiments conducted using a small number of well characterised model organisms. In the Animal Kingdom, the study of the nematode worm, the fruit fly, the zebra fish and the mouse allows analysis of animal development across a wide evolutionary spectrum encompassing increasing levels of complexity. Such wide comparative analysis enables us to discern the evolutionary processes that have generated these disparate creatures, and the ways in which essentially similar genes have been differently utilised in the course of evolution. Within the Plant Kingdom, the comparable model organisms that allow a similarly wide evolutionary perspective to be achieved are the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, and the moss, Physcomitrella patens. Model organisms are chosen for their experimental tractability. All these organisms have had their whole genome sequences determined. All can be manipulated by the introduction of foreign DNA: in the case of the mouse and the moss, foreign DNA can be introduced to specific sites within their genomes with exquisite precision. In all these organisms, random mutations can be induced that cause radical defects in their normal developmental processes. By identifying the genes in which such mutations have occurred, we identify the genes that normally regulate these processes. This identification is possible only where the sequenced genome is supported by a 'genetic linkage map': a representation of the genome based on the inheritance of large numbers of mutations in a large population. Mutations that lie in adjacent sections of the genome are typically inherited together, and are said to be 'genetically linked'. A gene that is responsible for a mutant trait can be isolated if that trait is co-inherited (genetically linked) with neighbouring, known 'genetic markers' - typically lengths of DNA whose sequence is known. This potent experimental approach allows the functional identification of genes without prior knowledge of their sequence. Such an approach is routine in Arabidopsis. This proposal will make it routine in Physcomitrella and accessible to all plant scientists. Physcomitrella is not a flowering plant. It is a member of the earliest group of land plants - the bryophytes - an ancient and biodiverse group which emerged ca. 300 million years before the flowering plants. It therefore represents an ancestral reference by which divergence in plant gene structure and function has occurred. It also provides insights into 'primitive' plant traits such as enhanced dehydration tolerance (essential for a successful colonisation of the land) and the origins of plant multicellularity, that retain their value for future plant improvement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F001797/1","grantId":"BB/F001797/1","fundValue":"366185","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We developed the first genetic linkage map for the model bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. This was achieved using a combination of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers, and we published the first iteration of this map, including a proof of concept mapping of a Physcomitrella gene, in The Plant Journal in 2008 (Kamisugi et al., (2008) Plant J: 56: 855-866).\n\nSubsequently, the mapping population developed in this project has been used in collaboration with the United States DoE Joint Genome Institute and the University of Freiburg to generate a high-density SNP-based linkage map that underpins the chromosome scale (Version3) Physcomitrella genome assembly. This is now the best characterised and annotated plant gennome assembly after Arabidopsis, and support the selection by JGI of Physcomitrella as a flagship model organism for comparative functional genomics. We are currently preparing a manuscript describing this genome assembly for publication.\n\nWe have exploited the GoldenGate SNP genotyping platform developed by JGI to implement the first forward genetic strategy for the identification of genes underpinning mutant phenotypes. By analysis of segregants in mapping populations derived from crosses between mutants non responsive to abscisic acid (anr - ABA non-responsive - mutants) we have identified the basis of a mutant designated anr4 as resulting from a point mutation (a CAG&amp;gt;TAG premature termination codon) in a gene encoding a novel modular protein kinase. \n\nFunctional characterisation of this gene is being carried out by a BBSRC-supported graduate student in my laboratory, Sean Stevenson.\n\nThe analysis of anr mutants additionally identified another allele of the anr4 mutant (designated anr7) and a different locus (anr 3) which is currently the subject of ongoing investigation.\n\nInterestingly, homologs of anr 4 are not found in flowering plants, but are present in basal lineages (liverworts, mosses, Selaginella). We believe this to be a novel component in the ABA signal transduction pathway that is a feature of plants with a free-living gametophyte generation.\n\nThe ability to conduct forward genetic analyses as well as reverse genetic analysis using the facile gene targeting technology available in Physcomitrella greatly enlarges the genetic toolkit available to researchers wishing to use P. patens in so-called evo-devo studies of plant developmental processes.\n\nIn reverse genetic analyses of the ABA signal transduction pathway, we have found that the ABA response mechanism in the sporophyte generation is highly conserved between moss and flowering plants, through a collaborative analysis of stomatal functions with colleagues at the University of Sheffield. These findings were published in Current Biology in 2011 (Chater et al (2011) Current Biology 21: 1025-1029).\n\nImpacts deriving from this will include a deeper understanding of the evolution of plant gene function, and result in a modified paradigm for the way in which plant stress responses are regulated.

Forward genetic approaches rely on identification of a mutant phenotype, and then identifying the gene by determining its position in the genome through its close linkage with known genetic markers (usually DNA sequence variants) - a process sometimes termed map-based cloning. Reverse genetic analysis involves first identifying a mutant DNA sequence, and then inferring the function of the sequence by analysis of any phenotype resulting from the mutation.\n\nThe moss Physcomitrella patens first came to prominence as a model species for comparative analysis of the evolution of gene function in plants, since it occupies a basal position in the land plant evolutionary lineage. Remarkably, it supports high efficiency gene targeting. The ability to construct mutants in predetermined genetic loci. This enables the functions of genes discovered to regulate plant developmental processes in the model angiosperm, Arabidopsis thaliana, to be probed in a more ancient plant lineage, through undertaking a targeted knockout of the Physcomitrella homolog.\n\nThis is useful, but relies on a priori assumptions of gene function. A philosophically more powerful approach to understanding the functions of genes in moss would be to undertake a Forward genetic strategy. For this to become a reality, the first requirement is the establishment of a densely marked genetic linkage map based on DNA sequence variants. At the time that this investigation commenced, no such linkage map existed.\n\nWe therefore constructed a linkage map based of DNA sequence polymorphisms: initially AFLP and SSR markers, but subsequently single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed in collaboration with researchers in the USA and Germany as a part of the International Physcomitrella Genome Programme. This has now enabled the assembly of the P. patens genome as a series of chromosome scale sequence scaffolds, released in publicly accessible web browsers for use by the scientific community. \n\nWe have additionally utilised this resource to undertake the first forward genetic analysis of a developmental trait in P. patens, the responses to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA enables plants to withstand high levels of dehydration - a crucial trait in simple and ancient organisms like mosses, that lack anatomical adaptations to obtain water from deep in the soil (e.g. roots) and distribute it through the plant body (as in a flowreting plant vascular system). \n\nBy identifying ABA non-responsive mutants, we have been able to map genes underpinning the mutant phenotype within the moss genome and identify a novel protein kinase that transduces the ABA stimulus to suppress growth and enhance the accumulation of stress tolerance proteins and sugars. This kinase is not present in the flowering plants, and appears restricted to species representative of the earliest clades to diverge from the land plant lineage (liverworts, mosses, clubmosses).\n\nThe ability to undertake both forward and reverse genetic analysis in this model moss species massively expands the repertoire of experimental tools available for understanding the basic processes that enabled simple plants to undertake the successful transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial life: a transition that fundamentally altered the planet on which we live. We have identified (among other loci) a novel protein kinase required for the ABA-mediated acquisition of dehydration tolerance that is present in the descendants of the earliest land plants, but absent in the flowering plants that we rely on for food security. Since the ABA signal transduction pathway - from receptors through to executive transcription factors - is largely conserved between flowering plants and bryophytes, we hypothesise that the P. patens ANR kinase interacts with these conserved elements of the pathway but modulates the pathway in ways necessary to maintain the widespread ability of bryophyte vegetative tissues to withstand acute dehydration (and often complete desiccation). \n\nDrought is perhaps the largest cause of crop losses worldwide, and water availability is becoming an important geopolitical factor in driving mass migration, social instability and civil wars. It is a factor that impacts most severely on the developing world in subtropical and arid regions of the globe. Consequently, the generation of crop varieties with enhanced drought tolerance or more efficient water utilisation is a clear and urgent need for ensuring future food - and political -security. \n\nWe cannot afford to pass up opportunities to investigate biological functions that may enhance the ability of crops to survive in marginal environments. It will be important, therefore to determine whether the novel ABA -transducing components of bryophyte genomes could be exploited through transferring them into crops in order to enhance this crucial trait.
