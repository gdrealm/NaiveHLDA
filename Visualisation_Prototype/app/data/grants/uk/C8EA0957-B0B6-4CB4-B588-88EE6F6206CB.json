{"id":"C8EA0957-B0B6-4CB4-B588-88EE6F6206CB","title":"Threshold Regression Models in Dynamic Heterogeneous Panels","abstractText":"<p>The research project proposes the rigorous investigation of nonlinear mechanisms within a dynamic heterogeneous panel setting when the number of time periods is small relative to the number of cross-section units. The relative absence of studies in this area is surprising, considering the well-established literatures on GMM and bias-corrected estimation of linear dynamic panels, and time series regime-switching models. So this project aims to fill this gap by addressing the joint issue as how best to model asymmetric mechanisms and cross-sectional heterogeneity. </p>\n\n<p>This project focuses on threshold regression models in dynamic panels, and advances two alternative methodologies: an extended GMM estimation and an iterative bootstrap-based bias corrected estimation procedure. The proposed framework can be extended in several dimensions including a threshold error correction model in dynamic panels, which is characterised by the common long-run relationship and the regime-dependent short-run dynamics. </p>\n\n<p>The project will develop the associated asymptotic theory and the sub-sampling-based inference for deriving (non-standard) sampling distribution theory. The small sample performance will be evaluated via stochastic simulations. We then apply the proposed techniques to a variety of applications in Economics and Finance, eg testing the validity of alternative theories of the capital structure and redressing the growth convergence literature.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G020825/1","grantId":"ES/G020825/1","fundValue":"66056","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yongcheol  Shin","coPersons":["Viet Anh Dang"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
