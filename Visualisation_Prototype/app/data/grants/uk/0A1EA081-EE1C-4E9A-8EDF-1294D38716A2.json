In order to examine this, 198 children will be assessed, 82 of whom have increased risk of language and literacy difficulties. </p>\n\n<p>These children have already been recruited and tested twice, once at school entry (Time 1) and again six months later (Time 2). They will now be retested at 7-9 years old. All children will be tested on reading comprehension as well at word reading and spelling skills. Time 1 phonological and non-phonological language measures will be used to predict progress. A sub-sample of 80 children will be selected on the basis of performance at Time 1 and will be given additional dynamic measures of phonological and morphological awareness. Longitudinal analysis will help clarify the relationships between phonology, morphology and literacy.</p>\n\n<p>The research will help clarify the role of different language skills in the development of early literacy. Due to the broad range of abilities represented in our sample, the findings should be generalisable to both typically developing children and children with language impairments.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H031936/1","grantId":"ES/H031936/1","fundValue":"76887","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julia Mary Carroll","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
