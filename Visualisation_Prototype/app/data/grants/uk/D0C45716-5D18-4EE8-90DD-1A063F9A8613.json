Current multi-agency policy encourages young people's participation at the level of service use and decision-making. Therefore, this investigation explores young people's perceptions of engagement and participation. This research focuses on multi-agency approaches and experiences in the particular context of UK extended schools. Within this research, both professionals and young people are considered as key agents in constructing multi-agency experiences and outcomes. Attention is given to the extent to which multi-agency approaches affect young people's experiences as well as inter-professional dynamics. This study runs from September 2007 to December 2008 and focuses on 10 extended school sites in the UK through a case study approach. A diverse range of participants is incorporated in order to gain insights into young people's experiences, perceptions and outcomes and to develop awareness of collaborative practices and processes emerging in multi-agency contexts. One-to-one interviews and group interviews will be conducted to include young people, senior strategic leaders, multi-agency co-ordinators and lead professionals, headteachers, frontline multi-agency professionals and teachers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2440","grantId":"RES-000-22-2440","fundValue":"53599","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tracey Lisa Allen","coPersons":["Alma  Harris"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
