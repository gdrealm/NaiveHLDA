Prostate cancer is the most common tumour in Western men.\nChromosomes are the carriers of genetic information in the cell. They are damaged during cancer development. Abnormal chromosomes by the re-joining of damaged chromosome fragments can switch genes on or off abnormally; which play a key role in cancer development. The role of these abnormal chromosomes in prostate cancer is largely unknown. \nWith recent advances in genetic technology, new approaches can be used to detect these genetic defects more efficiently. In this project we are planning to identify systematically the abnormal chromosomes in prostate cancer using a novel approach. The whole genome will be tested to detect these chromosome changes. Genes associated with these abnormal chromosomes will be identified and their clinical significance such as the ability to predict tumour progression will be evaluated in a large series of tumour samples. \nWe hope that we can use the information obtained to predict patient outcome and develop novel forms of treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701163","grantId":"G0701163","fundValue":"300292","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Yong-Jie  Lu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
