{"id":"AF01108E-671B-4721-B99C-1356BA3C6711","title":"Wind Turbine Gust Prediction","abstractText":"Offshore wind power generation is a key component of the UK's commitment to deliver 15% of gross final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. Efforts to meet this target are prompting the design of ever larger turbines in order to capture more energy from the wind. However, as these structures grow taller, they become increasingly vulnerable to violent gusts of wind and other turbulent flow phenomena that are the primary cause of severe turbine damage. Advance warning of such gusts will enable turbine control systems to take preventative action, and so the ability to predict the strength of an oncoming gust is widely regarded within the wind energy industry as being a problem of critical importance.\n\nThis research project will seek to overcome this problem by demonstrating a system that can accurately forecast the velocity profile of an oncoming wind, given only limited spatial measurements from state-of-the-art light detection and ranging (LIDAR) units. This approach will exploit recent interdisciplinary advances in the application of optimal estimation techniques, from the control systems community, to fluid-mechanical systems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The research will draw upon the PI's existing expertise in dynamical estimation of fluid flows and the project results will feed into the host institute's current industrial collaboration with Vestas Wind Systems, who have agreed to provide the data and technical support required to maximise research impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K007386/1","grantId":"EP/K007386/1","fundValue":"98611","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have recently engaged in a research partnership with a LiDAR manufacturer with a view towards technology transfer. They have provided us with real-world data to further validate our approach. We are also in discussions with relevant parties to apply our research in developing an early warning gust detection system for the offshore construction industry. Energy Economic","person":"Bryn Llywelyn Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" The use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instruments offers many potential benefits to the wind energy industry, since they provide wind-speed measurements at locations upstream from turbines. Although much effort has been invested in developing such instruments, the fact remains that they only provide limited spatio-temporal velocity measurements of the wind-field. Moreover, LiDAR measurements only provide the radial (line-of-sight) velocity component of the wind, making it difficult to precisely determine wind magnitude and direction, owing to the so-called `cyclops' dilemma. Motivated by a desire to extract more information from typical LiDAR data, and hence dramatically extend the functionality of such instruments, our research has shown that it is possible to accurately estimate, in a real-time fashion, the entire wind field spanned by two LiDAR beams. This enables us to pinpoint the size, strength and direction of potentially damaging oncoming gusts of wind. This paves the way for reliable gust detection warning systems to offshore construction workers, in addition to accurate wind-field estimates for use in preview turbine pitch control systems, both of which will ultimately reduce the cost of energy to the end consumer. Our research solution is interdisciplinary with combined elements of control systems engineering and fluid mechanics, and has been validated upon high fidelity simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The approach has been shown to be robust to a range of real-world uncertainties such as measurement noise, atmospheric stability and yaw misalignment. Firstly, LiDAR manufacturers can adapt/apply our techniques to extract more information about the wind-field from raw measurements. Secondly, the simplified models of the wind dynamics that we have developed could serve as a starting point for other control systems engineers within the wind energy industry to improve their LiDAR-based preview control systems in terms of capturing more energy from the wind, or reducing the harmful fatigue and extreme loads that are a primary source of costly repairs and maintenance.
