Yet our knowledge of political opinion in each of the 650 constituencies which elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to Westminster is not nearly as clear, mainly because it is too expensive to survey large numbers of citizens in each constituency. This matters because good measures of political opinion in constituencies are necessary to answer fundamental questions about their role in British representative democracy. For example, is there a meaningful link between the behaviour of individual MPs in the House of Commons and political opinion in the constituencies they represent?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project will generate new estimates of public opinion in Westminster constituencies. It will exploit new techniques for estimating public opinion in small areas, combining information from several existing data sources: ESRC-funded national surveys, Census data, and geographic information from the Ordinance Survey. &nbsp;The investigators will first test the performance of these new techniques in British context. They will then use estimates of constituency opinion to investigate the democratic link between individual MPs and their constituencies in Britain on issues from same-sex marriage to Europe.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K003666/1","grantId":"ES/K003666/1","fundValue":"116370","fundStart":"2013-04-27","fundEnd":"2014-10-26","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nick  Vivyan","coPersons":["Chris  Hanretty"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
