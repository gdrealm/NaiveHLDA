The follicles form from a pool of germ cells termed oogonia. During follicle formation, there is a massive wave of germ cell death. Indeed, only around 10% of oognia survive to form follicles in both mice and humans. The regulation of this germ cell death is not understood, although the process is one of the main factors determining the reproductive lifespan of female mammals. \n\nWe have recently obtained results showing that a neurotrophin receptor, TrkB, is involved in this process (Spears et al., 2003). TrkB is a member of a membrane-bound receptor family first discovered in the nervous system. The Trk receptor?s primary role in the nervous system is in the regulation of cell survival: neurons containing one or more of the Trk receptors might require the presence of sufficient concentration of the appropriate ligands (the neurotrophins) to bind to and activate the receptors. We hypothesise that the TrkB receptor and its ligands play a similar role during ovarian follicle formation, and that this is a specific requirement of the germ cells during the period that follicles form. We propose a series of in vivo and culture experiments to investigate our hypothesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400868","grantId":"G0400868","fundValue":"405088","fundStart":"2005-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Norah  Spears","coPersons":["David  Price","Richard  Anderson"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
