The research will investigate several factors, including the perceiver’s familiarity with the person, the person’s behaviour or emotional state, and the situation in which the person is encountered.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the research is expected to demonstrate that person perception - of which categorisation is one part - is a dynamic, integrative process designed to provide the best “fit” that allows the perceiver to understand and predict the target person’s behaviour within the context of the ongoing social interaction. As such, the likelihood of categorisation should be strengthened when it provides information that promotes the perceiver’s ability to navigate the interaction, and undermined when it fails to do so.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E001262/1","grantId":"ES/E001262/1","fundValue":"308050","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kimberly  Quinn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
