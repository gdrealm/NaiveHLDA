{"id":"9F1E7DEB-71CC-4140-BFCA-72EE6DCC76C9","title":"The Literary Culture of Analytical Psychology in Relation to German Classical Aesthestics","abstractText":"The monograph that will be produced during this proposed period of research leave will examine the affinities between the concept of individual development in analytical psychology and eighteenth-century notions of wholeness, by means of a study of \nC.G. Jung's, reception of Johann, Wolfgang, Goethe and Friedrich Schiller.\n\nThis research will place analytical psychology in the German-speaking tradition of Goethe and Schiller, with which Jung was very familiar. It will argue that analytical psychology appropriated some of its central notions from Weimar classicism, and that, when seen in its intellectual historical context, the true originality of analytical psychology lies in its reformulation of German classical ideas. The main theme of this research -the contribution of German classical thought to the development of analytical psychology -will impact on research in the history of ideas, intercultural studies, comparative literature, as well as on the history of analytical psychology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E503861/1","grantId":"AH/E503861/1","fundValue":"34747","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bishop","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
