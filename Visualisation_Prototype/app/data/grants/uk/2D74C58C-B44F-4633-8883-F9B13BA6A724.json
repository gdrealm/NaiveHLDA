There are currently no methods offered as alternative that avoid toxicity testing on animals. We have in previous research developed a fish gill cell culture system (FIGCS), which we have shown accurately predicts toxicity of metals to fish. We now propose to adapt FIGCS to replace fish toxicity tests for assessment of safety of medicines to the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000081/1","grantId":"G1000081/1","fundValue":"386285","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Christer  Hogstrand","coPersons":["Peter  Kille","Nicolas Richard Bury"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
