Presentation of results at the University of Cambridge has led to new contacts in the area both in academia (Prof E Briscoe, Cambridge, medical data anonymisation) and industry (Psychology Online Ltd, text-based psychiatric therapy software); these will be the basis of a new collaboration for follow-on funding (see below).\n\nOur enhanced visualisation prototype was showcased at the Barts and Queen Mary Science Festival that took place in Charterhouse Square on 10 July 2012. This public engagement activity allowed us to show the enhanced visualisation of the septal anatomy on CT images to final year secondary school children. Our exhibit was visited by many students who could also listen and visualise their heartbeat signal via the amplification tool designed by Dr. Smeraldi.

In addition to projects listed above, we used the funds to deploy a dedicated communications officer who was funded for six months in order to showcase the impact of our research in EPSRC remit areas and to facilitate its dissemination. Her project focused on capturing some of this activity with the aim of sharing it with a wider audience. She worked closely with principle investigators, and in some cases the industry partners too, in order to gain an understanding of the intended economic and societal impacts, see: http://www.qmul.ac.uk/research. The Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Centre has expressed interest in participating in the new Centre for Intelligent Sensing that academics in the Vision and Multimedia and Vision groups are currently establishing within EECS. This will strengthen our links and provide a platform for new interdisciplinary collaboration. We have also identified a number of projects where we are hoping to collaborate including the new London Cardiovascular Atlas project. The grant has produced a fully annotated and computer-readable dataset of schizophrenia consultations, annotated with clarification, questioning and topic discussion behaviours.
