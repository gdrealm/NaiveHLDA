Significant variation of the heterocyclic core and the nature and position of the substituents will be possible employing what is essentially a single strategy. Although the individual reactions used to construct these cascades are well established, it is the ability to combine them in productive processes that will allow valuable drug-like molecules to be produced. Cascades of C-X bond forming reactions offer great potential for heterocycle synthesis as they the introduction of the functional groups and heteroatom combinations frequently encountered in drug-like molecules. Cascade sequences involving up to four bond forming processes will be used to prepare complex, drug-like molecules in a single step. A significant aspect of the chemistry involves demonstrating that it can be applied to array synthesis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E020232/1","grantId":"EP/E020232/1","fundValue":"148550","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Willis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
