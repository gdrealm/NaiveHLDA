Based on analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a study, which collects data on the health, economic position and quality of life of people aged over 50 and their partners, cross-sectional analysis of this data will establish the main patterns of drinking in later life and the risk factors associated with binge drinking (excessive drinking on one particular day) and drinking in excess of the recommended weekly limits.</p>\n\n<p>The life history data will be used to identify past events and transitions that may be associated with later changes in drinking behaviour. This analysis will investigate the dynamics of the relationship between changes in alcohol consumption and health conditions and how these are associated with life course transitions and past experiences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004131/1","grantId":"ES/K004131/1","fundValue":"155276","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare Margaret Holdsworth","coPersons":["Martin  Frisher","Hynek  Pikhart","Cesar  De Oliveira","Nicola Jane Shelton"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
