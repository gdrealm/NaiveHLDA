{"id":"B1DE004C-8B27-4858-A58C-07A0DE9924FB","title":"Membrane sensory proteins and environmental cues of Enterococcus faecalis","abstractText":"Disease-causing bacteria depend on being able to sense (and respond to) changes in their environment in order to survive and multiply in their host and surroundings. They have evolved specific sensory proteins located in their outer layers (the membrane), and they use the information from these proteins to switch on/off production of virulence and other disease-enhancing factors (e.g. toxins). Almost every pathogenic bacterium possesses these sensory proteins, and the most common group are known as two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs). They consist of a sensor kinase protein (SK, usually located in the membrane) that senses the outside environmental signal, and a partner response regulator protein (RR) located inside the cell that receives the SK information and effects a response /usually a change in the expression of various genes, including those encoding virulence factors. Most bacteria possess multiple TCS pairs, each one tuned in to a different specific environmental cue. For example, the infective bacterium Enterococcus faecalis possesses 17 TCS pairs. This bacterium is an important pathogen of humans -causing endocarditis, urinary tract and bloodstream infections, wound infections and infections of indwelling foreign devices, and is of additional concern because of its readily acquired resistance to a wide range of antibiotics including last-line glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin. Enterococci have now become the second most important agent of hospital-infections. The aim of this proposal is to study the 17 SKs of E. faecalis, in order to understand what environmental signals are being sensed, how the proteins respond to their signal, how signal information is passed across the membrane, and ultimately the atomic structures of the proteins. We will prioritise the 9 SKs that are implicated in virulence, but structural knowledge of any will be highly informative. To achieve these aims, we must study the SKs in their intact forms, complete with membrane spanning portions, and we have the relevant specialist expertise for this. Ultimately, such studies will lead to new strategies to combat infections by E. faecalis that are based on inhibitors of these signal sensing/transduction systems, including those involved in activation of virulence factors and/or host defence systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D001641/1","grantId":"BB/D001641/1","fundValue":"211042","fundStart":"2006-01-04","fundEnd":"2009-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary Kathryn Phillips-Jones","coPersons":["Peter John Henderson"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
