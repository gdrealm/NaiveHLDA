{"id":"6AACD1D1-80BB-4224-9ECD-B50BF269B575","title":"Regulation of the Ipl1p kinase during chromosome bi-orientation in yeast","abstractText":"When cells divide, chromosomes are first copied or replicated. The two identical copies remain associated but become attached to microtubules, special molecular cables that are used to pull the two copies apart during division. It is vital that each of the two daughter cells receive exactly one copy of each chromosome so that they inherit a proper complement of genetic information, and this requires that the two copies attach to microtubules from opposite ends of the cell so that they are pulled apart when the cell divides in two. Should they attach to microtubule from the same end, both copies of the chromosome will be pulled into just one of the daughter cells causing one daughter cell to gain an extra copy of the chromosome while the other daughter cell will lose its copy. Chromosomes do not automatically achieve correct attachment to microtubules and we are interested in the molecular mechanisms that are used to correct chromosome attachment errors before they have a chance to result in chromosome loss or gain events. We are using yeast as a model organism for this research because the cellular components involved are found in all higher cells from yeast to man. However, yeast constitutes a much simpler experimental system in which to investigate fundamental questions such as these. Correction of incorrect microtubule attachments in yeast cells involves an enzyme called Ipl1p that catalyses the addition of phosphate groups to proteins in the kinetochore, a complex of proteins assembled at a specific point on each chromosome and that constitutes the 'handle' onto which the microtubules can grab. When the kinetochores on both copies of a chromosome attach to microtubules from one end of the cell, Ipl1p is activated to add phosphate groups to one kinetochore, causing it to let go of its attached microtubule and allowing it to grab a different microtubule originating from the other end of the cell. This corrects the attachment error, causing the duplicated chromosomal copies to become 'bi-oriented', the state that ensures they are pulled in opposite directions when the cell divides. The objectives of our work are to understand what activates Ipl1p to perform this function, and more importantly, how its activity is then turned off when it has done its job. The most likely way that Ipl1p is regulated is through tension / the pulling force exerted on duplicated chromosomal copies when they are bi-oriented - because then the microtubules attached to them are trying to pull them apart. Before they are bi-oriented, this force would be much smaller because of their attachment to microtubules attempting to pull them both in the same (rather than opposing) directions. Ipl1p associates with two other proteins that, like Ipl1p itself also have counterparts in human cells and we will examine how tension might regulate Ipl1p through its association with these two proteins. By investigating how this mechanism works at the molecular level, we will improve our understanding of a fundamental process that ensures maintenance of genome integrity during cell division and that is relevant to human conditions such as cancer and Down's syndrome, where chromosome loss or gain events play an important role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G003440/1","grantId":"BB/G003440/1","fundValue":"335817","fundStart":"2008-07-18","fundEnd":"2012-01-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The immediate impact of this research has been new knowledge gained about a fundamental cellular process, namely cell division.

The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) functions as part of a correction mechanism that ensures chromosomes are properly attached to the machinery (termed the 'mitotic spindle') that distributes them between the two daughter cells. Correct attachment means that the duplicated copies of each chromosome must be attached to opposite ends of the mitotic spindle, a state called 'chromosome bi-orientation', which ensures that they will be pulled to opposite ends of the cell during division. \n\nOur work used yeast cells to examine how the CPC is regulated. Yeast CPC is composed of four proteins (Bir1, Sli15, Nbl1, Ipl1 kinase), each with a mammalian counterpart. Ipl1 catalyses addition of phosphate groups (a process termed 'phosphorylation') to proteins at the interface between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle in order to promote chromosome bi-orientation. However, the role of the other components as regulators of Ipl1 was unclear. Our research focussed on Bir1 and we demonstrated that Bir1 promotes phosphorylation by Ipl1 and that it plays a role in a mechanism that delays division until all chromosomes are bi-oriented. Since bi-oriented chromosomes come under tension from the mitotic spindle whereas incorrectly attached ones do not, we tested whether Sli15 and Bir1 could together form a tension sensor functioning as a CPC 'on/off' switch. However, we could delete the Bir1 binding domain in Sl15 without compromising chromosome bi-orientation, arguing against such a model. \n\nA large multi-protein complex termed the 'kinetochore' mediates attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle. We discovered a novel and specific functional connection between Bir1 and components of the &quot;Ctf19/CCAN&quot; kinetochore sub-complex through a genome-wide &quot;synthetic lethal&quot; screen with our bir1-17 mutant, which becomes unconditionally lethal in combination with mutations affecting the Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore complex. This &quot;synthetic lethality&quot; is not shared by mutations affecting either Ipl1 or Sli15, showing that the functional connection is specific to the Bir1 component of the CPC. We additionally found that Ipl1 kinase adds multiple phosphate groups to the Sli15 component of the CPC itself and mapped these sites within the central domain of Sli15. We altered these sites either to block or to mimic phosphorylation and showed that Ipl1-dependent Sli15 phosphorylation does not influence chromosome biorientation, but influences binding of the CPC to the mitotic spindle during the late stages of cell division and that this is needed for optimal chromosome stability. \n\nFinally, in collaboration with others we helped to demonstrate an unexpected functional connection between the TOR nutrient signalling pathway and Ipl1-dependent promotion of chromosome bi-orientation. There are no immediate uses of this research in non-academic contexts. This research will be exploited through its contribution to knowledge about fundamentally important cellular mechanisms that occur in higher cells from yeast to man and will underpin additional investigations aimed at improving our knowledge of cellular processes that are relevant to human disease.
