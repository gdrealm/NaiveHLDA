Complement is a set of inflammatory proteins that are easily activated during organ transplantation and we have shown it may have a causal role in this type of injury. Our aim is to identify whether the tissue receptor that detects the activated complement fragment known as C5a can be blocked to protect kidneys during transplantation. If this can be achieved with a new agent that we are testing in mice, this could lengthen the life of the transplant and make more kidneys available by organ donation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L020254/1","grantId":"MR/L020254/1","fundValue":"464744","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2017-10-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wuding  Zhou","coPersons":["Irene  Rebollo Mesa","Steven H Sacks"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
