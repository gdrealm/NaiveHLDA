{"id":"35D734F4-FDBA-42B8-86F9-1B2859AE3D10","title":"The effects of business taxation on economic and social welfare: new insights from tax return data","abstractText":"<p>This project ultimately aims to contribute to improving the design of business taxation in the UK and elsewhere. We propose to do so by significantly improving understanding of the impact of taxation on the behaviour of business, and the costs to society of that impact, and by communicating the results to interested parties in academia, government and business.</p>\n\n<p>The work will focus on corporation tax, but will also include taxes on incorporated businesses and VAT. A key feature of the research will be the use of confidential tax return data, available in a secure HMRC Datalab. These data provide an opportunity for major advances in understanding of the effects of taxes on business behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will focus on four specific areas of business behaviour: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>investment</li>\n\n <li>source of finance</li>\n\n <li>choice of legal form</li>\n\n <li>tax avoidance</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will also analyse the responsiveness of taxable income to the tax rate. We will use statistical techniques to exploit two main forms of variation in UK business taxes: discontinuities in marginal or average tax rates at several kink points in tax schedules, and a number of tax reforms implemented during the period of data availability.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000016/1","grantId":"ES/L000016/1","fundValue":"1404190","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Peter Devereux","coPersons":["Benjamin  Lockwood","Sowmya (Wiji) Wijayambal Arulampalam","Stephen Roy Bond"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
