Examples of TSEs include scrapie in sheep; bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) in humans. TSE agents (prions, which are thought to be an abnormal form of a normal host protein) may be spread by several different mechanisms including, importantly for BSE and vCJD, via the consumption of contaminated meat products. There is much uncertainty about many stages in the development of CNS disease. After crossing the intestinal epithelial cells (themselves a tough barrier to proteins) the TSE agent does not appear to migrate directly to the CNS but accumulates and replicates on cells in the lymph nodes (glands) that drain lymph from the intestine. We do not know how the TSE agent crosses the epithelium or is transported to the particular cells in the nodes on which it replicates. We have several possibilities for both stages, and this project will use novel models and state-of-the-art immunological techniques to study early interactions between host immune cells and prion proteins. More specifically, we aim to determine the precise mechanisms by which TSE agents are transported across the intestine and on to the regional lymph nodes. The elucidation of these mechanisms will contribute to our understanding of the complex and relatively poorly understood interactions between TSE agent and host, and may lead to intervention therapies to help control the disease in man and animals. The work will make use of unique techniques that our group has developed and will benefit from the wide expertise available at the University of Oxford, and from that of other project partners undertaking TSE research in the UK and Europe. By addressing questions relating to the initial translocation of prion proteins and the interaction with immune cells, and by establishing collaborations between other groups with complementary expertise, the proposed project addresses the remit of the Agri-Food Committee for studying the control of food-borne pathogens, and in particular the priority areas of understanding the biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D00313X/1","grantId":"BB/D00313X/1","fundValue":"333014","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gordon  MacPherson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
