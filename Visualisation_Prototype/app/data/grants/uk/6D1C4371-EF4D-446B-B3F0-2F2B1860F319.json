{"id":"6D1C4371-EF4D-446B-B3F0-2F2B1860F319","title":"The New International Division of Labour","abstractText":"<p>Patterns of production in the world economy are changing rapidly. These changes are driven by trade liberalisation, technical change and economic reforms. The research will focus on two particular aspects of the ongoing globalisation process: (1) falling transaction costs as a result of ICT; and (2) the exceedingly fast export growth of some developing countries (particularly China and India), and considers their impact on the location of economic activities.</p> \n<p>Four projects will examine firm and regional responses to these two aspects of globalisation.&nbsp; The first project considers the role of ICT in firm’s outsourcing decisions and the impact outsourcing will have on the international division of labour.&nbsp;A second project examines how firms change their production techniques and product mix in response to rising import competition. The third project considers the impact on personal and regional inequalities in the ‘North’.&nbsp; It will draw on the work on outsourcing and product choice, but will also consider the extent to which affected industries are spatially concentrated.&nbsp;A fourth project also considers spatial issues, but will focus on the fact that fast growth in output and exports from developing countries often goes hand in hand with increased spatial concentration in a few dominant cities.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D001218/1","grantId":"ES/D001218/1","fundValue":"176900","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Henry George Overman","coPersons":["Stephen James Redding","Anthony James Venables","Frederic  Robert-Nicoud"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
