Such systems incorporate those fundamental characteristics important for allowing an approach to the Exascale. However, constraints of the hardware present challenges for the programmer: efficient utilisilisation of the available processing capability is typically only possible for real applications after significant adaptations are made. Access to a testbed GPU accelerated resource will allow researchers to gain vital experience with this disruptive architecture and prepare their applications for the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I035978/1","grantId":"EP/I035978/1","fundValue":"50000","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The GPGPU platform was contructed and made available to users, fully in compliance with the objectives of the grant.

Their reviews of the usefulness of the facility for their research will be contained in their individual returns, but the general opinion was that this is a technology that does not yet meet the needs of a wide range of scientific applications The outputs from this test facility helped guide the procurement of the ?25M ARCHER procurement, thus strongly influencing the technology chosen.
