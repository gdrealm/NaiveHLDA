He soon realised that if the decay rate is known, this system can be used to determine the age of geological materials. This is analogous with an hourglass in which sand in the top is the amount of radioactive parent and sand in the bottom is the amount of radiogenic daughter. Rutherford's idea was first applied to the radioactive decay of U and Th, which produces Pb and He, resulting in two chronometers. The proposed method aims to develop and apply a radically new technology in which both chronometers are combined on microscopic samples in a fraction of the time required by conventional techniques.\n\nU-Th-He ages are currently measured by (1) heating entire grains of U,Th-bearing minerals such as apatite or zircon with a long wavelength (IR or visible light) laser, (2) analysing the released He with a noble gas mass spectrometer, (3) dissolving the degassed grains in acid and (4) measuring their U,Th-content on a separate (ICP-MS) mass spectrometer. One problem with this method is that it is time consuming, especially for zircon which is an extremely hard to dissolve mineral. A second problem is that it assumes minerals to have a uniform U and Th composition, because He is spatially separated from its parent due to the energetic nature of the radioactive decay process, and this spatial separation can only be corrected for by making assumptions regarding the location of the parent isotopes.\n\nTo solve these problems, the proposed research will develop a radically new technology in which He is not released by degassing entire grains with a long wavelength laser, but is extracted from a small pit in a polished surface by ablation with a short wavelength (UV) laser, and ultimately measured on a noble gas mass spectrometer. U, Th (and Pb) are then analysed by exactly the same means using an ICP-MS. The key innovation of the proposed method over previous attempts at 'in-situ' U-Th-He dating is that all the measurements are done relative to a standard of know U-Th-He age, which is irradiated alongside the sample with high energy protons to produce an internally uniform background signal of 3He (which is a rare isotope of helium).\n\nThe new method will deliver a two orders of magnitude increase in sample throughput while enabling us to map out the spatial distribution of U, Th and He within individual grains and producing (U-Th)/(Pb-He) 'double-dates' by default, thus revealing a wealth of geological information previously invisible to the conventional method. We anticipate in-situ U-Th-He dating of proton-irradiated samples to replace conventional whole-grain degassing and dissolution in many (albeit not all) applications, warranting the label of a 'disruptive technology'. We are seeking funds to develop this new dating method as a continuation of Rutherford's groundbreaking research, at a modest cost to the tax payer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K003232/1","grantId":"NE/K003232/1","fundValue":"295452","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Pieter  Vermeesch","coPersons":["Andrew  Carter"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
