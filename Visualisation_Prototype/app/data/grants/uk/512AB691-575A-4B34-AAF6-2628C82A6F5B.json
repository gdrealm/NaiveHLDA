Too many or too few seedlings can have a devastating effect on the profitability of the crops they produce. There is also an environmental consequence, because chemical crop treatments like insecticides, herbicides and fertilisers are not used efficiently. The soil seedbed can be a very harsh environment in which to germinate and therefore seeds with high vigour are required to consistently provide the same number of seedlings following sowing. However, in practice seed vigour is variable. The problem is, that is it not fully understood what makes seeds vigorous and consequently this characteristic is not included in breeding programmes for new crop cultivars. The environment in which seeds are produced can affect seed vigour and seed companies have been addressing this using a range of basic technologies, but despite this seed vigour remains variable. However, we have shown that differences in seed vigour can also have a genetic basis and so there is a further opportunity for improving seed vigour. In this proposal we aim to gain a greater understanding of what underlies these genetic differences. To do this, we will identify the gene or genes which are responsible for arguably the most important aspect of seed vigour, how fast they germinate. During this work we will gain insight and understanding into how these genes regulate processes within the seed that affect germination and this will help companies develop methods to improve seed vigour. Different plant lines can germinate at different rates, and this may be due to only small differences (sequence differences) within the same gene. By looking at the differences in the sequence of our selected gene in a range of lines which are known to germinate at different rates we aim to see how these differences in sequence are linked to differences in germination rate. A further complication is that some crops contain more than one copy of many genes. It is likely that not all copies of the genes will have the same impact on your trait of interest (e.g. germination rate), and so we must also determine which of the gene copies are significantly affecting germination rate. With this type of information it is possible for plant breeders to breed and select for faster germination (enhanced vigour) in the new cultivars they produce. We will carryout the proposed work in the crop species Brassica oleracea which contains familiar vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower and sprouts, but will also work with oil Seed Rape (Brassica napus) which is an increasingly important arable crop. However, in the long term the work has relevance to many other crops and even ornamentals such as bedding plants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E006418/1","grantId":"BB/E006418/1","fundValue":"412558","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Results form two patent application and are being developed by Syngenta Agriculture, Food and Drink Economic","person":"William Edward Finch-Savage","coPersons":["Guy  Barker"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" We have identified three genes in Brassica oleracea (cabbage crops) that jointly regulate seed vigour.
