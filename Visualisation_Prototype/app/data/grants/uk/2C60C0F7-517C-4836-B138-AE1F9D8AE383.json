The dual requirements for high energy efficiency and minimal pollution for sustainable developments place an urgent demand on better understanding of and more accurate predictive tools for combustion processes. With its inherent complex and interdisciplinary nature, combustion is a major challenge for the science and engineering research communities, which can only be met through collaborative research using the most advanced tools available. Over the past decade, High End Computing (HEC) has been a driving force for deploying advanced numerical and modelling tools for fundamental and applied combustion research. The Consortium on Computational Combustion for Engineering Applications (COCCFEA) has been at the forefront of joint exploitation of HEC resources for the advancement of combustion science and technology over a decade, which has benefited immensely from EPSRC's strategic investment in HEC. A new grant is sought to continue its work, with the aim of exploiting HPCx and in particular, the proposed HECToR to tackle more realistic combustion problems in engineering applications as well as emerging topics related to sustainability, security and micro and nanotechnologies. New emphasizes are placed on integration of methods and tools, training of PhD students and dissemination of results at the highest level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D080223/1","grantId":"EP/D080223/1","fundValue":"95023","fundStart":"2006-06-19","fundEnd":"2010-03-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kai Hong Luo","coPersons":["Karl Warren Jenkins","Andreas  Kronenburg"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
