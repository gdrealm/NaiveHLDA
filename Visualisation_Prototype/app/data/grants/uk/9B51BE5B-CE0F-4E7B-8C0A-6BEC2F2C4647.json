This decrease in movement ability can be the consequence of biological or psychological factors, or a disease of the neuromuscular system. As people age, there is a natural decrease in muscular strength, flexibility and the ability to maintain balance. Additionally, with aging, people may develop fear of falling or become less confident in their ability to move in unfamiliar surroundings. Finally, there are a number of neuromuscular diseases which become more common later on in life, like Parkinson, dementia, stroke or lower limb amputations impinging on one?s health. It is the aim of the participating scientists to investigate what the consequences are and how individuals cope at different stages in their lives with decreases in their ability to move or when they develop a neuromuscular disease. For example, we aim to investigate movement characteristics (biomechanical analysis) that change with ageing, as well as how these and neuromuscular diseases affect individuals? quality-of-life and general well-being. In addition, we would like to find out how certain factors like physical fitness, disease status, or resilience might influence the development of movement problems. The Network consists of academics from a number of prestigious higher education institutions with diverse backgrounds and expertise including biomechanics, psychology, medical engineering, movement science, and public health. The Network is supported by various health-care providers and community organisations with whom we collaboratively shape the research agenda. We propose to hold a number of joint meetings with all stakeholders to develop the course of the research. Initially, the different institutions involved will work in dyads to explore specific research targets. The overall aim of these dyads is to become familiar with the needs, expertise and scientific approach of all partners. Each dyad meeting will produce a position statement which will then be used to develop a full research programme. We expect working in such a way, novel research methodologies can be developed to investigate changes in movement behaviour as we age or develop a disease. The ultimate aim of the Network is to present healthcare providers with better treatment and intervention options which will help to maintain and/or improve movement ability of individuals as they age which in turn will improve general well-being and quality-of-life and the possibility to live an independent life.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900009","grantId":"G0900009","fundValue":"42609","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Remco  Polman","coPersons":["Bruce  Abernethy","Jim  McKenna","Catherine Anne Dobson","James  Selfe","Jonathan  Maxwell","Paola  Dey","Michael John Fagan","Rich  Masters","Jim David Richards","Erika  Borkoles","Natalie Katja Vanicek"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
