{"id":"FB879056-927E-4682-9E7D-7359ECFFDB27","title":"Seeking a new, inter-disciplinary methodology to quantify the benefits of housing interventions for older people","abstractText":"<p>Within the new dynamic of ageing and its emphasis on independent living, there is a growing need for practical housing interventions that support older people to remain in their homes. There are, however, serious methodological challenges in producing clear, quantified evidence of the health and economic benefits of these interventions. In the climate of required cost benefit information for public service commissioning, this lack of evidence restricts the growth and funding of such services and means the services are not available on a scale commensurate with need.</p> \n<p>At the root of the methodological problems is a lack of consensus between disciplines about the nature of valid evidence. The purpose of this network, therefore, is to create dialogue and involve the disciplines of medicine, psychology and economics alongside those of social policy and housing and electronic engineering. The objective is to develop a methodology capable of quantifying the outcomes of these interventions and ethically acceptable to older people and agencies working with them.</p> \n<p>The preparatory network will devise a methodology and submit a proposal to implement and evaluate it. If the methodology proves sound and flexible, there will be long term-benefits in producing a new body of useful research evidence. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0144","grantId":"RES-351-25-0144","fundValue":"15534","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frances  Heywood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
