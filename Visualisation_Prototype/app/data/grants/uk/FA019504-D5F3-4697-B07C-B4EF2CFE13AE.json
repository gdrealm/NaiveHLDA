{"id":"FA019504-D5F3-4697-B07C-B4EF2CFE13AE","title":"The role of p63 in development of the secondary palate","abstractText":"The roof of the mouth (the palate) develops in two halves that fuse together during a babyâ€™s development. Currently, we do not completely understand what controls this process but we do know that cleft palate can result when it goes wrong. \n\nRecently, it has been found that disruption of a protein called p63, which has several different forms, can lead to cleft palate. This project is aimed at finding out how p63 functions during normal development and how this is altered in cleft palate.\n\nWe know that the levels of one form of p63 drop before fusion of the palate; we will therefore see if other forms of p63 are reduced at the same time. We will also introduce the same disruption that has been shown to cause cleft palate in man, into the p63 gene in mice, to create an animal model of cleft palate. This will allow us to look at the effects that this has on other proteins involved in cleft palate.\n\nThis research will help us to understand the role of p63 during development of the palate. In the longer term, this information will improve the way we help patients with cleft palate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400264","grantId":"G0400264","fundValue":"206850","fundStart":"2005-03-29","fundEnd":"2008-11-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jill  Dixon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
