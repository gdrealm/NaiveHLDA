{"id":"860B6894-7882-4235-A1FE-01D02CCDA035","title":"Characterisation of norovirus replication complex formation","abstractText":"Members of the calicivirus family are responsible for important diseases of man and animals; noroviruses cause gastroenteritis or projectile vomiting in humans and outbreaks are often seen in hospitals, cruise ships and in military camps. We currently know very little with regards to how these viruses interact with the host cell and how this leads to the production of new virus particles. When noroviruses infect a host cell they have many effects that can alter the normal processes occurring within the host cell. One such effect is to generate replication ?factories? within the host cell where the viral genome is replicated. In order to better understand this important family of viruses, we now aim to characterise how these replication ?factories? are generated to identify methods of controlling outbreaks of these important viruses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700109","grantId":"G0700109","fundValue":"362305","fundStart":"2008-02-15","fundEnd":"2011-07-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Gordon Goodfellow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
