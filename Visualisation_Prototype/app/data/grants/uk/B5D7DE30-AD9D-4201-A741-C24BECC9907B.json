{"id":"B5D7DE30-AD9D-4201-A741-C24BECC9907B","title":"Workshop on Psychology of Face and Gesture Recognition","abstractText":"The IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the most prestigious international conference entirely devoted to face and gesture recognition. This is the 7th conference in the series arranged by IEEE TC-PAMI and having been held in the US, Korea, France and Japan, this is its first visit to the UK. One traditional source of ideas for research in automatic recognition is the study of human mechanisms for recognition. The study of human mechanisms is currently a fast moving area with developments in such areas as neural mechanisms for gesture recognition, cues sub serving this recognition and elucidation of distributed brain mechanisms for face perception. To help bring into focus the common goals and highlight the potential for transfer between the study of machine and human recognition we propose a workshop given by 10 experts from psychology and neuroscience to run concurrently with the main meeting. This is the first time such an event has been held in the history of the conference and we request support to assist in funding speaker travel and accommodation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E003303/1","grantId":"EP/E003303/1","fundValue":"4582","fundStart":"2006-03-20","fundEnd":"2006-06-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Pollick","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
