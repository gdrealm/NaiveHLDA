{"id":"E93B3678-AC99-46BD-A570-80DE39ADECDE","title":"Regulation and substrate binding of the tolloid proteinase family","abstractText":"The tolloid family of proteins has essential roles in two fundamental processes in mammalian biology. The first is tissue assembly, for example bone growth, where tolloids cut protein precursors initiating the assembly process. Tolloids remove a region at the end of collagen molecules and this removal begins the collagen fibril assembly process which is essential for bone growth and the formation of other normal healthy tissues. Secondly, tolloids release stored 'growth factors' which are messenger molecules that can direct processes in cells, for instance telling them how much to grow or even whether they should live or die. These processes are critical for maintaining normal tissue structure and function and for essential processes in early embryonic development. We have recently determined the shape and arrangement of one member of the tolloid family that is found in humans, and shown that this tolloid works as a pair. This self-self interaction actually slows the tolloid down and may represent a novel method of internal regulation. Tolloids can also be controlled by protein enhancers that increase their capability of cutting their substrates (i.e. their activity). How tolloids interact with the many diverse molecules they cut is currently unknown, and insights into these processes are urgently needed in order to understand how they control such diverse functions in human biology. The main aim of our work therefore is to resolve the mechanism of action of tolloids which we believe will lead to an understanding of how their regulation and interactions underpin their fundamental roles in tissue assembly and embryo development. We will determine if all tolloids work in pairs and what happens when tolloids bind to their substrates, such as the collagen precursor, for example, does it remain paired or go solo. Finally, we will discover how protein enhancers work to improve the activity of tolloids. Understanding these molecular events preceding bone formation could have significant health and economic benefits to the UK. In the UK, 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men suffer a fracture after the age of 50 and the cost of treating all osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women has been predicted to increase to more than &pound;2 billion by 2020. Our research findings could be of future interest to the pharmaceutical industry in developing novel treatments to modulate bone deposition. Effective treatment for bone loss would significantly improve the quality of life of an ageing population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I012265/1","grantId":"BB/I012265/1","fundValue":"325280","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Enhanced skills and training of the postdoctoral research associate, PhD students associated with the project and UG and MSc students undertaking research projects in this area.

To determine the mechanism of self-regulation by substrate exclusion and whether this is conserved in all mammalian tolloids and tolloids from other species.\n\nWe have shown with studies on two further tolloid proteinases that there is divergence within the mammallian tolloid family and mammlian tolloid like-2 has a similar requirement for oligomerisation to drosophila tolloid.\n\n2. To determine the oligomeric state of tolloids when processing substrates and whether there is a common mechanism of substrate exosite binding between the diverse substrates.\n\nStudies using the non-catalytic domains of mammalian and drosophila tolloids has shown differential requirement for these domains between proteases and for different substrates providing differential specificity across the tolloid family.\n\n3. To determine how the protein regulator Twisted gastrulation, important for skeletogenesis and maintaining bone mineral density, acts on tolloid proteinases to enhance their activity.\n\nWe have shown that Twisted gastrulation does not interact directly with mammlian tolloid but has an inhibitory effect on BMP7 and interacts directly with chordin.\n\nThree papers in progress from this grant; one under review at eLife and two further in preparation. All publications will be open access. Our research findings could be of future interest to the pharmaceutical industry in developing inhibitors or enhancers of tolloid proteinases to modulate bone deposition. In particular the knowledge that different tolloid family members can be enhanced or inhibited in a differential way is novel. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
