{"id":"D7FECAB3-82EB-4ACB-90AB-A49FEDE4DFE1","title":"Economic Implications of Ambiguity","abstractText":"<p>Ambiguity or Knightian uncertainty - the absence of objectively given probabilities for future events - is pervasive. Economic crashes and recoveries or war in West Asia are arguably ambiguous events unlike the outcome of a fair coin toss. JM Keynes and Frank Knight in the 1920s, Daniel Ellsberg in the 1960s, and the most recent global economic crisis have all highlighted the need for better understanding of the economic implications of ambiguity.<br /><br />Jayant Ganguliâ€™s research develops theoretical models of how ambiguity impacts common and currently relevant settings of economic interaction.</p>\n\n<p>The first project studies the effects of ambiguous information on individual choices and market outcomes in financial markets. It provides new predictions on how individual portfolios and asset prices do and do not react to freely available public news, in otherwise frictionless markets.</p>\n\n<p>The second project explores the effects of ambiguity on incentive structures in financial intermediation and aims to understand and explain contractual arrangements between investors and fund managers that are puzzling under extant theories.</p>\n\n<p>The final project develops foundations for analysing strategic interaction among individuals with preferences and behaviour from a much wider class than traditionally studied, and includes inter alia individuals sensitive to ambiguity or subject to temptation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00168X/1","grantId":"ES/K00168X/1","fundValue":"163736","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jayant Vivek Ganguli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
