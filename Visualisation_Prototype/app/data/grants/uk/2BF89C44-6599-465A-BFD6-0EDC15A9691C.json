Relevant examples include the predictability of stock returns with valuation ratios or the predictability of GDP growth with interest rates etc.&nbsp; Existing methods that ignore this switching feature between the predictor and the variable being predicted may lead to misleading conclusions about predictability such as finding that there is no predictability when in fact it is only kicking in episodically.</p>\n\n<p>This project will develop formal econometric tests for detecting and modelling such behaviour in the data, paying particular attention to the robustness of the proposed tests to observed data characteristics such as the persistent nature of economic variables. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H032533/1","grantId":"ES/H032533/1","fundValue":"56751","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jean-Yves  Pitarakis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" This grant allowed me to develop a series of statistical methodologies designed to empirically uncover behavioural interactions and relationships between economic and financial variables (e.g. stock returns and valuation ratios, economic growth and interest rates) when these interactions can occasionally become inactive during particular states of the economy (e.g. recessions versus expansions). My research has established that ignoring such regime specific behavior can lead to very misleading conclusions on the effects of a particular economic variable (e.g. interest rates) on the future values of another variable of interest (e.g. economic growth, stock returns). \n\nThrough the numerous tests I developed I was able to establish for instance that valuation ratios such as dividend yields can be very powerful predictors of future stock returns but only during periods of recessions while during expansions or normal times the same predictors may lose their predictive powers. The search for useful predictors of future economic and financial activity clearly needs to take into account the possibility that predictability may be kicking in only occasionally. My research has started gathering citations (see URL) from other academics who picked up on my idea of regime specific predictability within a particular statistical environment commonly known as predictive regressions and that allows for a very rich variety of economic variables to be considered as predictors.
