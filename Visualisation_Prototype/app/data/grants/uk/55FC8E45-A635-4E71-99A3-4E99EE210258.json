The project will be the first venture of a new collaborative partnership between the University of Central Lancashire and the Beacon Museum, Whitehaven, and will achieve the following:\n\nIntegration of scientific research into a museum gallery, placing STEM alongside aspects of history, culture and heritage and highlighting the importance of STEM to the region\n\nPlace science learning into this community hub, in an area where there are no science centres/museums/discovery centres, and use this as a launchpad for future collaborative activity. \n\nEngagement of new audiences with STEM, especially audiences who would not normally seek out scientific information/activities\n\nIncreased visibility of higher education in an area where participation in HE is low (POLAR 3 methodology) and opportunity for aspiration-raising activity linked to the museum exhibit/outreach programme planned\n\nA varied programme of community engagement, including dance, storytelling, craft and science sessions, that offer opportunities for a wide range of interest groups and ages to engage with the research showcased \n\nAn exciting opportunity for researchers, and students, to get involved in public engagement in a variety of ways\n\nForming a link with museum professionals, which we will build on in future projects, e.g. developing content around the history of UCLan's observatories\n\nDelivery of a programme of engagement as part of the International Year of Light","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002091/1","grantId":"ST/N002091/1","fundValue":"9805","fundStart":"2015-10-08","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Joanna  Heaton-Marriott","coPersons":["Robert William Walsh"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
