{"id":"D5780936-DA89-45C5-A850-05136D60956C","title":"Dynamic Mental Representations of Motion Events in Sentence Processing","abstractText":"<p>When we hear/read a sentence that describes an object moving from one place to another, we have to keep in memory where the object was initially, then where it is after the movement, in order to understand the event described in the sentence. <br /><br />The present research will closely investigate how we construct such representations as the sentence unfolds. The project proposes a series of experiments that attempt to uncover potential ‘mental simulation’ processes in understanding linguistically described motion events. Some experiments, for example, investigate whether listeners' attention shifts can be modulated by the shape of the trajectory of the object in motion (eg, the ball will thrown/rolled into the pond). <br /><br />To do so, various methods are used to track attention shifts: standard ‘visual-world’ eye-movement tracking techniques to explore listeners' overt attention shifts, as well as other methods to capture more 'covert' attention shifts, focusing on the time-course of the processing to establish how automatic these processes are. <br /><br />Other experiments also aim at comparing the processes by which people represent motion events in spoken language versus written language. Altogether the research will have implications for wider issues, such as cognitive representation theories, cognitive development, and vision-language interactions.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2842","grantId":"RES-062-23-2842","fundValue":"307222","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yuki  Kamide","coPersons":["Christoph  Scheepers"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
