{"id":"DD7DE629-7D42-4EF9-A34A-4DB3898B3435","title":"Derivation of clinical grade human embryonic stem cell lines for therapeutic applications","abstractText":"In future it might be possible to use stem cells to treat diseases for which we currently have no cure. These include, heart disease (the biggest killer in the UK), Juvenile (type 1) diabetes, and degenerative neurological conditions such as Parkinson s and Motor Neurone disease. But before we can test potential therapies on patients we must create cell lines that are safe (free of infectious agents and possible animal contamination) and genetically stable. At the moment embryonic stem cells can only be used for reseach. This project aims to efficently produce embryonic stem cells to laboratory standards (called Good Manufacturing Practice, GMP) that allow them to be used for treatment of patients. The cell lines will be deposited in the UK Stem Cell Bank and will be freely available to the medical community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801059","grantId":"G0801059","fundValue":"1401310","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry David Moore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
