{"id":"9F0AB5EB-30FF-498E-8BA6-B9332466619A","title":"Metal-free Arylations for Green Chemistry","abstractText":"Organic Chemistry is mainly dealing with the synthesis of molecules. For efficient synthesis, we must have reasonable insight into the way in which bonds between atoms can be formed or broken and how molecules can react with each other. In this proposal we make use of the special properties of an interesting class of molecules containing iodine atoms. We propose to synthesise novel reagents and investigate reactions using these reagents in only catalytic amounts. This means that one catalyst molecule will have the potential to create thousands of new molecules with special properties. The development of these new iodine reagents and their application in various reactions allowing the selective transfer of aromatic moieties form the main part of this proposal. The target structures which are obtained in these reactions are found in natural products and in many pharmaceuticals. A fast and metal-free access to such compounds will therefore enable their fast synthetic access and enhance the development of new bioactive molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00569X/1","grantId":"EP/J00569X/1","fundValue":"354904","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Wirth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
