{"id":"A7BEA244-F395-4076-93EE-3FE0494A3DBB","title":"Ultra miniaturised, low-power, high precision, robust CT-DO sensor system exploitation","abstractText":"This project will aid the commercialisation of recent inventions of oceanographic / environmental sensor technology developed in collaboration by the National Oceanography Centre Southampton and the University of Southampton. They have developed novel miniaturised high performance sensors that measure the conductivity, temperature and oxygen content of water. The measurement of these parameters is essential in a wide range of environmental studies in both fresh and salt (sea) water. The small size and high performance of these new sensors suggests that they could be developed into a product with potential benefits to both science and industry. Prior to this project the inventors have commissioned a market survey and this has highlighted sizeable markets in a number of sectors. Crucially the potential customers include non scientists in sectors where potential sales volumes are large. This project seeks to investigate these commercial opportunities further and complete adaptation and testing of the technology to allow it to be demonstrated to key user groups and companies. The project will also explore business models, partnerships, patenting, and routes to manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I019956/1","grantId":"NE/I019956/1","fundValue":"122572","fundStart":"2011-09-30","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Charles Mowlem","coPersons":["Hywel  Morgan"],"organisation":"National Oceanography Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
