This proposal is specifically to provide a leading UK role in the construction of an advanced, flexible, wide field multi-object spectrograph. 4MOST (with a goal of 3000 spectra simultaneously over 7 deg^2 FoV at R of &gt; 5000 at 850nm and a wavelength coverage of 380-1000 nm) and its associated science survey (up to 25x10^6 spectra over 25,000 deg^2), an integrated component of the Gaia related programme unravelling the chemo-dynamic properties of the nearby universe. Our essential UK involvement, will not only enable a state of the art spectrograph design, but also through leading roles in the science definition and data processing, will give the wider UK community priority access to its large scale spectroscopic surveys. In combination with the ESA Gaia mission data, 4MOST will enable a transformational leap in our understanding of the processes which shape our Galaxy, giving definite answers to a range of fundamental questions, e.g. the Galactic potential, galaxy assembly history, early galaxy formation. The opportunity exists for major scientific, technological and training returns on a modest UK investment in this significant European initiative.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002933/1","grantId":"ST/J002933/1","fundValue":"44042","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  There has not been any significant economic or societal impact of the grant yet.

Our findings will be used to take the project forward to completion. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
