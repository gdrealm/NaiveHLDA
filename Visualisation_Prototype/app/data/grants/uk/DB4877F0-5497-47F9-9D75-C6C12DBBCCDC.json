A First Grant Proposal","abstractText":"The project is aimed at the discovery of new hydrothermal routes to the preparation of metal oxide nanotubes. The proposal also seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating these new materials into energy conversion and storage applications including hydrogen storage, solar cells and fuel cells. The methodology used to search for hydrothermal conditions will include an analysis of the solubility of metal oxides under hydrothermal conditions, followed by formulation and testing of novel conditions favourable to the formation of metal oxide nanotubes. The sorption of hydrogen into the pores of novel metal oxide nanotubes will be quantitatively studied. Improvements in solar cell and fuel cell technology are anticipated by utilisation of the unique properties of novel metal oxide nanotubes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F044445/1","grantId":"EP/F044445/1","fundValue":"303406","fundStart":"2008-09-15","fundEnd":"2010-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The ourcome of the research has allow us to to employ new computational chemistry tools for simulation of the process of nanotubes formation.
