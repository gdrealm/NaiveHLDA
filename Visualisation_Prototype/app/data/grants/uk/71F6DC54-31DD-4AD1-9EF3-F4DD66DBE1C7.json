The co-ordination and management of volunteers is an emerging issue for which the evidence base is under-developed.\n\no The mainstreaming of VCS organisations in public services has led to an explosion of information sharing with public agencies. It has also produced contentious information management and information security issues. Effective Information Sharing across partnerships (seminar 5) is becoming ever more crucial to the success of delivery models attempting integrated approaches. The seminar highlighted some practical steps including the need for safe discussion/coordination space for workers from different agencies and sectors to talk to each other, compare notes and provide mutual support outside of the usual operational reporting structures. \n\nInformation sharing challenges are being addressed in collaboration with the national Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing in a seminar series ES/M002314/1 (2014 - 2017) led by Prof Rob Wilson.
