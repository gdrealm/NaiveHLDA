{"id":"10B6008B-1745-4EE8-9183-D0EF8C820503","title":"British Election Study Ethnic Minority Survey","abstractText":"<p>The British Election Study (BES) has conducted surveys of the British electorate at every general election since 1964. The BES explores why people choose to vote (or not) and why they support one party rather than another, as well as wider questions about democracy and political participation.<br /><br />In order to allow a thorough investigation of the political views and behaviours of Britain's ethnic minority populations, an ethnic minority sample supplementing the main nationally-representative BES surveys, was needed. <br /><br />The project team therefore conducted an ethnic minority survey immediately after the 2010 General Election in order to provide, for the first time since 1997 (when an ethnic minority BES survey was last conducted), an accurate mapping of the political orientations and behaviour of Britain's major ethnic minority groups.&nbsp; This 'map' will provide an important resource for understanding the contemporary political integration of Britain's ethnic minorities and for assessing the changing patterns of ethnic minority attitudes and behaviour patterns. <br /><br />The proposed survey (N=2787) is large enough to allow for the separate analysis of Britain's major ethnic minority groups: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Black Africans and Black Caribbeans. <br /><br />The Electoral Commission is a collaborating partner in this research.<br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1953-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-1953-A","fundValue":"161652","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Francis Heath","coPersons":["David  Sanders","Stephen Douglas Fisher"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
