This provides a case study, which others will follow as an example for the implementation of UN protocols arising from Rio and Nagowa summits. We believe this to be one if not the first example of an Access and Benefit Sharing arrangement for a species not listed in Annex 1 of the CBD protocol.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on 3rd November 2011 between Aberystwyth University and National Cheng-Kung University, witnessed by Professor Douglas Kell (CEO, BBSRC) and Professor Hwung-Hweng Hwung (President, NCKU). The MOU provides a platform for future collaboration in the topics of the meeting.\n2. An international group of Miscanthus and bioenergy experts was assembled in Tainan and the proposed topics were discussed at the workshop and during associated talks when visiting a number of institutions in Taiwan.\n3. An Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) agreement under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) framework was progressed and subsequently signed in June 2012 between Aberystwyth University, UK and the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan. The Access and Benefit Sharing agreement is required to legitimately use and commercialise genetic resources not listed as Annex 1 crops (the main staple crops).

We believe this to be one if not the first example of an Access and Benefit Sharing arrangement for a species not listed in Annex 1 of the CBD protocol.\n4. A subsequent visit to Taiwan was made by Dr John Clifton-Brown (PI of the Defra and BBSRC funded GIANT Miscanthus breeding Link project) and Dr Lin Huang on the 31st October 2012 to the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan to continue CBD discussions and scope future opportunities for collaboration on Miscanthus and for postgraduate student exchange. Miscanthus field trials were established in Taiwan, and at IBERS Aberystwyth University to enable genotype by environment interactions to be studied and is in keeping with the spirit of CBD.
