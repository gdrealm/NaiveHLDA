The use of more realistic but complicated mathematical models is leading to problems for which new algorithms need to be developed for efficient solution (or, in many cases, solution at all). Meanwhile, recent developments in computer architectures (the drive to multi-core chips and the increasing use of GPUs and FPGAs as accelerators) are affecting the ability of current algorithms and software to fully exploit the hardware. The long-standing lack of investment in the development of high quality mathematical software exacerbates these problems. The net effect is that scientists are unable to make the best use of computational resources and hence are unable to tackle problems of the size that the hardware potentially allows. For all these reasons, new algorithms need to be developed that employ novel mathematical, algorithmic and coding techniques.The purpose of this network is to provide a focus for a new collaboration between numerical analysts, computer scientists and developers and users of software and HPC within the nodes, supported by the necessary administrative organization. The network will build a new interdisciplinary community at the numerical algorithms/HPC interface and thereby provide added value to existing funded research at the nodes in numerical algorithms and in HPC and its applications.By partnering with NAIS (Centre for Numerical Algorithms and Intelligent Software, a joint project between Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, and Strathclyde Universities) the network will build on EPSRC's recent investment in numerical algorithms for HPC.The activities of the network will be - seminars, - graduate courses, - short courses, - a workshop on the interface between NA and HPC, in which HPC users (including HECToR users) will be encouraged to describe the computational requirements of their applications and NA researchers will describe their latest algorithmic developments, - an international workshop, - an industrial workshop, - hosting of international visitors, and - movement of node members (and especially their PhD students and PDRAs) between nodes for visits of a day to a few weeks. These activities will raise awareness of the numerical aspects of HPC, including challenges, applications and their needs, and available software. It will also facilitate work on the underlying research at the nodes, which is funded through other means. A website will advertise the network activities and disseminate them to the wider community.Expansion of the network during its life is planned, and it is expected that upon completion of the project new ideas, connections and synergies developed within the network activities will have led to responsive mode applications to EPSRC and other bodies that sustain the collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I03112X/1","grantId":"EP/I03112X/1","fundValue":"134246","fundStart":"2011-05-03","fundEnd":"2014-05-02","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Higham","coPersons":["David  Silvester"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
