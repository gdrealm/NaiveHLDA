Emotion and paternity in working-class culture, 1880-1914","abstractText":"This project examines the meanings ascribed to, and representations of, paternity in working-class life, social and welfare policy between the late Victorian period and the Great War. Male involvement in family life is currently pivotal to controversial and emotive debates on family formations and society. Yet there is almost no historical understanding of paternal participation in family life beyond the assumption that fathers' key role in the last two centuries was to 'provide' financially for dependents. Likewise, the apparent opacity of working-class inter-personal dynamics has meant that studies of working-class families have focused largely on kinship as economic units, patterns of homosociability and the efficacy of mothers' parenting skills.\n<br />\n<br />Drawing on welfare and associational records, this study examines the ideological underpinning of the 'father' and the extent to which conceptions of paternity were inextricable from understandings of manliness and citizenship. More importantly, the research draws upon an extensive range of life stories to examine fathers within the inter-personal context of domestic life to question the supposedly peripheral role of fathers within the emotional and domestic life of the working-class family. In particular, it challenges the tendency to examine working-class childhoods through the lens of maternal relations with offspring. \n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G006962/1","grantId":"ES/G006962/1","fundValue":"63628","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Julie-Marie  Strange","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
