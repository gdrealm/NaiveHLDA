{"id":"7306E560-76D4-4DC9-8430-CE0F16AB8C85","title":"Referential Hierarchies in Morphosyntax: description","abstractText":"The RHIM project explores morphosyntactic systems that are based on a hierarchy of referents - first and second person ranking over third, humans over non-humans, known referents over unknown ones. This hierarchy is known to influence the structure of grammatical relations (the basic &quot;who does what to whom in an event&quot;), giving rise to e.g. inverse morphology or differential argument marking. There have only been few comparative studies on these phenomena, and many languages displaying them are seriously endangered. Based on fieldwork and documentation corpora, we aim at a better understanding of these systems from a typological and diachronic perspective.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H500243/1","grantId":"AH/H500243/1","fundValue":"177601","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anna Maria Siewierska","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
