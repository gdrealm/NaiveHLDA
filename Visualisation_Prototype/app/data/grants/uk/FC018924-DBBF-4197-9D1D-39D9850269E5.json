This is a crucial decision because when it goes wrong the two daughter cells that are formed can go on to cause cancer, or become resistant to current anti-cancer drugs. In the course of this research we hope to uncover new targets for anti-cancer drugs and to identify ways to make current anti-cancer drugs much more effective.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000818","grantId":"G1000818","fundValue":"1840370","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathon  Pines","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
