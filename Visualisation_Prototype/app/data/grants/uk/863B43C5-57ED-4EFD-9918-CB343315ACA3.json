{"id":"863B43C5-57ED-4EFD-9918-CB343315ACA3","title":"Defining the genetic contribution and functional role to altered lung function of genes identified by GWAS meta-analysis","abstractText":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of illness, occuring mostly in smokers, which results in worsening cough and breathlessness and which is responsible for 30,000 deaths per year in the UK. It is recognised that genetics plays a role in the development of COPD, and recently we have identified that genetic variants in three genes called glutathione S transferase CD (GSTCD), HTR4 and AGER are risk factors for the development of abnormal lung function and COPD. The aims of this programme of research are to find out the role of these genes in the lungs, to determine how genetic variability in these genes alters lung function, and to assess how different genetic variants contribute to the development of airways disease focusing initially on COPD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000861","grantId":"G1000861","fundValue":"1326300","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hall","coPersons":["Ian  Sayers","Martin  Tobin"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
