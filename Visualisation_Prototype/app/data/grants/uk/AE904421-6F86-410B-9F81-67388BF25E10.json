{"id":"AE904421-6F86-410B-9F81-67388BF25E10","title":"Giving to Development","abstractText":"<p>Although there are substantial theoretical and empirical literatures on giving to charities, there is little systematic analysis of giving to specific causes. As a consequence, not enough is known on why people give to international development charities and about the characteristics of donors to development compared to those of people supporting other causes. The research will draw on various disciplines (eg economics, psychology and marketing) to develop hypotheses about giving to development. In doing so the project will undertake new qualitative research into the motives to give to development charities.</p>\n\n<p>The issues to be addressed will include how giving to development responds to rising income, to changes in the distribution of income, and to changes in government spending on official development assistance. Three underused sources of data on inter-vivos donations and bequests at death will then be used to test hypotheses about giving to development and to analyse patterns of giving to UK development charities. These data measure total donations and legacies to each of a large number of named charities over a 25 year period, the donations made by a large sample of individuals to different causes recorded in survey data, and the legacies left to charities in a large sample of estates of the deceased.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0061","grantId":"RES-155-25-0061","fundValue":"261093","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Micklewright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
