However, immune responses must be carefully controlled so that they are only activated at an appropriate time. If this tight regulation is disrupted, the immune system can potentially attack and damage the organs and tissue of the body, resulting in so-called 'autoimmune disease'. Similarly, allergies can result if the immune system is activated in response to normally harmless substances, such as metal in jewellery or food substances. A particularly critical area of the body for immune regulation is the intestine. The intestine is lined with trillions of bacteria which are important in maintaining normal health, but could potentially trigger an immune response causing inflammatory bowel disease. Similarly, as food substances pass through the intestine, they could also potentially trigger immune activation in the absence of tight control, resulting in food allergy. Therefore, understanding the cells and molecules that control activation of the immune system is paramount if we are going to understand how our immune system functions to maintain normal health. In the food industry, there is great interest in the design of foodstuffs that can actively promote human health (so called 'bioactives'), especially in the gut. For example, many dairy products and drinks contain so-called 'probiotics', which are live bacteria intended to enhance gut health. However, the mechanisms by which bioactives enhance gut health are ill defined, and often there is mistrust from the public in manufacturer's claims that their products will improve health. Therefore, it is essential to understand how bioactives affect the biology of the gut to promote health, to provide important read-outs that can be used to scientifically assess existing and novel bioactives. The only way that enhancement of gut health will be achieved is by increasing our basic understanding of the cells and molecules that maintain and promote normal gut health. As immune regulation is critical in maintaining a healthy gut, understanding how immune responses in the intestine are regulated will be critical in identifying potentially beneficial effects of bioactives. An important cell type involved in regulating all immune responses is the dendritic cell (DC). Our laboratories have recently shown, using mouse models, that important subsets of DC present in the intestine are critical in maintenance of gut health. These DC subsets are characterised by the expression of different proteins on their surface, called CD103 and integrin alphav beta8, and by their ability to produce important molecules called TGF-beta and retinoic acid. The DC promote immune regulation by inducing an immune cell type called 'regulatory T-cells', which are important cells in preventing harmful immune reactions. To build on our mouse studies, it is now critical to identify the role of these specialised DCs in human gut health. Our proposal will characterise these specialised DCs, in terms of the protein markers and molecules they express and how they function in healthy humans. We will go on to identify how known bioactives affect the biology of these DC subsets. This work will therefore identify important cells and pathways that are central to the maintenance of gut health, provide novel data on the how known bioactives work, and identify read-outs by which novel bioactive food substances can be scientifically evaluated for potential beneficial effects on the gut.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I005609/1","grantId":"BB/I005609/1","fundValue":"387682","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our proposal aims were to determine how specialised gut dendritic cells (DCs, key cells in regulating T-cell responses) function to maintain intestinal health in humans.

However, at the same time immunity must be tightly regulated to prevent harmful responses against innocuous or self-antigens. If this regulation is abrogated, allergy or autoimmune disease can result. The regulatory balance is especially vital in the intestine, where commensal bacteria and food antigens can potentially trigger immune responses. A critical area of research aims to determine the cells and molecules in the intestine that are important in maintaining immune homeostasis at times of health, and what factors contribute to immune diseases of the gut.\nOur previous work has identified so-called tolerogenic dendritic cell (DC) subsets in the gut that prevent harmful immune reactions and maintenance of intestinal health in mice. Specifically, these DC express the biomarkers integrin alphavbeta8 and CD103, can activate the cytokine TGF-beta, and metabolise vitamin A into its active form retinoic acid (RA). Our work has shown that these DC are important in the induction of regulatory T-cells in the intestine, a cell type that is essential in maintaining gut health by suppressing autoimmunity and immune pathology. Our DRINC research project looked to build upon our studies in mice to translate findings into human subjects. Specifically, we aimed to determine how specialised gut DC function to maintain intestinal health in humans, and whether certain so-called 'bioactive' foods (which are proposed to improve our health) affect the function of these cells and subsequent immune responses.\nWork during our proposal has shown that markers previously associated with tolerogenic DC in mice are similarly expressed in human. Specifically the molecules CD103 and the integrin alphavbeta8 are preferentially expressed in human gut DC and macrophages. We have described two main subsets of DC present in human intestine; a population expressing the molecules CD141 but not CD1c and a reciprocal CD141+ CD1c-ve population. Our results identify distinct human gut DC subsets that are potentially functionally important in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.\nWe also determined if more abundant blood-derived DC can be differentiated to acquire a gut phenotype. To this end, we have successfully differentiated DCs derived from blood monocytes into gut-like DC in the presence of the vitamin A metabolite RA. Thus, cells treated with RA appear more 'gut-like', expressing tolerogenic molecules and less pro- inflammatory molecules, suggesting these cells have important functional properties of gut DC. Indeed, RA-induced DC preferentially induce regulatory T cells. Thus, we describe novel methods to generate large numbers of gut-like DC with tolerance-inducing properties. This work will prove useful to industry by providing more physiological models to screen the effects of dietary molecules/compounds in DC. Additionally, we have highlighted a potentially important dietary component (RA) in regulating the DC-mediated immune response.\nWe have also tested the effects of certain bioactives on regulation of human DCs. We have focussed on probiotic bacterial strains provided of interest to our industrial collaborators Dupont. We found that all probiotic strains tested to date upregulate expression of integrin alphav beta8, an important activator of the cytokine TGF-beta which has been shown in mice to be an important regulator of gut immune homeostasis.\nTogether, we have identified important molecules and cells involved in maintenance of intestinal health, and highlighted potential biomarkers of use to the food industry when designing dietary bioactives to enhance human health. We have additionally developed novel techniques that will allow more rapid analysis of the effects of bioactives on intestinal DC. We have generated a system to obtain gut-like dendritic cells from blood derived monocytes using butyrate, a metabolite from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates. Such a system can be used as an important model system to determine important pathways/molecules that can regulate intestinal dendritic cell phenotype and function (for example, the potential role of bioactive food components in modulating gut dendritic cell function).
