This clock is called a circadian clock from the latin 'about a day'. The circadian clock in plants has been shown to control many of the functions in the plant and can cause daily rhythms in amongst other things, growth, movements of leaves and the process of making sugar from sunlight, which is called photosynthesis. Until recently, we have thought that the circadian clock must be important because so many process in the plant are controlled by it, but we did not know why the clock is important. We have new data that show that the circadian clock increases the rate of photosynthesis in plants and therefore makes the plant grow faster and do better than its neighbours. Our data suggest that the increase in photosynthesis is due to the circadian clock helping the plant to have more of the green pigment, chlorophyll. It is chlorophyll that traps the sun's energy to drive photosynthesis. We will find out how the circadian control of the activity of genes involved in chlorophyll production increases the amount of chlorophyll in the plant. We will look to see if the circadian clock increases the amount of chlorophyll made, increases the repair of chlorophyll if it is damaged by light or increases the protection of the plant from too much light, by for example making more pigments that act as a sunscreen. These experiments are important because they will help us understand how the circadian clock improves the efficiency of other major metabolic pathways in the plant. This information is important for understanding how plants have evolved and adapted and could help produce plants that grow better and are more nutritious to eat.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010381/1","grantId":"BB/D010381/1","fundValue":"256027","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2010-04-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This work has resulted in an increase in research in to he basis of how circadian clocks increase yield Agriculture, Food and Drink Societal","person":"Alexander Arundell Webb","coPersons":["Alison Gail Smith","Peter  Horton","John Clinton Gray","Julian  Hibberd"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The main objectives were met as described below. They were to determine whether:\n\n1) Circadian resonance enhances chlorophyll accumulation during greening.\nWe entrained plants to 24/20h temperature cycles in the dark, and transferred seedlings to light at different times on days 4&amp;5 of entrainment. Timecouse analysis in which samples were taken every two hours for 20 hours showed that circadian resonance had no significant affect on greening.\n\n2) Circadian resonance increases the rate of pigment-protein complex turnover.\nWe found no good evidence for this.\n\n3) Circadian resonance enhances photoprotective processes.\nWe showed that the fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm was significantly lower in plants in which the clock was not functional, and that Fv/Fm was slower to recover in these plants than in matched plants. To quantify the role of photoprotective versus photodamage in generating the reduction in Fv/Fm, we carried out additional analysis, that indicated little alteration in non-photochemical quenching, indicating the primary affect of dissonance is likely that it leads to increased photoinhibition. \n\nWe are particularly pleased with the career development achieved for three outstanding PDRA during the lifetime of the grant.\n\n1. Dr Anthony Dodd received a Royal Society University Research Fellowship and resigned to establish his own group in York.\n2. Dr Naomi Brown was employed, she received training in circadian biology and was able to publish a number of papers.\n3. Dr Sylvian Aubry was recruited to work in parallel with Dr Brown and was awarded a Swiss Government Fellowship which was augmented by an Isaac Newton Trust Award to Dr Webb to lever matching funds from the Swiss Government The initial findings of this research have gone on to be widely used by ourselves and others to investigate how plants control growth rate.
