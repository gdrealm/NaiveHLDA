We will collect field observations and develop and analyse an archive of film evidence recording interactions between and among pro-and anti- culling groups, cull contractors, companies, farmers and police officers as culling is being undertaken. A sample of people from each of these groups will be approached for in-depth interviews.</p>\n\n<p>Data will also be generated from social- and mass-media. An online deliberative forum will be used to understand the types of argumentation deployed on all sides of the debate. This will inform a Q-set (a set of key arguments used in the debate) that will be used to test the views of participants in deliberative forums before and after they participate in two deliberative events. These professionally facilitated deliberative forums will seek to negotiate a workable compromise for future TB policy. Q-methodology will allow us to assess the extent to which social science-led deliberative forums have been able to reduce key fracture points in the conflict. Finally, we will run focus groups with key policy makers assessing the utility of our approach for informing policy and the possibility of our findings shaping TB policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008106/1","grantId":"ES/L008106/1","fundValue":"161725","fundStart":"2013-10-21","fundEnd":"2015-04-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings are still preliminary because this is an on-going project.

Our (preliminary) on-line deliberative forum results suggest that the debate remains heavily polarised, with farmers in one camp strongly pro-cull and nature lovers juxtaposed against them. The two main sides of the debate deploy different rhetorical arguments to support their case, and effectively 'talk passed' one another, rather than to each other. But the debate is not entirely polarised. We have also discovered that there also exist a range of more nuanced arguments Our findings are useful for everyone involved in the debate to find a way out of the current policy deadlock. We hope to be able to illustrate a way to 'do TB differently': to deploy a range of knowledges to find more workable solutions to the bTB epidemic in cattle other than blanket badger culling.
