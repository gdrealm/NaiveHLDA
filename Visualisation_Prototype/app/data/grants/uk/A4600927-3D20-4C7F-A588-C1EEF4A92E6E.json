The proposed work is cross-disciplinary, bringing together physicists/engineers, chemists, biologists and medical scientists. We will break the first law of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - that the applied magnetic field must be held constant during image acquisition. By doing so we will gain access to radically new types of image contrast, with the potential to gain insight into disease processes at the molecular level. This new Basic Technology is called Fast Field-Cycled MRI (FFC-MRI).Since its inception in the 1970s, enormous advances have been made in every aspect of MRI, including hardware, techniques and applications. There has been a trend towards developing and using MRI at ever-increasing magnetic fields: 1.5 tesla MRI systems are now the norm, and whole-body systems up to 7 tesla are being installed in research centres. Existing MRI systems operate at one, and only one magnetic field strength, and the normal imaging process demands that the magnetic field be absolutely stable over time. The very fact that the field is fixed, however, denies access to a truly fundamental contrast mechanism, namely the dependence of the sample's (or patient's) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation times on the applied magnetic field. (In MRI, it is differences in the relaxation times that provide contrast between tissue types, and between normal and diseased tissue.) Any conventional MRI system can only provide information about the sample's relaxation times at one, fixed, magnetic field. In FFC-MRI the scanner's magnet will be switched rapidly (hence the Fast in FFC-MRI) between levels during the collection of an image, allowing the NMR-sensitive nuclei to evolve at the chosen magnetic field (or at a range of field values). The magnetic field will always be returned to a fixed magnetic field, however, in order to read out the NMR signals. In this way, the image contrast (arising from relaxation time differences) will be that appropriate to the chosen field, rather than to the readout magnetic field.By obtaining FFC-MR images at a range of switched fields, it will be possible to optimise the endogenous contrast contained in the variation of relaxation times with magnetic field strength - something that is completely hidden from normal, fixed-field MRI, no matter what that field strength is. Another contrast mechanism that is accessible to FFC-MRI (but inaccessible to standard MRI) is an effect called the quadrupole-dip , which provides quantitative information related specifically to protein concentration and dynamics. The ubiquity of proteins in the body, and their role in disease, makes the latter particularly attractive.FFC-MRI also offers radically new possibilities for exogenous contrast, via injected contrast agents. Another vital unifying strand of the new Basic Technology is the design of contrast agents that are precisely tailored for the new FFC-MRI instruments, in order to improve sensitivity and specificity by at least an order of magnitude compared to conventional contrast-enhanced MRI. The improved sensitivity and specificity will enable molecular imaging applications to be developed.In order to develop the basic technology of FFC-MRI, we will work closely with our Collaborators in the areas of magnets, MRI control systems and contrast agents. So that we can demonstrate the utility of FFC-MRI, we will explore applications that are likely to benefit from the method, from basic bio-medical science through sports science to potential clinical applications, as well as other areas, including the food industry. This proposal will create the potential to revolutionise the way that MRI is carried out, in the bio-medical research laboratory, in the clinic, and elsewhere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E036775/1","grantId":"EP/E036775/1","fundValue":"2417760","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Lurie","coPersons":["Fiona Jane Gilbert","Peter  Teismann","Alison  Murray","Henning  Wackerhage","Gernot  Riedel","Christopher  Linington","Nuala  Booth"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" The advantage of Fast Field-Cycling (FFC) MRI over conventional MRI is its ability to make measurements and collect images over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, whereas standard MRI scanners are fixed at a single value of magnetic field. FFC-MRI can measure the variation of a sample's T1 relaxation time as a function of magnetic field, using a method called relaxometry. The T1 dispersion plots produced provide information on the behaviour of samples or tissues at the molecular level, and are sensitive to changes in the concentration and motion of proteins, making FFC a potential detector and monitor of disease. The project involved four main aspects: development of the technology of FFC-MRI scanners; development of methods of FFC-MRI and associated software; development of contrast agents for FFC-MRI; studies of applications of FFC-MRI. Two FFC-MRI scanners were designed and built: firstly, a small-scale scanner (15 cm internal bore) was constructed. It used a single-magnet design and cycled up to 0.5 T with a field switching time of 15 ms. Results indicated the necessity to control precisely the electric current and the magnet's temperature. A human-scale FFC-MRI system was built, with a specification of detecting signals at up to 0.2 T with a switch time of 20 ms. Attention was paid to precise current monitoring and control, and a different design of magnet power supply was used. As an alternative to large-magnet FFC, a prototype small-scale field-offset coil was built. The 38 cm diameter &quot;pancake&quot; coil was designed to enable localised FFC-MRI as an add-on for vertical-field MRI scanners. Tests using a 59 mT whole-body MRI scanner were successful.Methods for collecting and analysing data collected using FFC were developed. Mathematical and computer models of the imaging process were constructed, and used to improve the accuracy of T1 dispersion data measured using FFC-MRI and relaxometry measurements. Contrast agents for use with FFC-MRI should exhibit significantly different relaxivity (efficiency) over the range of magnetic fields accessible by FFC-MRI. In that way, scans can be collected at field strengths where the effect of the contrast agent is (i) low and (ii) high, giving an increase in sensitivity. A number of potential contrast agents were studied, each with different relaxivity profiles. The optimum system was composed of liposomes (artificially prepared microscopic lipid vesicles) filled with manganese chloride. This agent exhibited 50% greater relaxivity at 1 mT than at 90 mT, making it ideal for use with FFC-MRI. Experiments on test objects demonstrated the expected improvement in sensitivity over a conventional MRI contrast agent.Applications of FFC-MRI and relaxometry that we explored relied on the particular form of T1 dispersion curves observable in samples (or tissues) containing immobile protein. These exhibit distinct dips at magnetic fields of 49 and 65 mT which are sensitive to protein concentration and motion. We studied this effect in a test-tube model of thrombosis and found that thrombus (blood clot) formation could be detected by relaxometry measurements. We also examined human hip and knee joints which had been removed from patients undergoing joint-replacement. The presence of osteoarthritis affected the relaxometry or FFC-MRI signal to a significant extent, meaning that this is a potential method of diagnosing this condition. Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the formation of protein tangles in cells within the brain. As a first step towards determining if PD is detectable using FFC-MRI, we developed methods to purify the protein alpha-synuclein, prior to measuring its T1 dispersion. Studies on volunteers showed that FFC could detect exercise-related changes in muscle. Non-medical applications of FFC were also explored, including studies of foodstuffs to attempt to detect counterfeit products, and to determine whether prior freeze-thaw cycles could be detected.
