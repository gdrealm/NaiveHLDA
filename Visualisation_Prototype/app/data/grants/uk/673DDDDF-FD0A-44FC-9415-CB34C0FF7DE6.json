Growing evidence supports a role of fruit and vegetable components called flavonoids and research shows that people who consume high intakes of flavonoid-rich foods have improved cardiovascular health. In particular, research shows that some flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods exert direct protective effects on blood vessel walls, and since cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and specifically stiffness of the arteries results from accumulated damage to blood vessel walls, these data suggest that flavonoids can help restore and optimise vessel function; therefore reducing CVD risk. When researchers measure the amount of any one type of flavonoid in the blood after we eat flavonoid-rich foods, their levels are too low to explain the observed cardiovascular benefit. Therefore, it is likely that the health benefits of flavonoid consumption results from the collective effects of consuming multiple types of flavonoids at the same time. We therefore believe that the health benefits resulting from flavonoid consumption must be the result of many different types of flavonoids working together, as happens when we eat them in our normal diet. Complex combinations of flavonoids are found in our blood and vessels as a result of the consumption of a diversity of flavonoid-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, chocolate, juice, wine, and tea. However, although we know that flavonoids are consumed as mixtures of compounds, to date, researchers have studied their impacts in isolation and using levels of flavonoids that are well above that which could be obtained through eating a normal diet. These existing findings are therefore likely to be inaccurate, making it difficult to use these findings to provide dietary advice for the health benefits of flavonoid consumption. We plan to study the cardiovascular benefits of consuming multiple flavonoids as would be consumed in the normal UK diet to provide more accurate data which could be used in the future to provide advice on the true health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Aims and objectives: We aim to use an advanced cell culture model involving both vascular and immune cells to establish if the beneficial effects of flavonoids on cardiovascular health are the result of many types of flavonoid working together. We will also apply flavonoids and their metabolites in both isolation and in combination to provide a more biologically realistic model. These studies will explore the activities of the flavonoids found in the highest abundance in the present UK diet as established using survey data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. As this survey established the current UK consumption of fruits and vegetables to be around 3 portions per day on average (and 2 portions below recommended intake levels), we will test the effects of consuming doses relative to 3, 5 and 7 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Implications: This proposal promotes a nutritional strategy to improve cardiovascular health using a 'natural' dietary approach, involving flavonoids from multiple food sources which hold strong industrial, agricultural and public relevance. This project will provide evidence of the health impact of our current dietary consumption of flavonoid-rich foods, in relation to reaching optimal levels of 5-a-day and above; and will aid in the design of future feeding interventions directed at addressing dietary change in the UK for health benefit. This project will also provide 'proof of concept' for the design of future flavonoid intervention trials by establishing optimal cardiovascular endpoints, flavonoids and doses. Lastly, establishing a shared and cumulative bioactivity of a number of flavonoids will aid in establishing future functional health claims for many products high in flavonoids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I006028/1","grantId":"BB/I006028/1","fundValue":"357230","fundStart":"2011-03-28","fundEnd":"2014-05-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin David Kay","coPersons":["Maria  O'Connell","Aedin  Cassidy"],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Since the commencement of this project (28th March 2011) we have assayed the toxicity of: 10 natural products (flavonoids), 10 metabolites, 28 combinations of these compounds, at concentrations roughly equivalent to a standard pharmacological dose, 7 portions of fruit and vegetables, or 5 portions of fruit and vegetables. We have found that only three of the compounds in this study are moderately cytotoxic at a pharmacological concentration (100 _M). The anti-inflammatory effect of all compounds has been assessed individually. We have found that at least 12 of the compounds exert significant anti-inflammatory effects at concentrations equal to or lower than those typically found in the human body. \n\n\n\nWe are currently assessing whether combinations of these compounds have a more pronounced anti-inflammatory effect. We have also assessed the ability of these compounds to reduce cellular free radical production. Data gathered so far suggests that any reduction in free radical production is minimal and not significant. Taken together, the data produced from this project to date suggests that both the natural products, and metabolites of the natural products have anti-inflammatory effects that could help protect against the development of early stages of cardiovascular disease. The compounds investigated are found in abundance in commonly consumed fruits and vegetables in the UK. As these compounds are found in such a diverse array of fruits and vegetables, beverages and other processed foods, the outputs from this project have widespread implications at both at the industrial and agricultural level. Evidence gathered from this study will help us to identify which natural products found within the U.K. diet have specific beneficial effects on human health (e.g. anti-inflammatory, lowing CVD risk, and the development of a healthy ageing phenotype). This will allow the development and informed marketing of products with known quantities of these bioactive components as 'functional-foods' for health and wellbeing. In addition, ascertaining the combined bioactivity of flavonoids will offer commercial benefit by establishing their functional significance, thus providing a foundation of evidence for future health claims for many products. \n\n\n\nBy assessing the effects of combinations of these compounds and their metabolites we can also help inform future clinical intervention studies by having already established the safety and bioactivity in cell/animal models. These data could help lead to the development of large-scale, long-term dietary interventions to determine the exact of effects these natural compounds have on chronic disease outcomes. Furthermore, findings from this study will provide evidence on the benefits to public health of consuming particular flavonoid rich items (e.g. berries, tea, apples) already prevalent in the U.K. diet; which is important given the current low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables in the UK. Ultimately, the evidence provided from this research could be used to establish optimal dietary levels, safety, efficacy and marketing strategies, and help regulatory agencies develop more specific policies regarding dietary guidelines for CVD prevention. The project is currently providing valuable information regarding the bioactivity of important, dietary available, flavonoids and their metabolites as potential cardioprotective agents. This will ultimately provide valuable evidence for academics, supporting the importance of studying the bioactivity of dietary flavonoids and metabolites both individually and collectively (i.e., in combination). \n\n\n\nThis project is of particular importance to phytochemcial researchers as the study design outlines an experimental approach for defining the active compounds responsible for the health benefits of certain foods; an approach which may be applied to future studies on other food-based bioactives. Establishing levels and efficacy of bioactive flavonoids and metabolites will also help determine optimal dietary levels, and clinical endpoints for use in future interventions aimed at establishing safety and bioactivity in cell/animal models. These findings will ultimately help the design of large-scale, long-term dietary interventions to determine effects on chronic disease outcomes.
