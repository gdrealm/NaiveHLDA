RCTs are increasingly seen as the gold standard for evaluating policy interventions in the UK and internationally. Given their growing importance in policy-making, the series will examine different disciplinary perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of the increased use of RCTs in policy areas including, and beyond, clinical medicine, social welfare, legal and justice services, human rights and global development.</p>\n\n<p>We will explore the ethical challenges raised by the increased uses of RCTs in poor and middle-income nations where regulatory infrastructures often receive less investment than in northern nations such as the UK and the United States, as well as examine the industries and academic institutions that are dominant in conducting trials. Our aim is to establish cross-disciplinary dialogue on this important tool of measurement and evidence-building, examining to what extent the setting of trials - ie national, international, public or commercial - affects the robustness, access and public value of RCT results. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000350/1","grantId":"ES/L000350/1","fundValue":"30488","fundStart":"2013-10-15","fundEnd":"2016-10-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Linsey  McGoey","coPersons":["Ann Horton Kelly","William James Davies","Salla  Sariola","Nancy  Cartwright","Ian  Harper"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
