{"id":"BC7CB0AC-CD17-4264-85E5-E377E41021E3","title":"INTRINSICALLY FAULT TOLERANT ACTUATION THROUGH HIGH REDUNDANCY","abstractText":"This proposal is based upon a novel idea in which actuators for high-integrity and/or safety-critical applications are provided by a system comprising a number of actuation elements. These elements are configured and controlled in such a way that faults in individual elements are inherently accommodated without resulting in a failure of the complete actuation system in contrast to current technology in which a relatively low level of functional redundancy is used. The research proposal is scientifically challenging and highly original, as well as being timely from an industrial viewpoint because of the burgeoning interest in high-integrity mechatronic applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078350/1","grantId":"EP/D078350/1","fundValue":"312548","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  One of the project partners wrote an exploitation report and the following is a quote:\n&amp;quot;The idea of actuators that do not fail, just degrade, is potentially extremely interesting to the company because assuring continued operation of a variety of systems, specially flight control, in the presence of actuator failures is a major task. Clearly the work has been focused upon proving the concept, and this has been done very effectively, but of course there is still much work to do to raise the Technology Readiness Level of this research above what has already been\nachieved.&amp;quot; Aerospace, Defence and Marine ","person":"Roger Morgan Goodall","coPersons":["Roger  Dixon","Argyrios  Zolotas"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":" We have demonstrated the feasibility of the high redundancy approach for actuation, which can either to replace or to complement established methods.\nSpecifically we have analysed a number of actuator configurations in a formal manner in order to determine how they might be applied, and assessed both their ability to tolerate faults and their reliability. This has been extended to develop control strategies that will tolerate faults in individual actuation elements while maintaining overall robust performance. Software and hardware concept demonstrators have been created, and some outline studies undertaken for associated health monitoring of the actuation elements. The concept is ahead of current industrial thinking and so immediate applications are limited. We submitted a second EPSRC grant proposal &quot;Technologies For High Integrity Actuation Using High Redundancy&quot; in order to specifically identify innovative technologies for the actuation elements, but this was not funded. Hence we are developing technologies via PhD student studies. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
