From the development of websites associated with particular programs, through to the advent of interactive, mobile and online TV, television might be thought of as a 'multiplatform' experience. Television is no longer simply the 'box in the corner', but experienced and produced across a range of screens, sites and technological platforms. \\n\\nThis expansion of channels and platforms brings about increased competition for audiences, who have seen their choices for how, when, where and what kind of television to watch expand dramatically. As a result, traditional broadcasters are experiencing a continuing decline in the number and amount of time audiences spend watching TV. This has called into question the role of PSB as a funding and regulatory model for UK television, with the media regulator, Ofcom, recently suggesting that the future of PSB is at a crossroads.\\n\\nPublic service broadcasters are responding to these challenges with new commissioning, technologies and production strategies. Our study focuses on the BBC's and Channel 4's adoption of multiplatform production and commissioning strategies, which seek to exploit content and engage viewers across a range of digital media platforms. Such strategies not only produce new TV forms, but require new production practices. However, these changes and pressures are not only experienced by the broadcasters, but also by the independent television production sector, which increasingly includes digital media companies, which supply programs and content to them. \\n\\nThis project seeks to understand the function both independent production companies and these multiplatform practices have in shaping the future of PSB in the digital age. We do this by firstly examining the role that specialist factual independent production companies play in contributing to the shifting characteristics of PSB in the UK. Secondly, we position this role in relation to the way in which the production cultures of this sector respond to and creatively negotiate the move to multiplatform television as part of the wider commercial, regulatory, technological and cultural challenges of the digital age. \\n\\nWe examine specialist factual programming as a genre both traditionally associated with notions of PSB, but also recently ranked as one of those most highly valued by participants in Ofcom's first phase of its current PSB review. To do this, rather than simply examine the amount of specialist programming produced or the audience's reaction to it, we seek to unpick the industry's own understanding of this genre's role in contributing to distinctive characteristics of the UK's PSB landscape. By drawing on interviews with, and participant observation of, workers in the independent specialist factual production sector, as well as with commissioners and key players in the broadcasting industries, our research will establish what challenges and opportunities digitalization brings PSB. We then test these 'self-theorizations' by examining the programming practices and content of the independent sector, regulatory documents and discourses circulated within and by the television industry through trade journals, press releases and other trade artifacts. \\n\\nBy disseminating this research to industry, regulators, audiences and higher education institutions, this project will therefore make an important contribution to understanding the future role and shape of PSB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H018522/2","grantId":"AH/H018522/2","fundValue":"128810","fundStart":"2011-04-26","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Funded by the AHRC, and in collaboration with University of Sussex and London Metropolitan University, this two-year research project explored the cultural and economic value of the independent TV and digital production sectors in relation to public service broadcasting (PSB) in a digital age. Impact was delivered via:\n1. An industry report: downloaded over 1000 times from the project website www.cowboysrorindies.co.uk. It featured as the leading story on Media Guardian on the day of release (http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/20/tv-indies-risky-shows-factual-entertainment). A further 100 hardcopies were distributed to industry, including a request for 25 reports from Channel 4. \n• The impact of the report was attested to in letters of support and acknowledgement from:\n• Head of Online, Channel 4, Richard Davidson-Houston (organizational strategy)\n• Ofcom (policy formation)\n• Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport (policy formation)\n• Creative England (industry value)\n• Commonwealth Broadcasting Association (member benefits)\n• Skillset (sector skills requirements)\n2. An industry-academic knowledge exchange conference marking 30 years of the independent sector attended by over 100 delegates, half of whom were current industry professionals. The list of speakers included the Chief Executive of PACT (Producers' Alliance of Cinema &amp; Television); Head of Channel 4 Online, and Chair of the National Skills Council for Digital Media \nThe research's impact is underpinned by the strategy of dissemination, dialogue and concern to address the needs and interests of industry user communities. The research team interviewed over 100 industry professionals over the course of the project, often returning to key interviewees to update them on findings and discuss ways forward. In particular, the research team engaged policy makers (Ofcom), trade bodies (PACT), individual companies (Maverick, Somethin' Else, Lambent, Illumina Digital) and broadcasters throughout the duration of the project to share initial findings, hold feedback meetings, and agree shared research priorities. This included a detailed survey of PACT's membership regarding multiplatform economic and production practices.

It set out a radical notion for the future regulation of public service broadcasting in the UK: that PSB is a joint enterprise between commercially driven independents and the broadcasters. The compact between Indies and PSBs is what makes UK content unique, exportable and delivers cultural value to its viewers and users. \nBut it also suggested that this relationship was ‘fragile’\n• Increasing competition and diminishing security of PSB funding may reduce the commitment of independents to producing content with PSB characteristics;\n• Changes in the sector that have fostered competition have also brought about increased consolidation, an emphasis on formats and international sales that can heighten pressure on production budgets, reducing creative freedoms, working conditions and individual workers’ belief in PSB\n\nThe report made a series of recommendations to safeguard the compact, including addressing issues of rights negotiation; supplier lists for the broadcaster’s relationship with the digital sector; regulation of the emerging connected TV market; an extended role for Ofcom training and accountability. Anyone interested in the future of television in the context of a digital media ecosystem will find the research useful, particularly for understanding how the industry engages with the problem of digital. It is particularly useful for those concerned with the future of public service broadcasting in a global context, but also the formation of public service media - which might combine public sector resources in providing digital media experiences. It was most recently used by Ofcom, again, in setting policy direction for convergence television and connected TV. It is also useful for those wishing to study production cultures of the television and digital industries.
