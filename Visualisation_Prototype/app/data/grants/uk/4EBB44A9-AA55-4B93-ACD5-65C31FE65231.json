{"id":"4EBB44A9-AA55-4B93-ACD5-65C31FE65231","title":"Experiences of female migrant sex workers from Eastern Europe and effect of multiple vulnerabilities on risk of STIs/HIV","abstractText":"Most countries view migrants as a health threat, yet the process of migration is a health threat to migrants themselves and this in turn can cause risk to the receiving communities. The mobile nature of the communities, language barriers and illegal or undocumented status often means they are likely not to benefit from public health programmes or access health services which tend to target more stable communities. These reasons contribute to the lack of knowledge of migrant sex workers in London. There is little information on how migrant sex workers are established within social networks in the UK and how these social networks can provide support to promote safer sex practices. What is also lacking is information on whether the duration of stay in the UK affects their ability to make social connections, increases or decreases risk of being infected with STIs and other harms associated with sex work. Our research aims to answer these questions with a view to contributing to the design and delivery of appropriate health promotion interventions and increasing access to sexual health services. Through conducting in depth interviews with migrant sex workers the research will build up a picture of the different types of sex work that are occurring and how migrant women end up as sex workers. By collecting data on levels of sexually transmitted infections amongst migrant sex workers and UK born sex workers the research will highlight whether migrant sex workers are at more risk of STIs than UK sex workers and point to some of the reasons behind this. The findings of the research will serve to improve access and effective delivery of sexual health services for sex workers including migrant sex workers and will explore the effect of multiple deprivations such as poverty, poor housing, lack of residency status on vulnerability to STIs and how these factors interact with migration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601673","grantId":"G0601673","fundValue":"232883","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucy Victoria Platt","coPersons":["Christopher Philip Bonell","Kaye  Wellings","Tim  Rhodes","Dalya  Marks","Joanna  Busza"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
