The type of radiation emitted depends on the dimensions and composition of the targets; these factors also determine the unique spatial and temporal properties of the radiation sources, which have an extremely small size (of micrometer order - a millionth of a meter) and emit ultra-short radiation bursts (of picosecond duration, i.e. a millionth of a millionth of a second). Development of basic source technology will provide compact and flexible sources with optimal properties for use in industrial and medical context. We identify protons, ions and gamma rays as the products with the highest potential benefit to society, and will concentrate our efforts on developing sources of these radiation types. Applications of this technology are envisaged in the following areas:Medicine - improved cancer treatment using laser-energised protons and ions, at a significantly lower cost than currently achieved and with reduced radiation shielding requirements;radiobiology studies using multiple simultaneous radiations to simulate cosmic ray effects during air and space travelIndustry - in-situ flash radiography, satellite radiation hardness testing, engineering diagnostics, semiconductor production and manufacturing controlScience - opportunities for versatile production of intense, synchronised beams from a robust and compact source, allowing novel experiments requiring simultaneous delivery of different types of radiation (pump-probe experiments).Security - rapid imaging detection of hidden materials/explosives using gamma-ray tomography and activation techniques for rapid chemical analysis.The proposed project aims to develop the relevant technology for high-flux, high-repetition source delivery and characterisation, while achieving the standards of output beam quality and reliability essential for the above applications. These will be achieved via a combination of innovative developments in target production and delivery, detector technology, beam property optimization and control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E035728/1","grantId":"EP/E035728/1","fundValue":"4707230","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Marco  Borghesi","coPersons":["Bleddyn  Jones","Andrew David  Ward","Stuart  Green","Roger Gwynne Evans","Karen Joy Kirkby","Zulfikar  Najmudin","Roger Paul Webb","Martin Keith Tolley","David  Neely","Paul  McKenna","Ken  Ledingham","K Matthew Zepf","Michael  Kraft","Dino Anthony  Jaroszynski","John  Collier","Wilfried  Galster","Klaus  Spohr","Robert  Stevens"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" The project has been devoted to the development of novel techniques of acceleration of ions based on the use of high power lasers. In parallel, activities have been dedicated to deploying the laser-driven ion beams in innovative applications, and to the development of new technologies (targetry and diagnostics) related to these ion sources. The project has been highly successful and has led to a number of very significant advances in this area, as testified by the large number of high quality publications (~ 70 papers published so far, 15 of which in Physical Review Letters - one of the highest impact physics journals) and invited presentations associated to the project.\n\nA number of acceleration mechanisms have been explored. \n\nIn the first approach (Sheath Acceleration, SA) the ions are accelerated by the transient, ultralarge electric field produced at the surfaces of laser-irradiated foils by bursts of laser-energized electrons. The LIBRA project has demonstrated a number of methods by which the properties of the resulting ion beams can be controlled by acting on either the irradiated sample or the laser pulse. Highlights include: demonstration and characterization of ion beam focusing from curved foils; first demonstration of ion energy increase by decreasing the transverse size of the irradiated foil (limited mass targets); control of the beam energy spectrum by shaping the temporal profile of the laser light irradiating the sample. \n\nHighly significant results relate to the investigation of a novel, different approach (Radiation Pressure Acceleration, RPA), in which the ions are pushed forward under the effect of the enormous light pressure carried by an ultraintense laser pulse. This mechanism has been investigated numerically, which has clarified the detailed and complex dynamics of the process, discussed in a number of highly cited publications. The LIBRA consortium has also obtained the first demonstrations of monochromatic ion beams obtained through RPA, employing two complementary approaches (Hole Boring - where the ions have been accelerated in gas media- and Light Sail - where the light pressure is used to propel forward to high energies an ultrathin ion layer). The theoretical predictions and experimental observations indicate routes to increasing the energy of RPA ions to regimes of relevance to cancer therapy or high energy physics applications.\n\nAn additional result, of high applicative interest, has been the development of laser-driven sources of high-energy negative ions and neutral atoms, arising, through previously unexplored processes, from the interaction of intense laser pulses with water spray targets. \n\nAmong the applications explored, radiography of plasmas employing these beams, a technique pioneered by consortium members, has been refined during the course of the project and applied to obtain world-leading results in the investigation of plasma dynamics on ultrafast timescales, and of phenomena of relevance to astrophysical objects.\n\nThe beams have also been applied in innovative radiobiology experiments, to test the biological effects of ultrafast ion energy deposition on cells, of possible relevance to future modes of cancer therapy. Finally, initial results have been obtained in experiments aimed to explore the dynamics of ion damage of materials. As discussed above, there are potential applications of laser-driven ion beams in a number of non -academic contexts:\n\n1) Healthcare. Laser-driven ions show potential for future use in cancer therapy and diagnosis. Ion beams from conventional accelerators are already used in this context, but the large size and cost of the installations is preventing their widespread use (e.g. use of ions for cancer therapy in the UK is severely limited at the moment, despite the proven clinical advantages of this approach in a number of cases). If laser acceleration could match in the future the requirements in terms of energy and stability, it could become a competitor technology with potential benefit in terms of cost and installation constraints. Also in the healthcare context, there have been world-wide interruptions in the production of medical isotopes in recent years. Intense proton sources such as now available from high energy lasers may provide an alternative route of isotope production which could, in due course, be very compact and cost-effective.\n\n2) Industrial applications. Laser-driven sources are highly versatile. By changing the irradiated sample, it is possible to change the accelerated species, and we have demonstrated that it is possible to accelerate both negative and positive ions, and even neutrals. This versatility, as the ability of accelerating easily ions to multi-MeV energies, may be of relevance to a range of manufacturing/industrial activities, such as ion lithography and ion implantation. Laser-ion sources offer also unique capabilities for testing the resilience of materials under intense ion bombardment, and for investigating the fundamental processes taking place during the ion interaction with substrates of relevance to manufacturing. Some of the technical developments achieved during the project may also find application in an industrial/manufacturing context: for example the development of electrostatic/electromagnetic levitators and propellers for target injection may find application in sensor technology. Techniques for mass production of micro-disk targets based on silicon etching have also potential for wide use in a large number of contexts.\n\n3) Energy. Application in this context mainly relates to use in Thermonuclear Fusion. Laser-driven ions have been proposed as the trigger to start fusion ignition in a compressed fusion fuel, in the so-called Fast Ignition approach, but they can also be used to diagnose the compression process, or to achieve information on several aspects of the laser-driven Inertial Confinement Fusion approach. As mentioned earlier, there may be also a role to play for laser-driven ions in diagnosing plasmas inside the tokamaks used in magnetic confinement fusion (the approach brought forward by the ITER project) and for investigating the resilience of materials to be used as vessels to contain the fuel of future fusion plants. Thanks to the ultralarge accelerating fields that can be obtained, techniques based on high power lasers can in future lead to a reduction in size and cost of large-scale accelerators, and therefore facilitate broad use of high-energy accelerators in science, medicine and technology. In particular, there is scope for exploring the potential of laser-driven ion sources for medical applications such as cancer therapy and diagnosis. Proposed designs based on laser-driven sources may lead to advantages also in terms of reduction of shielding and ion beam transport requirements, reducing for example the size of the size of the gantries, enormous magnetic systems used to stir the beam around the patient. At present, innovative programmes of radiobiology at dose rates never expolored before, have been facilitated by the ultrashort, laser driven ion sources.\n\nBright beams of energetic ions may find application in industrial context, as sources for ion implantation and lithography. Thanks to the large numbers of ions produced during a single laser irradiation, laser-driven sources can allow testing proton damage of semiconductors, simulating conditions encountered in satellites exposed to protons from solar events. Ion damage of materials at high flux is also of relevance to the design of future nuclear plants based on thermonuclear fusion.\n\nIn a fusion energy context, beams of high energy negative ions and neutrals are also of potential use for diagnosing conditions in the interior of the large vessels (tokamaks) containing the fusion plasmas in the magnetic confinement approach.\n\nUse of the ion beams in radiography is already exploiting the unique properties of the beams (particularly ultrashort duration and excellent spatial emission quality) for obtaining novel information of the dynamics of large electric and magnetic fields associated to plasma phenomena - providing in this way data of great importance to activities aimed to achieve thermonuclear fusion, or to investigate, in the laboratory, phenomena of astrophysical relevance.\n\nThe beams of ions produced by lasers are also already employed to produce, by heating secondary samples, novel states of matter at solid density, at temperatures in excess of 100,000 K , the so called Warm Dense Matter regime, which is studied for its relevance to conditions in the core of planets, and in compressed thermonuclear fusion fuel.
