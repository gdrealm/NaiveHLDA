These 'pili' or 'fimbriae' contain at their tip a special protein molecule, called an adhesin, which allows the bacteria to attach to the host cell surface, thereby initiating the process of infection. These hair-like structures are formed from the assembly of hundreds of copies of protein subunits with similar structure into a long polymer chain linked by non-covalent interactions between each subunit. A complex folding and assembly machinery known as the chaperone-usher pathway is responsible for the assembly of these pili, typified by the P pili of uropathogenic E. coli. Key components of this pathway include (i) a specific chaperone which is needed to fold the pilus subunit into an assembly-competent conformation and to prevent premature subunit assembly in the periplasmic space; (ii) the pilus subunits themselves which, in the case of P pili, involves six different subunit types; and (iii) an outer membrane-embedded usher protein, which acts as the assembly platform where chaperone:pilus subunit complexes are brought to the basal end of the growing pilus for subsequent incorporation into the growing fibre. In a manner that is currently not understood, and is entirely independent of ATP, the usher catalyzes pilus assembly, adds a defined, specially chosen subunit to the base of the growing pilus, and extrudes it to the outer surface of the bacterium. The usher also serves as an anchor, tethering the pilus to the bacterial surface, arming the bacterium for attack. In recent years the X-ray structures of several pilus chaperones have been elucidated, along with many pilus subunits (known as pilins). Fascinatingly, these studies have shown that pilins have a common structure, based on an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold. However, whilst the canonical Ig fold contains seven ?-strands, the pilins have only six strands and their structure is thus incomplete and unstable. One role of the chaperone is to donate a ?-strand to the pilus subunit, temporarily completing its content of ?-strands. During pilus assembly the chaperone's ?-stand is then displaced from its binding site by the incoming pilin subunit, which forms a new ?-strand from its initially disordered N-terminal region (known as the N-terminal extension (Nte)), resulting in a very stable, intermolecular chain of Ig molecules. The ordered assembly of bacterial pili provides a fascinating problem in structural biology and molecular recognition that has far-reaching impact. First, it poses important fundamental questions about molecular self-assembly mechanisms and asks to what extent these are dictated by the biophysical properties of the amino acid chain (its sequence, or the kinetics or thermodynamics of the interactions) and how these are controlled, modulated and/or coordinated in vivo. Secondly, and equally importantly, elucidation of the molecular mechanism of pilus formation has immense importance for the possible development of new anti-microbial agents against bacterial infection mediated by pili. In this proposal we describe a series of experiments involving three applicants with complementary expertise that aim to reveal how proteins assemble into pili in unprecedented detail. Specifically, our aims are to determine the role of the N-terminal extension (Nte), the chaperone:subunit complex, and the soluble N-terminal domain of the membrane-bound usher in defining and controlling the order of subunit-assembly. Finally using our ability to purify intact functional usher protein we aim to develop an assay capable of providing the first insights into pilus assembly at a membrane surface in vitro.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F012284/1","grantId":"BB/F012284/1","fundValue":"433331","fundStart":"2009-02-09","fundEnd":"2012-02-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Methods for analysis of non-covalent complexes were utilised in the grant.

To make this happen, a specific chaperone is used to fold the pilus subunit into an\nassembly-competent conformation and an outer membrane-embedded protein, called the usher then assembles the pilus\nand pushed each subunit out of the bacteria in a specific order. The usher also serves as an anchor, tethering the pilus to\nthe bacterial surface, arming the bacterium for attack.\nUnderstanding how the usher orchestrates folding of pili is fascinating, fundamental question in biology. It is also of\nimportance since disabling pilus assembly may provide a new route for the creation of anti-microbial compounds, much\nneeded in the background of the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this project we developed novel assays\nusing mass spectrometry to work out how the pilus subunits assemble in such a specific manner. Two different approaches\nwere taken. First, we looked at the extent to which subunit assembly specificity is inherently encoded in the different amino\nacid sequences found in each subunit type. We then expanded on these results to examine how the usher protein itself\nbrings about rapid and specific assembly. New tasks for different parts of the usher were discovered using the approach we\ndeveloped, and we were able to propose relay of hand-over-hand passing of different subunits to different parts of the\nusher to bring about specific assembly. Finally, and in very exciting experiments, we used mass spectrometry to examine\nthe intact usher protein itself in the act of pilus assembly. This was a major feat of experimentation since the analysis of\nmembrane proteins using mass spectrometry, especially large protein complexes, is at the very forefront of this technology.\nThis work has not yet been published, but it paves the way for an analysis of pilus assembly in real time and, in the future,\ncould provide important information into how potential inhibitors of pilus assembly act.
