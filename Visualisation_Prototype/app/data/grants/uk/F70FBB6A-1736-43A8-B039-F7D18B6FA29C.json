{"id":"F70FBB6A-1736-43A8-B039-F7D18B6FA29C","title":"Proposal to Extend the Research Data Facility at the University of Edinburgh","abstractText":"This proposal aims to construct a highly energy-efficient extension to the University of Edinburgh's Advanced Computing Facility (ACF) to house the next generation High Performance Computer (HPC), ARCHER. The ACF, which is situated on a science park to the south of the city of Edinburgh, was completely refurbished in 2004 to house all present and planned HPC systems operated by the University. From 2007 it has been the home for the HECToR service and currently we are installing the DiRAC BlueGene/Q there. It is a free-standing non-public-access building offering excellent security. The specification, design and implementation of the new facility are being carried out by the same University/private enterprise partnership who undertook the original refurbishment, the extension and upgrades required for HECToR in 2007, and the upgrade for BlueGene/Q in 2011. The extension will add 500 square metres of floor space and 3MW of electrical power capacity, achieving power usage effectiveness (power used by the centre/power used by ARCHER) less than 1.1, the current state-of-the-art. The project is proceeding on a timetable to complete the building extension, and mechanical and electrical installations, by March 2013, so that the first phase of ARCHER can be installed and service begun as soon as the hardware procurement is completed and the computer ready.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505924/1","grantId":"EP/L505924/1","fundValue":"8077860","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The first phase of the UKRDF facility has been installed, is operating and is providing data stroage services to a wide range of researchers around the UK.

In 2013 we proposed a radical change to change the RCUK strategy to become data-centric. The UKRDF is the instantiation of that new vision. The UKRDF infrastructure and the services ruuning on it are fed into European and international projects designed to establish best practice in a rapidly developing area.
