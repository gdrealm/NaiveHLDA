Format: Two 7-day courses will be offered to introduce researchers to complexity science and network theory and to teach them the use of both qualitative and quantitative tools and methods. The trainees will be expected to use the methods taught in practice. Each course will therefore be offered in two sessions: one of 4-days at the beginning of the Spring Term in 2006 and 2007 and another of 3-days at the beginning of the Summer Term. In the intervening period trainees will have to conduct a set of interviews, transcribe them, analyse them using complexity theory and present them back to the group for further training. An agent based model and simulation will also be built, in the intervening period, using data provided by the trainees. This will allow them to experiment with the model during Session 2. 2. Qualitative methods: The trainees will be taught how to conduct interviews, analyse the data and present it for validation. The analysis will use the principles of complexity developed by the LSE Complexity Research Group over a 10-year period working collaboratively with business partners to test and apply the theory. The interviews are usually analysed by at least three researchers to reduce interpretation bias. Groups of trainees will be encouraged, if feasible, to work together on a single case to help them experience the value of the above process. 3. Guidelines will be provided by the PI on creating the list of topics, conducting the interviews, analysing the data and conducting a Reflect-Back Workshop to validate the findings.4. ABM: The qualitative method will be complemented by an introduction to agent-based modelling. Module 1 will be taught in Session 1 and Module 2 in Session 2. Each module will use a variety of demonstrations. MODULE 1 / Session 1: pre-Spring Term 2006 and 2007Brief Introduction to Complexity (Limits of Prediction)Deterministic Chaos, High Dimensionality, Intelligent Systems (Limits and State of AI), Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems, Neural Nets, Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy LogicAgent Based Modelling: Brief History (NK model, Swarm, SugarScape, Growing Artificial Societies, Would be Worlds)The trainees will be assisted to prepare a questionnaire focusing on the connectivity within the group. Dr Bilge will use the data from the questionnaire to build and customise an ABM, for Session 2. MODULE 2 / Session 2: pre-Summer Term 2006 and 2007Module 2 / Discussion of customised ABM simulator using 'what if' questions and experimenting with alternative structures and configurations, in a safe space. A simulator can also show the dynamic properties of organisational networks. 5. Software-based analysis and ABM questionnaire: Discussion of the use of Atlas/ti, a software tool for assisting qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts; Ms M. Nolas will also discuss the development of a questionnaire for the ABM. 6. Network Theory: Professor Jeff Johnson from the Open University will discuss network theory and its applications to complex social systems. He will also link it to ABM. At the conclusion students will be able to recognise some of the basic properties of networks, appreciate the historical development of network theory, and understand how network theory can be used to model human systems and their dynamics.7. Practitioners: Business partners from past projects will be invited to talk to the trainees about their experience in working on a collaborative action research project and the benefits derived from using complexity.8. Other tools &amp; methods: The Group has experiment with several other tools and methods incl. a tool based on psychological profiles, another used to map email connectivity and with visual representation. A description of all 3 will be included. Trainees will be encouraged to debate the value and contribution of these and other tools and methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D033268/1","grantId":"EP/D033268/1","fundValue":"74406","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2008-01-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"E  Mitleton- Kelly","coPersons":["Jeffrey  Johnson"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
