{"id":"3F6FA5EC-12F1-47AE-946C-ECA271FFD78C","title":"General and specific risk markers &amp; preventive factors for chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes","abstractText":"This research is examining the causes of chronic fatigue/ME and irritable bowel syndrome in the 1958 British Birth cohort, using data on health, family, education, and occupation gathered in childhood and adulthood before the illness develops. An understanding of the causes of these illnesses will contribute to preventing illness, as well as provide useful information for doctors, care providers, and patients and their families. Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ME is a debilitating illness, where the sufferer experiences long-term mental and physical tiredness that seriously affects daily life and activities. Little is known about what causes the illness. Few studies have information about the individualâ€™s life before the illness develops and those that do suggest differing evidence for exercise, childhood illness and childhood depression as causes of chronic fatigue. Studies have also not yet examined whether the causes of chronic fatigue are different to the causes of other similar disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome. This project is examining factors from childhood and adulthood that are thought to cause the development of chronic fatigue and which may also cause irritable bowel syndrome including childhood and adulthood depression, exercise habits, serious illnesses, neglect, and poor parenting in childhood.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701032","grantId":"G0701032","fundValue":"164050","fundStart":"2008-05-27","fundEnd":"2010-05-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte Elizabeth Clark","coPersons":["Stephen  Stansfeld","Matthew  Hotopf","Peter Denton White"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
