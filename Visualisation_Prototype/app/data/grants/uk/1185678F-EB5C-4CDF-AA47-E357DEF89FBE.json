{"id":"1185678F-EB5C-4CDF-AA47-E357DEF89FBE","title":"Physics coordination of the ATLAS collaboration","abstractText":"The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the two large detectors which will study collisions of protons with protons when the LHC first turns on for science in 2008. ATLAS will be sensitive to many different types of interactions taking place in these collisions. The energy of the colliding particles is seven times higher than in previous experiments, and so there is a big possibility of processes being seen which have never been seen before - i.e. that new physics may be discovered. Such new processes have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the deepest structure of matter and the forces of nature. The principal investigator will act as 'Physics Coordinator' for ATLAS during 2008/9. This will involve directing the physics research and setting priorities, as well as management of effort and ensuring that physics results are carefully checked.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F006454/1","grantId":"ST/F006454/1","fundValue":"47732","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The understanding of the performance of ATLAS with cosmic rays, and the preparations of ATLAS software and analysis teams for first data, have benefitted the subsequent LHC physics programme with collision data.
