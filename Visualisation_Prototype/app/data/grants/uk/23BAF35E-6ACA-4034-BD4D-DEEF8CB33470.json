Meeting China’s increased demand for resources from Africa and expanding her markets also means securing political influence. Over the past few years China has pumped in much aid and technical support to Africa and for the first time since the end of the Cold War African leaders have genuine choices about which aid donors and investors to work with. Given the problems of governance across much of the continent these new economic and political choices will have major impacts on African leaders, political parties, civil society groups and other aid donors. </p> \n<p>This research assesses what impacts Chinese aid, trade and investment are having on the politics of specific African countries and the extent to which it excites geopolitical competition. This will be examined through case studies of Angola and Ghana, which represent different examples of China’s development ‘partnerships’ in Africa. Angola possesses oil resources that China desperately needs, whereas Ghana lacks strategic resources, but is an important market and political ally. The research is based on semi-structured interviews with opinion leaders and case studies of specific Sino-African collaborations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0487","grantId":"RES-062-23-0487","fundValue":"296444","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Most of our findings have been used by researchers, either in academia or policy-related fields.

This assumption reflected a deep-seated wariness about the Chinese. Our research on Chinese aid and investment in Ghana and Angola showed a much more mixed picture. In some cases, such as infrastructure loans, the Chinese brought benefits. But in other sectors they competed with African businesses which was more negative. Our empirical findings have contributed to a growing body of work on the variegated impact of the Chinese on African countries and people.\nWe also sought to theorise our findings since much of the discussion of China in Africa had been descriptive. Our ideas on geopolitics, geography and African agency have been taken up by others. Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
