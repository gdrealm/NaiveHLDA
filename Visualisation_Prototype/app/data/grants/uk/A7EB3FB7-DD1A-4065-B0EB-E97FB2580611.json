As the size of these features reaches the level of tens of nanometres, researchers are becoming ever more interested in the possibility of using assemblies of organic molecules as circuit components, even down to the level of single molecules. Very sophisticated molecules, designed to imitate simple circuit elements such as diodes, have been synthesised. But a key issue is the necessity to contact such molecules electrically - to 'wire' them into circuits. We, along with many other researchers worldwide, have been studying the properties of molecules terminated with sulfur atoms, which attach readily to gold surfaces. In our work, we have developed two related techniques for measuring the conductance of small integer numbers, n, of molecules, including n = 1. The molecules are sandwiched between two gold contacts. We do this by adapting the technique of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in which the position of an atomically-fine metal tip is controlled very precisely over a metal surface. With the right conditions, we can persuade sulfur-terminated molecules to bridge between the metal (gold) surface and the STM tip. We can then measure the current that flows through the molecule(s). Using this method, we recently discovered that the conductance of single molecules called oligothiophenes was several hundred times higher in the presence of water than when water was carefully excluded from the experiment. This is important for several reasons. Firstly, if the electrical properties of molecules depends on their environment, we will have to take care to exclude water in molecular electronics devices. But more intriguing, we could perhaps make very sensitive sensors by designing 'host' molecules that change their conductance on exposure to a particular target molecule.In this proposal, we seek to explore the origins of this 'medium' effect, and to examine how it can be controlled. We also want to find better ways to calculate the conductance of metal|molecule|metal junctions taking into account the presence of water, or other solvent ('medium') molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H035184/1","grantId":"EP/H035184/1","fundValue":"325979","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings are at too early a stage to have been used.

Single molecules will inevitably be surrounded by other molecules. We wanted to test the effect of their surroundings on the electrical properties of molecules, some of which were designed specifically to interact with other (target) molecules. This could ultimately be of interest for designing very sensitive sensors. We have found that we can indeed control these interactions and that they can have a profound effect upon molecular conductances. Potentially high impact papers on this topic are under preparation We think that the findings will initially stimulate work by other groups in the field in academia. Depending upon the outcomes, this may later be of technological interest for sensing. Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
