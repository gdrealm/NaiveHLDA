{"id":"58ED2AB3-0F7F-4B60-A21A-F1EF62342B55","title":"Methodological search filter performance: assessment to improve efficiency of evidence information retrieval.","abstractText":"NICE requires research to help it decide which treatments and diagnostic methods should be funded by the NHS. NICE has highlighted the need for research into the methods for reviewing evidence from research. Identifying research studies underpins most NICE reviewing. Methodological search filters are widely used to identify specific research designs such as randomized controlled trials or economic evaluations. Search filters are carefully selected collections of words and phrases used to search databases to identify research.\n\nLittle is known about how well search filters work in finding research. This means that their use as a standard tool for NICE researchers may not be informed by adequate information to indicate how search filters perform across different subjects, questions and databases. \n\nOur proposal is to investigate how search filter performance can be measured and what measures are most useful to researchers. We also plan to investigate systems and approaches to provide better access to relevant and useful performance data on methodological search filters. The benefits of this research would be to enhance the tools and knowledge of the tools available to find research evidence to inform NICE appraisals, guidelines and other guidance. The research findings would also benefit other national technology assessment agencies, guidelines groups and related bodies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901496","grantId":"G0901496","fundValue":"95539","fundStart":"2010-05-14","fundEnd":"2012-05-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Lefebvre","coPersons":["Julie May Glanville","Sophie Julia Beale","Cynthia  Fraser","Lynne  Smith","Charles  Boachie","Jenny  Harbour","Steven  Duffy"],"organisation":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
