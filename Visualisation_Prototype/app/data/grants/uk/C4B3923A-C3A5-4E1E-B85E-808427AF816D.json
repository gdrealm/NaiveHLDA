In groups of 20, teenagers participated in a &quot;hot-table&quot; session wherein they spent thirty minutes engaging in each activity, before moving onto the next. \n\n\n\nSchools completed diaries and participated in focus groups after the event to measure any impact on saving energy the awareness day had. This data is currently beign analysed.\n\nThe data from this event is still being analysed. Initial findings reveal teenagers and teachers who attended the event, completed diaries and participated in focus groups after the event became more aware of saving energy in all types of environments.\n\nBeneficiaries: students, teachers and the research group\n\nContribution Method: The research contributed to the event by teenagers exploring and using prototype devices developed in the project as well as undertaking different energy tasks.\n\nThis was a one day worskshop held at the Centre for Life In Newcastle. Nicola Toth and Linda Little ran a session about energy use which included two interactive activities.\n\nThis one day conference was attended by primary school children from schools across the North East of England. The conference involved a variety of interactive activities and subsequently the children presented their opinions about what both scientists and everyone should be doing for the planet. Nicola Toth and Linda Little ran a session which included two interactive activities about energy use, based on the grant. The conference was covered in the media (The Journal and The Chroncile newspapers) and included within the School of Life Sciences (Northumbria University) Research and Innovative Bulletin.\n\nBeneficiaries: School children Education,Energy,Environment Societal","person":"Linda  Little","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
