This is surprising, since HEI generated knowledge and research is increasingly seen as an important stimulant of economic growth, especially for improving the development capabilities and economic performance of regions. This raised awareness has also occurred at a time when variations in underlying levels of knowledge are further understood to be important determinants of disparities in regional competitiveness.</p>\n\n<p>The key aim this study is to assess and analyse the impact of HEI generated knowledge on the competitiveness of UK regions. The study focuses on a regional comparison of HEI knowledge flows to the business community and other institutions both within and external to the region in which particular HEIs are based. It analyses the impact of HEI knowledge in relation to the type of knowledge, the flow mechanisms, and the types of actors ‘receiving’ this knowledge. Whilst drawing comparisons across the twelve UK regions, further comparison is made at an international level, with a parallel study of the Chicago Metropolitan region being undertaken by researchers in the United States.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017517/1","grantId":"ES/E017517/1","fundValue":"28165","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Alan Huggins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
