The lower background achieved through the development of new photomultiplier tubes and the addition of an active scintillator veto surrounding the WIMP target will be translated into improved sensitivity. This will allow us to probe even deeper into the parameter space that WIMPs are predicted to inhabit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000011/1","grantId":"ST/I000011/1","fundValue":"180461","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Findings from this work are used by the wider scientific community (astrophysics, cosmology, particle physics) and by the media, who report on these topics quite frequently - the search for dark matter attracts significant attention from the public at large.
