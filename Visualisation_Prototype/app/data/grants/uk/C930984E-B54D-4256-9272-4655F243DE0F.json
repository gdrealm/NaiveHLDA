These data are making it possible to investigate large\nnumbers of stars using asteroseismology, the study of stars by\nobservation and analysis of their intrinsic oscillations.\n\nSignificant uncertainties in our understanding of stars (including the\nSun) have a direct impact on wider areas of astronomy, e.g.,\ncalibration of distances on extra-galactic scales, fixing the ages of\nthe oldest stellar populations (which place tight constraints on\ncosmologies), and tracing the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies. State-of-the-art studies of stars are also crucial to a\ncomplete understanding of the formation and evolution of exoplanetary\nsystems, and inferences made on stars from asteroseismology allow\ndirect constraints to be placed on exoplanet properties (e.g., sizes,\nlocations in habitable zones, ages etc.). Asteroseismic studies of\nmagnetic activity, and variability, provide information on how stars\ninteract with their local environments (with obvious implications for\nexoplanet habitability). Stars are the visible building-blocks of the\nUniverse and the nearest star to us, the Sun, is vital to life on\nEarth. The internal mechanisms responsible for solar activity, and its\nvariability, lie at one end of the chain stretching from the Sun to\nthe Earth. Variability of the Sun remains poorly understood. The Sun\nalso plays the role of a fundamental calibrator, and reference, for\ndifferent areas of stellar structure and stellar evolution\ntheory. Hence, elucidating the details of its structure and dynamics\nis key, not only in the context of understanding the Sun, but also\nother stars.\n\nThis programme of research is a joint bid between the seismology\ngroups at the University of Birmingham (UoB) and Queen Mary,\nUniversity of London (QMUL). It brings together world-leading\nexpertise from UoB and QMUL in asteroseismology and helioseismology,\nwith projects on observation, data analysis and modelling of the Sun\nand solar-type stars, red giants, and massive main-sequence stars.\nThe programme will make use of state-of-the-art asteroseismic\nobservations by the NASA Kepler Mission and the French-led CoRoT\nsatellite, of solar-type stars, red giants and massive main-sequence\nstars. In studies of the Sun, UoB will continue to run the Birmingham\nSolar-Oscillations Network (BiSON), collecting world-leading data on\nmodes that penetrate the solar core.\n\nOur programme of research will develop and apply new methods for estimating\naccurate and precise stellar properties, and for mapping the internal\nstructures and dynamics of the stars. We shall also provide the\ncleanest picture yet of the core of our own star, the Sun; and\nestablish whether the recent, unusual activity behaviour of the Sun\nhas left any significant, long-standing changes, or &quot;scars&quot;, beneath\nits visible surface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J001163/1","grantId":"ST/J001163/1","fundValue":"931954","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Yvonne  Elsworth","coPersons":["William James Chaplin"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
