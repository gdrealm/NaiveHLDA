However, a fundamental problem is that almost all the evidence arises from a simple measure of how long infants look at specific events, longer looking being taken as indication that infants' expectations regarding object permanence etc have been violated.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, there is a growing literature indicating perceptual constraints on young infants' ability to perceive an object's trajectory as it passes behind a screen: young infants only succeed when the perceptual 'gap' is small. This supports an empiricist account through which infants gradually developing awareness of perceptual events indicating continued existence.</p>\n\n<p>In our lab we are now able to gather eye-track data while infants inspect 3D events. In order to provide a stronger test of nativist claims, we will harness this technique in two research strands. The first will replicate key eye-tracking studies of trajectory perception using 3D rather than 2D displays. The second will replicate a range of key tasks previously used to support the nativist account, supplementing looking time measures with eye-tracking data, selecting tasks for which the nativist and alternative accounts make clear and opposed predictions regarding patterns of fixation and predictive scanning.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G028435/1","grantId":"ES/G028435/1","fundValue":"510102","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Bremner","coPersons":["Alan Michael Slater"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
