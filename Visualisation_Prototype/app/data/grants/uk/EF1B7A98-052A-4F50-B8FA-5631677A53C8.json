{"id":"EF1B7A98-052A-4F50-B8FA-5631677A53C8","title":"American Culture in the 1920s","abstractText":"This book has a strong theoretical point, made by historically situating the major forms of American culture in the 1920s - from literature, performance and film, to art, photography and music - within key intellectual debates of the period (that remain relevant today). Combining a broad contextual approach with specific case studies drawn from both popular and high cultural forms, I examine important cultural themes and discourses and link them with social trends: for example, the emergence of mass culture and the perception of cultural crisis; the industrial aesthetic and the rationalization of cultural production; the impact of racial ideologies such as eugenics and the production of cultural texts; the relationship between consumer culture and the transformations engendered by technological and scientific innovations such as the radio, cinema and the automobile. This book is thus primarily concerned with uncovering and discussing the connection between a broad range of primary cultural products from the era, and the social and intellectual concerns over the role of culture in American society in the 1920s.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F002947/1","grantId":"AH/F002947/1","fundValue":"22263","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Currell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
