Gabriela Mistral (Chile), Cecilia Meireles (Brazil), and Rosario Castellanos (Mexico) were strong advocates for the children's rights, woman's issues, and educational policies and many of their articles and short stories address their political and ideological concerns. However, their poetry averts such straightforward analysis and tends to challenge and even contradict their own political positions. This project investigates why such discrepancies exists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112791/1","grantId":"112791/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen  Pena","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
