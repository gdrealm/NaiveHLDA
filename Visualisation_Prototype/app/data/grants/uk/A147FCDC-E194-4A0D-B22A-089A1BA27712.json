Based on interviews with Chief Executives, Chairmen and directors of companies such as LloydsTSB, Marks &amp; Spencer and Prudential, this series of projects began in 1987-1989 and was repeated in 1998-2000.&nbsp; A sample of institutional investors was included in the second study, reflecting their growing power to define the acceptability of corporate and director performance.\n<br />\n<br />The 2008-2010 project is interdisciplinary in design, bringing together three people with expertise in qualitative organization studies, quantitative financial management and legal experience of corporate governance.&nbsp; One aim is to explore the current mantra of ‘adding value’ through board and director behaviour and another is to develop a quantitative database to capture financial, structural and contextual facts and figures which depict the setting in which directors and organizations work.&nbsp; Together with additional data from key shareholders and a selection of influential third-parties, the project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding and comparative analysis of the changing roles, responsibilities and rhetorics of directors leading large companies. Research outputs will contribute to the literatures of corporate governance, strategy, leadership and organization studies.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F015631/1","grantId":"ES/F015631/1","fundValue":"509665","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They have been used by FTSE100 directors and companies who participated in the research; by government in review consultations; by professional associations and networks of senior practitioners; and at the University of Exeter in presenting research to the Queen, in teaching MBA and MSc students and in other continuing professional development forums hosted at the University of Exeter.

Quantitative analysis of panel data has been extensive, based on hypotheses generated from literature of board faultlines, interlocks and nomination committees - see manuscripts currently under review. Qualitative data analysis has also been extensive, with an array of findings, relating to directors' roles, responsibilities and rhetorics, as well as speaking to wider contextual and contemporary matters such as technological/ materiality impacts on practice. Not only does this study's data stand alone as illustrative of contemporary practice, it can also be compared with previous project datasets. Hence a brief selection of findings are highlighted here, framed by three key recurrent themes relating to the core outcome variable of corporate directing: people (roles and relationships); board and top management team responsibilities (strategy, governance and remuneration); and relationships between boards and investors.\n\nWe formulated three different analyses of the quantitative panel data for the FTSE 350 (1999-2008) and found:\n(i) age, nationality, and education negatively moderate the impact of interlocking directorates on performance, while gender, tenure and financial experience did not. Given the current social structure of FTSE boards characterised by predominantly older, male, British, highly-educated directors, this study provides evidence in favour of increasing variety and diversity amongst board directors. \n(ii) with regards to faultlines (concept drawn from group process research to explore diversity in boards), task-related faultlines (type of directorship, education degree, board tenure, and financial expertise) have a strong negative effect on firm performance;\n(iii) the presence of a woman and foreigner on the nomination committee positively impacts on increases in gender and nationality diversity on the board, respectively.\nEach analysis has implications for theory and practice, in particular relating to board composition, director development and demography, and their impact on performance.\n\nWith regards qualitative data analysis of the corporate directing process, we find ironically an element of plus &ccedil;a change, plus c'est la m&ecirc;me chose:\n(i) while regulation continues to encourage transparency and openness, it effectively also encourages more behaviour to go back-stage or migrate to different stages; \n(ii) increasing the volume of corporate regulation does not decrease levels of corporate 'bad behaviour': instead, it indicates increasing trust in the system of regulation rather than increasing trust in the probity of conduct of those being regulated.\n(iii) high frequency share-trading dramatically symbolises changed assumptions about time scales and ownership responsibilities with significant effect on corporate performance, evaluation and reward; \n(iv) while three key elements of corporate directing - strategy, governance and leadership &amp; values - find expression in executive remuneration decision-making, the process bears resemblance to 'painting by numbers', such that while the composition of different component parts of the packages may change, actual reward outcomes continue to escalate as it is in no-one's interest to change;\n(v) the Chairman/Chief Executive relationship remains the linchpin of board culture and of crucial significance to director effectiveness, creating circumstances in our dataset ranging from co-creative partnership through to formal executive/non-executive role differentiation, which leads potentially towards effectively covert two-tier, rather than unitary, board practice, each with differential influence;\nThus people, process and performance remain central to both individual and collective 'common-sense'-making, underpinning the art and science of corporate directing. Can be used by practitioners, professional associations to update and inform their membership and in HE for educating the next generation of potential senior managers and financial services professionals. The database and academic outputs may also be used by academics and other researchers. The whole project will also benefit from being repeated in 2018 to continue building a comparative historical record of changing conduct in corporate behaviour - learning from the past to improve the future.
