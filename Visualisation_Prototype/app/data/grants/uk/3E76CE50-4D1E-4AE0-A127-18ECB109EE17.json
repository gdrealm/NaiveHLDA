{"id":"3E76CE50-4D1E-4AE0-A127-18ECB109EE17","title":"Real time analysis of mitotic protein kinase activity","abstractText":"This study aims to generate the means to measure the activity of the factor that drives cells to divide into two, and, most importantly, to measure this activity in living cells as they divide. This had not been possible until recent advances in imaging techniques. Through this we hope to gain a better understanding of how cells coordinate the dramatic change in their architecture required to separate the genome into two identical copies and faithfully pass one intact copy to each of the two daughter cells. This process can go wrong in diseases such as cancer, and is related to the problem that gives rise to the extra copy of chromosome 21 that causes Down?s syndrome. Thus, a better understanding of how cells control their division may help in designing ways to combat cancer and to understand how some genetically inherited syndromes are caused.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400656","grantId":"G0400656","fundValue":"202023","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathon  Pines","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
