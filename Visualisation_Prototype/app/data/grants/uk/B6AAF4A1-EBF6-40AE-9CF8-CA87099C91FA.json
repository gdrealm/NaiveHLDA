This project aims to apply new technologies in epigenomics to interrogate this issue. We propose that the epigenome (markings added to the DNA sequence that alter how genes are regulated) act not only as an index of previous exposures (such as early life adversity, smoking or stress) - a biosocial archive - but may be intimately linked to, and predictive of, future wellbeing.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> This project will explore the relationship between epigenetic marks and a variety of different exposures in early life and across childhood and early adulthood. These epigenetic signatures will then be related to social, behavioural and health outcomes. The study will be based upon the well-established Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Understanding the role of the epigenome and its place in the life course may help to identify when best to intervene to avoid adverse consequences of early life events on long term outcomes. This will have an important impact in informing future policy.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003023/1","grantId":"ES/L003023/1","fundValue":"196736","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"George  DaveySmith","coPersons":["Caroline Laura Relton"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
