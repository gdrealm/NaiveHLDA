{"id":"75743CCC-4164-4CDB-8F6B-5A17D0EEB9A6","title":"An Integrative Multi-Level Systems Biology Approach to Understanding Enterobacterial Responses to Oxygen","abstractText":"In the 'molecular age', biologists have investigated the mechanisms underlying life by analysing individual components in great detail / tissues, cells, subcellular bits and pieces, and molecules. This approach has been highly productive but new methods and technology now allow scientists to look at the 'big picture' and attempt to understand how all these pieces work together. Bacterial cells provide ideal material for this kind of analysis since they are (relatively) small and simple and we understand a lot about their component molecules. In this project we will attempt to reassemble a picture of how a well-understood bacterium, Escherichia coli, responds to a stress that it will frequently encounter, particularly in its dual lifestyle, alternating between the animal (including human) gut and the outside world. In the former, the bacterium's environment is largely oxygen-free and the organism must adapt its physiology via gene regulation, protein synthesis and metabolic control to utilise other (non-oxygen) respirable substrates. When E. coli leaves the large intestine, it is suddenly faced with a colder, more oxygen-rich but nutritionally less satisfying environment and must make rapid and major changes to gene regulation, protein synthesis and metabolic processes. We will perform careful laboratory experiments in which the bacterium is cultivated under reproducible conditions, cataloguing the changes that occur in the cell when it encounters various levels of oxygen. Then a mathematical simulation (or model) of these processes will be attempted in which we try to integrate the data on molecules and pathways into the 'big picture' (Systems Biology). It is hoped that the model will reveal new aspects of the cell's response and, importantly, highlight those facts that we still need to gather to refine the simulation. The results of this work will be a much better understanding of how a simple cell responds to life-threatening stresses and may inform our approaches to controlling the survival of this and other bacteria in disease, as well as optimising the growth of this organism in commercial bioprocesses. Moreover, the project will stimulate cooperation between biological and mathematical/computing scientists in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, promoting a concerted research activity in the new area of Systems Biology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003463/1","grantId":"BB/F003463/1","fundValue":"843726","fundStart":"2007-08-27","fundEnd":"2011-03-26","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  By promoting knowledge in this area and highlighting the importance of oxygen, for example in fermentations and industrial biotechnology.
