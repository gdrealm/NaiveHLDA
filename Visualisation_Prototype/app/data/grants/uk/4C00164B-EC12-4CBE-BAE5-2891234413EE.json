How can governments be made more accountable for ensuring access to food?</p>\n\n<p>The research addresses this question by comparing two approaches people have been taking to making governments more accountable for food security. Focusing on the ‘food crisis’ since 2007, it will examine right-to-food movements and riots over food prices in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Mozambique. The research asks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How well do officials and policymakers understand how food price rises affect people? </li>\n\n <li>How do people view government responsibilities to protect access to food? </li>\n\n <li>Under what conditions do riots and right-to-food campaigns make governments more accountable for hunger? </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The research will involve interviews with activists, protestors, affected groups (particularly women on low incomes), key officials and policymakers, and secondary analyses of media accounts of protests and activism, and official policy changes and statements. It will improve understanding of how to hold governments to account over hunger, enable policymakers to better anticipate and monitor the effects of food price volatility, and create opportunities for activists to engage with policymakers and government officials.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018317/1","grantId":"ES/J018317/1","fundValue":"433707","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Naomi Therese Hossain","coPersons":["Ferdous  Jahan","Celestine  Musembi","Alexander  Shankland","Biraj  Patnaik","Patta  Scott-Villiers","Luis  Brito","Anuradha  Joshi"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
