The photon probe is an ideal way to investigate the structure of matter as its interaction is well understood and it probes the whole volume of the object under study. Nucleons are composite structures made of 3 much lighter particles called quarks, which exist in a sea of virtual gluons and quark-antiquark pairs. This system can be excited into a number of very short lived excited states which can be detected from their subsequent decay back to a nucleon via the emission of mesons. The spectrum of these excited states and their properties are fundamental observables reflecting the dynamics of the nucleon's internal constituents. Despite being studied for decades in various experiments information on the mass, lifetime and photon coupling of the known excited states have been obtained only with large uncertainties for many parts of the spectrum. For example the lifetime of the second excited state of the proton is only known to 50% accuracy. Some excited states only show up inconsistently in different theoretical analyses of the same experimental data and many 'missing' excited states predicted by quark models are not yet observed.This situation is particularly disappointing given the recent advances in theoretical descriptions of the spectra, such as first predictions from Lattice QCD. We will obtain unique new data to constrain the structure of the nucleon utilising polarised photon beams with (i) polarised neutron targets in which the spin of the target nucleons an be oriented in a chosen direction with respect to the beam (ii) measurement of the transfer of polarisation from the photon to the recoiling nucleon(s) in photoreactions. The first aspect utilises new HD target technology while the latter uses the Edinburgh nucleon polarimeter which employs a novel and highly cost-effective design to measure the polarisation of nucleons with a large angular acceptance. The polarimeter will enable the long sought 'complete measurement' of experimental observables in meson photoproduction from the nucleon. This will be a real milestone in the field, providing sufficient experimental constraints to allow a model independent analysis for the first time in the extraction of the fundamental excitation spectrum. We will also carry out world's first measurements of polarisation transfer in deuterium photodisintegration using the Edinburgh nucleon polarimeter. Polarisation transfer provides the most sensitive information on whether the appropriate degrees of freedom in the reaction process are the nucleon or the underlying quark structure of the deuteron. This will be the benchmark measurement to address intriguing indications of this transition at unexpectedly low photon energies. Finally, we will obtain important new information on how nucleons combine to make nuclei by accurately measuring the size of neutron skins. Neutron skins with thicknesses of up to ~1/3 of a neutron diameter are predicted to exist for heavy nuclei, and accurate measurement would give long sought constraints on the poorly established density dependence of the asymmetry parameter for neutron rich matter. This asymmetry parameter fixes the scale of the binding energy penalty for moving away from symmetric matter (equal numbers of protons and neutrons) and has fundamental consequences for neutron star physics including establishing the feasibility of cooling mechanisms and constraining mass-radius relationships. The size of the skin is also a crucial constraint on modern theoretical descriptions of the nucleus, which we will challenge by determining the change in skin thickness when the neutron number increases for a fixed proton number.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G008582/1","grantId":"ST/G008582/1","fundValue":"486304","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The particle detector simulations and analysis techniques developed for the Edinburgh nucleon polarimeter formed the basis of a new idea for improving the quality of PET medical imaging.

The programme tackles fundamental questions in nuclear physics and hadron physics (the physics of particles interacting via the strong interaction). The Edinburgh particle identification detector, supported by this grant, was key to the majority of measurements at MAMI during this period. We also developed further new equipment, the Edinburgh Recoil Polarimeter, which allowed the first large acceptance measurement of the spin direction of nucleons. Some physics highlights from our programme are described below.\n\nNuclear Physics:\n\nWe obtained the first accurate measurement of a neutron skin for a nucleus using an electromagnetic probe. Neutron skins are predicted to form on heavy nuclei which have an excess of neutrons over protons. The properties of the skin, how large it is and how diffuse its surface, provide powerful constraint on theories of the nucleus and also on the basic properties of neutron matter. The new results have direct implications for neutron stars with the size of the neutron skin giving new constraints on the radii of neutron stars and their possible cooling mechanisms. The result was selected for a physics synopsis in Physical Review Letters \n\nOur group coauthored work at JLAB showing how the transparency of the nuclear medium to protons is lower than expected from traditional mean-field theoretical calculations and consistent with the renormalisation expected from the effects of short range correlations between the nucleons. Further work showed the first evidence for scale invariance in a typical nucleus. This is important information to map the transition from nucleon degrees of freedom to partonic (quarks and gluons) in the nucleus. We also coauthored work which gave some of the first indications for a long sought effect, colour transparency, This transparency is predicted from the theory of the strong interaction (QCD), where hadrons produced with sufficiently high 4-momentum transfer (corresponding to the quarks being close together) can pass through nuclear matter with dramatically reduced interactions. This work produced the first measurement of the expansion time for a hadron - of the order of 10^-24 seconds, which is a fundamental measurement for QCD.\n\nHadron Physics:\n\nThe grant supported a significant expansion of the experimental database available to establish the excitation spectrum of the nucleon. In recent years using advanced computer arrays it has become possible for the first time to calculate the excitation spectrum directly from the theory describing the force between the quark components of the nucleon (QCD). Therefore the spectrum of nucleon excited states is a fingerprint to test the validity of the theory in describing the matter making up the visible universe. We developed a new detector concept which provided the first large acceptance measurement of the spin direction of nucleons produced in photo reactions, an crucial development in the world programme. The first results from the Edinburgh Nucleon Polarimeter were published in Physical Review Letters. We published a further letter exploiting our new technique for identifying Kaon mesons. Excited states of the nucleon which decay via Kaons provide powerful information for the theoretical analyses. Our precision results allowed models in which the quarks inside the nucleon pair off (di-quark models) to be disfavoured. We coauthored further publications at MAMI and JLAB where decay channels of nucleon excited states to double-meson decays, three-meson decays and decays involving strange quarks were obtained. In 2012 the world data were used in a global theoretical analysis which resulted in 6 new excited states being listed in the particle data group listings. This process will be repeated in the future using the latest data. We also developed a new proposal to establish the excitation spectrum of nucleons containing strange quarks (cascades) which was approved to run at the upgraded JLAB in the future.\n\nFurther work gave the most accurate determination to date of the form factor of the eta meson, giving new constraints on its structure. Measurements of the photo production of pion mesons near to the energy threshold for the reaction provided unique data to challenge Chiral Perturbation Theories, which link directly to QCD. The neutron skin work provides constraint on the nuclear equation of state which will be used not only by nuclear theorists but also theorists developing models of neutron star structure, cooling and gravitational wave emission. Our published work on lead already gives important new constraints on the size and shape of the neutron skin. This has already been used by nuclear theorists to constrain the models of the nucleus. The data under analysis on the evolution of the skin across an isotopic chain will enable further selectivity in nuclear models and in determining the equation of state. \n\nOngoing and future space based X-ray measurements of neutron stars will provide complimentary information on the equation of state, at higher densities than our nuclear measurements. Our data will be used in future combined neutron star and nuclear determinations.\n\nOur development of the Edinburgh Nucleon Polarimeter have attracted significant interest from other facilities and we are discussing future possibility and collaboration to transfer our method there.\n\nOur method for Kaon identification has been adopted by the BGO-OD collaboration at Bonn and significantly enhanced the achievable physics programme. We are also working with researchers in laser-plasma based particle acceleration, where the method may provide a novel way to overcome the difficulties of measuring the production of high energy photons (100's MeV). As the intensity of laser-plasma sources increases non-linear QED effects are expected to produce significant quantities of these high energy photons. A new idea based on our Kaon detection method may provide a way to measure these, even in the intense environment created by the ultra-short beam pulse. We are developing this work in collaboration with colleagues at the plasma research institute at the University of York. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
