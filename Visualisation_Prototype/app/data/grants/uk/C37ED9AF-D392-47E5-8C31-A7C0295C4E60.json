In the proposed research we aim to test the hypothesis that adding a calcium sensor protein; neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) can enable adult nerves to regenerate. This small molecule is involved in the growth of axons and formation of synapses (the wiring and communication points of nerves) in the embryonic brain and spinal cord. This molecule is usually only expressed in the embryonic nervous system which, as well as normal growth, is also capable of significant regeneration after injury. We plan to increase the NCS-1 content of injured nerves in two models of SCI in the adult rat. The differences between the two models will allow us to examine the contribution of different mechanisms that may underlie any functional recovery caused by the increase in NCS-1. \nClinically the treatment of the neuronal injury following SCI is delayed by the need to stabilise the patient, therefore we will test if increasing NCS-1 after as opposed to at the same time as the injury can induce recovery. We hope this work may contribute to new treatment options in SCI.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501617","grantId":"G0501617","fundValue":"327991","fundStart":"2006-06-19","fundEnd":"2009-06-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Brendan McMahon","coPersons":["Ping  Yip"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
