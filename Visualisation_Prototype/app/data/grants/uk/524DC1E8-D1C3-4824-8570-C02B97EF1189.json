It is intended that the methods will have application across a wide range of functions, dynamics and attributes of the vehicle. For example; the off-road capability, the effects off real world aerodynamics and the modelling of the noise within the passenger compartment. The ability to apply simulation methods from initial concept through to engineering verification allows robust decision making at all stages of the process. This will shorten product development times, improve flexibility and the ability to respond to market pressures, reduce reliance on physical prototypes and reduce costs and improve competitiveness. The simulation capability will therefore be expanded both in breadth and depth and methods for making simulation tools available throughout the design and engineering process will be explored.\nThe multi-physics theme is structured around three common research challenges associated with the modelling of complex phenomena in an Automotive context; Reduced Order Modelling, Coupling, and High Fidelity Modelling. These are pursued through several specific projects that address different aspects of the vehicle. By addressing multiple functions within a single proposal there is considerable added value through both academic cross-fertilisation and in cross-attribute collaboration within JLR. \nThe three main research challenges are:\nHigh Fidelity Modelling; here refers generally to the simulation of complex phenomenon, for example, capturing the time dependent flow-field around a vehicle where the simulation must accurately resolve the physical processes. An alternative example is capturing the complex tyre-terrain interaction that occurs in an off road situation.\nThe coupling challenge is associated with connecting multiple simulations in terms of the physics and also the process of timing and communication. The emphasis here is on the physics. In addition, the coupling challenge refers to the connection between large simulations running on an high performance computing system and simpler reduced models that are designed to capture only the most important aspects of the physics, for example between a full computational simulation of the in-cylinder flow and a simple model to predict the engine emissions.\nA reduced order model can be a reduction of a much larger simulation or system of simulations that can be used, within prescribed limits, to investigate specific aspects of a design or to quickly optimise a design before escalating to higher order. Alternatively a reduced order model might be coupled with a higher order model. For example a high fidelity numerical simulation of the aerodynamics might be coupled with a reduced order vehicle handling model to investigate crosswind characteristics.\nThe work is organised into three packages, the first focuses on fluid dynamic driven aspects of simulation and comprises three projects: Real World Aerodynamics, Surface Contamination and Engine-out Emissions. The first undertakes high fidelity unsteady flow simulations of a dynamic vehicle in a realistic environment, the second modelling of surface contamination using the flow predictions from the first project and the third determines emissions based upon the flow-field in the cylinder prior to combustion. The second package focuses on the simulation of effects of rough terrain, through three projects: the prediction of terra-mechanics excitations and their effect on vehicle dynamics, the transmission to the passenger cabin in the form of noise vibration and harshness and their effect on fatigue failure of critical components. The third package will develop methods of automated model order reduction and will take as it cases work from across the theme, initially relatively simple slow-varying problems and then extending to more complex multi-nodal models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K014102/1","grantId":"EP/K014102/1","fundValue":"1500940","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin A  Passmore","coPersons":["Matthew  Best","Georgios  Mavros","Salah  Ibrahim","Stephen James Walsh","Paul Robert Cunningham","W  Malalasekera","Gary John Page","Dan John O'Boy","Andrew  Garmory"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
