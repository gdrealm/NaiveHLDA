{"id":"DFCFEBBE-1BCC-414F-9CB4-686DCE99D5CB","title":"Exploring late 18th-/early 19th century English Organ music through the works of WILLIAM RUSSELL","abstractText":"The main aim of the project is to explore the organ music of William Russell (1777/1813) on an instrument of the period, and disseminate this to a wider audience through a recording. This music is contained in two sets of voluntaries published in London in 1804 and 1812, and is a fascinating blend of styles as well as beautiful and interesting in its own right. We still hear echoes of Handel, whose style dominated English music for many years after his death in 1759; the organ music of later English 18th-century composers was obviously an influence on him, such as that of Stanley, Greene, Boyce, Samuel Wesley and others; we also hear something of Mozart and Haydn, two composers whom Russell particularly admired. In addition, aspects of early Romantic music are detectable from time to time. Despite these many and apparently disparate ingredients, the music emerges as compelling and full of character.\\n\\nMuch music of the past, perhaps with a less than absorbing appearance on the page, springs vividly to life when performed on an appropriate instrument which is more or less contemporary with its composition. This recording of Russell's music on the 1829 Bishop organ in St James's Church, Bermondsey in London will combine music and instrument in an ideal partnership, and will demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of the music. Only a few of these works have been recorded hitherto, and so a recording of both sets of Voluntaries will give listeners a complete overview of his style. Notes on both the music and the organ will accompany the recordings, and an article reflecting on the research and performance process will be written to be published by the British Institute of Organ Studies.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G001227/1","grantId":"AH/G001227/1","fundValue":"16427","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Kitchen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
