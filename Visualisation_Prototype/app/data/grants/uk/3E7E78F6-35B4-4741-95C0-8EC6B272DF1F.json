Will this child memorise the two different sound systems, switching from one to the other depending upon the linguistic or social context, or will this bidialectal listener develop a greater tolerance for sound variability than a listener exposed to only a single dialect? In this project we investigate how children and adults that have been exposed from birth to multiple dialects cope with dialectical variability. Adults will be tested in reaction time based experiments to establish how the different dialects from their linguistic background have been integrated. Word recognition and discrimination of a range of dialects will also be tested in children from a different dialectal backgrounds aged from 6 to 16 months. Combining these studies will allow us to examine how long-term effects of exposure to multiple dialects affect word identification. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H002782/1","grantId":"ES/H002782/1","fundValue":"79578","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caroline  Floccia","coPersons":["Jeremy  Goslin"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
