Like other stem cells in the body, these blood stem cells serve to provide a supply of mature cells as required and at the same time are able to make copies of themselves so that they do not become depleted throughout life. As we age, the blood stem cells can gradually acquire mutations in their genetic material sometimes leading to the appearance either of blood disorders in which either the normal number of type of blood cells produced is disrupted or a leukaemia arises. A protein that we know to be critical to limit genetic damage as cells divide is known as MYBL2, and loss of the gene coding for this appears to be linked to certain age-related blood disorders and leukaemia. I have generated a mouse model mimicking the way in which MYBL2 is altered in some patients with blood disorders and I wish to use this to study the precise way in which changes in this protein in stem cells can cause blood diseases as we get older. The outcomes of the project should provide new information to aid diagnosis and prognosis, and may lead to novel treatments for leukaemia and age-related decline in stem cell function.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K01076X/1","grantId":"MR/K01076X/1","fundValue":"430926","fundStart":"2013-06-03","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paloma  Garcia","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
