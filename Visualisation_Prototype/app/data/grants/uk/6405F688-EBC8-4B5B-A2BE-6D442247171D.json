This may relate to our difficulty in measuring dietary sugar intake given its widespread presence and variable amounts in foods. Our work suggests that sugar excretion (sucrose and fructose) in the urine (as opposed to glucose, which is may indicate diabetes) is a good reflection of dietary sugar intake. We propose to examine whether dietary sugar intake, as assessed using urine sugar excretion is related to long term risk of chronic diseases associated with ageing such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes in 25,000 men and women aged 40-79 who have been followed up between 1993 to the present for health. This may help us understand better how to prevent chronic diseases associated with ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801534","grantId":"G0801534","fundValue":"140704","fundStart":"2009-02-11","fundEnd":"2012-08-10","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kay-Tee  Khaw","coPersons":["Julian Leether Griffin","Sheila  Rodwell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
