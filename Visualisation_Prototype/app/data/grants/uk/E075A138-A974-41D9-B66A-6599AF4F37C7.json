Although this is a relatively infrequent complication of anaesthesia, the rise in temperature is invariably fatal unless treated rapidly and most of those who die are healthy teenagers or young adults. There is a considerable cost to the NHS associated with diagnosis, treatment, training of staff and the avoidance of cost effective anaesthetics, which are potent triggers of the condition. The muscle contraction associated with malignant hyperthermia is known to result from a rise in the level of calcium ions within the tissue. Until very recently, it was believed that all of this calcium was derived from stores located within the muscle itself, and a particular protein (the ryanodine receptor) has been the main focus of study. However, recent work suggests that, in some circumstances, calcium may flood into the cell to induce contraction, and it is possible that this newly discovered mechanism may play a role in malignant hyperthermia. The aim of the present study is to examine whether calcium does enter the cell during human malignant hyperthermia and the properties of this calcium entry mechanism. This is important work, because treatment and the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods require a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the components of the muscle which exhibit abnormal behaviour during malignant hyperthermia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601243","grantId":"G0601243","fundValue":"194977","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek S Steele","coPersons":["A  Duke","Philip  Hopkins"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
