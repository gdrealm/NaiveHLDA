The pursuit of gender equality has tended, over the last decade, to focus on strategies that aim to secure women's descriptive and substantive representation within the political arena via gender quotas, women's policy agencies and gender mainstreaming. The recent interest in diversity complicates these political equality strategies, which currently focus solely of gender, by demanding that multiple equality strands be considered. The project evaluates the challenges of reconfiguring these gender equality strategies in the light of diversity consideration. The project will be published as a manuscript. The Politics of Gender Equality in an Era of diversity (Palgrave 2007). Three journal articles and one review article, all exploring the impact of diversity on women's policy agencies, mainstreaming practices and citizenship models, were also produced during the research leave period (for Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, Politics and Gender, Parliamentary affairs, Fronesis). A theoretical chapter on 'Equality and Difference' was also produced for the Oxford Handbook of Political theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=111949/1","grantId":"111949/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Squires","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
