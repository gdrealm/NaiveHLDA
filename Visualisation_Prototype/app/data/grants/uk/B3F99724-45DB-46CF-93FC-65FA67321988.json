{"id":"B3F99724-45DB-46CF-93FC-65FA67321988","title":"Protecting the malting and brewing quality of UK barley cultivars through effective FHB disease control strategies","abstractText":"The incidence of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease has significant implications for the viability and functional quality of barley destined for use in the malting and brewing sectors. Fusarium infection of UK malting barley is on an upwards trend and the strains implicated are diversifying. Such trends are predicted to continue as the effects of global warming become apparent. Currently there is insufficient information and knowledge of:1. The links between key agronomic variables (e.g. selection of barley variety/ agronomic and weather conditions) and the resultant severity of FHB in malting barley.2. The impact of infection with Fusarium species on the malting and brewing quality of the barley crop. This project will aim to determine the links throughout the supply chain from evaluating the impact of a series of agronomic variables on the incidence of FHB, through identification of the causal pathogens of FHB implicated to the subsequent impact on the functional properties of barley for malting and brewing. The role and contribution of varietal resistance in UK barley and timing of fungicide application against FHB will be determined. The collaboration between partners with expertise in key sectors such as crop breeding, crop protection, agrochemical industry, farm management, malting and brewing is required in order to ensure that future agricultural production meets the needs of UK industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/I001549/1","grantId":"TS/I001549/1","fundValue":"272570","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rumiana  Ray","coPersons":["David John Cook"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
