The disease inflicts very significant losses especially in livestock in India, with infection levels reaching 55% in some regions. Recently-estimated costs for liver fluke induced losses associated with livestock in India fall within the range of US$1.95-4.78 billion per year. This is a huge burden to the largely agricultural Indian economy and directly impacts the productivity of large and small farm holdings alike, negatively impacting individual farmers and their families. Liver fluke infected buffalo show reduction in general health, weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and reproduction. The infective worm stage encysts on vegetation such that host animals inadvertently consume the cysts during grazing. Once in the gut, the juvenile worms hatch, burrow through the gut wall and penetrate the liver, ending up as adult worms in bile ducts where they feed on host blood, significantly diminishing the health of the animal and greatly reducing agricultural productivity. In the developed world liver fluke is mainly controlled using the chemical triclabendazole (TCBZ). This drug is an Achilles heel of liver fluke control as it is the only drug that kills both adult and pathogenic juveniles. New control strategies are urgently needed as anthelmintic resistance in parasitic worm populations is spreading globally, and agricultural communities in many parts of the developing world simply cannot afford short-lived, anthelmintic-based treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective, single-treatment control strategy based on vaccination. Numerous vaccine trials have been completed in liver fluke, many showing some success, but none have provided protection levels adequate for immediate commercialization. The problem is that since most leading vaccine candidates exist in large, related groups of proteins within parasites, it has been impossible to determine which is the best candidate from the group such that up until now, these decisions have not been subject to rigorous validation. To this end, this international collaborative project between laboratories in India and the UK will, for the first time, incorporate new fast throughput nucleotide and protein technologies to validate the candidate proteins and thereby assess if these leading vaccine candidates can be used to treat liver fluke parasites in different parts of the world, a key to successful commercial production. Once a vaccine target is confirmed as widely present in liver fluke populations, we will use another new technology called reverse genetics that can switch-off (or silence) a target in a parasite, and then confirm if this target is essential for parasite survival. If confirmed as important to parasite survival, we will subsequently use yeast laboratory cultures to produce the candidates for vaccine trials in livestock in India. Since this is a multi-discipline and multi-laboratory project, we have formed an International Science Advisory Board (ISAB) in order to manage and co-ordinate progress and to trouble-shoot. Members of the ISAB include a representative from a large Animal Pharmaceutical Company, a parasitologist with many years of industrial experience, a leading world authority on liver fluke vaccination and a representative from the industrial Biotechnology sector in India. The programme addresses the mission of the BBSRC, including treatment of diseases of livestock, application of new technologies and international collaboration. Validated trial vaccine(s) from this programme would form the basis for commercial development for treating liver fluke disease, and our technology strategy is directly transferable to other helminth parasites of animal and humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009256/1","grantId":"BB/H009256/1","fundValue":"285137","fundStart":"2010-06-10","fundEnd":"2013-06-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings that the immune modulator (fluke Sigma GST) reduced pathology in livestock vaccine trials was used to support for two further large grant applications in 2013 and 2014 to BBSRC on liver fluke vaccination (FADH and sLoLa awards), both not funded at full application stage.\nThe programme characterised the first extracellular vesicle delivered fluke immune modulator protein and supports new studies on fluke extracellular vesicles by other academics worldwide.

Specifically, to the remit of this programme call, F. gigantica inflicts very significant losses of livestock in India, with infection levels reaching 55% in some regions.

This drug is an Achilles heel of liver fluke control as it is the only drug that kills both the adult and pathogenic juvenile stages of the parasite. New control strategies are urgently needed as anthelmintic resistance in parasitic worm populations is spreading globally, and agricultural communities in many parts of the developing world simply cannot afford short-lived, anthelmintic-based treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective, single-treatment control strategy based on vaccination. Numerous liver fluke vaccine trials have been completed and although some success was reported, none have provided protection levels adequate for commercialization. This three year international collaboration between laboratories in India and the UK incorporated new fast throughput nucleotide and protein technologies to reveal new vaccine antigen candidates and also identified a new approach to develop vaccines via dampening the ability of the parasite to suppress the immune system of livestock. The programme addressed the mission of the BBSRC, including treatment of diseases of livestock, application of new technologies and international collaboration. Field trial vaccine approaches are now required to catalyse the launch of the first commercial vaccine for treating liver fluke disease, and this technology strategy is directly transferable to other worm parasites, especially F. hepatica, that is increasing in UK livestock. Parasitic helminths are a major threat to global food security, and have been estimated to cost the livestock industry worldwide more than $50 billion/annum. The treat-all application approach of broad-spectrum anthelmintics has been the primary method to control parasitic worms in livestock in the developed world for over 50 years, and has made the production of cheap and plentiful food to a growing world population feasible. New control strategies are urgently needed as anthelmintic resistance in parasitic worm populations is spreading globally, and this coupled to the lack of new anthelmintics, means that in some parts of the developed world intensive livestock farming will no longer be sustainable. In addition, agricultural communities in many parts of the developing world simply cannot afford short-lived anthelmintic based treatment strategies and therefore, also urgently require a cost effective single treatment such as anti-worm vaccines. This programme discovered and validated a new approach to support liver fluke vaccination by targeting the parasite's immune modulation machinery delivered by extracellular vesicles to host cells. Vaccine trials with the immune modulator (Sigma GST-Prostaglandin synthase) reported a reduction in pathology in vaccinated livestock. The findings have been reported in two publications and data presented at scientific conference and to the general public (University Open, visit days and BBC radio). Further funding to improve the vaccine formulation is being sought (two BBSRC applications, FADH with Indian collaborators and sLola with new UK collaborators were not funded). However, the data is available to others to exploit for fluke and other worm based vaccine research. The programme also delivered gene discovery in tropical liver fluke via producing a transcriptome of juvenile stage and the dataset will be released for other academics and industr to support their vaccine discovery programmes once publication accepted. Publications from the programme detailing the expression of vaccine candidates from major fluke superfamilies will provide support for other academics and industry to develop their vaccination strategies.
