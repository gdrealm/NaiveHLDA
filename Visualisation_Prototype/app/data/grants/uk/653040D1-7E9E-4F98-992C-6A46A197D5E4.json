The project is practice led, focusing on the making of a series of new artworks by Charlotte Hodes from preliminary drawings through to completion. The creative process will be observed at crucial stages through a video recording made by Treadaway, supported by digital photos and research journals. The completed artworks evidencing the research, will be exhibited alongside the video recording at the Baring Wing, University Gallery, University of Northumbria in April 2008. The exhibition will be accompanied by a publication to include photographic documentation of the artworks as well as essays by both artist and researcher which address the findings that have emerged from the analysis of the data.\\n\\nCathy Treadaway's current research interests centre specifically on creative digital processes that involve hand use and craft. Her role within the project is to document work in progress, provide analysis of data within a broad context and to facilitate a dialogue between researcher and artist in order to aid reflection on the practice as it occurs.\\n\\nThe themes of the new artworks by Charlotte Hodes develop out of her recent practice - led research at the Wallace Collection, London, where she was Associate Artist 2005 -2007. The resulting work, made in response to the eighteenth century paintings and the highly ornate French porcelain was exhibited in 'Fragmented Images' at the Wallace Collection 2007. \\n\\nThe proposed research will investigate how 'making by hand' informs concept development and the selection of novel ideas within creative digital practice. The artworks which will be made for this research will take the form of collages, papercuts, which combine hand and digital drawing, digital collage i.e. 'cut' and 'paste' as well as 'hands on' traditional collage in the studio. This investigation seeks to illuminate how both hand and digital craft processes inform creative cognition. Previous research by Treadaway has revealed that many artists combine traditional and digital drawing processes. Her research investigating the use of digital imaging tools in art and design practice, indicates that the physical hand making plays a crucial role in creative thinking. Evidence of how creative computational support tools and software are used in practice will lead to the development of enhanced interfaces and better technology. Within the artist's own practice, periods of reflection on the work in progress and a more in depth understanding of how the tactile process of 'hands on' and digital making inform creative thinking can lead to new insights for the artist's practice.\\n\\nThis project crosses boundaries between fine art and craft making, human computer interaction and psychology. It seeks to reveal the human issues at the heart of creative practice using digital technology and will use the research method of 'studio as laboratory' in order to record and analyse the live creative process. Treadaway's doctoral research in 2006 used case study as a key instrument to investigate the use of digital tools in creative practice. The video documentation and analysis of Hodes' studio practice will provide the opportunity for reflection and interrogation of the creative process.\\n\\nThe analysis of data will be used to gain new knowledge about the physical and cognative processes involved. The findings that emerge will inform research papers for publication and conference paper presentations. Both Treadaway and Hodes have a good track record of successful mangagement of research projects including Treadaway's Wales Arts International2005 Hodes'AHRC Small Grant 2005.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F012071/1","grantId":"AH/F012071/1","fundValue":"15392","fundStart":"2007-11-28","fundEnd":"2008-05-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  Hodes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
