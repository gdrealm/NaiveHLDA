{"id":"EF2A1160-DBDF-4917-B9AC-C0E4874BC4C5","title":"Analysis of nuclear architecture during meiosis in yeast","abstractText":"All the cells of your body contain a central region called the nucleus, which is separated from the rest of the cell by a membrane. The nucleus contains the main genetic material required for coding life. This genetic material, DNA, is organised into various groups known as chromosomes. Humans have 23 different types of chromosome, each of which carries thousands of genes in a very tightly compact form. Like most animals and plants, there are two copies of each chromosome per nucleus in humans. One copy came from each parent during sexual reproduction. When cells divide to create growth, chromosomes are duplicated and then split in two, so that each new cell receives two copies of every chromosome type. During sexual reproduction a specialised type of cell division, that involves two nuclear divisions, is used so each new cell (or gamete) contains only one copy of each chromosome. This type of cell division is called meiosis. During meiosis the chromosomes are specially arranged to ensure that, by the end, one of each type is passed into the new cells. Rearranging the chromosomes involves the two copies (originating from different parents) lining up next each other so that they are paired. During chromosome pairing, special joints are made between the two chromosomes called crossovers. Crossovers are important to generate diversity and to hold the paired chromosomes together until just the right time for nuclear division. It is extremely important that crossovers only happen between two chromosomes of the same type rather than between chromosomes of different types. Crossovers between different types of chromosome cause a reorganisation of genetic material that can lead to inviable products of meiosis. We recently published data suggesting that one way chromosomes avoid making the wrong connections is through nuclear compartmentalisation. We think of the nucleus as a spherical sack, the space of which is filled with chromosomes. Nuclear compartmentalisation refers to the idea that not all parts of all chromosomes can access any part of the nuclear volume at the same time. It is well known, for example, that the ends of chromosomes, telomeres, bind the nuclear membrane. This means that chromosomes ends cannot move into the central space of the nucleus, so telomeres are unlikely to accidentally crossover with the middle section of another chromosome. In our recent publication we showed data and a model suggesting that this attachment of telomeres to the nuclear membrane is essential to maintain proper nuclear compartmentalisation. The aim of this project is to find out which genes produce the proteins that hold the telomeres on the outer edge of the nucleus. We will look at the position of telomeres using special fluorescent dyes and a microscope that can create three/dimensional images. We will use one colour dye, linked to a protein trans/membrane domain, to highlight the surface of the nuclear membrane. A second colour will be use to highlight a specific region of a chromosome (e.g. the telomere) by binding to a DNA sequence we can integrate anywhere we want it. We plan to develop a third colour reporter so that we can view two chromosome regions simultaneously. Using these markers we will be able to look at the position of telomeres relative to the nuclear membrane. We will test various mutant forms of yeast (a very convenient and efficient model organism) to see if the gene we have mutated was needed to ensure normal localisation of the telomeres. Based on other published work we already have a good idea which genes to mutate. Once we know which genes are required to maintain normal nuclear architecture, we will undertake tests to find out how mutating them disrupts other aspects of meiosis. In particular, we will use a well-developed genetic test to find out if chromosome regions that do not normally come into contact now make crossovers that will damage chromosome structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D01042X/1","grantId":"BB/D01042X/1","fundValue":"238725","fundStart":"2006-04-18","fundEnd":"2009-04-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alastair  Goldman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" That chromosome length is an important factor in defining the significance of the bouquet structure Further experiments to test the models Other","dataset":"gtr"}
