A previous PPARC visitor programme run by PI Smith at Armagh Observatory proved highly stimulating for theoretical and interpretational activities. We intend to bring in visitors to promote the new challenges approaching us, to instigate new projects based on fresh ideas and promote new ties to replace old collaborations running out of momentum. We consider a healthy flux of visitors to Canterbury as essential for the further development of our research and reputation. This application is to the Astro Theory Sub Panel for a Visitor Support grant for the three-year period 01.04.2007 -- 31.03.2010. In order for us to bring about three theory experts to Canterbury for periods of 1\\,--\\,2 months each year for 3 years of \\pounds 18,000. This is a reasonable flux of visitors corresponding to the present list of four full-time academic staff. Supplementing this with short-term vistits, we request &pound;24,000. The research output, as measured by our journal publications, reflects the high number of international quality projects being undertaken within several fields. Invitations to our collaborators will help maintain our success in these areas which includes solar system studies, star formation and numerical astrophysics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001823/1","grantId":"PP/E001823/1","fundValue":"10123","fundStart":"2007-12-03","fundEnd":"2010-12-02","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
