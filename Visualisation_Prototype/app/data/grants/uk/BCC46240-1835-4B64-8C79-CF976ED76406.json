Currently, succinic acid is predominantly manufactured from petrochemicals or by the fermentation of glucose/sugars. The bioconversion of crude glycerol will not only valourise this fully renewable side-stream which is essentially a biorefinery waste, hence significantly improving the biorefinery economy, but can also provide a sustainable production route with reduced carbon footprint and a favourable economic potential. Hence, the aim of this project is to holistically assess the feasibility of the route from the crude glycerol to the final succinic acid product. A combination of experimental methodologies at a range of scales, from the bench- to the pilot-scale, computational tools, including economic models and process simulators, and market analysis will be employed in order to: (i) prove the feasibility of the downstream process, (ii) benchmark the final succinic acid product against the chemical market standards, (iii) successfully optimise the scale up of the fermentation process to 750 litre bioreactors (iv) identify and engage commercial end users. These objectives should constitute a significant step in reducing the risk of the proposed bioprocess in order to attract industrial investments, hence moving closer towards its industrial uptake and application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M012816/1","grantId":"BB/M012816/1","fundValue":"80313","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Constantinos  Theodoropoulos","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
