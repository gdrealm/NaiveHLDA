We hope that a good experience with robust data services will lead to greater deployment of similar systems, which are essential to deal with modern data volumes and usage patterns.\n\nThe data served has been used globally by a range of research communities (mainly Earth Observation, modelling and oceanography), but are also publically accessible to all.\n\nExploration of the new methods has resulted in requests for advice from numerous centres across Europe. We have also organised a workshop on big data services, where our findings were disseminated and discussed with other interested parties (mainly ICT oriented) and have shared our key experiences with the GEO European Projects Workshop.
