Sliding mode controllers have strong robustness properties to a certain class of uncertainty and have been shown to provide inherent fault tolerant control with respect to actuator faults. Sliding mode observers have an ability to reconstruct un-measurable signals within a dynamic system by appropriate scaling and filtering of the so-called 'equivalent output error injection'. This is a unique property of sliding mode observers which emanates from the fact that the introduction of a sliding motion forces the outputs of the observer to exactly track the plant measurements. Previous work has investigated the potential of sliding mode ideas for fault tolerant control in a civil aircraft with 'conventional' control surfaces. In an active control environment a key challenge will be to apply these ideas in a less traditional setting in which there is a proliferation of 'unconventional' actuators or sensor arrays. A problem formulation will be developed during the project so that the signals to be reconstructed represent unmeasured or unmeasurable external quantities which impact on the aircraft system - either externally (environmental conditions) or internally (associated with the airframe itself).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F004702/1","grantId":"EP/F004702/1","fundValue":"88099","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Edwards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" This work aimed to develop novel fault tolerant control and estimation schemes based on sliding mode concepts, to meet the technological challenges of an active aircraft. The proposed schemes are under-pinned by rigorous theory, but practical and robust enough to be implemented on-line to provide drag estimates. The main objectives of the research were a) to develop robust sliding mode based schemes to estimate key parameters and model states associated with flow control problems of interest to Global warming and CO2 emission levels are issues high on both the public and political agendas. In response to the ACARE 2020 (Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe) target for a 50% reduction in emissions by the year 2020, Airbus is looking to develop technology to lower in-flight drag, thereby increasing fuel efficiency.
