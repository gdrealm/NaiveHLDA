{"id":"6DE1DFDF-002C-44D9-8F8C-2E5D24C04A02","title":"Criticism and Consensus: Politics and Political Culture in the Masque","abstractText":"This project explores the interaction of the court masque with the politics of the early modern period. Masque politics are often depicted as consensual and mainly concerned with the manoeuvrings of elite factions. This study suggest that at certain crisis points early modern politics become more fissiparous, and that the masque often responds directly to the political verse and libels that circulated at the time. Exploring these connections and the dissemination of the masque (through printed text, manuscripts, reports in news books and so on) allow us to understand how an elite form can participate in broader political debates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113090/1","grantId":"113090/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Knowles","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
