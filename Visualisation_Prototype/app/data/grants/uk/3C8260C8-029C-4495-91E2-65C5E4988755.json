{"id":"3C8260C8-029C-4495-91E2-65C5E4988755","title":"Foundations of Opinion Formation in Autonomous Systems","abstractText":"The project concerns how groups of partially informed and self-interested agents (e.g., humans, robots), which are faced with a common problem, take a collective decision by exchanging their individual opinions to, possibly, reach a consensus. It aims at understanding how processes of opinion formation in groups behave and how they can be engineered in groups of artificial agents, like robots. \n\nThe project capitalizes on techniques developed in the social and economic sciences, applying them to the artificial intelligence setting. It extends the state-of-the-art in the application of voting theory to artificial intelligence, addressing the process of opinion formation, and lays the theoretical groundwork for the development of collective decision-making techniques in autonomous systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M015815/1","grantId":"EP/M015815/1","fundValue":"98207","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Davide  Grossi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
