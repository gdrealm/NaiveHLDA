{"id":"9D7E5FCE-0C06-46A7-9E7D-4CD9D5EA84AD","title":"Study of elementary particles and their interactions","abstractText":"The grant is to continue the investigation into the properties of elementary particles and the fundamental forces of nature. The dominant programme will be to complete the CMS &amp; LHCb experiments to take data at the LHC and to analyses the first data to see if the Higgs theory is sound and search for evidence of phyisc beyond the standard model sucha as supersymmetry. Before the LHC takes data these seraches will be made at the Tevatron in the USA. An exquisite test of the standard model arises in CP violation in the b-system as this (probable) interference phenomenon can be very sensitive to small amplitudes. This will be investigated in detail by experiments first at SLAC and later at the LHC. Observation of neutrino oscillation shows that the neutrinops are not massless and this can have profound consequnces. These will be investigated in detail by the T2K experiment in Japan and searches for neutrinoless double beta decay. The ultimate neurino experiemnts will require a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring. This requires developmetn whci is taking place via the MICE experiemnt and a programme of accelrator R&amp;D aimed at a high intensity proton driver. Future particle physics facilities will require more sophisticated detectors and the technologies required for the detectors at the Linear Collidare being investigated with the CALICE experiment and effort is starting on the challengin task of a detector for a very high luminosity LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E000509/1","grantId":"PP/E000509/1","fundValue":"10407000","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter John Dornan","coPersons":["David  Websdale","Jordan  Nash","Yoshi  Uchida","Dave  Wark","Ulrik  Egede","David  Britton","Costas  Foudas","Tejinder  Virdee","Gavin  Davies","John  Hassard","Geoffrey  Hall","Morgan O'Hagan Wascko","Patrick Stefan Koppenburg","Juergen  Pozimski","Julia  Sedgbeer","Kenneth  Long","Rick  Jesik","Paul  Dauncey"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
