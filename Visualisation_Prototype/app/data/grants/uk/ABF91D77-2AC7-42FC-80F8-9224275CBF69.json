Arguably the most versatile of these model animals are the embryos of Xenopus frogs. In order to\nmake the most effective and efficient use of these models, the genetically altered animals themselves and the special\nmolecular tools (generally DNA and antibodies) that are used to work with them are shared within the research community.\nTo do this, resource centres exist for each organism. The centre for Xenopus is the European Xenopus Resource Centre\n(EXRC), and this application is to support the unique collection of molecular tools held there. Staff at the centre acquire the\nmolecular tools from laboratories around the world, grow more of them them and check that they work as expected. The\ndetails of the tools are then entered on the database for this model organism, which is called Xenbase. It has sophisticated\nsearching and linking functions so that researchers can find the tools easily. When they are requested, the tools are sent\nfrom the EXRC to the user who pays for the cost of their production.\n\nOur aim, using the funding requested here, is first to continue providing the current molecular tools, the curation of which\nwas originally supported by the BBSRC. These tools allow researchers to determine where in embryos genes are switched\non, to make transgenic frogs and to test the function of genes. We are also requesting funding to develop two new tools for\nthe community. Antibodies are needed by biologists to &quot;see&quot; proteins in cells and embryos; for some years now the\nXenopus community has been aware of a lack of antibodies for Xenopus research. The School where the EXRC is situated\nhas been raising antibodies successfully since the mid-1980s and does so at a scale that allows it to supply commercially;\nwe propose to make this antibody raising pipeline available to Xenopus labs and support them with preliminary\ncharacterisation of the antiserum produced. The other new tool is the physical frog genome (all of the frog DNA) in very\nlarge fragments called BACS. We will pick BACS that span the whole genome and make these available to the community.\nBACS let researchers improve the genome sequence of frogs, rescue mutations and identify the regions of DNA that\ncontrol specific genes. Since working with BACS is a highly specialised skill, we have recruited an expert BAC scientist to\ndevelop this project part time.\n\nThis set of molecular tools, when added to the transgenic, mutant and wild-type lines held at the EXRC and the US\nNational Xenopus Resource (NXR), together with the training programmes provided at the NXR, give Xenopus scientists\nan excellent resource infrastructure that enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of their research programmes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K019988/1","grantId":"BB/K019988/1","fundValue":"576840","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matt  Guille","coPersons":["Colin  Sharpe","Viki  Allan"],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
