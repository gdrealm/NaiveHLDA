This link between early brain development and behavioural patterns later in life can contribute directly to our thinking about education, social policy and clinical practice. Specifically, by measuring how a young baby processes information it may be possible to discover more about the origin of developmental disorders such as Autism. Techniques which are currently used to investigate brain development in young infants (i.e. less than 12 months old) are limited for a number of practical, ethical and technical reasons. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an inexpensive optical technique which uses low levels of light to measure the distribution of oxygen and blood in the brain. The equipment is safe, portable and well suited to measurements in young infants (it is routinely used to monitor premature infants). Recent developments have led to the development of a system which can produce two dimensional maps of blood distribution which can be used to determine which areas of the brain are processing information. The aim of this proposal is to use this NIRS mapping system to determine whether specific regions of the brain are active over the first few months of life. Studies will be performed on healthy infants aged 4 and 12 months using behavioural tasks designed to stimulate the frontal and prefrontal cortex, and provide information about how babies process information about their physical world. These experiments are designed to be enjoyable for the babies to ensure their interest is maintained for the duration of the study. Some technical developments will be required to produce an effective method of fitting the optical probes to the infant head and to detect whether the infant is moving during the study. As well as providing essential information about the development of the healthy brain, this work will contribute directly to the studies in the future of infants with developmental disorders. \nBoth groups have a proven track record of communicating their science to a wide audience through the media, public lectures and school events. As a female physicist, the Principle Investigator is often called upon as a role model for young people contemplating careers in science and enjoys using these opportunities to promote interest in her research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400120","grantId":"G0400120","fundValue":"209703","fundStart":"2005-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare Elizabeth Elwell","coPersons":["Mark H  Johnson","Jeremy C.
