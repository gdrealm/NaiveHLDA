The UK is playing a major role in the CTA design and is being supported to develop a prototype camera for CTA based on multi-anode photomultipliers. Here we ask for partial support for the construction of a second prototype, based on the rapidly developing technology of silicon photomultipliers. This second prototype will allow us to maintain our UK leadership in this part of the project and holds the promise of a higher performance and cheaper camera for CTA in the long term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L006154/1","grantId":"ST/L006154/1","fundValue":"22886","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Anthony Hinton","coPersons":["Richard James White"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
