This research will examine the tension between the need to legislate locally for Scotland and the need for the UK to comply with European Community (Community) Law. The research will explore the division of power between the Scottish and UK Institutions in practice by examining the extent to which Community environmental law is being implemented in different ways in Scotland and in England and Wales post-devolution. These differences relate to legislative form, timing and content, including the extent to which Community requirements are fully met or exceeded.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119265/1","grantId":"119265/1","fundValue":"87213","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrea  Ross","coPersons":["Colin Turriff Reid"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" The study involved a review of the procedures being used to implement EC environmental law in Scotland post-devolution\n\n- whether by primary or secondary legislation and by Scottish, Welsh or UK Institutions - and the extent of substantive\n\ndifferences in the resulting law across Great Britain. (Obj. 1-3) It then examined the reasons for the choices that had been\n\nmade.\n\nThe legislative review found that there is a high volume of UK/GB regulations implementing EC environmental Directives\n\nfor Scotland (12 +1 mixed/32) and Wales (27/32), which can be justified under the devolution settlement. There are 19\n\ninstances where Scotland produced separate legislation to transpose EC environmental rules and five occasions where\n\nWales acted separately. The study found that the decision to transpose separately is distinct from the decision to\n\ntranspose identically and the majority of the laws transposing EC measures are identical across the UK. Legislation\n\nproduced by the UK institutions contains no regional variation hence any Scottish or Welsh solutions must emanate from\n\nthe devolved institutions themselves. Only one of the five Welsh regulations contains provisions substantively different\n\nfrom their English counterparts, whereas a third of the separate Scottish legislation does so. &quot;Substantive&quot; differences go\n\nbeyond inconsequential phrasing or those necessary due to legal or institutional differences between jurisdictions.\n\nTransposing legislation in Scotland (primary or secondary) and Wales also receives more detailed scrutiny than where\n\ntransposition is by regulations passed at Westminster.\n\nSemi-structured interviews with key personnel in the relevant administrations and agencies were used to explore the\n\nreasons for the pattern that we identified and to trace changes in the behaviour as the devolution settlement has matured\n\n(New Obj. 5). The interviews explored the relationships and processes involved in deciding who legislates, how and by\n\nwhom these decisions are made, the factors and presumptions influencing them and their consequences (Obj.1-4).\n\nThe study revealed that while the devolution settlements set presumptions as to who should legislate the position is not\n\nrigid. Compared to Wales, Scotland is clearly more willing to legislate both separately and differently. This is predictable\n\nas Scotland has more legislative power to do so, is better resourced, has a separate legal system and regulator from\n\nEngland and is more used to acting separately. Most of the mechanisms for determining the implementation process are\n\ninformal and have evolved incrementally over the transition period, relying on co-operation, existing relationships and the\n\nmutual respect that comes from the unified civil service. As a result, the process for determining which administration\n\nshould legislate and the content of that legislation lacks transparency and accountability.\n\nThe study concludes that while the informal and co-operative approach has to date worked this is unlikely to continue. Coordination\n\nand co-operation will inevitably become more difficult over time. Already, even the slightest differences in\n\nlegislation are having cumulative and knock on effects and the laws in England, Wales and Scotland are incrementally\n\ndrifting apart. Moreover, the devolved administrations are more confident about legislating separately. London and the\n\ndevolved administrations no longer share the same political colour so informal processes are more difficult and the\n\nlikelihood of dispute higher. The research recommends that the Memorandum of Understanding and Concordats need to\n\nbe revisited and that more transparent and formal processes for consultation, representation and dispute resolution are\n\neither resurrected or introduced both at UK level and within the devolved administrations.\n\nThe research has led to 4 conference papers, at least 3 academic articles, two professional articles and contributions to\n\ntwo major inquiries on governance in Scotland.\n\nIf there are any additional achievements that do not clearly relate to your aims and objectives, please indicate these\n\nbelow. You may, for example, wish to provide evidence of intangible achievements that could not have been anticipated\n\nwhen you commenced the research programme. If you have identified such achievements under the 'Changes' section,\n\nthere is no need to repeat the information here.\n\n\n\nImportance - To date very little research has provided any quantitative analysis of outcomes related to devolution. This\n\nresearch provides the missing quantitative analysis of actual legislative outcomes needed to measure the impact of\n\ndevolution on the implementation of EC environmental law. More specifically, its analysis of this legislation reveals the\n\nextent of the differences in the implementing legislation across GB and the rationales behind these differences. The\n\nempirical work reveals how decisions about implementation such as who should legislate, legislative form and content are\n\nactually made and the nature of the relationships between and among the central and devolved institutions both in GB\n\nand in Brussels. The research also provides evidence into how the priorities and pressures on the devolved and central\n\nadministrations impact on their approach to the implementation of EC environmental law. These pressures and priorities\n\ninclude political agendas, resource constraints such as staffing, expertise and time, the legislative timetable, language\n\nobligations, differing legal approaches to statutory interpretation, the better regulation agenda including gold plating, the\n\nimpact of regulations on regulators, businesses and trade as well as local or regional concerns.\n\nEnvironmental Law - The research provides valuable evidence into how EC environmental obligations are transposed in\n\nto UK domestic law. By examining the differences in both form and substance, it has revealed the extent of divergence\n\nbetween the environmental laws for Scotland, England and Wales and the likelihood of further divergence in GB post\n\ndevolution. In December 2007, the team produced written evidence for the European and External Relations Committee of the\n\nScottish Parliament in relation to its inquiry into the transposition of EU law in Scotland. Ms Ross also met with the Clerk\n\nof that Committee in December 2007, and the findings from the legislative review of the project are widely cited in the\n\nCommittee's report. (see European and External Relations Committee, Report on an inquiry into the transposition of EU\n\ndirectives 1st Report, 2008 (Session 3), SP Paper 89).\n\nIn April 2008, the Commission on Scottish Devolution (the Calman Commission) established by the Scottish Parliament\n\nwith the support of the UK Parliament, began its review of the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998. The Commission is to\n\nrecommend changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve\n\nthe people of Scotland. In October 2008, Ms. Ross and Prof. Reid participated in a consultation workshop hosted by the\n\nCommission. We were each in separate roundtable discussions. During the day we found ourselves using the findings to\n\nsupport anecdotal evidence from other participants. Following the event, the Clerk of the Commission requested copies\n\nof the project's findings.\n\nEUR-LEX is the official EU Law portal, providing direct free access to European Union law including the Official Journals,\n\ntreaties, legislation in force, proposed legislation, cases, parliamentary questions etc. EUR-LEX was in the process of\n\ndeveloping their advanced search facility during the summer and autumn of 2006. The search facility did not do what we\n\nneeded it to do. Ms Nash worked very closely with the people at EUR-LEX who agreed that this was a gap and we\n\nassisted in testing the advanced search engine as it was developed. We now find the end product to be very useful and\n\nwe believe that our active engagement assisted in the development process.\n\nThe United Kingdom Environmental Law Association has invited the team to produce a short article for lawyers and other\n\nprofessionals in its electronic journal e-law. A similar paper was produced in the Scots Law Times for a more generalist\n\naudience of the Scottish legal profession. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
