The project will manage the electricity use\nof a range of sites, from single properties through to large commercial premises. The proposed management system uses\nalgorithm based predictive control to enable and optimise the active utilisation of multiple electric vehicle and domestic\nstorage batteries as an energy storage and generation resource. The project will demonstrate VPP functionality,\naggregating the disparate energy distributed energy resources to provide wider network ancillary support services, such as\npeak shaving. This will reduce variability in electricity demand levels, cost and CO2 emissions, plus improve the UK grid\nsecurity of supply.\nEnergy storage is one of the eight great technologies identified by the government to propel the UK to future growth (David\nWilletts MP, Policy Exchange, 2013). The RCUK Review of Energy in 2010 highlights that R&amp;D into energy storage has the\npotential to yield high levels of decarbonisation beyond 2030. The TSB (Energy Supply Strategy, 2012) states that battery\nrelated R&amp;D within the energy and transport sectors is a UK priority that will benefit from public investment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507131/1","grantId":"EP/M507131/1","fundValue":"345145","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"LIANA MIRELA CIPCIGAN","coPersons":["Omer  Rana","Nick  Jenkins"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
