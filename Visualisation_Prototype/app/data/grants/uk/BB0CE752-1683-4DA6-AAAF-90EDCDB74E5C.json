We have selected two opportunities for developing the programme further: an upgraded focal plane detector for the Glasgow Photon Tagging spectrometer, located at the MAMI facility in Mainz, Germany; a UK contribution to a new experimental effort in Hall C, Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia (JLab).\n\nThe focal plane detector is in need of an upgrade, since the detector components are gradually deteriorating over time. This refurbishment will also result in a factor of 5-10 increase in rate capability, which will allow a more ambitious programme of measurements in hadron structure and spectroscopy, themes that were highly rated in the previous grants round.\n\nThe Hall C experimental proposal has been highly rated and approved by the international JLab PAC, and Dr Hamilton is leading this effort as a spokesperson of the proposal. This programme has already attracted funding of $1million from an NSF Major Research Initiative (MRI) grant, and our request is to provide the cooling system of an electromagnetic calorimeter, as well as part of a deflection magnet that is required to remove low-energy charged particle background.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N002598/1","grantId":"ST/N002598/1","fundValue":"36666","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Ireland","coPersons":["David Jonathan Hamilton","Ian James MacGregor","Daria  Sokhan","Bjoern  Seitz"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
