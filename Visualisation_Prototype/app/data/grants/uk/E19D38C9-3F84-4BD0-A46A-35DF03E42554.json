This platform grant enables the consortium to sustain an internationally leading team of researchers working on the foundations of e-Science. The consortium delivers e-Laboratory environments in which scientists perform virtual or in silico experiments. The consortium's flagship tools include Taverna, myExperiment and Utopia. Taverna is used to develop the scientific workflows that scientists use to gather and analyse data - these represent the experiments on, for example, the genes and proteins involved in diseases. The myExperiment Virtual Research Environment is social web site software for the social curation and sharing of scientific research objects, including workflows and in silico experiments. UTOPIA is a suite of scientific visualisation and analysis tools that brings together disparate data sources in an easy to use unified interface. Together these enable scientific investigations to be undertaken in a way that enables the scientist to concentrate on the science, a feat that requires basic research in computer science.These E-Science tools are world leaders with 1000, 900 and 2000 users respectively - Taverna is used in some 350 organisations. Producing these tools necessitates foundational e-Science research in four main areas: the management of the knowledge in such environments; the production and management of the metadata, or descriptions, of the experiments and experimental holdings; the design, use and reuse of in silico experiments; and the exploitation of social networks to enhance e-Science. Explicitly engaging with users supports adoption, and it drives challenging, user-relevant research and development based on observed experience and real need. The platform grant enables the consortium to retain key staff that help sustain this world leading effort in e-Science and Open Science - they are experts in scientific workflow management, semantic technologies, intelligent middleware and social computing. Crucially it also supports our participation on the international stage, and it allows pump-priming novel and innovative research projects that are the hallmark of the consortium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G026238/1","grantId":"EP/G026238/1","fundValue":"1124440","fundStart":"2009-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-01-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used extensively in a variety of ways:\n- our software and technical products (see separate entries) which are used by 1000s of users, and in particular have been adopted as core resources by some major EU projects, some of which we have been invited to participate in. \n\n- standards - the World Wide Web Consortium PROV model for provenance and the W3C Open Annotation Data Model. we are now active in the Research Data Alliance as another route to impact through standards.\n\n- international initiatives and infrastructures such as Force11, FAIRPORT, ELIXIR, ISBE, BioMedBridges, NIH BD2K, Farr Institute.

We specialise in data and knowledge intensive e Laboratories. An e Laboratory is a set of components (workflows, resources, data, algorithms, texts, queries, people) that are used together to form a distributed and collaborative space for e Science and e Scientists (such as bioinformaticians), enabling the planning, execution, analysis and publication of in silico experiments and their results. The myGrid Consortium (http://www.mygrid.org.uk) became one of the most successful of the RCUK e-Science Programme pilots in basic and applied research, research dissemination and user adoption, focusing within its membership on the Life Sciences and e Health. The e Science Platform: myGrid: A Platform for eBiology was awarded to provide us with continuity and stability in order to exploit the success of the consortium (see EP/C536444/1). \n\nThe myGrid: A Platform for eBiology renewal had the objective of sustaining our position as a world-leading consortium, by (i) ensuring the continuity and stability of the team, retaining key researchers and sustain a platform for research; (ii) building research capacity and career development of the researchers; (iii) developing, incubating and pump-priming foundational and applied investigations, and identifying and stimulating new and long term research and innovation opportunities; (iv) building national and international technical and scientific collaborations; (v) fostering the exploitation of our research in practice, and leveraging research in other projects and initiatives; and (vi) winning further funds.\n\nAs a platform grant this award is inherently partnered with other awards, and this is reflected in the outcomes.\n\nThe Platform findings:\n- continuity and stability to the consortium: 28 researchers were supported. The platform bridged or pump-primed between 14 different funding streams/projects. 10 are still in the consortium at the end of the award and on new projects partially arising from the platform and affiliated projects.\n\n- capacity for national and international research: 2 of the researchers supported by the platform directly went onto a university faculty positions and continue to collaborate: Belhajjame (Paris 6), Missier (Newcastle). This award effectively allowed them to pump-prime their careers and establish themselves as well connected and independent researchers.\n\n3 went onto further research in other institutes (Eales, Lister, Cruickshank) and 4 went into industry (Li, Rodda, Withers, Newman) and 1 went onto further study followed by industry (Aleksejvs). \n\n- widened the awareness, adoption and influence of our software (Taverna Workflow Suite, UTOPIA, myExperiment, BioCatalogue, SEEK4Science, LabTrove etc) co-ordinating a coherent programme of work into an eLaboratory toolkit, and conducting a virtuous circle between research and production, whereby research investigations are inspired from real problems and outcomes are returned into the products.\n\n- continuity and innovations in core open source and widely used software toolkits and applications produced by the group for the benefit of the international research community. The group operates a virtuous circle between research and production, whereby research investigations are inspired from real problems and outcomes are returned into the products. The platform grant:\n\n * retained and bridged across funding streams key people : the Taverna Workflow system (Williams, Fellows, Haines, Withers), myExperiment (Cruikshank, Bacall), BioCatalogue (Beard), SEEK4Science (Owen) and LabTrove (Borkum). It also enabled research innovations outlined below to be transferred into these systems: workflow provenance, research objects, micropublications, semantic annotations and software ontologies. All the software listed above has high impact - see separate entries in the Software Outcomes - garnered additional funds, and underpins European projects such as BioVeL, SCAPE, VPH and HELIO. \n\n * enabled us to undertake fundamental developments in the Taverna workflow system that could not be funded elsewhere but were necessary for it long-term adoption and sustainability, notably the complete migration of the platform to OSGI-based plugin (this means that it can now become an open development project) by Withers and the prototyping of OAuth security by Borkum.\n\n * Bridged the whole UTOPIA team for a short but crucial time, enabling the knowledge and skills to be retained. UTOPIA Documents is now an established open source system with over 5000 users and commercial uptake amongst a small group of publishers. It is also a popular interface to the IMI Open PHACTS linked data warehouse for drug discovery.\n\n * enabled investigations into specific customisations of e-Labs and their components, and needs of different scientific communities, notably: chemistry, systems biology, biodiversity and public health. This lead to follow-on projects to sustain the group. Notably Li investigated the customisation and usability of workflows in chemistry and drug discovery: he is now lead at BGI GigaScience Data Journal in China, responsible for the reproducibility of workflows and research objects in genomics.\n\n- developed, incubated and pump-primed foundational and applied investigations, and identifying and stimulating new and long term research and innovation opportunities. Novel investigations afforded by the platform are concerned with computational technologies, semantic techniques and social-technical processes required to understand and enable the reproducibility of scientific research and the accelerated exchange and exploitation of scientific research. Our platforms and projects with chemists, biologists, astronomers, biodiversity scientists, librarians etc gave us a splendid opportunity for observation and experimentation.\n(ii) Knowledge management of scientific assets or artefacts and metadata management in e Laboratories\n(iii) Foundations of workflow systems: the semantics of workflow execution and the collection, the representation and use of workflow provenance and workflow preservation.\n(iv) New models of scholarly communication and reproducibility, drawing together the all three of the themes above, and exploring the social forces at work in reproducible research. This has led to numerous invited talks and keynotes by members of the consortium in scientific, digital library and publisher conferences, and contributions to UK and EU policy documents. We co-founded the Force11 Foundation (co-authoring the manifesto). \n\nHighlights include: \n- The Software Ontology (SWO) is a description of software used to store, manage and analyze data. Recently, the SWO has incorporated EDAM, a vocabulary for describing data and related concepts in bioinformatics adopted by the ELIXIR and BioMedBridges EU RIs.\n\n- The Research Object Framework: is a novel way of representing and managing the multi-variant and compound/interlinked nature of research artifacts. The RO Framework is a metadata model, with a collection of conventions encoded in standards, protocols and policies, with realizations using off the self and specialist software. Research objects are any digital resource that aims to go beyond the PDF for scholarly publishing, and prescribed ways of combining those resources. Several example realisations have been made for systems biology, public heath, scientific workflows and publications, and it is the foundation of several products (SEEK4Science), EU projects (Wf4ever, SCAPE, BioVeL, VPH-SHARE) and the basis of future work in EU wide infrastructures FAIRPORT, ELIXIR, FAIR-DOM (DMMCore), the MRC Farr Institute and the USA NIH Commons. ROs have generated a significant buzz in the publishing and digital library arenas. The RO work has been undertaken in collaboration with the VU Amsterdam, U of Oxford, U of Southampton, U of Lancaster, UPM Madrid, Instituto de Astrof?sica de Andaluc?a and ISOCO.\n\n- Semantic annotation of research objects using novel stand-off semantic middleware and linked data. This work is collaborative with Harvard Mass General and led to the development of the W3C Open Annotation Model and an ongoing collaboration combining Harvard's annotation platform Domeo with our UTOPIA tool. Earlier work with Pirr? (Universit? della Calabria) explored the role of semantics in computational middleware.\n\n- Fundamentals of workflow provenance- the log trace of computational executions and the lineage of data products arising from computations. We made significant inroads to the representation of provenance and lead contributions to W3C PROV standard suite, established the ProvBench benchmark suite, proposed a novel mechanism for tracking data credits through workflow execution traces, and mechanisms for annotating provenance with domain semantics (with Sheth et al, Wright University). \n\n- Fundamental work on workflows, including the specification of the formal semantics of our workflow engine (with Hidders et al TU Delft); comparisons with other workflow systems (with Foster et al Argonne Labs), automated refactoring of workflows (with Chen Boulakia, Paris-Sud), and workflow interoperability (with collaborators in USC SDSC, UC Davis, Amsterdam and Gonzaga). \n\n-Established and strengthened links with collaborators including: Harvard Medical Centre, Argonne Labs, Paris Sud, VU Amsterdam, Wright University USA, USC, UC Davis, Amsterdam and Gonzaga, UPM, USC, British Library, NYC University, Notre Dame, GigaScience, and many more in multi-partner European projects (see follow-on funds) and USA projects such as dataONE (Missier and Belhajjame are now partners), iPlant Collaborative.\n\n- won significant further funds for scientific applications, new research and tool and infrastructure award, notably within European Research Infrastructures and RCUK capital and infrastructure programmes such as the Farr Institutes.\n\n- co-founded research community Force11. Research insights into semantic annotation, provenance and workflow design have been incorporated into practice into our various software packages, and can be in other systems.\n\nAll the software and ontologies we have produced are free, open source, and openly available on the web and in the appropriate community public archives (GitHub, BioPortal).\n\nTaverna is an Open Development Apache Incubator.\n\nResearch Objects are proposed as a FORCE11 (http://www.force11.org, a not for profit foundation of scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders whose mission is to change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing) Working Group. We have also established a ResearchObject forum with an international advisory board. \n\nResearch Objects are proposed as a platform for the NIH BD2K Commons and the Farr Institute Commons.\n\n\n\nThe Software Ontology is incorporated into EDAM and will form part of the EU ELIXIR RI tool registry, and maybe even the NIH Software Discovery Index.
