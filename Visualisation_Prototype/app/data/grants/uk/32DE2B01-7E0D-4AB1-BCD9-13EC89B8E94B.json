{"id":"32DE2B01-7E0D-4AB1-BCD9-13EC89B8E94B","title":"An Examination of the Judicial Role in Specialist Antisocial Behaviour Response Courts in England and Wales","abstractText":"<p>Since the creation of 157 specialist anti-social behaviour response courts in 2005, no research has previously examined how these new courts are operating, or indeed how their approach to anti-social behaviour differs from that of traditional magistrates' courts. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of this research is to explore the implications of the creation of anti-social behaviour response courts in England and Wales for the judicial role. </p>\n\n<p>The research will situate recent legislative developments in the control of anti-social behaviour within the wider evolution of the criminal justice system towards more specialised and informal modes of delivering 'justice'. </p>\n\n<p>The research will investigate the way(s) in which the community justice model underpinning the work of specialist courts has impacted upon the judicial role in anti-social behaviour response courts in England and Wales.</p>\n\n<p>It will do so by (a) undertaking a series of interviews with magistrates operating in these courts and (b) examining the routine administration of cases that come before the courts through a 6 month cohort study.</p>\n\n<p>The research will establish to what extent there has been an expansion of the judicial role and it will examine how far improving outcomes for 'the community' features as part of the judicial decision-making process. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3715-A","grantId":"RES-000-22-3715-A","fundValue":"41964","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Donoghue","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
