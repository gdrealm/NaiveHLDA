In most patients with tumours confined to the prostate, the cancer can be successfully eradicated using surgery or radiotherapy, nevertheless in about 20% of these patients the tumour relapses, initially within the prostate area but then spreads to other organs such as bone, liver, and lymph nodes. There is no effective treatment for relapsed prostate cancer, drugs that induce a decrease of male hormones can provide a temporary benefit but after one or two years of treatment the cancer becomes insensitive to these drugs. We are developing novel gene therapy treatments for prostate tumours which have relapsed within the prostate. In our current clinical trial we use a genetically modified virus to introduce in the cancer cells a ?suicide? gene which is able to convert an inactive compound (?prodrug?) in a powerful anti cancer drug. The modified virus is injected directly in the relapsed prostate tumour then the ?prodrug? is administered intravenously to the patient. When the ?prodrug? reaches the prostate it is rapidly converted by the suicide gene in an anticancer drug and kills the cancer cells which have been infected with the modified virus. This treatment strategy was safe and showed anti tumour efficacy. Building on these observations we are now planning a new clinical trial using an improved virus which will carry the same suicide gene in combination with a gene able to induce a strong immune response against the cancer cells. In addition, we will use a modified virus injection protocol in order to achieve a uniform distribution of the virus within the whole prostate and to improve the anti-tumour efficacy of our system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0502050","grantId":"G0502050","fundValue":"584114","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2015-07-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Emilio  Porfiri","coPersons":["Vivien  Mautner","Lawrence Sterling Young","Steven  Lee","Nicholas David James","Peter Francis Searle"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
