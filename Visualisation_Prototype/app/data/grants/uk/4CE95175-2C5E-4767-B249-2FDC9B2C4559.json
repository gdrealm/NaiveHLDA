Thus far, we have identified around 800 household surveys from around the world, carried out between the 1880s and 1960s, of which around half are of sufficient scope as to be potentially useful for the investigation of inequality.&nbsp; We will extract the reported demographic and expenditure data by income group from these reports and use them to estimate parameters of the income distribution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Using these estimates, we will investigate the changing nature of inequality within a number of key nation states, and also investigate the time path and geography of global inequality 1880-1960. In addition, we would use these data to estimate other indicators of living conditions, such as nutritional attainment, which may provide further insights into the impact of industrialisation on inequality. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002523/1","grantId":"ES/L002523/1","fundValue":"929277","fundStart":"2014-01-13","fundEnd":"2018-01-12","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Stuart Gazeley","coPersons":["Andrew Thomas Newell"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
