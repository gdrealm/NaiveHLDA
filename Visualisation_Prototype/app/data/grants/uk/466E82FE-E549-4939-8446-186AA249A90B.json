The SiC BJT power module technology has voltage,\nfrequency and thermal ratings substantially greater than existing Si-based modules, which can significantly reduce size and\nenhance reliability and efficiency of power electronics inverters. These benefits will contribute to reducing the cost of\nenergy for offshore renewables.\nThe 50 kVA SiC BJT inverter will be the first of its kind and will act as a stepping-stone to develop and industrialise largescale\nHVDC SiC-based inverters. The performance and benefits of the inverter will be assessed and compared to existing\ncommercial Si-based solutions. In addition, a thorough business plan and exploitation model will be developed to support\nthe follow-on commercialisation.\nThis project aims to prove and quantify the benefits and economics of the SiC BJT technology, on both device and\napplication levels, through the design and testing of a 50 kVA SiC BJT inverter as a building block for high-power HVDC\ninverters and design assessment of an ultra-high voltage 10 kV SiC BJT power device.\nAccording to TSB's Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, the offshore renewable industry contributed circa &pound;1bn to the UK\neconomy and supported 20,000 jobs in 2013. However, only 40% of the lifetime costs of currently operational UK offshore\nwind farms will be spent domestically, since most large-scale components are imported. This project supports the\nexploitation of a new HVDC technology, currently only supplied by non-UK suppliers, such as Siemens and ABB.\nSuccessful commercialisation of project outcomes will not onl reduce the LCOE from offshore renewables, but will also\nincrease the UK content of the supply chain, hence bring economic benefits and create new jobs across the supply chain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506874/1","grantId":"EP/M506874/1","fundValue":"208762","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Anthony McMahon","coPersons":["Florin  Udrea"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
