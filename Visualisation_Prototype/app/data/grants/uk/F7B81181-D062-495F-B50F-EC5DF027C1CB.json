This agenda insists that the individual ownership of assets is an important part of individual well-being. Perhaps the most prominent example of this is the UK governmentâ€™s Child Trust Fund (CTF) which provides all babies born from September 2002 with a &pound;250 or &pound;500 endowment that is placed in an 18 year old savings account. </p>\n\n<p>Two important issues face this agenda today. First, asset policies are combined with programmes for education to improve the financial capability of citizens. However, questions can be asked over the appropriate content of such education. Second, there is concern within the policy community that policies such as the CTF might increase inequality between people as wealthy families are more able to save into assets than poorer families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This grant will support knowledge transfer activities for policy actors and practitioners in both of these areas. Activities include co-authored publications with the Institute for Public Policy Research and Social Market Foundation; policy seminars both in the UK and abroad with bodies such as the New America Foundation, National Institute for Adult Continuing Education and the Welsh Assembly; and meetings with stakeholders and users.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G042071/1","grantId":"ES/G042071/1","fundValue":"67740","fundStart":"2009-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rajiv  Prabhakar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
