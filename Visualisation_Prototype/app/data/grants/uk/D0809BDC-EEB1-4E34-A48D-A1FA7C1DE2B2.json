The controversies concern two issues: labour conditions in the breaking yards and environmental containment. </p>\n\n<p>One policy response has been to rekindle the ship breaking industry in those parts of the world where it has long been moribund (eg the EU). A second has been to begin to explore the potential for technology transfer as a means to improved environmental containment and enhanced labour conditions. </p>\n\n<p>This project takes the second response further. It takes a partnership approach to move identified transitional technical solutions further toward their potential uptake by market. A two-stage workshop is the principle means to progressing this aim. The workshops aim to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Identify lessons learned from other transitional technological transfer projects in the sector.</li>\n\n <li>To draw on these lessons, and from research conducted under The Waste of the World programme, to discuss the solutions identified within recent DEFRA-funded research, and to identify which solutions are socially as well as technically possible.</li>\n\n <li>To enable and facilitate active discussion of these possibilities in Bangladesh. <br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-192-22-0033","grantId":"RES-192-22-0033","fundValue":"6850","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"N  Gregson","coPersons":["Michael A Crang"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
