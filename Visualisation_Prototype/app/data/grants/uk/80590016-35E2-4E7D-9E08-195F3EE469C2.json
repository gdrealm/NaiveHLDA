The project adopts an interdisciplinary approach building on, and developing, previous work from the sociology of childhood and child care social work. The aim is to investigate the role played by food practices in relation to the exercise of care, control, reward and punishment within an institutional setting. Questions of how the distribution and provision of food is understood and conducted are central, as are the possible ways in which these practices can be resisted and negotiated by children within residential care homes.</p>\n\n<p>To conduct the research we will carry out detailed studies of three residential children's homes, including both observation and interviewing. This will involve 24 residential care staff and 24 children aged 10-17. The aim is to provide data which will further our knowledge of issues of care and control within institutional settings and provide practical information and insight to aid the future governance of children's care homes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1581","grantId":"RES-000-23-1581","fundValue":"155589","fundStart":"2006-10-02","fundEnd":"2009-04-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Samantha  Punch","coPersons":["Ian  McIntosh","Ruth  Emond"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
