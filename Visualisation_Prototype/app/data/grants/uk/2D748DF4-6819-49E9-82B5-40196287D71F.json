Analysing Inter-sectoral Collaboration for Service Delivery","abstractText":"<p>Governments of developing countries have widely failed to provide adequate public services. This is particularly important for poor people who need access to primary health, education, water and sanitation to satisfy their own needs and to be productive citizens. In many countries, they have turned to non-governmental providers. The research is concerned with the relationship between government and non-governmental actors in the delivery of these basic services, focusing on basic education, primary health care and community sanitation. </p>\n\n<p>Our research objectives were to understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>the factors that condition the definitions of public action by government and non-governmental actors \n</li>\n <li>how their different goals are managed and controlled through alternative&nbsp;organisational arrangements \n</li>\n <li>how the characteristics of services influence the forms of collaborations between organisations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Practically the research helps to elucidate how these relationships can be strengthened.</p>\n\n<p>The countries where field research was undertaken were Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.&nbsp;These offer a range of types of government/non-governmental collaboration within broadly similar social and political traditions. The research involved a mixed-method approach, based on qualitative analysis of data collected documentary analysis, interviews, overviews of collaboration in three service sectors, and in-depth case studies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0045","grantId":"RES-155-25-0045","fundValue":"272093","fundStart":"2006-01-16","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Batley","coPersons":["Pauline Margaret Rose"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
