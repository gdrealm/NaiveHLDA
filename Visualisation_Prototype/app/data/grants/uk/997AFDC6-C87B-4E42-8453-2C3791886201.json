Several parallel channels in the visual system processes incoming information with that purpose, segmenting the images in both eyes through a series of rapid hierarchically organized stages. This rapid hierarchical processing stream involves a cascade of neural activity that encompasses a series of brain areas, from primary sensory regions that analyse separate visual features (low-level vision), through parts that organise the percept into figures and background (mid-level vision), to parts of the brain that store semantic knowledge on familiar objects (high-level vision). A coherent representation of our environment is thus formed in less than 300 milliseconds of processing time within a range of highly varied brain regions. In the study on visual perception, it is crucial to investigate in which way does the brain manage to coordinate the processing of information on simple visual features such as colour and luminance along each of the transformative stages (low, mid, high-level) that lead to the perception of objects. It is well-known from studies on animals that separate visual channels in mammalian brain process achromatic and chromatic information: magnocellular pathway processes luminance information, while parvo- and koniocellular pathways predominantly subserve colour processing. Both are crucial for everyday object vision but their contributions differ, with luminance considered to be more relevant for rapid processing of lines, edges, shape and motion and colour being more relevant for segmentation of visual scenes. But the extent to which various visual pathways function independently or interactively at different stages of visual processing remains unknown even after many years of study, due to the difficulties in 1) producing stimuli that selectively elicit processing along different pathways and 2) analysing the rapidly evolving neural processes that subserve normal human vision. We intend to conduct a study that will overcome these problems through an innovative experimental approach which joins electroencephalography's (EEG's) ability to divulge millisecond differences in rapid neural processes that underlie human visual perception with the tools of colour psychophysics which allow us to separate out different visual processing streams by defining our stimuli in three-dimensional colour space (a luminance dimension and two chromatic dimensions). The stimulus displays will be controlled through a visual stimulus generator that would enable systematic and concurrent control of inputs into chromatic and achromatic mechanisms. The timecourse of cortical activations and their underlying generators will be identified and the interactions between different pathways modelled by using stimuli that elicit excitations in single (magno-, parvo- or konio-) or multiple (two or all three combined) pathways. The findings of this study will provide an important insight into the ways in which the human brain utilises different types of information during parallel visual processing and will thus significantly contribute to current knowledge on the relations between parallel (magnocellular, parvocellular or koniocellular) and hierarchical (low, mid, high-level) processing. We will be able to describe the neural mechanisms that allow preferential inputs of luminance information into object representation processes and thus enable it to drive everyday vision. A further advantage will be provided by the description of koniocellular contributions to vision which have so far not been studied extensively since this pathway has only recently become the subject of systematic study in human participants.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H019731/1","grantId":"BB/H019731/1","fundValue":"185565","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  One exploitation route concerns the role of basic vision research in sustaining the improvement of machine vision systems: by knowing the properties of human vision very well, it is possible to implement these highly effective heuristics in machine vision development.

Within these limits, the amount of luminance needed to discriminate shapes and objects can be decreased by addition of colour. However, when the luminance signal is strong enough, it appears to dominate discrimination. \n\nWe have also assessed the neural markers of these processes by using electroencephalography (EEG), which indicated that these interactions occur relatively early, around 150-300ms after the image has been observed. Comparing colour only with colour-luminance combinations shows that early brain responses are object-selective only when the image contains both colour and luminance signals. We extended these findings by using several colour-luminance combinations at threshold and at suprathreshold contrast levels. The early EEG response occurred earlier and had larger amplitude at suprathreshold for stimuli defined by luminance alone and luminance combined with a colour signal along the reddish-greenish dimension (differentiating between Long and Mid-wavelength excitation). The full combination of luminance and colour signals (including also the bluish-yellowish, Short-wavelength mechanism) at suprathreshold elicited only a shift in latency but had similar amplitudes to the threshold stimuli. Early object-selectivity was found only for this full combination of colour and luminance. Therefore, the addition of information that excites the Short-wavelength-responsive mechanism at suprathreshold might both suppress the amplitude gain mechanism of the other two channels and enhance sensitivity to some low or mid-level property of objects, relating to lower accuracy rates. This will be followed up in future research.\n\nIn our second line of experiments, we examined the effects that backgrounds have on object classification by adding background elements to the images of objects. The backgrounds were intended not to interfere with the integration of object shape, avoiding the perceptual phenomenon known as crowding of contours. In crowding, the high proximity of background elements worsens performance. In all combinations of colour and luminance signals there was no adverse effect of background, except for a combination of shortwavelength cones (S-cones) with luminance. These adverse effects of shortwavelength-cone signals combined with luminance signals on the extraction of objects from their background indicate that the role of the colour signals in the segregation of objects from the background may not be just facilitatory, but can actually produce negative effects when certain conditions are met. I am following these results up with psychophysical studies aimed at establishing the source of this suppresive interaction, examining if it is due to masking or crowding.\n\nIn summary, experiments conducted as a part of this project have shown that the role of colour in the processing of contours cannot be neglected. In terms of complex scenes, chromatic signals are also likely to influence the processing of shapes within backgrounds. Therefore, interactions between colour and luminance extend throughout the visual processing hierarchy and are relevant for object classification processes.
