This follow-on Knowledge Exchange Platform on Forced Labour and Asylum is developing strategies for tackling the existence of forced labour among refugees and asylum seekers, and ensuring that the research is disseminated in ways that maximise its chances of having a positive impact on policy and practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Platform is working with nine Partner organisations located in different positions along the asylum-labour interface to develop a project designed to produce the most effective way of influencing policy and practice from the research findings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A programme of collaborative activities will promote dialogue between social scientists and research users and generate useful outputs for the latter. The activities consist of an opening and closing Platform Meeting, Stakeholder Dialogue Forums, Practitioner Surgeries, User Workshops, and on-going General Networking and processes of Developing and Disseminating Outputs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005413/1","grantId":"ES/K005413/1","fundValue":"29468","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Waite","coPersons":["Stuart  Hodkinson"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
