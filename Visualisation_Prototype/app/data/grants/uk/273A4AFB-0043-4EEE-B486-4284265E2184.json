Answers to these problems often lie outside the politics of nation-states. To be successful in addressing these problems often necessitates the building of networks of people who interact beyond domestic boundaries. As the politics of the environment have become increasingly intertwined with issues of social justice, globalisation and development, environmental groups have also broadened their agendas. This research seeks to understand how transnational environmental networks can create common understandings and solutions to environmental problems, whilst respecting the diverse cultural spheres into which they enter. Friends of the Earth International is one of the globe's largest environmental organisations. Organisational lessons learned from FoE will be relevant to all who seek common, global environmental solutions.</p> \n<p>The major aim of this project is to assess and explain how Friends of the Earth - the largest transnational semi-institutionalised environmental network - negotiates a common identity and joint action across autonomous groups in 70 countries. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-155-25-0008","grantId":"RES-155-25-0008","fundValue":"54089","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Brian  Doherty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
