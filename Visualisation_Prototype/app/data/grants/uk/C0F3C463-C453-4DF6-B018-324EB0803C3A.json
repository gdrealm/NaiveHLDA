In the UK the steady decline in TB cases over the whole of the last century halted in the mid 1980s and there has been alarming signs of increased numbers of cases in certain communities. The situation is compounded by the AIDS epidemic and by the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that are resistant to virtually all the drugs that would normally be used to treat TB. It can be argued that, globally, M. tuberculosis is the single most important infectious agent affecting mankind. All bacteria have cells that, like plants, are enclosed in a cell wall. This protects the organism from its immediate environment and, fortuitously, presents an important target for drugs, like penicillin, that can be used to treat bacterial infections. However, M. tuberculosis has a distinctive cell wall that differs in composition from that of other bacteria. Although there are drugs that affect the unique M. tuberculosis cell wall, the current treatment for tuberculosis lasts 6 months and is potentially toxic to patients who often cease treatment early. Moreover, the efficacy of treatment is threatened by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. There is a great need for new and better drugs to treat TB. The work proposed here therefore fulfils the clear need to extend our understanding of the bacterial physiology of the tubercle bacillus in the hope of priming novel therapeutic approaches to this ancient human adversary. Communication to the general public will be channelled through the University Press Office at Birmingham (http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/office.htm) which has established contacts in the local and national media. The applicants will also highlight there research through personal University based Web pages, which has open access.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001023","grantId":"G1001023","fundValue":"609790","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gurdyal Singh  Besra","coPersons":["Christopher Gerrard Dowson","Adrian John Lloyd","David Ian  Roper"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
