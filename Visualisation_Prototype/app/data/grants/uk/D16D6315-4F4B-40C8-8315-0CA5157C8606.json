This coefficient characterizes the signal seen far from the object; these can be awkward to evaluate and re-evaluate as a parameter changes.Embedding offers the possibility of revolutionizing how these are calculated, basically one instead solves a master problem and one evaluates its directivity. The directivity one actually wants to have is found from this by manipulations, the key point is that less variables are involved in the master problem so you evaluate this directivity only a few times. Hence one could potentially model, say, scattering by a crack in a rail track by doing just a few calculations and model the effect of altering the incoming wavefield without ever having solve the problem again.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D045576/1","grantId":"EP/D045576/1","fundValue":"102796","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Craster","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
