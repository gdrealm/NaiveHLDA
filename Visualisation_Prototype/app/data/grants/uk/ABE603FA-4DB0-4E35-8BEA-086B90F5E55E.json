{"id":"ABE603FA-4DB0-4E35-8BEA-086B90F5E55E","title":"A universal T cell vaccine for HIV-1","abstractText":"HIV infection and AIDS continues to spread in a virtually uncontrolled manner. The best and possibly only hope to change this alarming situation is a safe, effective, accessible protective vaccine. Arguably the biggest challenge in developing such a vaccine is enormous HIV variability, which dwarfs that of almost any other infection. However, all parts of the virus cannot easily change. To remain alive, HIV has to keep some smaller regions of its proteins more or less constant. We have taken an advantage of this and constructed a candidate vaccine designed specifically to overcome HIV variability by focusing the body defences on the conserved regions of the virus, i.e. the Achilles heel of HIV. Here, we are proposing to build on and extend our ongoing vaccine development effort and, if successful, assemble a strong case for further evaluation of this vaccination strategy in larger scale and expensive field efficacy studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001757","grantId":"G1001757","fundValue":"1322810","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tomas  Hanke","coPersons":["Andrew J McMichael","Benedikt Mathias Kessler","Adrian Vivian Hill"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
