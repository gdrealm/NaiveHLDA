{"id":"5183244A-86EC-49A7-A096-470D16B1A6D0","title":"Developing the UK Role in Extremely Large Telescopes","abstractText":"The next generation of ground-based telescopes are expected to be in the range 30 to 100 m in diameter. Worldwide activity in planning these extremely large telescopes (ELTs) is rapidly gathering momentum, with major feasibilty studies being started or proposed in Europe, the US and Canada, and strong interest in Australia and Japan. The UK has experience in all stages of planning, development and use of current large (8m class) telescopes and is in a strong position to be a major contributor in the development and exploitation of future ELTs. This grant proposal is to support UK activity in ELTs, specifically in scientific aspects including development of the science case and its translation to technical specifications. The EU has awarded funding (through OPTICON) which allows half-funding for a scientist to work on the science case for ELTs. A matching contribution from PPARC will enable a full-time scientist, based in the UK, to carry out this role and also work as co-Project scientist for a major European ELT design study currently being proposed to the EU. The new UK ELT project scientist will also support and develop the UK's role in ELT projects Worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/B500858/1","grantId":"PP/B500858/1","fundValue":"384684","fundStart":"2004-06-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roger L Davies","coPersons":["Patrick Francis Roche"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" We designed an optical-infrared integral field spectrograph for \nESOs EELT.
