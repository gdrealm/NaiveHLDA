One aspect fundamental to communication in everyday discourse is 'common ground', defined as the knowledge, beliefs and assumptions that interactants share and know that they share. </p>\n\n<p>Common ground allows us to coordinate and collaborate in social interaction and is thus crucial to face-to-face dialogue. A host of investigations has provided us with important empirical evidence for how such common ground influences communication. Despite this, these studies all have one serious limitation: their exclusive focus on verbal language use. </p>\n\n<p>In recent decades, important advances in the field of human communication have been made showing that language consists of both speech and gesture. These 'co-speech' gestures are spontaneous movements of the hands and arms and ubiquitous in conversation. Importantly, these gestural movements are not random but tightly coupled with speech both semantically and temporally, and they have been shown to convey core semantic information in talk. To date, we therefore have only a partial understanding of how common ground influences communication. </p>\n\n<p>The proposed research aims to expand our knowledge on this topic and to develop a more complete model of common ground in language use. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H009280/1","grantId":"ES/H009280/1","fundValue":"79005","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith Anne Holler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
