Kiely (Lehigh University, USA) G.J. Hutchings &amp; J.K. Bartley (Cardiff University, UK)This research relates to the preparation of new heterogeneous catalysts using a new materials science approach. The overall aim of this research program is to develop new one-step preparation methodologies for heterogeneous catalysts currently being made via multi-step processes using the heat treatment of precursors formed at low temperatures (&lt;200 C) and low pressures (typically 1 bar). The project aims to Specific objectives will include:a) The preparation of novel materials using high pressures and temperatures in an autoclave utilizing three phase (gas/liquid/solid) systems below the critical point and two phase systems above the critical point; studies will focus initially on vanadium phosphates, and will subsequently be extended to niobium and molybdenum phosphates.b) The preparation of novel materials using a high temperature / high pressure flow reactor in which mixtures can be exposed to non-standard reaction conditions. Where appropriate in-situ diffraction and spectroscopy techniques will be employed to follow the transformations occurring during material synthesis. This method will be used to explore the preparation of oxides and phosphates.c) The materials will be evaluated as catalysts for alkane oxidation and oxidative hydrogenation.d) The materials prepared will be structurally and chemically characterized with a full range of state-of-the-art microscopy, spectroscopy and diffraction methods. The aim being to determine structure/function relationships as the basis of improved catalyst design.These goals will be achieved by combining the expertise of two research groups that have a long and very successful 16 year record of performing collaborative research together. The UK group, led by Professor Hutchings, will spearhead research into the new catalyst preparation methodologies. They will also assess the materials produced for their usefulness as partial oxidation catalysts. The USA contribution, under the direction of Professor Kiely, will be to perform detailed structural characterization of the catalysts produced with the aim of establishing meaningful structure-function relationships.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F023103/1","grantId":"EP/F023103/1","fundValue":"337877","fundStart":"2007-11-19","fundEnd":"2010-11-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have used the outcomes to design new active catalysts Chemicals Societal","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" We have explored the to use of high temperatures and pressures to prepare new catalysts The research has been useful in the preparation of catalysts in teh academic community Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
