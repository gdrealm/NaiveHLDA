{"id":"E831196F-EBC4-4BB7-BA40-99C6794C0313","title":"Characterisation and Measurements of Radiated Emissions and Immunity of Equipment with Cables","abstractText":"Any electric and electronic equipment sold within the European Union has to comply with the EC Directive on Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). To achieve compliance, the equipment must be tested for radiated and conducted emissions and immunity. There is a strong interest within the standards making bodies as well as in industry to develop fast and accurate test methods that are reliable and repeatable. This is essential for a wide range of applications such as electromagnetic product safety, system interoperability, and signal integrity.National and international standards are already in force, which describe test methods for different applications. There is however still a lack of standards describing test methods for equipment with cables, particularly at higher frequencies. Since electric and electronic appliances have cables, this is a significant gap. Therefore the standards needs to be further developed, which is only possible if underlying research has been done first. The work of this proposal will make a significant contribution in this area and thus fill a significant gap in our scientific understanding and control of emission and immunity problems caused by the inevitable presence of cables in a wide majority of equipment. The aim of this work is to develop characterisation and test procedures for radiated emission and immunity measurements of equipment with cables that is applicable to a wide range of test environments and cable configurations and provides reliable and repeatable results, while keeping the test effort small and remaining consistent with the real-life behaviour of the equipment under test. There is a need to establish scientifically sound techniques for testing of equipment with cables, so that measurements in one environment (e.g. a Fully Anechoic Room) can be compared to measurements in other environments (e.g. a Reverberation Chamber or a TEM Waveguide). A further aim is to use results obtained from measurements and testing to develop models suitable for use in simulations thus offering the attractive option of demonstrating compliance by simulation. These aims can only be achieved if characterisation and measurements are based on sound science.The main challenge for this project is to make this procedure generic, applicable to as many products and potential cable configurations as possible, to make it valid in all generally used test environments, while keeping it simple and without changing the characteristics of the tested equipment, so that the real-life behaviour of the product is reflected in the measurements and numerical models.This proposal builds on the applicant's previous work on state of the art experimental techniques and the Institute's strength in the development of powerful numerical models of EMC test environments. It is therefore a strategic fit to the Institute's aims and objectives. It will consolidate the applicant's expertise in measurement and characterization of equipment at high frequencies and offer her the opportunity of tapping into the wealth of modelling expertise at the Institute. The synthesis of these two strands of work (measurements and simulations) will offer her a long-term research theme focussed on the development of complementary experimental and numerical tools for demonstrating compliance of complex equipment at high frequencies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F069677/1","grantId":"EP/F069677/1","fundValue":"201830","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Input to IEC 61000-4-20 Ed. 2.0 Electronics ","person":"Angela  Nothofer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
