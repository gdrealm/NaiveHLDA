{"id":"632C5AC2-DEC1-41E3-8850-74E0267F25DD","title":"PORE-LEVEL NETWORK MODELLING OF THE MISCIBLE DISPLACEMENT","abstractText":"The project's aim is to comprehend the hydrodynamic aspects of the oil extraction process. This process, in general, includes two stages: dissolution of oil and displacement of a solution from porous media. The focus of the project is, therefore, twofold: (i) to develop and verify a theoretical model for an evolving miscible displacement with an account of dynamic surface tension and mass diffusion, and (ii) to provide a model for the miscible displacement from the porous volume. Owing to complexity in modelling the evolution of the interface between inter-diffusing liquids, a detailed theoretical analysis of the hydrodynamics of dissolution process has not been provided thus far. The pore-level description of the solvent extraction process from the porous medium has not been undertaken either.The final goal of the project is to construct the dynamic 2D network model of oil dissolution from porous media. The throats of the network will be represented as the capillary tubes of square cross-section of random side-widths; as the pores will be the volumes connecting four tubes. We will develop the numerical code for the 2D and 3D resolution of solvent/solute flows within a single element of the network, and then, will combine the results into macroscopic network. The evolution of the miscible solvent/solute interface will be modelled within the phase-field approach. The developed theoretical model will be verified by a series of experiments designed so that to support the calculations, i.e. to investigate the dynamics of miscible displacement through a single capillary tube of square cross-section and through a network of tubes.The project will help to predict the rate of oil dissolution from porous media, and its dependence on time, injection flux, wetting conditions, etc. We will determine the physical conditions, the time, and volume of solvent required for efficient complete or partial solvent extraction or cleaning. The results will be valuable for modelling of the various industrial processes, including the vegetable solvent extraction, and enhanced oil recovery and enhanced aquifer remediation in which the miscible injection is used for oil displacement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G014337/1","grantId":"EP/G014337/1","fundValue":"264281","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2012-08-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We continue this research work.

These are quasi-compressible equations: full continuity equation is required to describe evolution of two incompressible liquids, which makes numerical solution unfeasible. Using multiple-scale method we separated fast quasi-acoustic and slow diffusive and convective processes and derived the low-Mach-number (Boussinesq) approximation of the full equations. The obtained equations represent a general model for the analysis of slow thermo- and hydro-dynamic evolution of multiphase systems with diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e., for processes involving dissolution/nucleation, evaporation/condensation, solidification/melting, polymerization, etc.\n(ii) We investigate the dynamics of liquid/liquid phase transition. For this, we isolate the diffusive mass transport from hydrodynamic flows. The dissolution dynamics was found to occur completely unexpectedly. In addition to slow smearing, solute/solute phase boundary moves as a whole due to barodiffusion. We also showed that such a boundary is endowed with the surface tension. Despite a seeming simplicity of the experiments, there is no theory that could describe our observations. Proper understanding of the liquid/liquid solute/solvent dissolution process can be utilised as the framework for a computational tool to be used to control various industrial processes such as vegetable oil extraction, enhanced oil recovery, soil and aquifer remediation, cleaning, etc. Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
