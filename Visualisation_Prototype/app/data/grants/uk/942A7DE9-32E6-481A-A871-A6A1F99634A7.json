The Centre has a wide portfolio of activities from longer term, higher risk adventurous research, through medium term application research and development to short term practical projects and technology transfer activities with SMEs and other exploiters of new products. EPSRC funds support the longer term, adventurous research while industry funds support the full range of research. A wide range of research outcomes have been delivered, information disseminated to the community and technology transfer actions put in place.

New approaches to NDE with micromachined transducers (University of Warwick)\n\n\n\nThis project has successfully generated the basis for exploitation of the rapid and low cost Micro-Stereo Lithography (MSL) technique for future NDE transducer developments. Development and characterisation of a range of transducers has included: \n\n• Electrostatic ultrasonic devices which have promise for structural health monitoring or acoustic emission monitoring. \n\n• Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) coils with different geometries to generate ultrasonic beams at various angles and to enable use as detectors for laser-generated ultrasound.\n\n• Miniature and flexible eddy current arrays for inspection of components with difficult or varying geometries. \n\n\n\nKey references:\n\n[a] Ho, KS., Bradley, RJ., Billson, DR., and Hutchins, DA., Ultrasonics. 48, 1-5, 2008.\n\n[b] Yin, X., Hutchins, DA., Diamond, GG., and Purnell, P., Cement and Concrete Res., Vol.40,1734-1743 2010. \n\n[c] Dixon, SM., Burrows, SE., and Fan.

Permanently installed monitoring of creep damage (Imperial College) \n\n\n\nDevelopment of a quasi-dc potential drop measurement technique for monitoring the progress of creep: \n\n• Successful development of a method which effectively provides a high temperature strain gauge with a gauge factor of around 5-6 in the early stages of creep. In the later stages the gauge factor increases to around 10. \n\n• Production of a robust measurement system that gives excellent results in the lab, is suitable for limited site trials and provides a potentially robust monitoring method.\n\n• A deployable probe has been constructed and it has been confirmed that the changes due to voiding late in the creep life of a 2.25% Cr – 1% Mo ferritic steel specimen are less than 1%; this order of magnitude has been confirmed by an analytical model;\n\n• The changes due to voiding may be larger in the vicinity of welds where the defects are concentrated in the plane of the fusion face; this is being investigated in a follow-on project.\n\n\n\nKey references:\n\n[a] Sposito, G., Ward, C., Cawley, P., Nagy, P. and Scruby, C., NDT&amp;E International, Vol 43, pp555-567, 2010.\n\n[b] Madhi, E., Sposito, G., Davies, CM., Cawley, P. and Nagy, PB., Review of Progress in Quantitative NDE, Vol 30, DO Thompson and DE Chimenti (eds), American Institute of Physics, pp1631-1638, 2011.\n\n[c] Prajapati, S., Nagy, P.B. and Cawley, P.

Nonlinear material inspection (University of Bristol) \n\n\n\nProgramme to develop a robust nonlinear ultrasonic inspection technique, given that equipment often induces nonlinearity and the nonlinear signals are themselves typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the linear signals: \n\n• The work has shown how harmonic generation methods need to be corrected to produce a measurement suitable for comparison across multiple specimens. In addition the effects of experimental variability were studied. This work is vital to ensure that measurements made at different distances and with different specimens can be compared. \n\n• The research has shown the potential of the noncollinear technique, which relies on mixing of two waves to generate a third wave due to material nonlinearity and in principle can be used to detect changes in material state.\n\n\n\nKey references:\n\n[a] Croxford, A., Wilcox, P., Drinkwater, B., Nagy, P., J.

Outcomes include:\n\n• Significant progress in characterising different positional sensors and algorithms for accurate robot positioning.\n\n• Evaluation and enhancement of new sensors including air-coupled ultrasonic inspection, focusing on the creation of a synthetic ultrasonic array using a single robot with pulse-echo transducers, and a new ‘whisker’ sensor for surface characterisation \n\n• Delivery of a demonstrator system (TRL 4) that can perform automated Magnetic Flux Leakage and visual inspection. Results from each dataset can be fused into a single composite result and presented clearly to the operator.\n\n \n\nKey references:\n\n[a] Macleod CN, Pierce SG, Sullivan JC, Pipe A, Dobie G and Summan R., Accepted for publication in IEEE Sensors Journal, 2014.\n\n[b] Dobie, G., Pierce, SG., and Hayward, G., NDT &amp; E International, Volume 58, pp 10-17, September 2013.\n\n[c] Dobie G., Summan, R., MacLeod, C., Pierce, SG., NDT&amp;E International, Volume 57, pp 17-25, July, 2013.\n\n[d] Jackson, JC., Summan, R., Dobie, G., Whiteley, S., Pierce, G., Hayward, G., IEEE Trans.

The research has been aimed at providing improved inspection technology capabilities to meet long term industry objectives – through the development of new sensor and imaging techniques as well as improving the basic understanding of current techniques. The research will have applications across many industry sectors in two major areas:\n\n• Advanced manufacturing – providing the new and improved non-destructive evaluation capabilities needed to assure the quality of manufactured products and meet engineering challenges related to new product designs, new engineering materials and ever more extreme operating conditions. Example applications include aerospace (eg engines and composite aircraft structures), power (eg new nuclear, renewable and next generation fossil plant) and Oil &amp; Gas (eg deep water plant and equipment). \n\n• Existing plant and infrastructure – providing inspection capabilities to maximise the safety and economic operation of plant and equipment, including the advanced inspection capabilities needed to enable life extension of much of the UK’s ageing infrastructure. Example applications include life extension of ageing aircraft, oil &amp; gas plant, nuclear and fossil power stations, and introducing monitoring technologies to minimise disruptive in-service inspection. Research outcomes from the 6 university consortium members will be exploited in a variety of ways including via spin-out companies, licensing and open access use by industry – with examples of all these routes already in place for some of the early research. The RCNDE consortium includes major end user industrial partners as well as Associate members from the NDE supply chain so that strong links and information flows have been in place with potential exploiters throughout the research programme. Many of the industrial partners have already invested in in-house implementation of relevant exploitable research and others access through the supply chain. \n\nSignificant follow-on funding has been secured to raise the research to higher Technology Readiness Levels including direct industrial investment, TSB, EU and regional development funding. \n\nA further EPSRC grant for RCNDE core research has been secured for 2014-2020, and the RCNDE management Board will continue to undertake a number of technology transfer activities to facilitate exploitation of past and future research, including technology transfer information events, technology readiness workshops and use of industry member funds for specific technology transfer projects.
