This project delivered more efficient computational methods to support the design of low-noise fan stages.\n\nThese methods are currently used and further developed in a project with Rolls-Royce plc. In addition these methods have been adopted by other research institutes in France (ONERA) and in Germany (DLR).

The random nature of many aeroacoustic problems stems from the presence of turbulent flows which act as noise sources and also as an uncertain medium through which sound propagates. The challenge is to devise numerical methods which preserve in some sense the uncertainty of the sound field and still represent accurately the complex physics of sound propagation through non-uniform flows.\n\nThe project focused on predicting broadband fan noise which is generated when fan blades or stator vanes interact with their boundary layers or with turbulent wakes from other blades located upstream. After some preliminary tests the project concentrated on a variant of the random-vortex-particle method, where the turbulence impinging on the aerofoil is represented by a set of point vortices with random strengths. This method was preferred against other methods, especially stochastic methods based on Fourier, for its ability to represent efficiently inhomogeneous turbulent fields.\n\nThe following is a list of the main achievements of the project:\n- The stochastic method was extended to describe non-Gaussian spectrum, by modifying the nature of the filter. This technique has proved to be quite accurate (provided some care is taken with the numerical implementation) and allows for more realistic turbulence spectra to be modelled.\n- The problem of representing evolving, rather than frozen, turbulence has been tackled. Again this allowed a more realistic description of the targeted applications. It was demonstrated that using standard Langevin equations to represent the evolution of the vortex strengths is not well suited for numerical simulation of the acoustic field. A more complex, but more robust, stochastic model was devised and validated for that purpose.\n- Inhomogeneous turbulence was also modelled using the random-vortex-particle method to provide an accurate description of the train of turbulent wakes seen by the stator vanes in a turbofan engine.\n\nThe numerical tools developed in this project were validated against analytical models for a flat plate interacting with a uniform turbulent stream. And numerical predictions have also been compared against experimental data for an isolated aerofoil in a turbulent jet, and very good agreement was observed. The project was able to increase the range of applications that can be treated by computational aero-acoustics by demonstrating that stochastic methods can be used successfully to predict broadband fan noise. The prediction methods devised during the project will be further developed during a project funded by TSB and Rolls-Royce, with a particular focus on broadband fan noise.\n\nAlso another project, funded by EPSRC, will involve the prediction methods developed in this project to study the spectrum broadening caused by the interaction of sound with turbulence.
