However, their cost is often enhanced by object-oriented design and manufacturing, wherein a costly nanomanufacturing process is used for making one product for one application. By using structured design philosophies similar to the ones used in popular Complementary mental oxide semiconductor (CMOS) Integrated Circuits, we propose to showcase the feasibility of cheap nanosensors as well as integration of nanosystems with existing manufacturing facilities. This provides an opportunity for existing IC design houses to include nanosystems in their design flow, while developing a novel single chip low cost multifunctional nano-sensor array made from Graphene.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N010159/1","grantId":"EP/N010159/1","fundValue":"298001","fundStart":"2016-01-08","fundEnd":"2017-07-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Bhaskar  Choubey","coPersons":["Harish  Bhaskaran"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
