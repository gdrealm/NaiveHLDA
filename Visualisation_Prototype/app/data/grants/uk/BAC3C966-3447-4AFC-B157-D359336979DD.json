As well as being able to create an external magnetic field that can be observed or used, magnetism can determine other properties of the material itself. In our project we will be studying materials where the underlying physics behind these magnetic properties is as yet poorly understood. We will also making accurate measurements of property known as spin polarisation, in materials that could be of use for technological development in the future. The other main aspect of our work is to perform experiments that should contribute to our understanding of superconductivity. In our project we will study a set of these materials where there is currently significant controversy surrounding the underlying electronic structure, with different results being found using different experimental techniques. Our experiments will help to resolve these problems.\n\nIn order to provide the sensitivities required, these experiments all require us to use x-rays to measure specific details of the magnetic properties. The only way to obtain x-rays of sufficient intensity and with the particular properities required, is to use a synchrotron source. There are a few of these available world-wide. The choice of synchrotron for these experiments was based on the particular experimental facilities and x-ray energy available at the SPring-8 synchrotron in Japan.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J002925/1","grantId":"EP/J002925/1","fundValue":"136200","fundStart":"2011-10-03","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Brian  Dugdale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" We have developed a new code to help the interpretation of experimental data. This code is about to be released into the public domain as part of an open-source package. We have also used this code ourselves to try to understand the magnetism in a particularly interesting material, PdCrO2. Our code will be made freely available, meaning that others can benefit directly from our research. This might mean anyone who wants to understand how electrons are behaving in materials.
