In the nutrient-poor central regions of the oceans this production of oxygen is dominated by very small, single celled organisms, which are referred to as the photosynthetic picoplankton.

The genus is genetically diverse, demonstrating heterogeneity at the level of the 16S rDNA gene, which thus far has phylogenetically defined at least ten distinct lineages or clades.

This idea is consistent with recent molecular ecological work from my lab which has demonstrated distinct spatial distributions of these lineages in situ, which we suggest is akin to occupying specific niches.\n\nTo more completely understand the molecular basis of this niche adaptation we undertook a genomic approach to begin to identify gene sets that might define the ecological 'distinctness' of these lineages. We have shown that while members of a given marine Synechococcus lineage may have the same broad geographical distribution, local niche occupancy is facilitated by lateral gene transfers, a process in which genomic islands play a key role as a repository for transferred genes. The genes contained within these genomic islands are hence excellent indicators of the environmental pressures individual isolates are experiencing and may be a novel way of predicting environmental controls on growth in these organisms, which has implications for understanding regulation of marine carbon cycling. Our work also highlights the need for developing picocyanobacterial systematics based on genome-derived parameters combined with ecological and physiological data. The role of genomic islands in an environmentally ubiquitous marine phototroph will be taken forward by ourselves and other marine micorobiologists to assess their functional role - since these islands are critical to identfying the link between diversity and environmental adaptation Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
