{"id":"752E2A7F-39DD-4294-9282-77987BDD5844","title":"The Role of Parliaments in the Protection and Realisation of the Rule of Law and Human Rights","abstractText":"The main aim of the proposed one-day conference is to bring together relevant experts, including policy-makers, legislators and academics, to focus entirely on a working draft of the principles and guidelines and to hold a series of focused discussions on key aspects of them. The intention is to initiate an international process with a view to the eventual adoption by the international community (potentially via the UN and/or the IPU) of an agreed set of principles and guidelines. The conference will provide an environment to discuss the draft document and to subject its content to constructive criticism and scrutiny by delegates. It will also ensure that stakeholders with a diverse range of perspectives are involved in discussion of whether and, if so, how a set of internationally agreed principles can be adopted in practice. One important question is how to devise some useful standards and guidelines which will be of use in all countries, but which can take root and grow organically in very different cultures and political systems, and the contribution of cross-cultural and historical perspectives will therefore be crucial.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504294/1","grantId":"AH/N504294/1","fundValue":"27646","fundStart":"2015-05-15","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Murray  Hunt","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
