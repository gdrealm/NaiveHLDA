Following a stroke, many patients are disabled and require help with activities of daily living, such as moving, bathing, dressing, and toileting. After discharge from hospital, this help is often provided by family members. The sudden change in lifestyle is very difficult and it can be hard for stroke patients and their families to cope. Many patients become depressed and are reluctant to go out and caregivers become stressed and anxious. This study aims to see if a hands on structured training programme for carers can reduce this burden and also improve patient’s physical ability. The study involves 36 hospital stroke units from different areas of the country. In half of these stroke units, caregivers will be trained using the hands on skilled training programme. We will compare patients and caregivers that have received the training with those who have not. We will look at their mental health, social life, physical progress and value for money. If the study shows that patients and caregivers do better with the training, we will be able to suggest that such a training programme be provided to all patients and their caregivers after stroke","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501807","grantId":"G0501807","fundValue":"1623230","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Forster","coPersons":["Amanda  Farrin","Lalit  Kalra","John  Young","D  Smithard","Anita  Patel","Jane  Nixon","Martin Richard Knapp"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
