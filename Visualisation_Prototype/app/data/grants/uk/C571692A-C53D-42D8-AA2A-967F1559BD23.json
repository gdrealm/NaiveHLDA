In a survey of humanities curricula in 17 Canadian medical schools, Kidd (2008) found that 'Canadian medical humanities programs are largely shaped by individual educators' interests, experience and passions.' Moreover, while there is agreement that the health humanities should strive to foster empathy, respect, self-awareness, and reflective practice among students, there is not much hard evidence to show that humanities disciplines help cultivate any of these qualities. \n\nPerhaps the most novel claim about a humanities discipline has been made on behalf of literary study. Charon et al (1995) argued that 1) 'literary accounts of illness can teach physicians concrete and powerful lessons about the lives of sick people; 2) great works of fiction about medicine enable physicians to recognize the power and implications of what they do; 3) through the study of narrative, the physician can better understand patients' stories of sickness and his or her own personal stake in medical practice; 4) literary study contributes to physicians' expertise in narrative ethics; and 5) literary theory offers new perspectives on the work and the genres of medicine.'\n\nThe investigators in this study wish to explore the possible differences a taught course in literary reading might make to clinicians in their professional lives and how any such differences might be measured. To that end, they will convene two interdisciplinary methodological workshops which will lay the ground for a randomised controlled trial involving a taught and an untaught group who will read the same literary works in the same sequence over a one year period. The first workshop will determine the best outcome and process measures of difference between the two groups. This will entail a dialogue between literary researchers and researchers with a scientific training in the conduct of comparative trials. The second workshop will have as its aim to devise a course composed exclusively of demanding texts, spanning a range of periods and cultural attitudes, which will call into question easy assumptions about medicine, illness, health, the body and human flourishing. \n\nThe study matters because large sums in higher education resources are currently being directed into the health humanities. Research funders in the UK and abroad are developing this area; the evidence base for their decisions is still underdeveloped. \n\nTwo international scholars will be invited to both workshops: Dr Rolf Ahlz&eacute;n, from the University of Karlstad, Sweden, who has written a PhD thesis entitled 'Why Doctors Should Read' (not yet published); and Prof. Anne Scott, an internationally renowned health humanist at Dublin City University where she is professor and head of the School of Nursing. Prof. Scott has a strong interest in the role of the humanities in professional education and clinical practice. Each workshop will be carefully structured in advance and will last one day for a maximum of 10-12 participants.\n\nThe results will be disseminated to the Medical / Health Humanities community including funders. The investigators hope to use the outcome of this exploratory award to apply for funding for a large-scale, interdisciplinary study next year.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J011444/1","grantId":"AH/J011444/1","fundValue":"16194","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2012-06-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  We developed a multicentre proposal to answer the question 'What difference might the study of imaginative literature make to clinicians in their professional lives?' by creating facilitated, multi-health-professional reading groups comprising 100 clinician readers which would run monthly for a year and be evaluated by participant observers, and validated questionnaires that measure certain clinical virtues, literary response skills and signs of burnout. This was submitted to the Science and Culture AHRC call in 2013 and received favourable reviews and was short-listed but not funded. The main impact has therefore been on the thinking on research design of the Exploratory Award holders which was transmitted to the AHRC, its peer reviewers and Panel members.

The workshops were specifically interested in whether it would be possible to set up a controlled assessment to measure such impact. The participants included literary scholars, academic specialists in the health humanities from medicine and nursing, a trials methodologist, GPs, a hospital doctor, philosophers, as well as clinicians and physicians who teach literature as part of professional medical training.\nWe reached two major sets of findings: \no the first was that an exploratory study not involving randomization could produce interesting results which would prove useful to a subsequent, more ambitious study \no the second is that a randomised controlled trial to study the impact of literary study on clinicians is not warranted at the moment, given the underdeveloped state of understanding in this area. However, it was agreed that an uncontrolled exploratory study was warranted and could be designed to answer important questions in a robust manner.\n\nA full bid whose central research question was ' What difference might the study of imaginative literature make to clinicians in their professional lives?' was worked up by the reseach team and subsequently submitted to the Science and Culture call. It was short-listed but not funded. The role of imaginative literature in the education of health care staff remains a live research question. We would be happy to share with others the results of our workshops as well as our deliberations on the most appropriate type of study to answer this question. Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
