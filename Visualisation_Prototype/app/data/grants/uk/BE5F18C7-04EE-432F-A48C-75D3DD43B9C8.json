This type of instrument is an important tool used across many science and engineering disciplines, including for example nanotechnology, chemistry, surface science, functional materials, pharmaceuticals, catalysis, metallurgy, sensors, the environment and energy. LiPPS will provide unique atomistic measurements of both bulk liquids and solutes there-in. Other new features make this instrument easier to operate, able to deal with a wider range of sample types and to acquire data autonomously. \n\nThis unique facility will provide UK universities and industry with the opportunity to carry out world-leading research. By providing open access at the Nottingham Nanotechnology and Nanoscience Centre (NNNC) at the University of Nottingham we aim to maximise the impact of this instrument on UK science and industry. To help achieve this Nottingham will collaborate with other leading centres of Photoelectron Electron Spectroscopy particularly the new national facility (NEXUS) hosted by Newcastle. \n\nThe NNNC operates as a sustainable cross-faculty multidisciplinary centre supporting open-access to state-of the art-instrumentation. The provision of such facilities is a priority of the University of Nottingham. The new LiPPS instrument will become a key service within the NNNC which is committed to the long term maintenance and updating of this resource for the benefit of research in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K005138/1","grantId":"EP/K005138/1","fundValue":"15523200","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2022-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  ShakesheffJessica Lois  CornerSaul  Tendler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Axis Ultra DLD LiPPS:\nDevelopment of new depth/layering models for ionic solutions in their solid, liquid and a glass states.\n\nTof SIMS gas cluster ion beam: This system has allowed studies of polymer multi-layer systems in collaboration with NPL.
