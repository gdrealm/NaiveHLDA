We are not sure how or why this occurs, but it is caused by a marked decrease of blood flow to the kidneys, itself caused by a reduction in the effectiveness of the heart to beat blood around the body, an opening up of blood vessels that supply the intestines, and increased production of a series of compounds which reduce kidney blood flow further. We appear to have a good animal model of this syndrome, but it needs further characterisation and direct comparison to patients with acute or acute on chronic liver failure who develop the hepatorenal syndrome. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that this animal model of acute liver and kidney failure is representative of the human disease. The second part of the study will determine some mechanisms by which we can improve kidney function in this animal model and hopefully use to treat patients with the hepatorenal syndrome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800971","grantId":"G0800971","fundValue":"407421","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin Peter Moore","coPersons":["Andrew  Burroughs"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
