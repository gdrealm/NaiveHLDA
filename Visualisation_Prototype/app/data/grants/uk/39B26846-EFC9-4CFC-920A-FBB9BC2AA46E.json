This particular application is chosen here because NAs, such as molybdenum disulphide, fullerenes and dispersed PTFE (Teflon), are being increasingly considered for use in formulation of advanced lubricants. Lubricant nanoadditives (NAs) are broadly defined as nanoparticles (NPs) that are deliberately added to a lubricant to obtain desired properties. Greener, more efficient lubricants can only be developed through thorough molecular understanding on lubricating mechanisms under realistic working conditions. Currently, mechanisms of how NP interacts with lubricant contacts are not known. Previous research either infers behaviour from indirect methods, or only correlates macroscopic responses, such as friction &amp; wear, to macroscopic control variables such as load, speed, etc. The proposed work is aimed at radically change the research landscape by introducing methods to directly observe NPs' behaviour, in the nano-scale, in and around the lubricated contact. \n\nThe proposed work will focus on the dynamics and behaviour of NPs around and within tribological contacts, and their effectiveness as NAs. The overall aim of the proposed research is to understand the interactions between NPs, base oil and the rubbing surfaces and how these influence NPs' lubricating properties and the rheology of a formulated lubricant. The effect of substrate properties and NP surface properties, NPs' size and the relative velocity of the two rubbing surfaces will also be explored. The proposed research constitutes a vital step towards exploring and understanding the lubricating mechanism of NPs. Various researchers have hypothesised different lubricating mechanisms when NPs is added in lubricant and the proposed work provide results that could be used to directly verify simulation works. The findings will contribute to improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of lubrication and the role of NPs in forming boundary films. The research will also contribute to improved strategies for wear and friction reduction both in lubricant formulations and engineering components design. \n\nThe study will develop advanced in-contact analytical techniques to allow in situ observation of the dynamics of NPs under confined conditions. A test apparatus for this purpose will be constructed, and advanced, single particle/molecule level fluorescence techniques will be applied to track NPs in-situ in very thin film lubricated contacts under engineering conditions. This will allow correlation of macroscopic observables, such as frictional force and wear damage, to nanoscopic/molecule level behaviour, such as self-assembly and adsorption-desorption kinetics of nanoadditives. It should be noted that the experimental approaches that will be devised during the research programme are generic and will have applications to several other engineering fields such as multiphase flow and microfluidics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008141/1","grantId":"EP/J008141/1","fundValue":"95750","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work while has not been used directly by the industry, it has attracted a lot of attention and has increased the industry awareness of the possibility of improved understanding of how lubricants work through a more fundamental and a molecular level understanding of lubricant and additive performance. Lots of discussion with the industry, specially lubricants, additives, and energy sectors, has been resulted.  ","person":"Janet  Wong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" High performance lubricants are needed for highly efficient and reliable engineering components, While there is a lot of interest in the use of nanoadditives (NAs) in improving the properties of lubricants, their effectiveness remains controversial due to a lack of appropriate experimental tools which limited our understanding on how NAs work. The goal of the project is to develop a novel technique that allows the dynamics of NAs within a tribological contact to be investigated in-situ. \n\n\n\nThe project has successfully established novel methodologies based on fluorescence imaging to study the behaviour of lubricant in an tribological contact. A miniature tribometer is designed and fabricated that allows the flow and dynamics of additives to be investigated. Pivot testings have been conducted using model oil lubricants with and without model NAs. The methodology is published and results with NAs presented in conferences. It was shown that the lubricant in the contact can have very different properties to the bulk lubricant. Moreover, the addition of NAs in base lubricant is not sufficient to ensure that these NAs will enter the contact and work as intended. Careful selection of operating condition and surface engineering are necessary to optimise the benefit of NAs. The results of the work has been disseminated through journal paper, conference presentation and laboratory tours offered to potential industrial sponsors. The project has strong engineering relevance and it gears towards the needs of designing high performance lubricants which can increase performance, energy efficiency, reliability and service life of engineering components. The technique can be applied to investigate in-situ the performance of nanoadditives in enhancing the lubricating property of conventional lubricant. It aids efficient design of novel lubricants.\n\nWhile lots of industrial interested has been generated, more resources for the pursue of the fundamental aspect of this research area are needed for the industry to fully understand and appreciate the significance of this work.
