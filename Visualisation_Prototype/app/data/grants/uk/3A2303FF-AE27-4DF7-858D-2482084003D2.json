{"id":"3A2303FF-AE27-4DF7-858D-2482084003D2","title":"Proposal for a Human Embryonic Stem (ES) Cell Resource Centre","abstractText":"We aim to provide resources and training for other researchers planning to take up the study of human embryonic stem (ES) cells. At the same time we plan to develop new underpinning technologies to help facilitate research with these cells.\nES cells are derived from early human embryos and have the capacity to grow indefinitely in culture. At the same time they retain the ability to differentiate, or change, into all of the different cell types found in the human body. It is hoped can use this capacity of ES cells to develop new sources of cell types for replacing diseased or damaged tissues, or to develop new tools for understanding human development and the causes or different diseases.\nThe human ES cell field is young and the techniques for working with these cells are poorly developed. By providing resources for training investigators new to human ES cell research, and establishing new tools, we will help increase the capacity for new research that will underpin the future applications of human ES cells.\n.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300273","grantId":"G0300273","fundValue":"955313","fundStart":"2004-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Walter Andrews","coPersons":["Darren  Shickle","Harry David Moore"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
