These achievements are now beginning to be shared by leading emerging economies. Yet research across nations and disciplines is now regularly suggesting that this increasing prosperity has not been accompanied by increasing happiness or wellbeing. Indeed, the opposite has often been the case in terms of major growth in crime, mental illness, and family breakdowns, and declining trust in neighbourhoods and volunteering. This predicament of increasing wealth but not increasing happiness is often referred to as the paradox of prosperity.\\n\\nThe happiness hypothesis is a key entrypoint into these debates, is of growing significance, and involves research from such disciplines as economics, economic history, psychology and sociology. Essentially, it recognises that increasing individual annual incomes above $20,000 p.a. is not commensurate with increasing happiness at all. Above that sum, other existing features of happiness become far more important, including personal relationships, family life and friendships, shared trust in neighbourhoods, and questions of morality and philosophy or purpose of life (including religion). The cumulative effect of all these features propels this whole debate into the centre of religious traditions and experiences. Yet the actual contribution of religion to this debate is under-researched, even though the current secular research clearly recognises the importance of religious wellbeing for happiness.\\n\\nThe proposal will therefore seek to develop the religious contribution to the happiness hypothesis by bringing together a network of scholars and reflective practitioners, principally British, but including Swedish and US. They will engage with and debate the key features and indices revealed by the existing happiness research (including the nature and importance of work, income, mental health and spirituality, spiritual capital and globalisation, values and virtues, ethics and justice, inequalities, fair trade, religious finance as Muslim tradition). The network will therefore seek to elaborate the nature and extent of religion's contributions to such features and indices, including the nature and extent of any added value provided by religion. These emerging findings will be tested in relation to mainstream economics, and by exploring appropriate measurement systems. The research network would seek to continue beyond the life of this proposal through further research applications which would build on these initial findings.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F007833/1","grantId":"AH/F007833/1","fundValue":"23492","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The Network has succeeded in its objectives of establishing a multi-disciplinary forum for the examination of the specific contribution of religion to the happiness hypothesis and related research. A primary finding of the project has been the unanimous recognition, across a range of intellectual disciplines and perspectives, of the contribution of the religious contribution to wellbeing. It has mapped the religious contribution to key variables, such as marriage, crime and rehabilitation, work, inequality, mental health, environment, participation, institutional theory, business and trade. These engage critically with research in related disciplines, especially economics, identifying the added value of religion to these debates.\n\nPublications:\nThe Practices of Happiness, published by Routledge in 2010 and edited by Ian Steedman, John R.

What distinguishes these findings from ancient wisdom is the growing research across disciplines, including economics , psychology and sociology, which is developing more precise definitions and measurement systems of wellbeing. Their cumulative effect is beginning to influence policy from more general national accounts of wellbeing to particular improvements in economic practice, health and education. The contribution of religion to these changes is under researched, even though current secular research recognises its importance.\nThis research identifies the nature and role of the religious contribution to wellbeing as part of an emerging multidisciplinary endeavour by examining the contribution of mainstream economic theory to wellbeing, and then exploring the religious contribution to key features of the research including marriage, crime and rehabilitation, work, inequality, mental health, environment, participation, institutional theory, business and trade. These engage critically with research in related disciplines, including Layard in economics, identifying the added value of religion to these debates. As such, it therefore represents a valuable handbook to the early stages of developing such a religious contribution to wellbeing research.\nAs a unique research network of 19 participants from Britain, Sweden, Estonia - India, aimed to bring to public notice the nature and role of religionâ€™s contribution to wellbeing, including new ways of measuring it. It particularly recognises the growing importance of religion in the academy and in the public square, and how this can be progressed in ways which recognise both the distinctive character of a discipline and its ability to engage in interdisciplinary projects. In addition, it enlarges the generally accepted anthropocentric interpretation of wellbeing to engage with the non-person as a central feature of emerging debates over environmental sustainability. It therefore seeks to develop the contribution of philosophy and anthropology, as well as religion, to these pivotal debates. Further work on the relationship between well-being (individual and corporate, societal) and religion. \nOne of the features of research into happiness and well-being is the growing cross-fertilisation across disciplines, including economics, psychology and sociology, which is developing more precise definitions and measurement systems of wellbeing. Their cumulative effect is beginning to influence policy from more general national accounts of wellbeing to particular improvements in economic practice, health and education. The contribution of religion to these changes is under-researched, even though current secular research recognises its importance. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
