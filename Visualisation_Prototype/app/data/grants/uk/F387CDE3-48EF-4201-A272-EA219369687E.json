Moving beyond the experience of lone mothers, the project will explore with policy makers the extent to which they take into account people’s dignity in the process of social security design and implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The final objective is to address popular concerns about the role of social security in alleviating poverty in terms of whether it jeopardises traditional forms of social solidarity. The project will use a mixed methods approach. The qualitative work will comprise in-depth interviews and focus groups with lone mothers and elite interviews with policy makers. The quantitative work will include the design and analysis of a dedicated module in the South African Social Attitudes Survey 2012.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0642","grantId":"RES-167-25-0642","fundValue":"380862","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael William Noble","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
