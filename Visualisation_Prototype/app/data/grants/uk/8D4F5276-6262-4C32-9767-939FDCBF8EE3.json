Current archaeological RS techniques have evolved with variable understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and environmental processes involved. Thus current detection strategies do not allow systematic AR assessment leading to sub-optimal heritage management and development control. This project will focus on analysing the physical and environmental factors that influence AR contrast dynamics with the overall aim of improving site and feature detection.\\n\\nArchaeological RS techniques rely on the ability of a sensor to detect the contrast between an AR and its immediate surroundings or matrix. AR detection is influenced by many factors - changes in precipitation, temperature, crop stress/type, soil type and structure and land management techniques. These factors vary seasonally and diurnally, meaning that the ability to detect an AR with a specific sensor changes over time.\\n\\nWithout understanding the processes that affect the visibility and detection of ARs (directly and by proxy), prospection techniques will remain somewhat ad-hoc and opportunistic. Enhanced knowledge of ARs is important in the long-term curation of a diminishing heritage and will provide cost savings to operational works (through more effective mitigation). This is important in environments where traditional optical aerial photography has been unresponsive (e.g pasture and clay soils).\\n\\nThe project is timely considering the recent development of high spatial and spectral resolution ground, air and satellite sensors.\\nThe project involves 4 stages:\\n1 Identifying appropriate candidate sites and sampling methodology\\n2 Field measurements and collecting and analysing field samples from sites under different conditions\\n3 Physical modelling, feedback, knowledge articulation\\n4 Evaluation\\nSites will be chosen on the basis of contrasting ARs, soil and land management conditions etc. Close liaison with curatorial agencies (with excavation data) is necessary to ensure a representative range of AR types is identified. It will be important to include sites with varying environmental conditions and AR types (buried soils, 'negative' features such as ditches, buried masonry and surface materials).\\n\\nTo determine contrast factors strategic samples and measurements will be taken on and around the AR at different times of the day and year to ensure that a representative range of conditions is covered. Field measurements will include geophysical and hyperspectral surveys, thermal profiling, soil moisture and spectral reflectance. Laboratory analysis of samples will include geochemistry and particle size.\\n\\nModels will be developed that translate these physical values into spectral, magnetic, electrical and acoustic measures in order to determine contrast parameters. Data fusion and knowledge reasoning techniques will be used to develop management tools to improve the programming of surveys. These tools will be used to deploy sensors, including aerial hyperspectral devices, for evaluation purposes.\\n\\nIn summary, this project will impact on and develop:\\n1 Baseline understanding and knowledge about AR contrast processes and preservation dynamics:\\n a. leading to better management and curation\\n b. providing data to model environmental impact on ARs\\n c. enhancing the understanding of the resource base\\n2 The identification of suitable sensors and conditions for their use (and feedback to improve sensor design)\\n3 Data fusion techniques (physical models, multi-sensor data and domain knowledge) to improve AR identification\\n4 An Interdisciplinary network between remote sensing, soil science, computing and heritage professionals\\n5 Techniques for researchers to access data archives more effectively\\n\\nWe believe that the results will have national impact and have the potential for transfer throughout the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H032673/1","grantId":"AH/H032673/1","fundValue":"695183","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony  Cohn","coPersons":["Keith Nicholas Wilkinson","Nicole  Metje","Armin  Schmidt","Michael David Steven"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The DART project was initiated in 2010 in order to investigate the ability of various sensors to detect archaeological features in 'difficult' circumstances. DART had the overall aim of developing analytical methods for identifying and quantifying gradual changes and dynamics in sensor responses associated with surface and near-surface archaeological features under different environmental and land management conditions. Through this work DART has amassed a large corpus of well provenanced data. The majority of these data, and other research objects, have been made available through a repository framework (http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk). A spatio-temporal database is used for integrated analytics and data mining purposes. Enhanced knowledge of archaeological residues is important for the long-term curation and understanding of a diminishing heritage. There are certain geologies and soils which can complicate the collection and interpretation of heritage remote sensing data. In some of these 'difficult' areas traditional detection techniques have been unresponsive. DART has developed a deeper understanding of the contrast factors and detection dynamics within 'difficult' areas. This provides a framework for the identification of appropriate sensors and conditions for feature detection. The successful detection of features in 'difficult' areas will provide a more complete understanding of the heritage resource which will impact on research, management and development control. Our findings could influence the manner in which future archeological prospection could take place using remote sensing techniques. It has also opened up opportunities for further research, particular given the open dataset of the DART raw data at http://dartportal.leeds.ac.uk -- DART has been strongly commited to Open Science we hope that DART will provide a model for other projects -- at the AHRC Science and Cultural Heritage Final Conference in 2013 this aspect of the project was particularly well received.
