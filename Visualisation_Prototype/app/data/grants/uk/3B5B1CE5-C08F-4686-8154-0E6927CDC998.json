{"id":"3B5B1CE5-C08F-4686-8154-0E6927CDC998","title":"UK Regions Digital Research Facility (UK RDRF)","abstractText":"The UK RDRF brings together a number of research strands funded under the DET, EPSRC and ESRC portfolios over the last decade to create a national facility to tackle the vexed question of regional competitiveness and rebalancing the UK economy. Following the Scottish referendum there have been renewed calls for greater devolution to regions and core cities. This facility will bring together the big economic data and construct the high resolution models needed to support policy makers at national, regional and local level. It will innovate by building together a model of the fixed stock of buildings, including housing, commercial, warehousing and manufacturing, with a network model of key infrastructure. This will allow analysis of which policy nudges might be expected to overcome the inertia present in the historic geography of the UK. It will allow a common framework of data and evidence ti be used by regional and local policy professionals wishing to evaluate policy options. The whole facility is built on the opportunity created by CDT funding to develop a cohort of evidence based policy professionals and analysts to support the needs of a more devolved form of planning. We aim to support the creation of a 'community of practice' based on access to big economic data and open source analysis and modelling tools. We will host workshops and networks to spread best practice and create some institutional glue amongst the people concerned. Finally, we will engage local communities in the debate and bring the same evidence and tools to the public at large through crowd science and in-the-wild research engagement.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M023583/1","grantId":"EP/M023583/1","fundValue":"4000600","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2020-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Penn","coPersons":["Michael  Batty","Philip  Treleaven","Paul Arthur Longley","Elsa  Arcaute","Alan  Wilson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
