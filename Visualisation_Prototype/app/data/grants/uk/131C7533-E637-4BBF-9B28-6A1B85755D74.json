{"id":"131C7533-E637-4BBF-9B28-6A1B85755D74","title":"Ebbs and Flows of Energy Systems (EFES)","abstractText":"This project builds upon the Ebbs and Flows of Energy Systems feasibility study (31737-230167) and demonstrates the\ndevelopment, impact and business potential of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) integrating: building energy management;\nrenewable electricity generation, electric vehicles and battery storage systems. The project will manage the electricity use\nof a range of sites, from single properties through to large commercial premises. The proposed management system uses\nalgorithm based predictive control to enable and optimise the active utilisation of multiple electric vehicle and domestic\nstorage batteries as an energy storage and generation resource. The project will demonstrate VPP functionality,\naggregating the disparate energy distributed energy resources to provide wider network ancillary support services, such as\npeak shaving. This will reduce variability in electricity demand levels, cost and CO2 emissions, plus improve the UK grid\nsecurity of supply.\nThe Warwick university contribution will be a new energy system model that quantifies energy storage, performance and\ndegradation for a vehicle battery system when exercised under real-world driving and charging/discharging conditions\n(Vehicle-to-Grid: V2G). This model will reinforce the capability of the industrial partners in areas of energy system design\nand evaluation. A comprehensive understanding of energy storage performance and degradation will also be of great value\nto energy providers - it will further support the creation of business models that promote the use of renewable sources of\nenergy integrated with local storage.\nEnergy storage is one of the eight great technologies identified by the government to propel the UK to future growth (David\nWilletts MP, Policy Exchange, 2013). The RCUK Review of Energy in 2010 highlights that R&amp;D into energy storage has the\npotential to yield high levels of de carbonisation beyond 2030. The TSB (Energy Supply Strategy, 2012) states that battery\nrelated R&amp;D within the energy and transport sectors is a UK priority that will benefit from public investment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507143/1","grantId":"EP/M507143/1","fundValue":"108557","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Marco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
