Although electrically neutral overall, neutrons are made up of charged particles. The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is a measure of the distribution of positive and negative charge inside the neutron - just as a magnet has north and south poles, so a neutron with an EDM would have one end slightly negative, and the other slightly positive. However, this can only happen if certain symmetries in the laws of physics are slightly broken - by exactly the same mechanisms that were responsible for the dominance of matter over anti-matter in the Universe at the time of the Big Bang. These mechanisms are not understood, but by measuring (and putting limits upon) the nEDM, we put extremely tight constraints upon new models of physics that attempt to explain the origin of all of the matter in the Universe. \n\nOur group currently holds the world's best limit in the precision of measurement of this fundamental quantity. The proposed work will improve the sensitivity by a factor of two in the first instance, and later on by much more - perhaps approaching an order of magnitude.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M003426/1","grantId":"ST/M003426/1","fundValue":"12129","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  No, it is far too early for that.

","person":"Philip Greville Harris","coPersons":["William Clark Griffith"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":" This grant funds development work towards one of the most precise and exquisite measurements that it's possible to make in physics: the search for the so-called Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of the neutron. This is a tiny distortion of the structure of the neutron (a subatomic particle), perhaps a billion times smaller than anything that LHC is capable of detecting. It is critically important for helping us to understand the origin of all of the matter in the Universe - including all of us, and the stars and planets - since the size of this subatomic distortion is intimately related to the question of the difference between matter and antimatter, which led to our Universe being matter-dominated. We use a sort of atomic clock to study the behaviour of neutrons in strong electric fields, which allow us ever increasing sensitivity in the measurement. Findings will be of immense importance to theorists trying to understand the origins of matter in the Universe. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
