At present, it is a feature of the English legal system that the principles to be applied in such situations are the same as would apply if the loss occurred as a result of the actions of a private person. I intend to show that to make the system fair, the judges must devise a new body of principles specially adapted to deal with public authorities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113044/1","grantId":"113044/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2006-05-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Cornford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
