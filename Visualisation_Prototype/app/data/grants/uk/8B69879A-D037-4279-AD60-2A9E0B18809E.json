At this there was much discussion with members of DEFRA who were extremely interested in the results of the work and the publication we had in the EBI magazine. We were then sent further raw data from DEFRA and are in discussion with them about further analysis.

The collaboration has proved very insightful, with two multi actor one week meetings (one in the US and one in the UK), associated workshops with academics and government policy makers. In addition there has also been several other meetings and trips associated with the project. An ongoing relationship has been made between the investigators and some of the researchers. It is expected that there will be many collaborations in this area in the future.\n\nThe way in which LCA is applied is changing rapidly. This is specifically seen in the bioenergy arena, and it is from studying this that we can learn most. We explored the requirements of LCA, the areas in which the tool is being stretched the most, and what this means for the science and technology and the policy makers. We identified areas for further research and what is required in order to undertake it.\n\nDuring the project period the principle investigators in the US spent some months in Brazil. The UK PI also spent a week there, funded by the British Council. Both of these links led to dissemination of the work we had undertaken as part of the UK/US partnership, and established links and connections with colleagues in Brazil. As a result of this we have recently submitted an application to the Global Innovation Initiative for further, tri-country partnership and working. This application builds on the methodological work developed, and is a direct result of the UK/US partnership. LCA is used in bioenergy and biofuel production and decision analsyis. Our results and recommendations will be able to be used to help with these decisions. It will also be useful in other (energy related to begin with) sectors as they can learn from some of the issues that are being seen in the bioenergy arena first (due to the complex interactions between food, land and energy).
