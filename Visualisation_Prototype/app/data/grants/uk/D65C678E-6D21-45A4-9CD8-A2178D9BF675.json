Explaining genetic variation in NUE via senescence kinetics: An analysis of grain yield (GY), N-use efficiency\nparameters and senescence kinetics for 16 UK and French cultivars under contrasting N supply in field experiments in 2\nyears/4 sites (Nottingham, JIC, INRA Mons and Clermont Ferrand) showed timing of onset of post-anthesis senescence\nexplained 32-70% of genetic variation in NutE (GY/N uptake; NUtE) across sites under low N, and was itself associated\nwith the efficiency of post-anthesis N remobilization (Gaju et al accepted in FCR).\n2. Understanding effects of crop N status on N allocation parameters: Analysis of N partitioning in the same experiments\nshowed genetic variability in N distribution in leaf layers is due to differences mediated by crop N status. The adjustment\nof the leaf N gradient to the light gradient differed significantly among genotypes. But, when the impact of crop N status\non leaf N distribution was considered, the remaining variability was only weakly explained by a genotypic effect. (Moreau\net al draft ms uploaded with report).\n3. A novel framework for predicting post-anthesis senescence in wheat: Analysis of canopy N dynamics and senescence\nprofiles in the 16 cvs and a Savannah x Rialto DH population demonstrated the stay green trait is determined by an\nincrease in N accumulation at the start of grain filling and/or decreased N remobilization from the lamina and/or stem\nduring grain filling. The project produced an extended genetic map of the Savannah x Rialto DH mapping population and provided stocks of this important population to other projects. The project required refinement of field phenotyping methodologies which included advanced protocols for scoring progression of field senescence and the development of calibration protocols for determination of stem, leaf, and ear Nitrogen content by Near Infra Red Reflectance (NIR). These high throughput and low cost screens allowed very large scale field screens. One output of this was the identification of 'stay green' mutants from 7000 Paragon EMS mutant lines (the DEFRA WGIN EMS population). Within the BBSRC-INRA NUE project some of these senescence mutants were shown to confer a yield advantage at low N levels.\n\nCoordination of data collection, phenotyping methodologies, and standardised trait naming (trait ontology) required the\ndevelopment of common standard operating procedures for University of Nottingham, JIC, RRes and INRA. Phenotyping\ndata were collated at Nottingham and genotyping at JIC in relational data bases. This resulted in a high level of quality\nassurance for statistical analysis, QTL discovery, and meta-analysis. These datasets were all uploaded on the password\ncontrolled project database available at Rothamsted Research (http:/www.rothamsted.bbsrc.uk/bab/masprojects/\nNUE.html). These bioanalytical resources have generic value for any large data set physiology/genetics project.\n\nA major output of the project is the development of Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) for QTL identified for QTL identified in\nSavannah x Rialto and Beaver x Soissons populations. QTL for senescence were prioritised quite early in the project and\nadvanced backcross material is now available for QTL on 2D and 3A from Beaver x Soissons and 3D and 7D for\nSavannah x Rialto. These NILs are essential resources for the specific study of these genes.\n\nIn the project a new model for the N vertical distribution in canopy leaf layers has been developed and incorporated in\nSiriusQuality2. Crop N uptake is driven by canopy expansion. The vertical distribution of leaf N follows the light\ndistribution and the ratio of nitrogen to light extinction coefficients is determined by the crop N status. In addition, a new\nmethodology for calibration of cultivar parameters with evolutionary algorithms has been developed and applied in\nSiriusQuality2. Calibration of cultivar parameters of a crop simulation model represents a considerable challenge when\nobserved data for a single cultivar is available for a complex G x E x M experiment. The algorithm with self-adaptation\n(EA-SA) has been developed and applied to calibrate parameters of SiriusQuality2 for the experimental datasets,\ngenerated in the project for 16 wheat cultivars in two years at four field sites (Nottingham University, John Innes Centre,\nINRA Estree-Mons and INRA Clermont Ferrand) and for two N treatments.
