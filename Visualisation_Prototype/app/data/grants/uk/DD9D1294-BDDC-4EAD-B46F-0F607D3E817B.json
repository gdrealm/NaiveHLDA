{"id":"DD9D1294-BDDC-4EAD-B46F-0F607D3E817B","title":"NETWORK: Interdisciplinary Cutting, Packing and Space Allocation","abstractText":"This proposal seeks the funds to establish a UK network in the scientifically and industrially challenging area of cutting, packing and space allocation. It aims to provide a new national foundation and infrastructure to support major interdisciplinary and inter-institutional approaches for the modelling, optimisation, analysis, implementation and understanding of cutting, packing and space allocation methodologies throughout the industrial, commercial and service sectors so as to underpin decision support system development in these sectors.One of the main aims of the network is establish a dialogue between academia and the industrial sector in order to inform the service sectors of the work that is being carried out within academia and bring to their attention the opportunities that exist for them to work with academic researchers (for example, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, CASE awards etc.) Of course, we will also encourage inter-institutional, interdisciplinary blue skies, adventerous research and this network will enable researchers to collaborate and develop their research ideas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D031079/1","grantId":"EP/D031079/1","fundValue":"63211","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This proposal was a NETWORK and, as such, was not a research proposal, but facilitated research/researchers.

Publications\n\nA number of publications arose from the NETWORK, either directly or indirectly. The following represent a small selection of papers that have been associated with the project.\n\n\n\n- Burke E.K., Marecek J., Parkes A.J. and Rudov? H. Decomposition, Reformulation, and Diving in University Course Timetabling., Accepted for publication in Computers and Operations Research, to appear 2010. DOI 10.1016/j.cor.2009.02.023\n\nIncludes an international author (Rudov?).\n\n\n\n- Burke E.K.,Marecek J., Parkes A.J. and Rudov? H.

Funding Applications\n\nAs a result (directly or indirectly) the NETWORK led to a number of proposals being submitted. For example:\n\n- Modeling and Optimising the Complexities of Supermarkets (EP/H018441/1). This involved an academic partner (Chartered Institute for Logistics and Transport) and an overseas collaborator (Dr Tom van Woensel, Eindhoven).\n\n- Underpinning Novel Decision Support Methodologies for University Timetabling (EP/H014209/1). This was a joint proposal between the University of Nottingham and Queen's University Belfast and involves an industrial partner.\n\n3. Workshops\n\nThe NETWORK supported a number of workshops, as specified in the project proposal. In addition, other workshops were organised. For example:\n\n- A Dagstuhl Seminar: Cutting, Packing, Layout and Space Allocation (organisers Daniels K.M. and Kendall G), 13th - 17th March 2007 (ref: 07112). This led to a special issue of Annals of Operations Research\n\n4. Summary\n\nWe believe that this NETWORK was very successful and that they are a valuable resource for the scientific community. They also represent good value for money, providing a mechanism for the communities (scientific and industrial) to collaborate in a relatively informal way. The network still exists. albeit informally, and many of the researchers are still in touch with the industrial partners that were involved in the project.\nThis provides a 'goto' place for many collaborative opportunities.
