{"id":"BD8DE32A-3ED4-4F03-8A55-C53031E40D7D","title":"Maintaining a Faith Community: The Role of the Law","abstractText":"Concern about the relationship between faith communities and the wider secular community have been prominent since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and 7/7. Much media attention, as well as academic research, has focused on the Muslim community and has examined the attachment of the community to norms and customs that are different from, and in part incompatible with, those of the wider secular community. Interest in the interaction between religious and secular laws was further heightened as a result of the statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury that it was &quot;inevitable&quot; that elements of the Muslim law, such as divorce proceedings, would be incorporated into British legislation (Williams, 2008)\n\nThe proposed project will offer an overview of the current state of the debate in the UK on the relationship between religious law and state law, with reference to both the Muslim and Jewish communities. It will then compare selected aspects of that relationship with the position in France. The aspects to be compared are:\n1. the identification of representatives who can negotiate on behalf of the community with the state, and the identification of religious legal authorities \n2. the relationship between religious and state law in the context of marriage and divorce; and\n3. the role of religious courts in the process of dispute resolution, with particular reference to divorce.\n\nThere is already a significant body of information on the relationship between religious and state law in the context of marriage and divorce, including material written by the Principal Investigator and the Research Associate (see Publications lists). The proposed project will place this work in the context of other UK studies, and develop a comparative dimension. It will also lay the groundwork for further comparative research by establishing a network of scholars in this field from the US, Canada and Israel as well as other EU States with significant Muslim and Jewish populations.\n\nThe proposed project will be based within the Women in Society Research Centre (WISRC) at the University of Wales, Newport with the support of colleagues working in related fields at Cardiff University, who have the necessary contacts with religion and law researchers in France and elsewhere. The Principal Investigator is a family law specialist and expert in particular in the areas of forced marriage, polygamy and the human rights dimension of family relationships. The Research Associate has a part-time teaching post at Cardiff University, is currently conducting research on religious law and the law of arbitration and has extensive experience of comparative law research - notably with reference to French law. Dissemination of the project findings will be facilitated by the activities of WISRC (see &quot;Academic Beneficiaries&quot;). The Research Associate is an associate member of the Cardiff University Centre for Law and Religion (CUCLR) and so further dissemination will be possible through networks organised under the aegis of CUCLR, or in which members of that Centre are active (see &quot;Impact Summary&quot;)\n \nBy providing comparative insights, the project will benefit a range of scholars who research, inter alia, law and religion, family law and the sociology of religion. It will also benefit religious courts and institutions and a range of policy-makers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012033/1","grantId":"AH/J012033/1","fundValue":"30816","fundStart":"2012-02-13","fundEnd":"2013-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to form the basis of several academic articles and have been disseminated via several engagement events Government, Democracy and Justice Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Ruth  Gaffney-Rhys","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wales, Newport","findingsText":" The main conclusions of the research funded by the grant are:\nThat the concept of a faith community is elusive: there is no unified Muslim or Jewish community, which means that the role of the law in maintaining a faith community is difficult to pinpoint.\nIn terms of maintaining faith communities, key issues arise in relation to the regulation of religious marriages and divorces and the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to resolve family disputes\nThe research demonstrated differences between the law in France and the law in England and Wales. The complex system of authorising, solemnising and registering marriages in England and Wales creates problems for faith communities - certain religious marriages will be recognised whereas others will not. In contrast the French system, which only recognises civil marriages, is more straightforward. Further research is required to explore the reasons why members of faith communities do not always adhere to the formalities required to create a legally recognised marriage in England and Wales.
