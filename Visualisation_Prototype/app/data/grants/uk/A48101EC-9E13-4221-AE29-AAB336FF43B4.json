Localized mRNAs are usually transported in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and must be translationally repressed until the RNA reaches its final destination. This is achieved by translational repressor molecules, e.g. Bruno, CPEB,eIF4AIII, FMRP, Staufen and ZBP1 that are present in these transport RNPs. It has recently emerged that mRNA degradation factors also play an essential role in mRNA localization. For example, the transport of oskar (osk) mRNA to the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte requires the DEAD-box RNA helicase Me31b/DDX-6, a decapping activator, and the Dcp-1 subunit of the decapping enzyme that removes the 5'-cap from mRNAs to trigger their degradation. Both proteins colocalize with osk mRNA at the oocyte posterior. Furthermore, osk mRNA localization also depends on the exon junction complex (EJC) and Staufen, both of which have been implicated in mRNA decay in mammals. The EJC must be bound to an mRNA downstream of a stop codon to trigger nonsense mediated decay (NMD), while Staufen 1 recruits the NMD factor Upf1 to specific mRNA 3'-UTRs and thereby induces a novel form of mRNA decay. In mammals, Staufen 1 is a component of dendritic mRNA transport complexes. Moreover, the DEAD-box protein DDX-6, the mammalian homolog of Me31b, is found in kinesin-associated RNA granules isolated from rat brain. osk mRNA localization is also disrupted by mutations in armitage (armi), spindle-E (spn-E) and maelstrom, all RISC components mediating siRNA-dependent RNA degradation and miRNA-dependent translational silencing. In contrast, the Argonaute proteins, Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi, are required for efficient osk mRNA translation once it is localized, and both proteins accumulate at the posterior with the mRNA. Both proteins have been shown to associate with a new class of small RNAs called repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) to repress the activity of transposable elements in the germline. However, it is unclear whether Aub and Piwi that localize with osk mRNA are bound to rasiRNAs, nor whether the latter play any role in osk mRNA translation or degradation.Finally, there is recent evidence that not only RNA degradation but also translational silencing is coupled to RNA transport in mammals, since non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and longer regulatory RNAs, e.g. BC1, can repress translation of mRNAs during transport (22-24). It has been postulated that this miRNA-guided silencing occurs in another class of RNPs, called processing bodies (Pbodies),which are the major sites of mRNA degradation in both invertebrate and vertebrate cells , and that repressed mRNAs can even be released from P-bodies upon specific signals into the cytoplasm for further translation. This raises the question of whether P-bodies provide a platform for the transport of translationally repressed RNAs, and function as centers that co-ordinate degradation, translation and localization. We would therefore like to investigate whether P-body components are involved in mRNA transport by addressing the following specific questions: Do protein components of the RNA degradation pathway and the RISC complex play a direct role in localizing RNAs in Drosophila oocytes or mammalian neurons? Do small non-coding RNAs silence mRNA during their transport in both systems? Do localized mRNAs associate with P-bodies, before, during or after their transport to their destination? What is the molecular function of the Argonaute family members Aub and Piwi in osk mRNA localization and translation in Drosophila oocytes? Are individual members of the mammalian Ago family, e.g. Ago1-5, associated with specific miRNAs in dendritic RNPs?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F010303/1","grantId":"BB/F010303/1","fundValue":"282772","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2011-01-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This was a collaborative EuroCORES project with groups in Austria and Germany that led to new insights into how mRNAs are tranported to synapses in mammalian neurons and the role of micro RNAs in regulating synaptic RNAs.

Since mRNAs that are localised to the synapse can be locally translated there to make proteins that modify the efficiency of synaptic transmission, this work helps to elucidate a basic mechanism that is thought to underlie learning and memory. It has recently emerged that proteins involved in mRNA transport are candidates for factors that are altered in autism related disorders. A greater understanding of the basic biology of mRNA localization in neurons could therefore help in the development of strategies to treat these disorders Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
