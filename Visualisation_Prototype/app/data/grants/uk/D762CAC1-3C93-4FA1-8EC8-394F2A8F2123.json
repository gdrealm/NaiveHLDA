Most of our communication is ostensive. Ostension is the difference between a pointed finger that is a by-product of looking at your watch, and a pointed finger that is designed to direct someone's attention.</p>\n\n<p>Our capacity for ostension means that any behaviour has the potential to be used in a communicative way. Indeed, much human communication is ostensive. It provides the foundation for many human institutions, including both language and culture. It appears to be species-unique, and it has clear evolutionary advantages. Despite this, many basic empirical questions about it are unaddressed. The Future Leaders scheme&nbsp; will be used to experimentally investigate a range of fundamental questions about how ostensive communication systems operate. Specifically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>what general qualities distinguish ostensive behaviour from otherwise similar behaviour (eg the pointing example - what distinguishes the two different points?)</li>\n\n <li>how ostensive communication systems evolve, and hence develop conventional forms</li>\n\n <li>what keeps human ostensive communication evolutionarily stable. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The findings of this empirical work will be applied to current debates about the origins and evolution of human language.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001647/1","grantId":"ES/K001647/1","fundValue":"172851","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas C.

Research is ongoing, but has already led to several important publications, including a book that has already been hailed as &amp;quot;the most important and the best book ever written on the evolution of language&amp;quot;. My research concerns a topic of inherent public interest - what makes us human? - and as such is amenable to public science communication. I have begun to pursue such opportunities. For instance, I will be speaking at the Edinburgh International Science Festival, in April 2015. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
