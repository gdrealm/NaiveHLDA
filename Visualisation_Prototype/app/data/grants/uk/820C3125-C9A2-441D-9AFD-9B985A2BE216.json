Bacteria are responsible for 20-30% of the &gt; &pound;100 billion per annum lost worldwide to disease and spoilage of crops caused by plant pathogens. For example, the soft rot pathogens Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Dickeya spp., the most damaging bacterial pathogens of potato in Europe, are responsible for the greatest losses and down-grading of stocks of any pathogen in this crop. Traditional measures for reducing losses include the breeding and introduction of resistant potato varieties, chemical treatments and plant hygiene measures aimed at minimising losses due to spoilage during storage. However, for these bacterial pathogens, no good resistant varieties are available and there are no effective chemical treatments. Climate change will only make the problem more severe as these bacteria thrive in warmer moister conditions. It is essential, therefore, that new methods of control are investigated \nDespite the economic importance of bacterial plant pathogens, we lack understanding of some of the key mechanisms utilised by these bacteria during infection and so are limited in the interventions that are available to us. Our work aims to address this problem by investigating a key mechanism of iron acquisition from the host during infection. The availability of iron can be a deciding factor in the success or failure of microbial infection.\nWe have discovered that some bacterial soft rot pathogens are able to acquire iron directly from an iron-containing host protein called ferredoxin. We have identified the protein on the bacterial cell surface that is responsible for this as well as other proteins that are likely to be involved in the process of iron acquisition. The aim of this work is to understand the mechanism through which these bacterial proteins are able to bind ferredoxin and acquire iron from it. If we can fully understand this mechanism then it should be possible tocreate disease resistant plants that possess an engineered ferredoxin variant to which bacteria cannot bind or from which they cannot acquire iron.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L02022X/1","grantId":"BB/L02022X/1","fundValue":"379343","fundStart":"2014-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This grant started 2 months ago and so it is too early for impacts to have arisen.
