EPSRC has previously supported a number of Summer Schools in this area. Here we set out the case for further training support. In summary, we show that the strategic case for advanced training in this area is increasing: digital images and the need to transmit, process and interpret them are becoming an increasingly important economically and socially. We further argue that doctoral training programmes in this field cannot provide research students with a sufficient breadth of knowledge to equip them fully to contribute to the technological developments that can be anticipated.Digital images are everywhere. Increasingly images play a central role of our social and economic lives. Obvious examples are security video, biometrics, vehicle recognition, videophone calls using webcams, entertainment and medical imaging. The capacity of images to encode and transmit huge quantities of useful information means that the capture, processing and interpretation of images will form a significant component in the digital economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I005722/1","grantId":"EP/I005722/1","fundValue":"26635","fundStart":"2010-07-12","fundEnd":"2010-10-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The BMVA/EPSRC Summer School did not produce directly any findings.
