{"id":"21EE9F08-65A8-43A7-B60C-ECDCF43E5B62","title":"Network in Biocatalyst Discovery, Development and Scale-Up","abstractText":"Industrial biotechnology has the potential to transform the chemical industry by creating more eco-efficient manufacturing processes using natural enzymes (biocatalysts) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and toxic waste products. Currently many of the day-to-day household products that we rely on, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymers and cosmetic ingredients, are derived from oil-based feedstocks. Competition for oil is intense, with more than 80% being used for generation of energy and as a transportation fuel. Moreover, global supplies are dwindling and hence there is a need to generate an alternative bio-economy based on renewable and sustainable feedstocks. Such feedstocks need to be processed and upgraded in order to provide the broad range of chemicals that are currently manufactured from oil based resources. Biocatalysts offer an attractive approach and indeed are currently used in some cases on large scale for production of specific chemical products. However, over the next 10-20 years it will be necessary to implement this technology more broadly in the chemical industry.\n\nThis Network in Biocatalyst Discovery, Development and Scale-Up will help to shape the future of Industrial Biotechnology in the UK by addressing some of the key challenges that lie ahead. The Network will bring together research expertise from the academic and industrial sectors, along with those involved in supply-chains and also the manufacturers and end-users to address these opportunities. Access to biocatalysts developed by academic laboratories, together with the ability of industry to identify, screen and scale-up production of a broad range of biocatalysts, have been identified as major barriers to entry for those in the scientific community wishing to use biocatalysis and Industrial Biotechnology for the development of sustainable processes for the production of high value chemicals. By identifying priority areas, promoting collaboration, sharing best practice, and undertaking proof of concept studies, the Network will seek to develop new biocatalytic process that exploit industrial biotechnology. \n\nThis Network will also promote and develop the reputation of the UK internationally and reinforce links with other world leaders in IB excellence. We shall engage with other Centres of Excellence in Europe, USA, Asia and beyond to provide examples of best practice, particularly involving BBSRC sponsored research. As well as providing access to the established expertise of the UK biocatalysis community, the Network will provide the skills base to tackle future barriers to the uptake of biocatalytic processes by helping to train and support the next generation of IB scientists. Training of young scientists is seen as a vital component of the greater uptake of biotechnology.\n\nFinally the Network will also engage in a broad range of dissemination and outreach events in order to educate the wider community as to the benefits of industrial biotechnology and the potential impact that it can have on peoples lives. In addition to addressing scientific and technological challenges, the Network will give due consideration to environmental, social economic and policy related issues that are important as we transition from an oil-based economy to one based on renewable feedstocks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L013649/1","grantId":"BB/L013649/1","fundValue":"975883","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Turner","coPersons":["John Maxim Ward"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The use of biological catalysts, in the form of enzymes and microorganisms, has the potential to transform the chemical manufacturing industry, enhancing the safety, and lowering the cost and environmental impact of current products, and ultimately leading to new generations of improved products. The uptake of Industrial Biotechnology (IB) processes is a key step in the reduction of fossil resource use and the switch to renewables. Biocatalytic processes are well studied in academic laboratories, and are characterised by relatively benign reaction conditions and exquisite selectivity, often achieving transformations of cheap and accessible precursors which are difficult or impossible via traditional chemical methodologies. BIOCATNET is the BBSRC Network in Industry Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBB) dedicated to discovery, development and scalable production of biocatalysts for the whole IB community. Over the initial 5-year lifetime of the Network, BIOCATNET will support innovative research and foster new collaborations to facilitate Industry to access the wealth of world-leading expertise in UK Biocatalysis research, delivering tools and applications for the whole IB Community. BIOCATNET provides a cross-sector forum with the goals to foster and enhance collaboration; develop skills and expertise; share best practice; define common research priorities; target funding opportunities in industrial biocatalysis. Access to biocatalysts developed by academic laboratories, together with the ability of industry to identify, screen and scale-up production of a broad range of biocatalysts, have been identified as major barriers to entry for those wishing to use biocatalysis for Industrial Biotechnology. By bringing together key research expertise from the academic and industrial sectors, along with manufacturers and end-users, BIOCATNET will address key challenges to help shape the future of Industrial Biotechnology in the UK and beyond.
