Such data is interesting and important in the context of current attention to the role of associations in developing social capital. It is also an opportunity to examine the issue of biases in the interest group system in the sense that there is a differential mobilisation among different types of group.</p> \n<p>The directories will be used to develop a data base that will allow patterns over time to be identified. For example trades unions are now reduced in number as a result of changes in the economy and organisational changes within the labour movement. Early work shows unexpectedly high turnover: while the group population in total may be growing slowly, this is the net&nbsp;result of much more dramatic group termination and mergers. The study will be able to take advantage of a question inserted in the directory questionnaires a decade ago to identify groups with particular interests in the political process.</p> \n<p>The project fits into a rapidly developing literature on group population ecology that attempts to understand the demographic structure of the interest group system in terms of broad restraints and supports.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1959","grantId":"RES-000-22-1959","fundValue":"77526","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Grant  Jordan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
