But there are problems with these models, among them, the problem of resetting the system for every event for which a time judgment might later be required. Recently, the reset problem has been avoided by suggesting that time perception depends on memory-trace decay.</p>\n\n<p>We will explore a novel memory-trace model of the early development time perception in which learning and coordinated motor activity in infancy both play a key role.</p>\n\n<p>This hypothesis is explored through a combination of rigorous experimental behavioral studies of infants developing time perception, measurements of muscular electrical activity used an implicit measure of infant time keeping, and computational neural network modeling of the emerging ability.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I014802/1","grantId":"ES/I014802/1","fundValue":"423182","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Denis  Mareschal","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
