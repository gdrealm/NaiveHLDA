This showed the value of co-construction of maps to facilitate and negotiate management options and to combine practitioner and scientific knowledge across a landscape to create a better understanding of the distribution of a mobile resource such as deer. </p>\n\n<p>There is now an opportunity to build capacity among conservation agency staff to utilise this framework to engage with land-managers early in the process and foster collaboration over public and private objectives. </p>\n\n<p>We aim to use a participatory, action learning approach to develop three core skills that are essential to the process: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>participatory techniques to identify management issues</li>\n\n <li>collating knowledge relevant to the landscape scale deer operate over using GIS</li>\n\n <li>analysing the knowledge to inform management issues. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project will be undertaken as a trilateral in which stakeholders, policymakers and researchers work together in an adaptive and interactive manner and will lead to the co-production of a 'Best Practice' guide for developing sustainable deer management plans.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-811-25-0002","grantId":"RES-811-25-0002","fundValue":"60450","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"R Justin Irvine","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Macaulay Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
