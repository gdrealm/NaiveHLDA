In the Centre for Cell Imaging we have established a facility that specialises in timelapse microscopy looking at the same cells as they change, over time periods from seconds to days. This work involves the use of fluorescent labels to follow biological processes. Our existing microscopes are ageing but are extremely heavily used by a very large number of scientists from different disciplines, Departments and Institutions. We need a new system to take advantage of improvements that have occurred since the last confocal microscope was purchased 6 years ago. Since then, electronics and detection capabilities have been improved substantially. During this period, we have developed new methods that allow us to perform many experiments in a single dish containing a 'cell array' which consists of spots of around one tenth of a millimetre which are placed on a glass surface next to each other. Each spot has about 50 cells on it which have had different genes (or drugs) introduced into them. The new microscope will allow us to look at more spots every day . The improved speed is mainly because the new microscope will spend less time automatically setting the focus as it moves from spot to spot. We will also connect this microscope to a new computer controlled laser (purchased separately) that can excite fluorescence using intense pulses of light, where each photon carries half the energy normally used to excite fluorescence. Compared to our previous system, this microscope will be far more flexible and powerful, since the intensity of light that can be shone onto the cells will be far greater and there is new equipment for more efficient detection of the signal. The microscope will be used to study a variety of processes including: the timing of protein movement in cells, protein stability and protein interactions and gene expression. Protein interactions have been difficult to study in timelapse experiments and it is becoming very important that we understand which proteins bind to each other and when and where they do this inside cells. The research objectives lie in a broad area of applied biology. We are interested in how the timing of signals may change when genes (and which genes) are switched on in cells and how this affects cell division and cell death. We have discovered that NF-kappaB, one of the most important signals in the cell moves into the cell nucleus repeatedly suggesting that the timing of movement may control cell functions. We want to study this further and to relate this to other important signalling systems in the cell such as p53, the 'guardian of the genome' a tumour suppressor protein that is changed in most cancers. The information that we get will be fed into computer models of these systems because they are so complicated that it is difficult to understand in any other way, exactly what is going on. We will also study related projects in the areas of neurobiology, endocrinology and glycobiology. The research that this equipment will support is substantially funded by BBSRC and also by other organisations. There is a strong record of collaboration with industry and excellent strategic support for the Centre for Cell Imaging from Liverpool University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E012965/1","grantId":"BB/E012965/1","fundValue":"244767","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Richard White","coPersons":["David William Ray","Alister Gordon Craig","Carlos Pedro Rubbi","Marisa  Martin-Fernandez","Douglas Bruce Kell","Violaine  See","Raphael  Levy","Barry Roger Barraclough","Steven William Edwards","David  Fernig","Jeremy Ewan Turnbull","Julian Richard Davis"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
