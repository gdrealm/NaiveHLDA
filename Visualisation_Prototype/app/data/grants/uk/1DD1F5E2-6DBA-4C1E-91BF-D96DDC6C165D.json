More recently, the use of coated microbubbles in therapeutic applications such as targeted drug delivery has also become an active area of research. However, their behaviour in vivo is by no means fully understood and the aim of this project is to investigate the hitherto neglected problem of microbubbles excited by an ultrasound field within the confines of narrow blood vessels. The work will involve a combination of theoretical modelling and both in vitro and in vivo experiments which will enable a more rigorous assessment of the safety of ultrasound contrast agents and the development of more effective ultrasound therapies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E029612/1","grantId":"EP/E029612/1","fundValue":"341904","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Publication cited in other research papers Education,Healthcare ","person":"Gail Reinette Ter Haar","coPersons":["Ian Henry Rivens"],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":" In this project a novel system for the ultrasound exposure of isolated, cannulated arteries has been developed to allow study of the effects of both therapeutic and diagnostic ultrasound exposure of vessels with and without ultrasound imaging contrast agent (microbubbles) within the vessels. The system allows microscopy imaging of the vessel throughout the experiment and passive detection of acoustic cavitation during the ultrasound exposure. The application of standard vessel vitality tests, co These results should contribute to the understanding of the safe application of diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound, and thus decrease any risk to patients. This research has greatly improved understanding of the interaction of ultrasound with blood vessels. This is particularly important when considering the safety of diagnostic ultrasound scans in patients for whom contrast agent enhancing imaging is medically indicated.
