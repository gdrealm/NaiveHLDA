{"id":"EBF47CAD-56CB-461B-9A0A-2B8B23BD7D71","title":"Dorothy Richardson Scholarly Editions","abstractText":"Dorothy Richardson was one of a select group of twentieth-century writers who changed the rules of prose fiction. With James Joyce, Marcel Proust and Virginia Woolf, Richardson invented a new form of writing. Alongside Proust and Joyce, Richardson would have been at the forefront of a revolution in literature. However, although Dorothy Richardson was a key figure in the emergence of modernist prose, there are no scholarly editions of her collected correspondence or her fiction. This is in part explained by the initial neglect of women writers in modernist studies. However, with the Cambridge scholarly edition of Virginia Woolf now nearly complete and editions of other women modernists being planned, editions of Richardson's work are long overdue. This project will redress the current imbalance in literary studies, which has meant that almost all the focus has supported scholarly editions of male authors. The planned Richardson editions will be informed by the most up-to-date standards of critical and textual editing. They will become the standard reading and research editions for scholars and the general reader, making a vital contribution to public awareness of Britain's cultural heritage and of the contribution of women writers to modernism. In addition, the editions will make a vital contribution to textual scholarship in modernist studies. The edition of the Letters will contribute to our understanding of the importance of epistolary networks in the emergence of modernist cultural formations, identifying those who played facilitating roles in these networks, such as patrons, agents, publishers, and translators. The edition of 'Pilgrimage' will allow us to reconstruct Richardson's writing process, contributing to genetic studies of modernist texts. \n\nThe editions will be edited by a team of leading Richardson experts, who have worked together for several years. They founded the Richardson Society in 2007, and have organised the biennial international Richardson conferences, and set up the online Richardson journal. The PI has compiled the resources available on the Richardson website and edits the journal. Laura Marcus is an expert on the relationship between Richardson's work and early film. Deborah Longworth is an expert on modernism and the city and has published on Richardson as a theorist of the modernist novel. Joanne Winning has pioneered the reinterpretation of Pilgrimage as an example of Sapphic modernism and is an expert on lesbian modernist networks. The project builds on the work and support of eminent Richardson scholars, who have lent their research materials and advice to the editorial team. Before the founding of the Richardson Society, the key Richardson scholars worked at a distance. Since 2007, research on Richardson has had a renewed focus. The editorial team will bring to the project the advantages of a carefully planned collaboration, which combines the best of Richardson scholarship.\n\nThree additional scholars, Howard Finn, Bryony Randall and Claire Drewery each with particular expertise on 'Pilgrimage' will contribute to the work of particular volumes. Two PDRAs will work on the project for a period of 30 months each: one on the Letters and one on the Fiction. An integrated PhD project will examine how modernist epistolary networks operated to support women involved in modernist literary production. The second integrated PhD project will be a genetic study of 'Pilgrimage', which will use the correspondence, notes, manuscripts, typescripts, editions and their paratexts and epitexts to examine the writing process that produced its various parts and editions. There will be a conference in 2016 at Keele University on 'Gender and Textual Scholarship in Modernist Studies'. The project's collection of Richardson materials will be used to create a small touring exhibition and form the basis of a digitised virtual exhibition, to be hosted on the project's webpages.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L004011/1","grantId":"AH/L004011/1","fundValue":"795911","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Scott  McCracken","coPersons":["Deborah  Longworth","Laura  Marcus","Joanne  Winning"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
