{"id":"A034ADAE-EB3B-4584-8D88-98768CF97A31","title":"Drone Warfare: Towards a More-Than-Human Geopolitics","abstractText":"<p>This project seeks to investigate how remotely piloted aircraft or 'drones' are transforming global politics and generating public anxieties over security, ethics, and justice. This is realised through a project that places the technology at the heart of inquiry. Geopolitics is traditionally rooted in understanding the relationships between power, sovereignty, and territory.</p>\n\n<p>This research looks at how drone warfare is fundamentally changing these interactions. The unique angle the research investigates is how the drone is itself generative of new and unexpected geographies, both within the UK and beyond. Instead of humans acting as the sole directors of world politics, an array of automated machines and intelligent systems is shifting the terrain of international relations and control. This proliferation of drones, coupled with widespread political and ethical ambivalence over the enmeshing of robots and humans in diverse security scenarios across the planet, is a crucial area that must be met with engaging, timely and relevant research. This project will accordingly use a range of archival and interview data to film and produce a documentary, “The State of Our Unmanned Planet”, and a related manuscript, “The Predator Empire”.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009087/1","grantId":"ES/K009087/1","fundValue":"158144","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Shaw","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
