{"id":"DCE8A50A-036A-4AF3-A5BB-85D9FCCB6D27","title":"GS-MS Analysis of New Catalytic Reactions via C-H Activation","abstractText":"Catalytic C-H activation allows chemistry that would otherwise take several discrete steps to be performed cleanly and efficiently in one step. Therefore such reactions are more cost effective and environmentally more benign than the processes they seek to replace.During the course of this research we intend to use GC-MS to help enable the inception and development of novel C-H activation processes in order to realise a wide range of new C-C bond-forming reactions. The proposed research can be broadly divided into two areas: (a) the development of catalytic intermolecular ortho-specific arylations and related reactions and (b) the development of one-pot syntheses of benzo[b]- and dibenzo[b,d]-fused heterocycles via C-H activation. The new methodologies will be applied to the novel synthesis of selected interesting targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D075335/1","grantId":"EP/D075335/1","fundValue":"35894","fundStart":"2006-05-08","fundEnd":"2009-05-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Bruce Bedford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
