But in people whose immune systems are suppressed, especially patients receiving bone marrow transplants after radiation treatment for leukaemia, these virus infections get out of control and become life-threatening. This reflects the important role that our immune system, especially that part of the immune system involving a type of white blood cell called a T cell, normally plays in controlling virus infections. We are studying the way human T cells normally control EBV and CMV infections, what parts of the virus are the main targets for T cell attack, and how the efficiency of T cell control and the choice of virus targets might change from the time immediately after infection, when the immune response first develops, to a point several years later when the virus is kept under control by long-lived ?memory? T cells. We are also developing new ways to isolate the important T cells from the blood of bone marrow donors, then to give them to the bone marrow recipients and in that way protect these patients from virus disease in the first few dangerous months after the transplant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9901249","grantId":"G9901249","fundValue":"1608840","fundStart":"2005-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Rickinson","coPersons":["Paul  Moss"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
