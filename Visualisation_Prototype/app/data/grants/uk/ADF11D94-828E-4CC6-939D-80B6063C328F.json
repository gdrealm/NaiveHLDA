{"id":"ADF11D94-828E-4CC6-939D-80B6063C328F","title":"Spaces of diffeomorphisms of disks and characteristic classes","abstractText":"The proposed research is about symmetries of the n-disk, the region D(n) in n-dimensional euclidean space consisting of all points having distance at most 1 from a specified origin. The symmetries under consideration are invertible differentiable transformations from D(n) to D(n) which take every point on the boundary of D(n) to itself. The goal is to understand some of the geometric and qualitative properties of the sets Diff(D(n)) made up by all such symmetries. Itis a fact that Diff(D(n)) is a crucial building block in all kinds of sets of differentiable symmetries.For the sort of measurements that this research aims for, there is a reduction, available since around 1970, which predicts the outcomes of such measurements made on Diff(D(n)) in terms of outcomes of similar measurements made on another set of symmetries, Top(n). The set Top(n) consists of invertible continuous (not necessarily differentiable) transformations from euclidean n-space to itself. An advantage of this reduction is that the variability of the input n in Top(n) can be used to good effect. It is easy to relate Top(n) to Top(n+1), because a transformation from euclidean n-space to itself determines a transformation from euclidean (n+1)-space to itself which leaves the last coordinate of any point in (n+1)-space unchanged. It is also possible to make sense of Top(n) when n is infinity. Moreover, the geometry and qualitative properties of Top(infty) are in some respects quite well understood, much better in many ways than the geometry and qualitative properties of Top(n) for finite n. The exploration of Top(infty) was one of the major mathematical enterprises in the second half of the 20th century. In addition to many beautiful geometric ideas it also led to a number of new algebraic concepts. Part of the strategy proposed here for understanding some of the geometry of Top(n), and therefore some of the geometry of Diff(D(n)), is a calculus approach.The idea is to think of Top(n) as a function of n and to play calculus with that function, to ask questions about rates of change. For example, the extent to which the continuous map from Top(n) to Top(n+1) just described deviates from being a homotopy equivalence would be filed under first rate of change aspects. (Algebraic topology has well-established concepts of equivalence and efficient ways to quantify how much a continuous map deviates from being an equivalence.) More to the point, one hopes to understand Top(n), for a fixed n which may not be very large, in terms of Top(infty) and the rates of change of Top(k) for very large k. This is analogous to how the value of an analytic function such as cos(x), for any real number x, may be expressed in terms of the value, first derivative and higher derivatives of the function at x=0. A solid framework for doing that kind of calculus with functions whose values are geometric objects rather than numbers has been developed in the last two decades. It is now called functor calculus and the functions in question are normally called functors . The principal investigator is not the originator of that framework, but has made substantial contributions to it. In our example, where the functor takes a positive integer n to Top(n), the value Top(infty) of the functor at infinity is well understood in many respects, as noted earlier. The first derivative of the functor at infinity is also rather well understood; this is a more recent development in which, again, the principal investigator has some part. The second derivative of the function at infinity is not yet well understood but it seems ripe for a thorough investigation. Such an investigation, if successful, will almost automatically give significant new results on Top(n) and Diff(D(n)).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E057128/1","grantId":"EP/E057128/1","fundValue":"267305","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Weiss","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" Dr Reis and I remained faithful to the plan set out in the project application. One part of the project was (1) to relate some conjectures about spaces of regular maps to the plane to some conjectural formulas for the rational Pontryagin and Euler classes of fiber bundles whose fiber is homeomorphic to a euclidean space. This was done as expected, although it took a while (until late 2009). Beyond that, despite desperate efforts, little progress was made until about 33 months into the 3 year term. During that time we learned a great deal about traditional singularity theory (roughly the theory of &quot;unusual local behavior&quot; in differentiable maps) and tried to apply that to the study of spaces of regular maps (differentiable maps with no singularities) and spaces of diffeomorphisms (invertible differentiable maps, automatically without singularities), but with no success. The breakthrough came in 9/2010 with the following small modification to the plan as in the project application: instead of working with traditional singularity theory and using spaces of maps with only a few singularity types, we extended this to &quot;multisingularity theory&quot;, i.e. looking at the behaviour of differentiable maps not only in a neighbourhood of a point in the source, but in a neighborhood of a finite set in the source. This is not entirely new and it does not have to be vastly different from singularity theory, but it connects much better with our questions about spaces of regular maps and diffeomorphisms. Key findings following this change of direction were: (2) a classification of the most common types of multisingularities of differentiable maps to the plane; (3) an extension of known homotopy theoretic descriptions (known as h-principles) for certain spaces of differentiable maps with moderate singularities to analogous homotopy theoretic descriptions for certain spaces of differentiable maps with moderate multi-singularities. This made a connection, not foreseen in the project application, with an area where I have a great deal of expertise, manifold calculus. In doing so, it also did much to clarify the theory as it existed until then. With these findings our project acquired a more obvious direction. Most of the missing pieces (i.e. proofs of the conjectures mentioned above) have been worked out since then  ","dataset":"gtr"}
