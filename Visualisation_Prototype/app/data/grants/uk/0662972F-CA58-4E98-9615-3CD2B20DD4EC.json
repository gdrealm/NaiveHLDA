Both reports will cover:\n1 - Analysis of markets. Primarily of the most obvious applications where there are established or growing markets, with a focus on potentials for market penetration through cost and efficiency, e.g. electricity, gas, water, fuel monitors, temperature and humidity measurement. It is also intended to include expectable changes and openings in markets, such as through regional/national changes to environmental and mitigation policies, and changes in consumer behaviours and insurance regulation and practices. \n2 - Competitor analysis: investigate the competitors' market share, pricing and functionality - this will also show us if there are possible opportunities for collaboration rather than competition, eg where components of our technologies could improve existing products, and potentials for licensing.\n3 - Feasibility and product development business potential. Estimate the price and functionality of the prototype and related service (assuming continued development, bulk manufacture etc) and how it compares to the competitors.\n4 - Novel areas and new markets. Investigate the potential for prototypes in which there is no clear competitor but the data is perceived to be useful (moisture content, of soils, grain and building fabric etc).\nThe reports will show if and where there are commercial opportunities for our technology. It will potentially find possible users, collaborations, distributors, anticipated changes for further scoping and businesses to partner with and routes to market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M021297/1","grantId":"NE/M021297/1","fundValue":"8064","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Russell  Layberry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
