The focus of this current phase is on children’s interactions with peers, sibs, and mothers. In particular, the study includes valuable observations with the children playing with these distinct social partners at ages 2, 3 and 6, as well as concurrent cognitive assessments. </p> \n<p>Detailed coding from film will also allow us to assess how individual differences in the success of children’s interactions with sibs and mothers relate to each other, and the extent to which they show distinct antecedents. In addition, the use of naturalistic experimental situations enable us to observe children in socially challenging situations (eg, joining peers at play) and to analyse the ways in which children can be lead astray by their peers. Finally, we will determine whether cognitive skills explain why some children are more influential than others with their peers. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D00554X/1","grantId":"ES/D00554X/1","fundValue":"308224","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Helene Hughes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
