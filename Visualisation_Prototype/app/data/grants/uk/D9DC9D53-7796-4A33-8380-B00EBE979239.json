Influencing SEV Policy and Licensing Conditions\n• Direct work with licensing practitioners (one to one meetings) and training events where research findings and recommendations have been transmitted to Licensing Committees in 20 Local Authorities. Briefings have been sent via the Local Government Authority through their e-bulletin to 3,000 officers in August 2011 and March 2012. The research reports and recommendations have been used in license hearings by solicitors and twice in court cases. \n• Through the Institute of Licensing we have conducted training events/seminars with 8 /11 regions across the UK, with some 300+ licensing practitioners and police attending. Plus a training event at the IOL annual training conference in November 2012 to capture those outside the regions, giving maximum transmission of findings.\n• As a result there has been significant influence and inclusion of our recommendations, on how to improve dancer welfare, safety and good practice in management during the first phase of the new Sex Entertainment Venue Policies written by the majority of LA's across England and Wales. \n2. Industry Involvement in Changing Working Conditions\nFour seminars with the industry from the following cities were held: Aberdeen (30/31Jan 2012) London (28 June 2012), Manchester (18 June 2012), Leeds (10 July 2012), Blackpool (31 May 2012), Cardiff (13 June 2012) capturing managers from at least 50/200 venues. These industry representatives have contributed to the gold standards of good practice which are being promoted to the Licensing Committee's as well as within their own clubs. \n\n3. Resource for Dancers\n\nWe have now created a permanent, accessible and mobile resource for dancers consisting of essential information about personal safety at work; tax awareness; and self-employment information through an Iphone App and Website for Dancers: http://www.dancersinfo.co.uk/\nKey 'top tips' on the website are written in English, Romainian, Portuguese, Spanish, Polish and Russian with corresponding promotional material. \n\n4) Media / Public Engagement\nBroader public engagement has been extensive through the broadsheets and tabloid press. For example: Preliminary findings launch August, 2010, in the Independent, which was further reported by 26 media outlets and in 6 languages), \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/one-in-four-lap-dancers-has-a-degree-study-finds-2063252.html\nAlso another article in the Guardian on 15th January 2011 and the Financial Times (20th June 2011) Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice Societal,Policy & public services","person":"T  Sanders","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" This dissemination project was sharing the research findings and recommendations from a previously ESRC funded project, the &quot;The Regulatory Dance: Structural Integration of Sexual Consumption into the Night Time Economy&quot; (RES-000-22-3163). Finished in 2011, this is the largest study of the strip-based entertainment industry to date, adds to this extensive research repertoire by making theoretical and empirical advances to our existing knowledge of gender based social issues around employment and the rise of sexual consumption. The operation of strip clubs needed to be examined in relation to: a) the broader processes of urban governance and structural integration of sexual consumption businesses in the city and night time economy; b) the working conditions of dancers and the entrance routes that create 'supply'; c) the relationships between regulatory processes, corporate and independent club ownership and the management of the night time economy. The study (consisting of a survey of 197 dancers and 70 interviews) focused on women who operate in the strip-based entertainment industry in the UK, and produced the following key findings:\n\n1. The vast majority of dancers had made a decision to do dancing/stripping as a flexible, relatively high earning (although unpredictable), cash-in-hand form of work.\n\n2. Most women did not report any violence and felt safe in their workplace due to security and door personnel, however, there was some reporting of unwanted touching and harassment from customers.\n\n3. There was no evidence of organised prostitution or trafficking / forced involvement.\n\n4. Most dancers were concerned about the high fees, commissions and fines they were paying to the management, especially on occasions when they were taking relatively little money home. 70% of respondents said they had left a shift without earning any money.\n\n5. There was overall concern amongst dancers that their welfare and working conditions were not being taken seriously by the new legislation introduced in the Policing and Crime Act, 2009 that set out a new Sex Entertainment Venue licensing process but rather assumptions were being made about exploitation and the community's views were favoured against dancers. The project was all about dissemination to the striptease industry, the Licensing fraternity in the UK which is made up of licensing officers, Local Authority Licensing Committees and the Institute of Licensing. At the heart of the project was consultation with female dancers and other workers in the industry, so that the resources that were designed and produced were informed by their experiences, needs and understanding of their work. Equally policy recommendations we promoted to Local Authority Licensing Committees and practitioners were informed by dancers, managers and owners in the business who strive for a regulated, tolerated and professional industry free from stereotypes and myths about the work.
