By speaking about imperialism, political activists are establishing strategic connections, cohering and strengthening diverse projects. Anti-imperial rhetoric played a key part in drawing together a wide range of anti-war activists in the wake of September 11, under an umbrella group known as Stop the War. In 2003, Stop the War organised a protest against the invasion of Iraq, which drew unprecedented numbers of protesters to the streets of London. The new anti-imperialism represents a historical departure but emerges out of deeper political roots including those of resistance to overseas and internal colonialism, particularly on the political left, among ethnic and religious minorities including Muslims, and among Scottish and Welsh nationalists. These overlapping groups – their anti-imperial, anti-war activism – are investigated in this research project. Interviews with key activists will ask how and why individuals and organisations have found common ground in their opposition to imperialism, cementing contemporary connections and forging new networks out of longstanding political grievances and perspectives. By understanding these political ideas and relationships, this project will answer pressing questions about social division and also cohesion within the UK.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D004837/1","grantId":"ES/D004837/1","fundValue":"79029","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Simon Phillips","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
