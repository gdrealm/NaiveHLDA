Non-invasive investigations in animal models.","abstractText":"The ability to detect and respond quickly to changes in the environment, for example, the appearance, disappearance or movement of an object, impacts significantly on survival. Detecting changes in the acoustic environment is critical to this process; we often rely on our hearing in the dark or in visually-cluttered environments, and for events that occur beyond the field of vision. Because detecting acoustic changes is such a basic and vital ability, and since modern environments are characterized by 'noise pollution' or competing sources of acoustic information - the need to detect important events within a mixture of sounds, is increasingly important. The present proposal seeks to understand how the auditory brain's sensitivity to the unfolding acoustic environment is shaped by previous long-term exposure changes, and the degree to which this sensitivity is mutable during adulthood. Inherent difficulties in assessing the nature of brain mechanisms underlying sensitivity to acoustic changes means that the questions posed in the current proposal have never been, to the best of our knowledge, addressed experimentally. One reason for this deficit lies in the need to control carefully developmental experience and exposure to sound patterns, a requirement that renders investigations in human subjects almost impossible. So too, addressing such questions in animal models is limited by the difficulties that arise in evaluating the results of exposure/training, coupled with a lack of basic knowledge concerning the sites (i.e. which brain areas) to which electrophysiological recordings might be directed (or indeed how detecting acoustic changes relates to activity at the level of single neurons). Here, we propose a method of assessing the long term plasticity of mechanisms underlying detection of acoustic changes by means of non-invasive, gross brain activity - measurements in animal models (mice and guinea pigs), for which behavioral relevance and developmental experience can be carefully controlled. To measure gross brain activity we will employ a small animal MEG (magneto-encephalography) device. Relative to other means of measuring brain responses from small animals, such as EEG (electro-encephalography), this emerging technology is entirely non-invasive, increasing the efficiency of measuring event-related responses, and facilitating repeated measurements from individual animals. In the first experiment proposed, we will examine the effects of training in adulthood on subsequent neural sensitivity to change. Two groups of animals will be exposed to an identical auditory stimulus, containing changes in two sound features (pitch and timbre). One group will be trained to respond to pitch changes, while ignoring timbre changes, and vice versa for the other group. A control group will be exposed to the same stimuli but without a training element. Change-evoked brain responses (measured using MEG) will then be recorded from non-behaving anesthetized animals to determine whether, and in which manner, such training alters change-detection mechanisms in auditory cortex, A second experiment will investigate the extent to which passive exposure to sound during development, shapes neural representations of change detection in adulthood. Different groups of animals will be raised in specifically controlled sound environments such that the statistics of sound features across groups will be identical, but the statistics of changes (the frequency of changes encountered) different. Following exposure, MEG responses to acoustic changes will be measured. Differences in response patterns between groups will be specifically attributable to the differential exposure of the groups to patterns of changes. The outcome of this experiment will reveal the means by which statistics of acoustic changes shape cortical responses, and which changes (rare or commonly-occurring) are dominant in this process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H006958/1","grantId":"BB/H006958/1","fundValue":"519179","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  So far, the findings of this project have been used as a validation of small-animal MEG technology in brain research, motivating further development of the technology within the electronics, manufacturing and biotechnology industries.

MEG is widely used for studies of auditory brain activity in human subjects, because the measurements can be made with higher temporal precision than is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and better spatial precision than is typical of electroencephalography (EEG). In this project, we performed the first entirely non-invasive MEG measurements of auditory brain activity in rodents. We pioneered the use of a novel small-animal MEG machine donated to UCL by our collaborators at the Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan, and we developed new algorithms for de-noising magnetoencephalographic brain signals with our collaborators at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France. With these new methodologies, we demonstrated that (1) auditory evoked MEG signals qualitatively similar to those observed in human MEG studies can be detected non-invasively in the guinea pig using small-animal MEG; (2) evoked MEG responses to tones in the guinea pig show very rapid reduction in magnitude with tone repetition, which is largely complete by the second tone in a repeated series; and (3) changes in tone frequency produce characteristic alterations in evoked MEG responses in guinea pigs that resemble those previously observed in awake humans using a similar stimulus paradigm. Importantly, our work indicates that alterations in MEG responses following unexpected changes in stimulus features, which are often interpreted in human studies as evidence for high-level cognitive processes such as change detection, may instead arise from low-level and largely automatic mechanisms of sensory adaptation. This research has thus established a bridge between non-invasive MEG studies of auditory perception in human subjects and previous invasive electrophysiological studies of auditory adaptation in small-animal models. Moreover, the development of non-invasive small-animal MEG has enabled refinement of animal procedures in line with the 3Rs. In addition, the project has launched two international research collaborations, and provided proofs-of-concept of both small-animal MEG technology and novel algorithms for de-noising magnetoencephalographic signals. This research has established small-animal MEG technology as a viable non-invasive method for studying auditory brain activity in small rodents, with immediate and/or potential impact on beneficiaries in multiple sectors including information technology, electronics, manufacturing, industrial biotechnology, medical biotechnology, healthcare, and the pharmaceutical industry. Information technology benefits arise from the development of novel algorithms for de-noising biological signals; software developed in the course of this project is freely available online (http://audition.ens.fr/adc/NoiseTools/) and is already being used in other magnetoencephalography projects in the UK and elsewhere. Electronics, manufacturing and industrial biotechnology impacts derive from the demonstration that small-animal MEG technology can be used effectively for measuring evoked sensory responses in the rodent brain; this validation provides justification for further development and manufacturing of the small-animal MEG sensor electronics and hardware by our collaborators at the Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan and their industrial partners. In the longer term, we anticipate that the findings will also be taken up by the medical biotechnology, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Our research has shown that auditory brain signals similar to the human mismatch negativity --- an auditory brain response to stimulus change --- can be measured non-invasively using MEG in small animals. Abnormalities in the mismatch negativity are one of the most reliable endophenotypes of schizophrenia in humans; therefore, our work has obvious potential to be taken forward as a method for pharmaceutical testing of novel drugs on schizophrenia endophenotypes in animal models. Finally, the project is having a continuing impact on academic beneficiaries, not only through publications and conference presentations, but also through establishment of multiple collaborations, including links between University College London in the UK, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France, and Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan. The results of the project and the academic impact of the international collaborations are to be highlighted in the next International Meeting on the Mismatch Negativity in September 2015, where we have been invited to give a symposium presentation on the results of this project to an audience of academic scientists, clinicians, and researchers from the pharmaceutical industry.
