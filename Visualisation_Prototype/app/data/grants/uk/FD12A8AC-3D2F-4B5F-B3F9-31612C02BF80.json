Regenerative medicine involves the use of living cells and other biological molecules to restore damaged structure and function in human organs and tissues. In addition, the recent excitement arising from the discovery and potential uses of stem cells makes it timely to investigate how stem cell research can be used to treat patients. One of the key issues is how to produce enough living cells (including the very rare stem cells) that have the correct function for these new therapies. The current laboratory cell culture procedures are not efficient, nor are they standardised and cannot meet the current clinical needs. This project aims to address this acute issue by the development of a new method of efficiently culturing stem cells and other human cells to give enough cells required to treat patients. This system will be based on the idea of growing cells using a biomaterial derived from seaweed (alginate) that allows the cells to grow and develop normally. In this work, we will decide what effects the key features of the culture system will have on the growth and function of both human stem cells, and also specific human cell types (eg bone cells). As part of our experiments we will measure how the cells grow and behave in the different culture environments, and compare this to conventional methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005950/1","grantId":"BB/E005950/1","fundValue":"185476","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Oreffo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
