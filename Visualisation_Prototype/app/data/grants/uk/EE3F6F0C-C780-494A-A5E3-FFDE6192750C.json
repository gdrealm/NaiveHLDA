Assuming greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates, carbon dioxide will reach nearly triple the pre-industrial concentrations by the end of this century. This is expected to raise global mean temperatures to a level not seen for more than 32 million years. According to the latest assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the high latitudes will experience the largest temperature increases, resulting in a rapid melting of polar ice-sheets and global sea level rise. For a further understanding of potential changes that our world may undergo in the future, it is vital to study environmental changes during past warm periods and across major climatic thresholds. The proposed research project will reconstruct past vegetation of Antarctica and southern Australasia during the Eocene (ca 55-34 million years ago). The Eocene is a geological time period of exceptional warmth, with atmospheric CO2 concentrations exceeding triple the pre-industrial levels. The project will reconstruct past vegetation by analysing pollen in sediments deposited during Eocene times. Vegetation provides detailed information on a number of important environmental parameters, such as annual temperature and precipitation, length of growing season, minimum and maximum temperatures, and soils. Of particular interest for this study are very short-lived time intervals during the early and late Eocene, during which carbon dioxide concentration and temperatures changed rapidly. For a full understanding of their climate forcings and mechanisms, the analysed sediments must have a high time resolution and unambiguous dating control, in order to relate them to respective past climate events. The marine cores 1171 and 1171, taken offshore Tasmania as part of the International Ocean Deep Drilling Programme Leg 189, as well as Eocene rock outcrops at Cape Foulwind in New Zealand, have been chosen for the proposed study, as they provide an unprecedented opportunity to produce high resolution pollen records for Antarctica and adjacent sub-polar regions. The data will be interpreted in a global context and related to Arctic palaeoenvironmental reconstructions by integrating them into the global GIS database TEVIS (Tertiary Environment and Vegetation Information System). The TEVIS dataset will be compared with a number of simulations using the cutting edge Hadley Centre climate model (used within the climate assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change IPCC). By combining regional high-resolution pollen analyses with global data-model comparison, this proposed study will foster a deeper understanding of how the terrestrial environments and polar ice sheets responded, and might respond in the future, to rapid changes in temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentration. By indicating weakness and strength, the data-model comparison will also contribute to the improvement of climate models that we rely upon for simulating future climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H000984/1","grantId":"NE/H000984/1","fundValue":"91863","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Outcomes of this project have been used for research informed teaching projects at university and during public lectures.\nPublications of key findings of this project are currently under review.

We test the hypothesis that the opening of the Tasmanian Gateway at the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O) transition led to a major reorganisation of ocean currents, during which southeast Australia came under the influence of warmer surface waters affecting continental climates and vegetation. We further investigated whether the crossing of atmospheric carbon dioxide thresholds and/or plate tectonic changes resulted in a stepwise cooling of New Zealand and Antarctica as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developed. In order to test these hypotheses, we also developed a global reconstruction of vegetation and land surface temperature change across the E-O transition.\n\nThe question of whether continental Antarctic climate was warm enough at the end of the Miocene to support a substantial vegetation cover is of great significance to the ongoing debate on the behaviour of Antarctic land ice. Palaeoecological analyses from IODP 318, Wilkes Land, show that during the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum MCO (ca 17-15 million years ago) sediments are devoid of sea-ice and ice-rafting indicators, and contain abundant temperate dinoflagellate cysts and pollen of cool-temperate woody plants. Organic paleothermometry (TEX86 and MBT-CBT) consistently show warm sea and continental temperatures. The reconstructed late Oligocene vegetation on Wilkes Land might have resembled modern woodlands in Tasmania and southern New Zealand. Quantitative climate estimates derived from fossil pollen assemblages using the Coexistence Approach suggest mean annual temperatures between 5.8 – 13.7°C.\n\nA global database with presence/absence information on over 2600 pollen taxa across 212 sites has been created. Our analysis uses shifts in latitudinal distribution of these groups as well as quantitative temperature estimates to further explore global vegetation response to climate change at the E-O transition. Our results indicate no major change in global mean annual surface temperatures. Key papers are currently under review. After publication all data will be made available through open access databases (e.g. IODP and Northumbria University Research Link). Education,Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
