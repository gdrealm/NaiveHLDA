In order to quickly respond to environmental changes or to dispose of damaged proteins, cells harbour an effective system for protein destruction that is tightly regulated as any mistakes can have serious effects for the cell. Protein destruction consists of a series of events. At first a small protein termed ubiquitin is attached to a protein molecule that serves as a signal to direct these molecules into a certain pathway. The formation of a particular type of chain of several ubiquitin molecules on a protein results in them being recognised by a large molecular machine, the proteasome that ultimately digests the protein into small pieces. The attachment of only one ubiquitin moiety or other types of ubiquitin chain to a protein can also lead to other outcomes unrelated to protein destruction. Because the correct timing is essential, there are mechanisms to remove or alter these signals. Check point molecules called deubiquitinating enzymes can remove ubiquitin molecules and consequently alter the fate of a target protein. The most abundant class of these deubiquitinating enzymes in humans are the ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs). They regulate ubiquitin-dependent metabolic pathways by cleaving ubiquitin-protein bonds. Each USP specifically recognizes a limited number of ubiquitinated proteins that they can salvage from destruction or channel into different pathways within cells. The structure of these molecules is complicated in that they need to be able to provide binding sites for the protein, in order to be specific, as well as the attached ubiquitin chain and be highly selective in their action. Removing the ubiquitin signal from the wrong protein could have disastrous effects for the cell. This research aims at gaining insights into how one ubiquitin specific protease, USP11, achieves this specificity, whether it is able to distinguish between different ubiquitin chains and how its molecular make-up influences its function. To this end we will determine structures of discrete parts of USP11 and identify binding surfaces for the protein and the ubiquitin chain. As USP11 also interacts with other proteins we will look for additional binding sites. A second attempt to gain a better understanding of these important regulatory proteins will consist of looking at the shape and flexibility of the whole molecule in solution. Ultimately we will establish which parts of USP11 are involved in the recognition of the viral protein HPV-16E7 that once infection has occurred exploits the function of USP11 in order to extend its own life-span. Together, this will provide unique novel insights into how these proteases work, which will help us to better understand this check-point system in regulating normal protein destruction pathways, signalling events and in viral infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H012656/1","grantId":"BB/H012656/1","fundValue":"301865","fundStart":"2010-10-04","fundEnd":"2013-10-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Pharmaceutical companies have shown interest in the findings of this grant and discussions about possible collaborations are in progress.  ","person":"Ingrid  Dreveny","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" We describe for the first time how the N-terminal domain present in ubiquitin specific proteases (DUSP) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains of two related members of the ubiquitin specific protease (USPs) family, human USP15 and USP11, associate to form one functional entity at the atomic level using X-ray crystallography. The structures allowed us to identify a number of potential binding sites such as a binding pocket in the DUSP domain for interaction partners. USPs specifically recognize their substrates and/or binding partners via their protease domains as well as these additional domains. Our investigation of the solution behaviour using biophysical techniques showed that USP15 and USP11 are monomeric in solution with implications for their mechanism of action. We discovered that human USP15 and USP4 share conserved interaction surfaces that imply a common functional role while the same domains in USP11 despite sharing a similar overall structure have different properties. This suggests that despite a common domain composition these three USPs do not fulfil redundant functions. Analysis of the ubiquitin-like domain in these structures revealed that this domain is unlikely to act as ubiquitin mimic with key implications for the mechanism of this protease. Furthermore, we investigate the regulatory role of these N-terminal DUSP and both internal UBL domains on the catalytic activity of USP11 using a series of truncation mutants. Interestingly, we found that USP11 is not regulated by intra-molecular auto-inhibition or activation by its N-terminal DUSP or two UBL domains, suggesting a different regulatory mechanism of this protease compared to other USPs such as USP7. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive enzymatic analysis of the substrate specificity of full-length USP11 and the truncation mutants in terms of ubiquitin chain linkage types. Interestingly, this revealed that USP11 has a preference for ubiquitin chains that have been implicated in DNA damage repair, namely K63- and K6-linked ubiquitin chains, in agreement with its function in this pathway. This substrate specificity is mainly mediated by the protease domain. Our data provides a framework to advance study of the structure and function of this sub-family of USPs in health and disease. The Ubiquitin Proteasome System has emerged as important target for drug discovery in cancer, neurodegerative diseases and other pathological conditions. The observation that proteasome inhibitors are able to induce apoptosis preferentially in tumor cells opened the way to their use as potential drugs.\nOne of these drugs, bortezomib (Velcade), was introduced in cancer therapy and its use was approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib is the first drug targeting the Ubiquitin Proteaseome System. The drug bortezomib affects many cellular pathways and more selective inhibition targeting Ubiquitin ligases or ubiquitin specific proteases may have increased benefit and reduced side effect. The pharmaceutical industry will benefit from this work by reading publications from the grant or downloading structures deposited in the PDB database.
