Progress in this direction has been made but the correlation with experiment is not yet clear. An electron residing in the electrode can jump to an ion in solution, reducing its oxidation state. How easy this process is depends on the proximity of the ion and the electrode and the numbers of electrons available at the correct energy and location within the electrode (this number is called the surface projected density of states at the Fermi level). We have calculated this for 1-10 graphene layers and find it maximum for one layer and minimum for two. We have also examined how defects in the layers affect the surface projected densities of states, which very closely related to what is seen of these defects by a scanning transmission microscope. Finally, collaborating with colleagues in France we have examined edges of graphene sheets and found they can curl up on themselves removing all their broken bonds. This curling and folding process has been examined in the boron nitride analogue of graphite, and shown to give interesting optical emission effects. graphene and nanotechnology researchers should be able to use the STM images of defective graphene and the trends in projected densities of states.
