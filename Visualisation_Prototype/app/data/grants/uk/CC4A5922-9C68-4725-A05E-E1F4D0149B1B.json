As our ability to control alloy properties and microstructure increases, greater attention is drawn to designing new alloys that outperform the current state-of-the-art. In order to design the alloys of the future, the research community will have to undergo a step change, and think of advanced alloys as composite materials that include individual phases with remarkably different properties. The morphology, size and distribution of phases, together with their individual properties, work in unison to provide superior performance. For example, the superalloys of the future will need to display specific desirable dislocation behaviours that lead to higher strength and better high-temperature properties. This can be achieved by planar faults engineering: a finer control of planar fault energies and deformation mechanisms by fine tuning the chemistry of individual phases. This project has two aims. The first aim is to understand how wider compositional changes and temperature affect all planar fault energies in ordered intermetallic compounds, using the L12 phase as a case study. The second aim is to develop a framework for designing the composition of new alloys considering also desired planar fault energies as an input parameter.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M021874/1","grantId":"EP/M021874/1","fundValue":"95270","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alessandro  Mottura","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
