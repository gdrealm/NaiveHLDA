A hallmark of cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells, which is normally prevented by a network of control mechanisms that restricts the number of divisions normal cells can do. Cells that are damaged or have reached a certain age are prevented from any further divisions to remove the potential for them becoming cancerous. However, this continuous removal of old and damaged cells comes at a cost. While it avoids the formation of cancerous cells, it also increasingly impedes the regeneration of tissues, which is thought to be a major factor contributing to the ageing process of an individual. Thus, oncogenesis and ageing are opposite but tightly linked forces.\n \nMy interest in cancer genetics and ageing was one of the key motivations for studying molecular biology and for most of my research up to now. Initially, the medical aspects of cancer were my main interest. I spent several months in a human genetics laboratory where I worked directly with cancerous tissue. However, this work, although interesting, left me rather unsatisfied. Little was known about the details of cancer development in human cells and the studies I was doing felt rather like shots in the dark. Shortly afterwards I did a course in a lab that was interested in genomic stability in baker's yeast. Here I experienced that the understanding of the molecular details of DNA metabolism in yeast was far advanced in comparison to human cells. I was able to do simple experiments that allowed me to understand why the genetic information became unstable. In humans this lack of genomic stability is one of the key stages that results in transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell, as it corrodes the complex network of quality control systems that maintains genomic integrity and ensures that cells only divide once it is safe to do so. \n\nMotivated by this key feature of the biology of cancer, I went on to investigate how a specific yeast protein called Mph1, which was newly discovered at the time, helps to maintain the genetic information. These studies formed the basis of my Diploma and subsequent PhD training. A similar protein has been identified in humans. It is called FancM since its absence causes Fanconi anemia, a genetic disease associated with a much-elevated risk of cancer. It was exciting to see how investigations of a yeast protein can be of interest for human geneticists.\n\nAfter completing my PhD I decided to study a protein called RecG, a DNA processing enzyme found in almost all species of bacteria. It was thought that RecG, Mph1 and FancM might all have a similar function in DNA metabolism. However, my studies revealed that RecG has an important and previously unknown function. It limits a major cause of genomic instability, one associated with events necessary for the orderly completion of chromosome replication, a fundamental requirement in all organisms. This trigger of genomic instability was unexpected and I am excited by the prospect of dissecting the molecular details. Ultimately, I aim to understand how it might contribute to the development of cancer and ageing. However, my initial studies will continue to exploit more tractable bacterial models so as to build some basic understanding before progressing to the more complex systems operating in higher organisms. As such my studies will also shed light on aspects of genomic instability that enable bacterial pathogens to overcome host defences and to acquire resistance to antibiotics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K015729/1","grantId":"BB/K015729/1","fundValue":"403836","fundStart":"2013-10-07","fundEnd":"2016-10-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  First year of award, not applicable yet.  ","person":"Christian Joachim Rudolph","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":" Objective 1 of the proposal is to investigate whether the recombination events associated with the collision of replication forks can lead to genomic instability in bacteria.\n\n- In line with Objective 1a of the original proposal we have developed strains with tandem repeat cassettes in locations where replication forks collide as well as control locations. We have started to collect first experimental data. \n\n- In line with Objective 1b we have started to generate synthetic strains with additional replication origins and additional termination sites. \n\n- In line with Objective 1c we have established 2D DNA gel electrophoresis in the lab and will be starting to collect specific experimental data.\n\nObjective 2 of the proposal is to investigate whether origin-independent synthesis can help to duplicate the bacterial chromosomes in times of genotoxic stress.\n\nWe have completed a study showing that replication initiating in locations other than the origin leads to head-on collisions between replication fork and transcription complexes. Our data support the idea that the induced clashes between transcription and replication have a severe impact and, if unprocessed, can threaten the viability of the affected cells. Thus, while damage-induced forks are in theory capable of helping progression of ongoing synthesis to ensure survival of the cells affected, our data suggest that these forks also pose a danger, leading to the question of why and how damage induced synthesis is triggered. The data have been submitted and the manuscript is currently under evaluation with PLoS Genetics. \n\nObjective 3 of the proposal is to investigate target proteins that might be involved in replication and termination of the human mitochondrial DNA. Key proteins will be expressed in E. coli cells with a termination defect and the efficiency of suppression of these proteins evaluated. The long term objective is to establish whether replication fork collisions might pose a problem in mitochondria, as replication has great similarities to bacterial replication. \n\n- We have successfully expressed human mitochondrial (hmt) RNase H1 in E. coli cells lacking RNase HI. We were able to show that the phenotype caused by the lack of RNase HI can indeed be partially complemented by hmt RNase H1. Furthermore, hmt RNase H1 was shown to play a role in mtDNA replication. We are now identifying further candidates that can be tested in a similar way. In 2014 I have given multiple oral and poster presentation as part of research seminars and conferences, which has greatly improved visibility of our work in termination. Key findings of my work were published in 2013 in a letter in Nature, which was recently cited in a number of high profile journals by groups working on termination in bacteria as well as eukaryotic cells (e.g. Moreno et al. 2014, Science 346(6208):477-481; Wendel et al. 2014, PNAS doi: 10.1073/pnas.1415025111), highlighting the importance of the work undertaken. \n\nAn additional aim for the next 2 years of the award will be to increase visibility via non-academic routes, including developing a website available to the public.
