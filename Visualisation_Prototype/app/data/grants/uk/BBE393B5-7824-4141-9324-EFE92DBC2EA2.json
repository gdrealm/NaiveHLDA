{"id":"BBE393B5-7824-4141-9324-EFE92DBC2EA2","title":"Voices in the City: Understanding the Role of the City of London as a Multi-Level Policy Actor and the Impact of the Financial Crisis","abstractText":"<p>&nbsp;‘Voices in the City’ sets out to unpack the black box of the City of London by addressing five key questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How can we conceptualise the City as a policy actor? </li>\n\n <li>How does the City try to shape the regulatory agenda at multiple levels? </li>\n\n <li>What has been the impact of the global financial crisis on its policy role? </li>\n\n <li>To what extent have its regulatory policy preferences been redefined? </li>\n\n <li>How can we explain the City’s influence within the policy process? </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The study explores the political role of the City by mapping its policy preferences and lobbying strategies at the national, European and international level. It does so by analysing a series of case studies related to recent regulatory reform negotiations, including the Basel 3 agreement and EU Capital Requirements Directive IV. The project will draw upon extensive survey data and in-depth interviews with policy makers, industry regulators, trade representatives and members of leading City firms to provide a rich empirical account of how this critically important but hitherto neglected actor wields influence within the policy process.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001019/1","grantId":"ES/K001019/1","fundValue":"95386","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Scott  James","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
