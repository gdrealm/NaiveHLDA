Two important aspects of this question will be explored. How do people value social stimuli? How do people change their behaviour in order to preserve their reputation? These two questions are central. Indeed, finding social stimuli rewarding and being careful about preserving one's reputation are two important aspects of social motivation that can function as powerful incentives to guide behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3136","grantId":"RES-000-22-3136","fundValue":"74041","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The data collected during the award led to three experimental papers, one review paper, two book chapters and one encyclopedia entry: \n\n1.

In such a highly social and interactive environment, it is important 1)to enjoy social interactions and 2)to present oneself as an interesting partner for such interactions. As a result, typically-developing children and adults are naturally keen to socialise, and spontaneously adjust their behaviour in order to preserve their reputation and convey their best image. \nBy contrast, we found that teenagers with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) i) report that they take less pleasure in social interactions than TD controls, ii) are less irresistibly attracted to social stimuli, iii) are more likely to favour honesty over reputation-management or flattery, and iv) that this measure of flattery correlates with self-reports of social pleasure. These results were obtained using a combination of techniques: self-report, reaction time, and observational measures. \n\nThis work provides a new understanding of the basis of social impairments in autism, with possible implications for future intervention strategies. As such, our research will be of interest to psychologists involved in autism research but also to others in areas of research where social motivation is a key concept (economics and social psychology, in particular). This diversity of impacts is reflected in the journals and conferences that we selected to disseminate our findings. Our work has had its main impact on psychologists involved in autism research: little is known regarding how much value is given to social stimuli in ASD and quantifying social interest has proven difficult. Our findings therefore bring about new ways to understand the social deficits found in autism, and to measure social interest. More specifically, our results have led to collaborations with Prof. Robert Schultz, at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\nOur research also has potential impact on other areas of research where social motivation is a key concept (economics, social psychology, and animal models of social cognition, for example). In particular, we collaborated with Dr. Pascal Huguet, a social psychologist at the Universit? d'Aix-Marseille specialising in the effects of social presence on cognitive performance, to design the task presented in Paper 3. This collaboration, in turn, has had an impact Dr. Huguet's research, who now intends to study similar effects in other pathological populations (e.g. depressed patients). Our work also prompted a collaboration with Dr. Edward Brodkin, an animal researcher who develops mouse models of autism at the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nThis diversity of impacts is reflected in the journals and conferences that we selected to disseminate our findings.
