The ability to form an attachment to another person can provide a sense of security and support. Attachment relationships may be particularly important in later life when dealing with issues such as illness or loss. The first study will examine attachment patterns and social relationships in normally ageing older adults. This questionnaire study will explore the relationship between attachment patterns and quality of life, health, wellbeing and adjustment to ageing in a sample of older people. The second study will focus on the importance of attachment for people with dementia and their caregivers by analysing an existing data set. A greater understanding of differences in attachment patterns will help in understanding the needs, emotional experiences and behaviour of people with dementia, and the implications for caregiving. The findings will have implications for policy, practice and service provision with regard to older people generally, caregivers of people with dementia, and people with dementia themselves.\n\n</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H046860/1","grantId":"ES/H046860/1","fundValue":"80215","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharon  Nelis","coPersons":["Linda  Clare","Christopher John Whitaker"],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
