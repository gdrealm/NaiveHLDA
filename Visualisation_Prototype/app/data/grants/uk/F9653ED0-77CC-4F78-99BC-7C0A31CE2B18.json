{"id":"F9653ED0-77CC-4F78-99BC-7C0A31CE2B18","title":"Detector Development Infrastructure","abstractText":"QMUL has, and is currently, making signicant investments in infrastructure to support the\nParticle Physics Research Centre (PPRC) at QMUL. Prior to the last consolidated grant round\nan estimated investment of &pound;170K had been made in order to modernise the workshop, equip-\nping it with two modern CNC machines to directly support detector prototyping and future\nexperiment builds. College is continuing to invest in our activities, and has just completed a\nnew class 10,000 clean room for silicon detector R&amp;D, and a dedicated laboratory for testing\nsilicon detector and mechanical support structures. This new lab includes facilities for ATLAS\ntracker upgrade stave QA. The total cost of this facility including VAT is &pound;560K. QMUL will\nbe investing in additional laboratory facilities in the near future to support generic R&amp;D and\nneutrino detector development work. Our projects team are currently finalising the tendering \nprocess for that work. Given this significant direct contribution to provide infrastructure for STFC\nscience, totalling &pound;730K so far, combined with the fact that we are seeking funds for generic \ndetector development infrastructure, we ask for 100% contributions from STFC for an Optical \ncoordinate measuring machine for silicon detector QA and development programmes and a \nScalable Readout System (SRS) for testing pixel sensors as a part of our generic R&amp;D programme.\nWe believe that this infrastructure request represents excellent value for money from the perspective\nof STFC as we have already leveraged over five times the requested amount of money for\nour group infrastructure. QMUL will cover the cost of software for the CMM and training of staff\nto use it, which as can be seen from the quote supplied, amounts to &pound;11,358+VAT.\n\nThe equipment requested will strengthen collaborative ties between QMUL, STFC laboratories and CERN,\nas well as allowing the UK community to build on its silicon expertise by taking into account previously\nignored effects in silicetector construction. If fully successful that knowledge could make the \ndifference between UK technology, with a proven track record of impact potential, being selected for \nnew international projects over competitors. This is especially true in the realm of future linear collider\ndetectors where resolutions of less than 3um are desired targets that have yet to be achieved in \ndemonstrator chips. An understanding of these effects could also be relevant for other industrial \nor scientific imaging applications involving large scale image sensors. Hence this could lead to impact\nfrom ATLAS data analysis to underpinning IP for STFC developed technology, and may even have benefits\nfurther afield in terms of image processing in CMOS applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003511/1","grantId":"ST/L003511/1","fundValue":"32800","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Francesca  Di Lodovico","coPersons":["Jonathan Michael Hays","Stephen  Lloyd","Lucio  Cerrito","Adrian John Bevan","Syed Eram Rizvi","Jeanne  Wilson","Marcella  Bona"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
