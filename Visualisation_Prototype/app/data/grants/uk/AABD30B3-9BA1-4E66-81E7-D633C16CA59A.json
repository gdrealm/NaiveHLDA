{"id":"AABD30B3-9BA1-4E66-81E7-D633C16CA59A","title":"Self-organization in Immune Response","abstractText":"The in vivo visualization of dynamic processes in lymphoid tissues by two-photon microscopy opens up possibilities for a combination of modelling, testing and experimental approaches to understand the behaviour of the immune system. A key element to develop larger models of immune response is the understanding of the cell activation, proliferation and interaction mechanisms.The aim of the project is to develop a theoretical and algorithmic framework to model and simulate the behaviour of T-cells in different environments and conditions using multi/agent dynamic systems and self-organizing systems. The proposed framework will reduce the burden on the modeling and simulation of immune system. A major step forward will be achieved by drawing inspiration from behavioural science, control engineering, physical and mathematical modelling. The final multi-agent model represents a multi-discipline integration of research concepts and simultaneously a substantial improvement of the present state of the art that fails to identify the mechanisms responsible for T-cell activation and proliferation. The integration of the activities in three research units at Strathclyde guarantees the accuracy of the final model that will be tested against a variety of experimental data and put the applicants in a unique position for the achievement of the objectives not just in the UK but also at an international level.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E062091/1","grantId":"EP/E062091/1","fundValue":"106290","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Grimble","coPersons":["Gian-Luca  Oppo","James MacDonald  Brewer","Paul  Garside"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
