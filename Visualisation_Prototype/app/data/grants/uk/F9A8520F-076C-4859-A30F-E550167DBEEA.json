Identifying and exploiting genetic variation controlling seed yield and quality in oilseed crops","abstractText":"Oilseed rape is one of the most important UK crops, providing nutritious oil for human consumption and contributing to biodiesel production to meet renewables obligations. Globally it is the third largest source of oils, behind soybean and oil palm, and is the second leading source of nutritious protein meal for livestock rations. Oilseed rape is also a very useful rotation crop grown alternately with wheat. This is used extensively, but problems with weed build-up and increased disease potential may could lead to reduced cultivation of oilseed rape. Therefore higher yielding crops will help with sustainable agricultural practices. \nHowever, the yields of oilseed rape seed has not changed significantly since 1980, and production levels have increased through increasing the growing areas. One of the contributing factors is that the overall form and growth of the plant has not yet been highly adapted for crop yield, compared to wheat or maize for example. The aim of the UK part of this project is to exploit recent advances in oilseed rape genomics and genetic analysis to identify genetic variation that contributes to seed yield and composition and to overall plant form, and use this to identify and understand genes that influence these traits. \nThe work on understanding gene function will draw on parallel studies carried out by German and French partners in the project that aims to identify genes that control key aspects of seed formation and to assess in detail how genetic variation contributes to seed composition. The genetic analysis work uses a wide variety of oilseed rape relatives that although not directly useful for crop improvement, help to identify genetic variation causing interesting and relevant changes to plant growth and seed formation. The highly precise genetic analyses afforded by genomics helps define genes linked to genetic variation that is associated to traits- in our case seed formation. The functions of these genes can be understand, and eventually used for crop improvement. We will engage with breeding companies to pass on relevant information and advice on how to use it.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M001334/1","grantId":"BB/M001334/1","fundValue":"392514","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  As the project has only been going for 4 months the findings are at an early stage.

This summer we conducted the first phenotypic analyses of a Brassica diversity set of 102 lines grown in a greenhouse. Data has been collected and GWA conducted. several strong associations of genetic variation and gene expression with seed traits have been detected and candidate genes are being studied. Another trial will be replicated next year with new lines to increase variation Allelic variation in genes influencing yield traits will be characterised and any potential commercial value discussed with PBL for patenting and licensing\nResults will be published and presented so that other researchers can contribution to a thorough genetic analysis of growth and yield in Brassica napus Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
