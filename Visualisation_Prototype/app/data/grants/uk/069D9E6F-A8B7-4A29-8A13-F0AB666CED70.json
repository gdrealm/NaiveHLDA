The design will allow us to measure a range of song parameters, plus collect data on singing rates and mating success. The DGRP lines are part of a coordinated effort by the Drosophila community and are having their genomes sequenced to a high level of coverage. This will allow genome-wide association analyses to be completed for variation in song, and covariation analyses between song and other phenotypes, including mating success. This will provide an unparalleled data set for the analysis of genome-wide associations for variation in important behavioural phenotypes within a single population. Results will be relevant to behaviour genetics, sexual selection and our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary genetics of natural populations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H010548/1","grantId":"NE/H010548/1","fundValue":"26234","fundStart":"2010-05-10","fundEnd":"2011-10-12","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Ritchie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
