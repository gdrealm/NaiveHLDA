There are 5.2 million asthma sufferers in the UK, 1.1 million children (1 in 10) and 4.1 million adults (1 in 12). On average, 1400 people die from asthma each year, and asthma now costs the NHS an average of #889 million per year. The Global Burden of Disease studies ranked COPD as the 6th commonest cause of death worldwide in 1990 and this has now risen to 4th. In the UK COPD now causes about 30,000 deaths a year and mortality is almost double the European average, with COPD killing more women than breast cancer last year.Inflammation is believed to be central to the development and symptoms of asthma and COPD. A naturally occurring chemical in the body can open the airways and reduce the inflammation through interactions with one or more of a family of proteins. Unfortunately, this chemical also causes cough. The aim of this study is to try to determine which of the proteins are involved in the beneficial responses and which in the detrimental cough response of the chemical. The hope is that this work may lead to the discovery of a novel drug which could selectively target the beneficial processes leading to the production of a therapy that could help these patients who suffer from these debilitating diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800195","grantId":"G0800195","fundValue":"587716","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria Gabriela Belvisi","coPersons":["Deborah Lee Clarke"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
