Overcome this and major new markets open up in the medical and petrochemical industries amongst many others. Results obtained by Loughborough University indicate this can be achieved by producing nanostructured zirconia.The science is now largely understood so the task is to scale up the manufacture of these materials to prototype level and transfer the technology into industry.

Work undertaken at Loughborough University has resulted in overcoming this barrier as large, complex shapes are now being fabricated through optimising the pilot scale manufacturing conditions for nanostructured zirconia components. Scale up quantities of granulated powders suitable for industrial pressing trials have been prepared and successfully used in factory-floor automated presses, which was a milestone in fabrication of valve components. In order to evaluate the suitability of nanostructured zirconia for valve component applications the parts were\n\nsubjected to slurry erosion and ultrasound cavitation tests at Southampton University. Zirconia showed 6 fold improvement compared to the commonly-used stellite-coated commercial stainless steel specimens under slurry erosion conditions, although it was less good for cavitation situations. In parallel, a market survey was performed to investigate the size of the market. It was found that the global sales for advanced ceramics was around US$ 44 billion in 2011 and was projected to reach &gt;US$ 56 billion by 2015. Japan and the US formed half of the market in 2011 but it is projected that by 2015 Japan will gain a majority share of &gt;40% in the annual sales of advanced ceramics. Over 50 zirconia manufacturing companies were identified, mainly in the US and Europe and contacted. All the companies who participated in the survey confirmed that the granulated powder was relevant to their existing technologies and were happy to adopt the powder for initial trials. Following the successes obtained, additional funding has been obtained, from both Loughborough University until Aug 2012 and MEL Chemicals from Aug 2012, to transfer the technology to MEL and to seek to exploit the properties of nanostructured zirconia further and improve the environmental sustainability of the production processes. Furthermore, a licence agreement has been signed with MEL Chemicals Ltd. The achievements of this project along with other activities of ceramic research group in the field of nanoceramics have been recognised by the Enterprise Office at Loughborough University and it has been nominated for Loughborough University 2012 Enterprise Award (outcome known 25/04/12). The technology has been licensed to MEL Chemicals. With a license now signed between MEL Chemicals and Loughborough University a clear exploitation route exists. The focus is now on scaling up two key steps in the process route. Aerospace/ Defence and Marine,Energy,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
