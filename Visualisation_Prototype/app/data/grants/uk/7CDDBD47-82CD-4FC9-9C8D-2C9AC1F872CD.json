Since the 1990?s there has been nearly a five-fold increase in antipsychotic prescriptions, especially for non-psychotic behavioural disorders. While these medications are generally safe over the short-term, their long-term effects on the brain are unclear. While patients show some brain abnormalities before the start of treatment ? these abnormalities seem to increase as the illness goes on and as treatment continues. It is not clear if these abnormalities are due to the natural course of the disease or due to the antipsychotic medication. In order to evaluate the long-term effects of antipsychotics on brain structures and their subsequent effects, we have developed an animal model in rats that mimics the clinical administration of the drug. These studies would not be ethically possible to conduct in humans as one would not wish to give these drugs to normal volunteers for long periods and nor can one deprive patients of needed treatments for long periods. Given this, the animal models provide a much better way to examine this issue in detail.\n\nIn a small initial study, we administered antipsychotic medications to normal rodents in a way that mimicked clinical dosing patterns, and we found that both haloperidol (an older generation drug) and olanzapine (a newer generation drug) caused a decrease in brain volumes of rats treated for two months (equivalent to 3yrs human life-span). The effect was mainly in the grey matter of the brain. We now wish to test the drug in animals that bear hallmarks of schizophrenia to further distinguish the effects of the drugs from that of disease. \n\nFurthermore, we have shown that a commonly available medication, Lithium, has the opposite effect on the brain, it increases the grey matter. We would like to test if this medication can be used to counter the effects of the antipsychotics. The results of the study will be helpful in determining the safety of the current drugs, develop treatment strategies and the animal model itself will serve as a tool to screen safer antipsychotic medications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002198","grantId":"G1002198","fundValue":"819680","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Shitij  Kapur","coPersons":["Jonathan David Cooper","Steven C Williams","Michel  Modo"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
