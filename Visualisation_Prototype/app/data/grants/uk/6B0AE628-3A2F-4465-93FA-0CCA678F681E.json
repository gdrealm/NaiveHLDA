{"id":"6B0AE628-3A2F-4465-93FA-0CCA678F681E","title":"GAmma detection with New Advanced Scintillators - GANAS","abstractText":"Historically, key advances in nuclear physics have been driven by advances in detector technology. An exciting prospect for new detector technology is that offered by novel scintillator materials which have very high energy resolution and excellent time response. The present project is part of an EU-wide initiative called NuPNET to develop new detectors for nuclear physics. The project, entitled GANAS, will look specifically at the potential of novel scintillators and also how these can be attached to novel photosensors. The York group will lead one of the work packages of this R&amp;D project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002747/1","grantId":"ST/J002747/1","fundValue":"88041","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  We have already followed up this project with development of a hand-held gamma-ray spectrometer for Kromek PLC which is now being marketed commercially.

York was a work package leader on what was a wider European project with many project partners working on related aims. We have already used the findings to develop a new product for Kromek PLC - a hand-held gamma-ray spectrometer. This was funded through a short KTP. The work here has also placed us to work on two follow-up STFC-funded projects related to hand-held gamma-ray spectrometers and oil and gas exploration.
