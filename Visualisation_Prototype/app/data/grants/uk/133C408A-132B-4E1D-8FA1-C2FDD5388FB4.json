{"id":"133C408A-132B-4E1D-8FA1-C2FDD5388FB4","title":"Intoxicants and Early Modernity: England c.1580-c.1740","abstractText":"<p>This collaborative project between the University of Sheffield and the V&amp;A explores the political, economic, cultural, and social importance of intoxicants and their material culture between the introduction of tobacco in the 1570s and the ‘Gin Craze’ of the early eighteenth-century. By intoxicants is meant; ‘old world’ alcohols and ‘new world’ tobacco, caffeine, and opiates. While people at the time were aware that intoxicants played a central role in the many changes and processes linking the medieval and modern worlds, orthodox interpretations of 'early modernity' (as the period is termed by historians)&nbsp;insist the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>The project challenges this orthodoxy by consulting and linking a range of sources and datasets - ranging from port books detailing the type and volume of coastal trade to legal depositional evidence detailing instances of drinking, and from records of policing and regulation to the inventories of retailers - in order to develop closely contextualised community studies over time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Outcomes include an easily accessible website and database for academics and the wider public; museum displays and public lectures; monographs, articles and volume of essays; and a range of initiatives by which this crucial historical perspective can be brought to bear on current debates and policies regarding intoxicants.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00493X/1","grantId":"ES/K00493X/1","fundValue":"638710","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We have done the following public events over the last year: \n\n14 October 2014: Angela McShane, 'What's in a Teapot?'
