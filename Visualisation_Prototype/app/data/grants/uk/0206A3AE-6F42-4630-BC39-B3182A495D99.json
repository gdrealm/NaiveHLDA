How do city leaders respond to global challenges and contribute to global governance? How are they influenced by city- to-city networking? How does city leadership translate into strategic responses to global challenges? Urban Gateways is designed to improve our understanding of how city leadership translates into long-term strategic visions, how it relates and contributes to global governance and how this global action is perceived ‘on the ground’ in cities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Urban Gateways will provide a global overview of the city leadership and strategic plans in both developing and developed countries, highlighting leadership approaches, strategic trends, foresight drivers and major hindrances in the development of strategic urban plans addressing global challenges. The project focuses both on major global cities and second-tier cities to offer not only international comparative assessments but also multi- tiered considerations that de-centre globalist models of international and urban research.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007742/1","grantId":"ES/K007742/1","fundValue":"243544","fundStart":"2013-12-02","fundEnd":"2016-12-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michele  Acuto","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
