Upon identifying a suitable partner, Drosophila melanogaster males initiate an elaborate courtship ritual that culminates with copulation. Drosophila females do not actively court males, yet it is her response to the male's advances that determines whether mating will actually occur. These are complex decisions and behaviours controlled by the brain, but working with flies has the advantage of using a vast array of genetic tools that allows us to identify and manipulate relevant neurons in the brain. With these tools we can ask how does the brain differ between the sexes, and how might these differences explain the distinct behaviours of males and females that are critical for reproductive success? \n\nWe are interested in identifying neurons that control courtship behaviours, understanding how they are connected with one another, and how they work together to specify a behaviour that is unique to one gender. In particular, we have focused on understanding the role of neurons that express doublesex (dsx), a gene that is key for determining sex in Drosophila. These dsx+ neurons control male courtship behaviour and aspects of female receptivity. Yet little is known about the specific role of dsx+ neurons in the brain, which are believed to control mating decisions. We recently used genetic tools to manipulate the function of these neurons in the brain of females and males and evaluate the effects on sexual behaviour. Unexpectedly, when we artificially activated dsx+ neurons in the female brain, these females began to behave like males by displaying male-typical courtship behaviours towards other females or males.\nThis experiment demonstrates that both male and female brains have the necessary neurons capable of inducing male-specific behaviours, regardless of biological sex. So why don't females normally behave like males? And, what is different about the male and the female brain that allows them to behave in a sex-appropriate manner?\n\nUsing our assay to induce male-typical courtship behaviours in females we can now study sex differences in the brain that cause only males to exhibit these courtship behaviours. Specifically, we propose to address the following fundamental questions: (i) which specific neurons in the brain are capable of inducing male-typical courtship behaviours in females? (ii) how does their activity differ between sexes? (iii) Can we identify sex-differences in other neurons of the same circuitry that account for sexually dimorphic behaviours? \n\nThis study provides the opportunity to study how neurons operate differently to control mating decisions in females and males. Comparing the structure, function and activity of neurons in the brain of both sexes will reveal principles of brain organization that underlie unisex and sex-specific circuitry in flies. These studies offer great potential for understanding fundamental neuronal mechanisms that are present across species, and represent a key step toward understanding the complex inner workings of higher organisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N000803/1","grantId":"BB/N000803/1","fundValue":"454688","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Goodwin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
