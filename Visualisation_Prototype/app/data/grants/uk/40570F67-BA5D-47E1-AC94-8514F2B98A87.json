There was a danger that many of these works might have disappeared because of their ephemeral nature and poor technical condition. The project has sought to determine the best examples of works from the period, conserve and preserve them (in partnership with the Scottish Screen Archive), to enable further scholarly activity. An archive, exhibitions, salons and a Content Management System (CMS), have been employed to disseminate the works to the public and academic community, with further exhibitions being planned for 2008-2010.\\n\\nThe CMS offers online access to interviews with artists and animateurs, documentation, background material and associated ephemera. The interviews are in video/audio form and downloadable PDF files. \\n\\nThe REWIND ARCHIVE and COLLECTION currently has 250 works including single channel videoworks and 30 installations. \\n\\nResearch Leave is required to complete the main publication and plan and curate a series of exhibitions, screenings, and other events. \\n\\nAs the Research Grant was awarded before FEC an application for Research Leave is allowable and was indicated in the original application.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F012918/1","grantId":"AH/F012918/1","fundValue":"37317","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  To support the writing and editing of the publication.\nImpacts derive from archival research in contemporary art practice, specifically curatorial activities within video &amp; experimental film, and the European avant-garde.
