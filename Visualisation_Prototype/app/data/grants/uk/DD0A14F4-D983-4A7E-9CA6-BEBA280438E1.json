The negative influence of distance on prisoners - its contribution to high rates of recidivism and poor prisoner mental and physical health - is recognised by the post-Soviet authorities.&nbsp;In reforms to the 'correctional code', Russia has pledged itself to holding prisoners near to home, but women are excluded from this provision.&nbsp;The research will examine how the isolation suffered by women&nbsp;in Russia's penal system shapes their experiences of custody and the decisions they make at the end of their sentences.&nbsp;The project is the first systematic study of the geography of imprisonment in Russia.&nbsp;It will involve first-hand research in penal colonies in three regions and will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods.&nbsp;In addition to women prisoners, the researchers will conduct interviews with prison officers, other members of the penal service and voluntary organisations.&nbsp;The results will be analysed in the context of the continuities and changes in Russia's broader penal geography in the past two decades.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/D00053X/1","grantId":"ES/D00053X/1","fundValue":"253013","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Pallot","coPersons":["Laura  Piacentini","Dominique  Moran"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
