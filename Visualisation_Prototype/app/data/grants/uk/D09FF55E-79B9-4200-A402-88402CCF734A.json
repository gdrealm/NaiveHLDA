The most fundamental conflict concerns the distribution of reproduction. Animal societies vary enormously in the degree of 'reproductive skew', which measures the evenness with which reproduction is distributed among group members. A large number of evolutionary models have been proposed to account for why societies vary in this way. These models are based on different principles but nevertheless make similar or overlapping predictions, with the consequence that even the best attempts to test the models have up to now been uninformative. The best way to distinguish the models and provide a much richer understanding of reproductive conflict is to manipulate the degree of skew experimentally. We will carry out the first experiment of this kind large-scale on a free-living population of banded mongooses that we have studied for the last eleven years. This species is unusual because nearly all adult females (up to ten) in each group give birth together in the same den, and offspring are cared for by adults of both sexes. We have shown in a pilot study that we can use short-acting contraceptive injections to block pregnancy in breeding females for a single breeding attempt, thereby temporarily increasing the degree of skew while keeping group size and other variables constant. The behavioural responses to the manipulation, combined with genetic analyses of maternity, reproductive success and the kin structure of the group, will enable us to measure the costs of co-breeding, determine which individuals exert control over the distribution of reproduction, and provide information on the behavioural mechanisms employed in reproductive conflict. Moreover, our experiment will test for the first time the direction of causality between variation in the distribution of reproduction and variation in individual social behaviour, a important but untested assumption of models of skew and cooperation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/E015441/1","grantId":"NE/E015441/1","fundValue":"309283","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  This work was essentially 'blue skies' research aimed at understanding how different types of cooperative society evolved. In particular, can we explain why how cooperative societies remain stable despite wide variation in the degree of inequality between group members? Why do individuals share the profits of cooperation in some societies equally, while in others a single dominant or 'queen' monopolises reproduction? Our project investigated these questions using a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. We carried out the first experimental test of competing theoretical models in a wild mammal system. Our results suggest that reproductive behaviour of cooperative animals is shaped by threats of punishment that remain hidden until they are triggered experimentally. Our experiment suggests that coercion as a force shaping animal behaviour may be much more widespread than previously realised. The theoretical component developed this idea formally, and showed how it can apply to conflicts in other social organisms and at other levels of biological organisation, such as conflict among genes and cells in multicellular organisms.

The main findings were that socially dominant female banded mongooses use the threat of infanticide to deter reproduction by younger subordinates; but that these younger females can escape this threat by synchronising birth to the same day as older females. The results suggest that conflicts within cooperative groups may often be resolved by threats of infanticide or aggression, which remain hidden until they are triggered experimentally. Coercion may therefore be widespread in animal societies, even those in which acts of aggression are rarely observed. Our theoretical development of this idea revealed the conditions where threats can be effective as a method of coercion, with wide applicability to social and cooperative vertebrates and insects. The evolution of cooperation is a topic of interdisciplinary interest and underlies many evolutionary, economic, and political issues such as global climate change, the stability of public goods, and human conflict. Understanding how conflicts are resolved to promote cooperation is a key step along the path to a full understanding of how altruism and cooperation can be favoured in the face of self-interest. The key finding took several years to pin down using our experimental method, but was published in PNAS in January 2014. This represents the culmination of the grant outcomes. However, we are currently using the long-term data collected over the 7 years of the experiment to test new hypotheses about the effect of reproductive competition (which was experimentally manipulated during the grant period) on behaviour and life history. We anticipate further important outputs as we analyse this long-term dataset. Environment,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
