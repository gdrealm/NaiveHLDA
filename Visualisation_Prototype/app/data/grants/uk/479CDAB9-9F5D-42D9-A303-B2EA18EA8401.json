Clearly the microscopic structure of a tissue is vital to its function. For example, how nerve cells are connected together and arranged underlies brain function. How muscles cells are aligned determines how a muscle will contract. \n\nLooking at a section of tissue under the microscope reveals information about its structure but it is limited by the scattering of visible light and thus only the surface can be examined in any detail. This can be overcome, to a limited degree, by using infrared light combined with a specific form of microscopy termed DIC that uses polarised light. This allows the experimentalist to see deeper into the tissue, to a depth of around a tenth of a millimetre, and produces an image that appears falsely three-dimensional because opposite edges of components in the tissue are highlighted or darkened, as if illuminated from the side and casting a shadow. Any deeper structures are not visible as the light is too badly scattered, producing a diffuse image. \n\nDIC microscopy is a standard technique that is routinely used to identify nerve and muscle cells by eye for electrical recording in physiology laboratories. However there is a vast amount of information contained within the images produced by DIC microscopy that cannot be readily used due to the difficulty in training computers to recognize and automatically analyse the false three-dimensional images. Gathering and analysing this information would significantly increase experimental efficiency and thus minimise the quantity of human and animal tissue required for these sorts of experimental procedures. \n\nWe propose to optimise the DIC-imaging method using simple and inexpensive modifications of the imaging hardware and then use mathematical and computer analyses to extract information from multiple images allowing for the three-dimensional reconstruction of tissue structure. By utilising the rapid speed of graphical processors designed for game-oriented personal computers, we aim to develop software that will transform the DIC imaging data on-line so that it can be used by the experimenter to efficiently target specific cell types for recording. Such methods will be of great value to academics but also to the medical profession and to industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M020231/1","grantId":"BB/M020231/1","fundValue":"142402","fundStart":"2015-05-05","fundEnd":"2016-12-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Magnus  Richardson","coPersons":["Anatoly  Shmygol","Till  Bretschneider","Mark  Wall"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
