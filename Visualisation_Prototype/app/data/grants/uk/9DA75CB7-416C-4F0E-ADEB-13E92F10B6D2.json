It would be very useful if the molecular machinery that is responsible for these processes could be incorporated in man-made devices. However, biological molecules are fragile when taken out of their natural biological environment (the cell). We propose to develop gels, essentially water that is immobilised and structured by the incorporation of network of fibres with a precise molecular composition, that stabilise these biological molecules and allow them to be used in devices. The resulting technology will combine the advantages of biological systems (highly efficient and fully renewable) with those of synthetic materials (simple, low-cost and robust). Ultimately, we hope to use this technology to incorporate biology's energy supply mechanism, photosynthetic systems into gel particles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021113/1","grantId":"BB/J021113/1","fundValue":"110362","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rein  Ulijn","coPersons":["Richard John  Cogdell","Neil Terence Hunt"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
