{"id":"5C4D5DA2-F6A3-47B8-A3A7-EAABB976D5EF","title":"A trial to study the effect on breast cancer mortality of annual mammographic screening starting at age 40","abstractText":"At the time this trial began the NHS breast screening programme (NHSBSP) invited women aged 50-64 for screening by mammography every three years, although the upper age limit has now been extended to age 70. At this time results from previous trials had not shown any benefit from screening at younger ages, but none of these trials had been designed to look specifically at the benefit of screening in different age-groups. It is also likely that screening needs to be more frequent in younger women in order to be effective, as cancers may be more difficult to detect and may develop more quickly. \n\nThe aim of this trial is to determine the additional benefit of annual mammographic screening from age 40 in reducing deaths from breast cancer, compared with starting screening from age 50. The trial is taking place in 23 screening units in the UK. A total of 160,000 women aged \n40â€“41 have been randomly allocated to a study group offered screening, or to a control group who are not invited. All women in both arms are eligible for the NHS Breast Screening Programme which currently invites women for the first time between the ages of 50 and 52","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9000793","grantId":"G9000793","fundValue":"1839110","fundStart":"1990-07-30","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Moss","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
