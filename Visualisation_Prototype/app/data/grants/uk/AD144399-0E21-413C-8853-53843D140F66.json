This grant will allow us to deal with rapidly growing data collections, and permit us to seek rarer and more subtle new physics effects; and will allow us to test new physics models by designing future experiments, which may also led to potential developments of use to commerce and industry.\nFuture long baseline neutrino experiments, including LBNE, are all investigating low temperature detectors. The cryogenic presure vessel system requested will allow Lancaster to engage in device development and testing within this programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003325/1","grantId":"ST/L003325/1","fundValue":"22864","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Roger William Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
