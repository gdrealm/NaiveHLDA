Mitochondria are essential subcellular compartments, present within all animal cells that consume oxygen and generate chemical energy. When cellular oxygen levels change, an &quot;oxygen-sensor&quot; called HIF-1alpha increases and switches on specific genes in the nucleus. We have discovered a human gene (CHCHD4) that encodes two mitochondrial proteins that interact with HIF-1alpha. Furthermore, we have also found that HIF-1alpha protein localizes with mitochondria in cells. We have previously shown that CHCHD4 proteins are essential for regulating the amount of HIF-1alpha protein available in the cell when cells experience low oxygen levels (hypoxia). This is important, because high levels of HIF-1alpha are associated with several human diseases including heart and kidney disease, stroke and cancer, where hypoxia is a key contributing factor to the pathology and severity of the disease. The role of HIF-1alpha protein localization with mitochondria and binding to CHCHD4 protein is not known. Thus, the proposed work will explore the molecular interface between HIF-1alpha and mitochondria with specific focus on the role of the HIF-alpha:CHCHD4 interaction in regulating mitochondrial function and metabolism in tumour cells. This work will help us identify novel mechanisms for how tumour cells adapt to their hypoxia microenvironment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K002201/1","grantId":"MR/K002201/1","fundValue":"402878","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Ashcroft","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
