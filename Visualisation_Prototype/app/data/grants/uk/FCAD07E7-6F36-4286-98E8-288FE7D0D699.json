{"id":"FCAD07E7-6F36-4286-98E8-288FE7D0D699","title":"Nanowells and Nanocages for High Throughput Protein Recognition","abstractText":"Biosensors are an integral and increasingly important part of modern biomedicine and new developments in biosensor technologies are increasingly seeing their application in the process industry, security, environmental and biodefense application markets. We seek to address the limitations of current anti-body based diagnostics and we propose the development of a radical new nanotechnology for high throughput electronic recognition of proteins. While there are some moves to develop nanotechnology approaches to biosensing, these have yet to make a mark and there remains an unmet need in the development of lab-on-chip biosensors that are affordable, integrated, fast, capable of multiplexed detection and monitoring, and highly sensitive which can detect trace levels of analyte. This proposal directly addresses these issues. \n\nNB this summary is necessarily brief to avoid potential issues of disclosure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L017865/1","grantId":"BB/L017865/1","fundValue":"117686","fundStart":"2014-05-31","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joshua Benno Edel","coPersons":["Anthony Edward Cass","Geoffrey  Baldwin"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
