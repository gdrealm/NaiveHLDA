Engaging shoppers in Manchester","abstractText":"<p>Shoppers at the ASDA-Walmart Supercentre (Eastlands, Manchester) on 12 or 15 March were not confronted by food adverts at the store entrance but a six foot high image of the brain! This was all part of the ‘Brain Activity Stand’ being run by young scientists from the University of Manchester as part of National Science and Brain Awareness Week.</p>\n\n<p>More than 20 scientists, from undergraduate to lecturer, from the Faculty of Life Sciences and School of Psychological Sciences braved the elements to help the visiting shoppers ‘make sense of their brain’. Participants tested their sense of smell and saw whether it brought back fond, or not so fond, memories. They stared in disbelief when colours appeared on a spinning black and white disk, tried their best at catching plastic fish while using only one eye and found out if their finger tip or forearm was more sensitive. They also got to take apart a model brain and learn which sense each part was linked with.</p>\n\n<p>The event was a huge success and a brain stress ball was the reward for anyone taking part!</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0077","grantId":"RES-168-26-0077","fundValue":"1550","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This funding supported a series of public engagement events.
