{"id":"34D801C0-8482-45EB-8E9C-5DEA8A3D6C3E","title":"Understanding the impact of severe wildfires on moorland carbon dynamics","abstractText":"The spring of 2011 saw an unprecedented number of large wildfires break out across the length and breadth of the UK. These fires were associated with a prolonged period of unusually warm and dry weather that led to flammable vegetation, dry peat soils and the potential for severe ecological impacts. Wildfires can cause significant damage to ecosystem function, particularly in areas of high severity where ground-level layers of moss and peat deposits are extensively heated or ignited. Smouldering combustion in layers of peat releases significant amounts of fossil carbon and can have a profound effect on total UK emmissions. Smoulering and extensive soil heating also destroys belowground plant structures and soil seedbanks leading to fundamental changes in patterns of plant and wildlife biodiversity, the loss of moorland habitats and a potential imbalance between the carbon lost from burnt vegetation and that which can be sequesterd by regeneration. Severe fires are also associated with a range of other environmental impacts such as increased soil erosion. Despite the serious environmental consequences of such impacts, almost all of the scientific knowledge of the impacts of moorland wildfires comes from a single event some 35 years ago. There is increasing concern about potential feedbacks between climate, fire frequency, fire severity and carbon fluxes from peatlands. For this reason there is an urgent need to ensure we develop sustainable management practices with regards to moorland biodiversity and carbon stores. This research will play an important role in beginning to fill this fundamental knowledge gap on the impacts of wildfires on UK moorlands. We will visit and assess the immediate impact of recent severe wildfires across the UK, and collect data to allow an initial comparison to be made of the effects of varying burn severities on the above and below ground carbon balance and ecosystem functioning of moorlands. We will map the perimeter of recent wildfires and the distribution of broad classes of fire severity. In areas of differing severity we will make estimates of the total amount of carbon lost from the system due to combustion and assess differences in vegetation regeneration and carbon fluxes from peat in burnt and unburnt plots. By establishing a network of permanent plots, the project will also create a valuable scientific resource that will allow us to track ecosystem change over time and provide a focus for future research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J006289/1","grantId":"NE/J006289/1","fundValue":"51865","fundStart":"2011-10-04","fundEnd":"2013-04-03","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Use of the results of our study are current at an early date as preparation of our data for formal publication is still in progress. Our work has, however, been presented a number of scientific and stakeholder events and has attracted considerable interest. This has led to the PI being invited to give keynote addresses at recent and forthcoming conferences. The Project PI has also been invited to usse his expertise to help inform the on-going review of prescribed burning regulations in Scotland as well as to provide advice and input to the work of the Scottish, and England and Wales, Wildfire forums. Research on peatland carbon dynamics in response to wildfire is at a comparatively early stage globally and the work stemming from this project has attracted international interest. We anticipate that our work will continue to inform attitudes to the sustainable use of fire on peatlands and the importance of managing fire impacts with respect to the carbon cycle. Nationally the work helps oush forward the argument that a system to forecast the potential for damaging wildfires could be developed with only moderate research investment.

We developed a semi-quantitative methology that allowed us to assess fire severity after the event. \n\nFire severity varied significantly both within and between individual fires. Interestingly average severity varied up to two-fold between fires but as much as three-fold within some fires. \n\nThere was a significant degree of variation in fuel consumption. Consumption varied significantly between plots within fires but there was limited evidence of a significance difference in average consumption between fires.\n\nSubstantial differences were recorded in average soil temperature between burnt and unburnt plots. Day-night temperature fluctuations in burnt plots were frequently more than twice that seen in unburnt plots. This has significant implications for modelling the lostt of carbon from peatland soils.\n\nBoth carbon dioxoide and methane production were noticeably different between burnt and unburnt plots but substantial differences also existed between different fires. Methane fluxes were consistently lower on burnt sites whilst carbon dioxide fluxes were generally higher. Intense fire behaviour in the shrub and grass fuels that dominate the British uplands has distracted attention from what appears to be the critical issue â€“ the structure and moisture content of ground fuels. Our work lends support to suggestions that a useful wildland fire dangaer rating system, that forecasts the potential for damaging wildfires, could be developed if models of fuel moisture content can be developed. Such models do already exist and would only need adjustment/ground-truthing for use in peatland conditions Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
