This is made possible by very rapid interhemispheric transfer, which permits &quot;early-integration&quot; of the hemispheres. Recently, however, it’s been claimed that word recognition starts prior to interhemispheric transfer, with each half of the brain trying to guess the word’s identity based on the letters to which it has access (the &quot;late-integration&quot; account). </p>\n\n<p>This project involves three experiments that will test this idea by measuring readers' reaction times to isolated words. By varying where readers fixate within a word it is possible to manipulate both the amount and usefulness of information to which each hemisphere has access in the earliest stages of processing. The standard (&quot;early-integration&quot;) account predicts no effect of this difference in the input to the two hemispheres, whereas the &quot;late-integration&quot; account predicts that reaction times will be slower when the inputs to individual hemispheres are less informative.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2662","grantId":"RES-000-22-2662","fundValue":"81462","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marc  Brysbaert","coPersons":["Colin  Davis"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
