{"id":"5C316EF5-8EF5-4A36-BBC6-BD78A48188FF","title":"Combined Heat and Photo Voltaics (CHPV)","abstractText":"The Combined Heat and Photo-voltaic (CHPV) based local energy system solution was formulated on the simple, but\neffective observation that CHP systems develop low carbon and energy efficient electrical power in the colder months of\nthe year in the UK and Photo-voltaic (PV) power generation provides most of its low carbon power generation when there is\nno demand for heat in commercial buildings. By combining these two primary energy supplies, it is potentially feasible to\ncreate a LES which is autonomous to the national electricity grid by appropriate sizing of the CHP and PV systems. That\nsaid the supply and demand is highly transient and the use of energy storage and advanced control systems and other\ndemand side measures such as Smart DC systems for lighting and ICT networks will enable accurate supply and demand\nmatching for both heat and power. This potential LES solution is highly attractive to industry partners in the CHPV project\nsuch as Peel Utilities, BRE and ARUP. The system potentially offers a high return-on-infrastructure investment (ROI),\nhowever it is extremely complex to design to ensure that this ROI can be reliably achieved in practice. In order to assist in\nthe design and implementation of CHPV based LES systems the following research needs to be carried out:\nTask 1: Dr J. Counsell with the research assistant will develop ESL based models for the energy supply and demand\nsystems such as CHP and PV and the already developed through BRE Trust R&amp;D funded projects IDEAS dynamic\nmodelling of buildings and there energy using systems. The researcher will be able to draw on existing models within the\nEEE department for PV and other micro-generation systems at Liverpool to rapidly develop comprehensive nonlinear dynamic models for both energy supply and energy demand in the buildings served by the CHPV based LES. (refer\nreferences in Appendix A of the main TSB proposal for references of past modelling work)\nTask 2: Led by Dr Lin Jiang the researcher will use the ESL models resulting from task 1 to develop nonlinear optimal\ncontrol solutions to guarantee supply and demand matching with the constraints of satisfying thermal comfort requirements\nin the buildings and the minimising the power drawn for the national power grid. The research will need new nonlinear\ninverse dynamic control algorithms developed by Dr Counsell (refer Appendix A for references) and nonlinear optimal\ncontrol strategies for demand side management systems developed by Dr Lin Jiang (refer Appendix A for references).\nThese control algorithms will also be modelled and used in simulation studies to prove the effective regulation of the\nautomated CHPV systems.\nTask 3: Led By Dr Lin Jiang, the researcher will create the ESL models and tuned control algorithms for each of the three\ncase studies in this project.\nTask 4: Dr Counsell will lead the application of the resulting case study models in partnership with Peel, BRE and ARUP to\ntest a number of demand side measures including Smart DC systems for LED lighting and ICT networks and devices. The\ntests will establish the energy, carbon and economic benefits that Smart DC systems will bring to the CHPV based LES\nsolution and the models for Smart DC systems will be validated using the EEE department's new Smart DC PoE Network\nlaboratory now under construction.\nThe lead academics and the researcher will engage with BRE and the BRE Trust to hold industry/academic research\nworkshops and create high quality journal and BRE Trust publications as well as hold workshops to disseminate the\neffectiveness of the CHPV concept. The resulting project outputs such as design tools from the university will also be\ndisseminated to the wider LES community. It will also investigate the potential for the design tools to be used as part of\npotentially new regulatory frameworks which are being developed outside this project for local energy systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507192/1","grantId":"EP/M507192/1","fundValue":"179750","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lin  Jiang","coPersons":["JOHN MARK COUNSELL"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
