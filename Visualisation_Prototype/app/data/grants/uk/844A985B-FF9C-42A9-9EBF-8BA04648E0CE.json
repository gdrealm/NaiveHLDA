Motivational contexts are established through learning processes that allow associations between motivationally salient (rewarding or punishing) events and specific external stimuli (called incentive cues) to become established in the brain.</p>\n\n<p>It is well known that such associations enable incentive cues to arouse and enhance motivational states, such as hunger. However, emerging evidence from our lab and others suggests that these associations may also have a direct and powerful effect on visual cognition, especially visual selective attention and visual working memory. Such cognitive effects may heighten stimulus-driven control over motivation, increasing the likelihood of inappropriate or unhealthy behavioural choices. We aim to explore, quantify, and understand these basic effects and the mechanisms that produce them. The project will involve conducting laboratory experiments on healthy adults and adolescents and will combine behavioural and electrophysiological techniques.</p>\n&nbsp;","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000210/1","grantId":"ES/L000210/1","fundValue":"366751","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We are early into our grant term so it is not obvious to us how our research has had impact so far.

We also find that people differ in their propensity to be attracted to these cues and that this may be related to personality. Our findings may eventually be of use for understanding mechanisms of addiction, obesity, depression and other disorders of motivation and for developing interventions. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
