It will make use of legal and financial datasets to carry out time-series and panel data analysis capable of specifying causal links between legal institutions and economic development.</p>\n\n<p>The fieldwork will focus on the role played in each country by the banking sector and capital markets as sources of finance for firms, and on how government reconciles or combines its continuing role as owner of financial and industrial enterprise with its emerging role as a regulator of banks and securities markets.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J012491/1","grantId":"ES/J012491/1","fundValue":"520526","fundStart":"2013-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They are being considered by international bodies and organisations and by the governments of the case study countries.
