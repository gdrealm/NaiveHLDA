Our research program is in mathematical analysis of discrete dynamical systems. We aim to study nonlinear models expressed by the differential advanced-delay equations, difference equations and partial differential equations in the context of applications to photonic band-gap engineering, nonlinear optics, and atomic physics of Bose-Einstein condensates. The research program consists of several specific goals (problems): (1) derivation of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the coupled-mode (Dirac) system, (2) persistence of traveling waves in discrete lattices, and (3) bifurcations and stability of three-dimensional discrete vortices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D069513/1","grantId":"EP/D069513/1","fundValue":"19992","fundStart":"2007-01-30","fundEnd":"2007-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our paper has 16 citations according to Google Scholar Other ","person":"Robert Sinclair MacKay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":" We attempted to prove existence of breathers in lattices in a context close to continuum.
