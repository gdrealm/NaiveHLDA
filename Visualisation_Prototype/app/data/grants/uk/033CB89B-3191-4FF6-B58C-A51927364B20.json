The cytokine that is the subject of this study is called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which directly affects T cells and has been shown to play a central role in the development and function of several components of the immune system. IL-2 exerts its effect by mobilizing specialized intracellular proteins in T cells, called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), whose ultimate function is to reprogramme gene expression allowing the responding cell to make an appropriate biological response. STAT proteins critically control the life and death decisions of T cells and consequently are often deleteriously altered in human cancers such as leukamias and lymphomas. We recently described the aberrant function of one member of this family, namely Stat5, in malignant T cells from a common human skin-related cancer called Sezary Syndrome. We found T cells from patients showed a breakdown of the processes, which in healthy individuals maintains this protein in two different structural forms; one of which positively affects gene expression, while the other has a negative effect. The inhibitory form of the protein is predominantly expressed in cancer cells leading to deleterious consequences on IL-2-activated gene expression. In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanisms that control the generation and activity of Stat5 proteins in normal human T cells. By studying how these processes differ in normal versus cancer cells, we hope to gain a better understanding of not only normal T cell function but also how it is dysregulated in cancer. These studies may also inform on possible therapeutic approaches for T cell malignancy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400197","grantId":"G0400197","fundValue":"408761","fundStart":"2005-05-23","fundEnd":"2011-05-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  John","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
