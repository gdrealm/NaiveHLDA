They are distinct in ways that have a relevance to teaching and learning, including questions related to attention span and information searching patterns. At the same time universities in the UK have been exploring a more extensive use of e-learning. The policy direction emphasises learnersâ€™ needs and aspirations but we have little empirical evidence of the changing student population. This research will aim to explore students coming from the Net generation as they first encounter e-learning at university.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;The aim of the research is to provide an empirically based understanding of the Net Generation as they enter university. The research will use a mixture of survey methods, interview and observation to achieve the following objectives:\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n <li>To explore their attitudes, expectations and experience of e-learning at university.</li>\n <li>To explore any linkages between their prior exposure to gaming and digital networked technology and their expressed attitudes towards and experience of e-learning.</li>\n <li>To investigate the use of social software</li>\n <li>To develop the theoretical basis for understanding any generational changes</li>\n <li>To provide timely evidence based advice for policy makers, teaching staff and administrators</li>\n</ol>\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0971","grantId":"RES-062-23-0971","fundValue":"296892","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Richard Jones","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
