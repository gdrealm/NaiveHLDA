Mice naturally avoid disturbance and rely heavily on smells for communication. So it is not surprising that cage-cleaning, which involves handling and the removal of home-cage odours, elicits many responses that indicate that they find it unpleasant. However, regular cage-cleaning is necessary to prevent high ammonia levels, which can cause health problems. \nWe are investigating whether reducing cage-cleaning frequency (fortnightly vs. weekly) and providing ‘low-ammonia’ (vs. standard) bedding helps to improve welfare without adversely affecting health. We are assessing the effects of these factors in two commonly used mouse strains – BALB/c and C57BL/6 – via non-invasive physiological and behavioural welfare indicators and analysis of ammonia-related nasal and lung tissue damage. We are also collaborating with a commercial breeding facility to assess whether cage-cleaning frequency affects the reproductive output of breeding females.\nThe results of this research will enable us to make recommendations about cage-cleaning practices most benefit mice, by optimising their well-being and health; scientists (and ultimately the general public), by improving the validity of mice as research models; and commercial facilities, by improving their productivity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300112","grantId":"G0300112","fundValue":"218037","fundStart":"2004-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marian Stamp Dawkins","coPersons":["Georgia J.
