{"id":"9FB9F7E0-41A3-487F-BFAD-8932DC208ABF","title":"Scottish Graduate Programme in Economics PhD Training Sequence","abstractText":"<p>The Scottish Graduate Programme in Economics (SGPE), formerly known as the Scottish Doctoral Programme, was established in 1989. Its main objective is to provide post-graduate education in economics. It is a collaborative arrangement between the Departments/Subject-units of Economics at the following eight Scottish Universities: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot Watt, Stirling, Strathclyde and St Andrews. Currently the five Scottish post-1992 universities are not included in the programme.</p> \n<p>The SGPE PhD Training Sequence is a three-year programme aimed at providing additional training in economics primarily for Scottish-based PhD students. There are two main aims. The first is to close the gap in both the quality and quantity of training received by SGPE PhD students compared to their North American counterparts. The second is to provide an opportunity for PhD students enrolled at other UK institutions to receive advanced training in economics. These aims will be achieved through a series of multi-day workshops.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006167/1","grantId":"ES/E006167/1","fundValue":"104579","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Edward Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
