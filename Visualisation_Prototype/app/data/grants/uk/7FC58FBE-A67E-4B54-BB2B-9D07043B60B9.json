{"id":"7FC58FBE-A67E-4B54-BB2B-9D07043B60B9","title":"IDEAS Factory - Detecting Terrorist Activities: Clothing simulations","abstractText":"This research will look at the effects of walking on the movement of clothing in terms of how the fibres move relative to each other and what effect this has on the clothing in general. The different ways in which people move will be considered because we all move differently. The results will enable a detailed investigation of how different fabrics are affected by the various degrees of movement that are exhibited when people wearing clothes made out of them move around. Fibre fatigue and creasing will be considered in relation to the looks and practical feel of garments made out of the various fabrics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H023062/1","grantId":"EP/H023062/1","fundValue":"408452","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David M Howard","coPersons":["Ben  Dalton","Chris  Rowland"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
