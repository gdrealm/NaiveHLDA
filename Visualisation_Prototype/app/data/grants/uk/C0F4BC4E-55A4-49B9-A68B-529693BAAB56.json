This question underlies one of the most fundamental issues in linguistic research today and is one on which there is currently no consensus. My research on the Slavonic language suggests that whereas case endings themselves do not have meaning, they are linked to something meaningful, namely aspect. My findings not only shed on the nature of some of the most puzzling case-marking alterations in the Slavonic languages, they also have potential to help us resolve some of the most problematic aspect of linguistic (syntactic) theory, as it is currently formulated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112751/1","grantId":"112751/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kylie  Richardson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
