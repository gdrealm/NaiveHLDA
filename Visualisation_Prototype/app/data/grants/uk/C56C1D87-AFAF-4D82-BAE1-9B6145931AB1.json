{"id":"C56C1D87-AFAF-4D82-BAE1-9B6145931AB1","title":"Environmental Sustainability, Civil Society and Corporate Citizenship in the Russian Federation.","abstractText":"<p>This project examines the hitherto under researched area of environmental sustainability in the Russian Federation. Using both corporate citizenship and civil society frameworks, it seeks to shed light on the behaviour of profit and non-profit organisations in response to both the legacy of the Elt'sin era, including pollution intensification and the creation of influential oligarchs, and a number of key policy and economic developments enacted by the Putin administration.</p>\n\n<p>On assuming the presidency, Putin enacted a 'dirty recovery' policy, focusing on natural resource and heavy industry to facilitate an economic revival. This policy, while controversial, opened up Russia's natural resource and heavy industrial markets to international competition. In order to ease its passage however, Putin abolished Russia's State Environmental Protection Ministry, and enacted a law to limit the activity of both domestic and overseas pressure groups.</p>\n\n<p>Thus this project investigates the ability of the market to substitute for the regulator, influential business elites, in promoting environmental sustainability within Russian firms? It will also investigate the impact of Putin's NGO law on the environmental movement, and its ability to influence both firm behaviour and regulation in the area of environmental sustainability and pollution control.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0002-A","grantId":"RES-061-25-0002-A","fundValue":"42980","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jo  Crotty","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
