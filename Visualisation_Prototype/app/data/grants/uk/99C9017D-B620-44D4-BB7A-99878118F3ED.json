We will use a unique marriage of concepts extracted from ultrasonics and photonics that are intrinsically generic in applicability. This new field will deliver unprecedented accuracy and control for delivery, together with improved efficacy and selectivity, and a much reduced risk of infection. This research will lead to a quantum leap for biologists who are studying the cell's chemical pathways or signals (cellular signal transduction) through to histological/clinical approaches. For example within a population of cells it will be possible to target each cell individually, introducing foreign biological material into any cell. This is central for studies in numerous human diseases. By the use of fibre optic delivery and endoscopes, we envisage that the realisation of this basic technology may allow us to develop a non-invasive surgical technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D048958/1","grantId":"EP/D048958/1","fundValue":"1041640","fundStart":"2006-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  In generating IP, and opening dialogue with the global leader in rotating mirror camera production, Cordin in Salt Lake City Utah, we have moved into the possibility of licensing our patented technology arising from this grant Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education Cultural","person":"Paul Andrew Campbell","coPersons":["Alfred  Cuschieri","Mervyn John  Rose","Aleksandar  Jovanovic"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":" This project aimed to push the limits of microbubbles excitation for medical application, principally for molecular delivery, but also to create a means of ablative therapy, and also to test the concept of light production from violently cavitating bubbles. \nWe proved that light from microscopic bubbles that were excited using ultrasound energy could be harnessed for real practical use, even at high (body) temperature.\nWe also demonstrated that light could be used to trap and control microscopic bubble ensembles.\nWe also developed a new and enhanced means of imaging in the sub microsecond framing regime. patents arising have been generated and may be licensed to Cordin. Discussions to that end have already occurred with CTO Cordin.\nA new grant was also successful to the Wellcome Trust fro some ?5.9m. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
