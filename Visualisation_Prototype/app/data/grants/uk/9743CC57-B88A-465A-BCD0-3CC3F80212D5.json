For this to occur, cell has to accomplish two major tasks a) Duplicate the DNA ( DNA replication) b) Segregate the duplicated DNA molecules equally to the 2 daughter cells( chromosome segregation). Mistakes in either process can lead to cancer and disease in humans. Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins is a family of proteins conserved from bacteria to humans and essential for accurate chromosome segregation.. Members of the SMC family play crucial roles in organizing the higher order structure of chromosomes. But the precise function of these proteins are poorly understood. Our research aims to uncover the function of this important class of proteins using the 'baker's yeast' as the model system. Since cell division is vital for all forms of life mechanisms that mediate high-fidelity chromosome segregation are generally conserved from yeast to humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G00353X/1","grantId":"BB/G00353X/1","fundValue":"635664","fundStart":"2009-04-29","fundEnd":"2013-08-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Prakash  Arumugam","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
