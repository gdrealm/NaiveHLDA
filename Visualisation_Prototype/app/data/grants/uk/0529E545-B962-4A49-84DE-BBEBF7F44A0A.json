Developments in technology and in access to technology, and the emergence of a knowledge-based economy necessitate an understanding of the plurality of spaces (such as homes, workplaces, international space and cyberspace) within which learning can take place, as well as diverse definitions of contemporary ‘education’. The spaces of policy making around education are also being transformed, away from traditional centres of policy formation towards incorporating a wider range of actors and sites. These changes coincide with a more general interest in ‘space’ and ‘spatial theory’ across the social sciences, where notions of ‘simultaneity’ and ‘diversity’ replace more modernist conceptions of linear progress and development through time. To date, however, education theorists and policymakers have rarely engaged with geographers in tackling questions of space in relation to education and learning. Consequently, a crucial interdisciplinary understanding of these new and emergent spaces of education is missing.</p>\n\n<p>Through this seminar series, we addressed this gap in our understanding, gathering together an interdisciplinary, international team of academics as well as a number of practitioners and policymakers.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0584","grantId":"RES-451-26-0584","fundValue":"11562","fundStart":"2009-06-11","fundEnd":"2010-07-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  Brooks","coPersons":["Alison  Fuller","John  Holford","Johanna Lesley Waters"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
