One cause of this is the concern over health effects of global climate change. Another is the emergence, mostly as a by-product of studies of air pollution and health, of evidence pointing to substantial importance of weather in causing poor health â€“ in particular events such as death or admission to hospitalisation. Although variation in health according to season have long been known, the details of this relationship remain only partly understood.\nStudies to estimate health effects of weather and of climate change depend heavily on complex statistical methods. These are currently poorly developed, so we propose in this research project to improve them. \nThis research will improve the ability of future studies to identify with confidence the effects of weather and climate. Improving this knowledge will help us develop policies to reduce effects of weather and future changes in climate on our health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701030","grantId":"G0701030","fundValue":"324962","fundStart":"2008-09-10","fundEnd":"2011-12-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Benedict  Armstrong","coPersons":["Paul  Wilkinson","Shakoor  Hajat","Michael Giles Kenward"],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
