The aim of this project is to develop a new version of MOSAIC that learns from utterances represented as strings of stressed and unstressed syllables (rather than strings of words), and to use this version of the model to simulate a wider range of phenomena and a wider range of languages than has been possible hitherto. MOSAIC will be extended in two ways. First, syllabified dictionaries will be used to convert corpora of orthographically coded utterances into sequences of stressed and unstressed syllables. Second, mechanisms will be added to the model that allow it to represent the syllables in the utterances that it learns with different degrees of strength as a function of their frequency and salience in the input. The new version of the model will then be used to simulate patterns of tense-marking and utterance-internal omission errors in five Indo-European languages (English, Dutch, German, Spanish and French), and patterns of verb-marking error in two agglutinative Central American languages (K’iche’ Mayan and Q’anjob’al).\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G002282/1","grantId":"ES/G002282/1","fundValue":"321757","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have informed theories of typical and atypical language development Other Cultural","person":"Julian Mark Pine","coPersons":["Daniel  Freudenthal","Fernand  Gobet"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" We have developed a computer model that can simulate the pattern of verb-marking errors in European languages including English, Dutch, German, French and Spanish as well as a very different language of Central America: K'iche' Mayan Our findings could be used to explain the pattern of verb-marking in children with SLI Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
