Welds of high temperature steels such as austenitic steels and Inconel have stiffness properties which are typically both anisotropic and inhomogeneous, so that ultrasonic wave rays tend to deviate and scatter. This results in inaccurate interpretation of defect sizes. Knowledge of weld maps which describe how the material properties vary throughout the weld, applied to wave propagation models, would allow array images to be corrected to compensate for the deviations of the rays. Work at Manchester University will investigate how weld maps can be constructed, using sectioning, experimental measurements, and materials modelling. Work at Imperial College will investigate the use of ultrasonic array measurements in order to measure such maps non-destructively. The findings will be combined to create a procedure to correct array images to enable accurate sizing of the defects. The work will be done in collaboration with two industrial companies who will both provide realistic weld specimens.The proposal is being submitted within the UK Research Centre in NDE (RCNDE) to the targeted research programme, the funding for which is earmarked by EPSRC for industrially driven research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G045720/1","grantId":"EP/G045720/1","fundValue":"168052","fundStart":"2010-02-28","fundEnd":"2012-08-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  At completion of the project a package for industrial deployment was prepared and delivered to the industrial partners. This package included software codes and instructions for their use. Users of this package should be able to adapt their own array imaging of inhomogeneous welds such that they can correct for the inhomogeneity in their imaging of defects in welds, and thus achieve much improved location and characterisation of defects. The package is currently being used by one partner, and the other two partners are both planning to use it. The delivered capabilities were also offered to any other interested parties by a well-attended Technology Readiness Level (TRL) workshop, run by the UK Research Centre for NDE Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy Economic","person":"Michael  Lowe","coPersons":["Peter  Cawley"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Welds in many safety-critical components, such as nuclear power plant, are made of materials that deviate the path of ultrasound rays that are being used to inspect them. This causes errors in ultrasonic images and consequent errors in sizing and locating defects. This project delivered a non-destructive methodology to measure stiffness maps of weld materials using array measurements, that can then be used to correct the images. The practical output is ready for deployment in industry, and this is happening. The research output could be used for further development of weld inspection techniques. Possibilities for a European project to do this are being pursued. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","dataset":"gtr"}
