As a starting point to achieving societal impact, however, the objectives of this project and their relevance to those in clinical and educational sectors were presented to these users (and the general public) at Psychology at BU (May, 2010); an event held to showcase developments in psychological research and consultancy at Bournemouth University. We have also developed a website (www.featurebindinglab.org) detailing our findings and associated outputs. We are currently extending our program of research to include the study of memory processes in cognitive ageing - a line of investigation that has potential future impact.

The project drew on a proposed analogy between the spotlight of visual attention (studied in the visual selective attention literature) and a single-item focus of attention hypothesised in memory that selects stored information for further processing. We investigated four main themes: (1) Does the focus of attention select from features or objects? (2) Is the focus of attention sensitive to the spatial distance between to-be-retrieved features? (3) Is the focus of attention sensitive to the temporal distance between to-be-retrieved features? (4) Of these two means of structuring information (spatial and temporal), which is the most dominant? A series of behavioural studies used adaptations of a change-detection task (Prabhakaran et al., 2000) where participants were asked to remember the colour and shape of coloured shape objects presented on screen, then judge whether the features of a test probe (a coloured shape) had been presented to them, regardless of their original combination in the memory display. Critically, in cases where features were re-combined from separate objects to form the probe, we manipulated 1) the spatial distance between the objects they were sampled from; 2) the temporal distance between the objects they were sampled from; or 3) both spatial and temporal distance.\n\n\n\nOur results indicated that performance was superior when to-be-retrieved features were initially presented as part of the same object relative to where they were sampled from distinct objects, suggesting the selection of bound objects rather than individual features. Furthermore, increasing the spatial distance between the objects that features were sampled from negatively influenced retrieval performance (demonstrating a 'spatial distance effect'), a finding compatible with a single-item focus of attention scanning a memory representation preserving the metric spatial relations between objects, echoing earlier imagery work (Kossyln et al., 1978) in a task where spatial location was never task-relevant. \n\n\n\nWe then explored the possibility of a 'temporal distance effect' when coloured shape objects were presented sequentially in a central location. While we found evidence for surface-feature binding there was no additional performance cost associated with retrieving temporally distant relative to temporally proximal object features, suggesting that the focus of attention does not, by default, re-enact the order of encoding during retrieval.\n\n\n\nFinally, when spatial and temporal distance manipulations were combined in a single experiment we again failed to find evidence for a temporal distance effect, but here the spatial distance effect was absent too. This suggests that presenting objects sequentially reduced the possibility of forming a spatial configuration of items to be scanned by the focus of attention. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, we examined whether surface-feature bindings are supported by attentional resources. Drawing on one point of difference between existing studies (stimulus presentation time), we found a significant detrimental impact of attentional load on surface-feature binding when the exposure duration was long (2000ms) that was absent when the exposure duration it was short (250ms). This suggests that different binding mechanisms may be evoked based on the time allowed during stimuli encoding. The impact of this work is primarily theoretical (commensurate with the fundamental/theoretical scope of the project), however there are some practical benefits that can be derived from our work in terms of paradigm design. For example, the design of stimulus arrays in simple change-detection tasks often used in memory research should consider the 'spatial distance effect' in order to ensure stimuli are configured in such a way that it does not serve as a potential confound.
