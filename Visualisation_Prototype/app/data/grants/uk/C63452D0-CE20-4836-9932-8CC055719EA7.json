{"id":"C63452D0-CE20-4836-9932-8CC055719EA7","title":"SOCIAM: The Theory and Practice of Social Machines","abstractText":"SOCIAM - Social Machines - will research into pioneering methods of supporting purposeful human interaction on the World Wide Web, of the kind exemplified by phenomena such as Wikipedia and Galaxy Zoo. These collaborations are empowering, as communities identify and solve their own problems, harnessing their commitment, local knowledge and embedded skills, without having to rely on remote experts or governments.\n\nSuch interaction is characterised by a new kind of emergent, collective problem solving, in which we see (i) problems solved by very large scale human participation via the Web, (ii) access to, or the ability to generate, large amounts of relevant data using open data standards, (iii) confidence in the quality of the data and (iv) intuitive interfaces.\n\n&quot;Machines&quot; used to be programmed by programmers and used by users. The Web, and the massive participation in it, has dissolved this boundary: we now see configurations of people interacting with content and each other, typified by social web sites. Rather than dividing between the human and machine parts of the collaboration (as computer science has traditionally done), we should draw a line around them and treat each such assembly as a machine in its own right comprising digital and human components - a Social Machine. This crucial transition in thinking acknowledges the reality of today's sociotechnical systems. This view is of an ecosystem not of humans and computers but of co-evolving Social Machines.\n\nThe ambition of SOCIAM is to enable us to build social machines that solve the routine tasks of daily life as well as the emergencies. Its aim is to develop the theory and practice so that we can create the next generation of decentralised, data intensive, social machines. Understanding the attributes of the current generation of successful social machines will help us build the next.\n\nThe research undertakes four necessary tasks. First, we need to discover how social computing can emerge given that society has to undertake much of the burden of identifying problems, designing solutions and dealing with the complexity of the problem solving. Online scaleable algorithms need to be put to the service of the users. This leads us to the second task, providing seamless access to a Web of Data including user generated data. Third, we need to understand how to make social machines accountable and to build the trust essential to their operation. Fourth, we need to design the interactions between all elements of social machines: between machine and human, between humans mediated by machines, and between machines, humans and the data they use and generate. SOCIAM's work will be empirically grounded by a Social Machines Observatory to track, monitor and classify existing social machines and new ones as they evolve, and act as an early warning facility for disruptive new social machines.\n\nThese lines of interlinked research will initially be tested and evaluated in the context of real-world applications in health, transport, policing and the drive towards open data cities (where all public data across an urban area is linked together) in collaboration with SOCIAM's partners. Putting research ideas into the field to encounter unvarnished reality provides a check as to their utility and durability. For example the Open City application will seek to harness citywide participation in shared problems (e.g. with health, transport and policing) exploiting common open data resources. \n\nSOCIAM will undertake a breadth of integrated research, engaging with real application contexts, including the use of our observatory for longitudinal studies, to provide cutting edge theory and practice for social computation and social machines. It will support fundamental research; the creation of a multidisciplinary team; collaboration with industry and government in realization of the research; promote growth and innovation - most importantly - impact in changing the direction of ICT.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017728/1","grantId":"EP/J017728/1","fundValue":"6219060","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The 2 most significant interactions are:\n1. We have engaged with Hampshire County Council (and through them, Hampshire Constabulary), the Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner, and the College of Policing collaborating on use of the Web Observatory to monitor social media activity and also to specify use cases for a nuisance reporting app. Potential domains for exploitation include: understanding victim experience, witness experience, anti-social behaviour and intelligence gathering.\nThe collaboration with Hampshire County Council has produced a paper presented at a policing conference about the role that social machines technology could play in policing and crime management. Two further papers have been published on measuring the reliability of open crime data, which advanced the state-of-the-art in a highly contested area. \n\n2. Online citizen science is a prominent example of Social Machines. It is a blueprint of a hybrid computing approach, coupling state-of-the-art artificial intelligence with human-based computation, to tackle problems that are impossible to be solved in a purely computational fashion.\nThe Zooniverse, the world's largest multi-project citizen science platform with over one million volunteers contributing to projects from various domains such as astrophysics or digital humanities, is developed and maintained at the University of Oxford. SOCIAM researchers from Southampton and Oxford look deep into the socio-technical process behind Zooniverse projects but also other citizen science platforms such as EyeWire. This is an important cornerstone for the development of observational methods and tools that allow to measure the contributions of individual participants in collective online activities such as citizen science. A fundamental change is underway in the research landscape. Principles from citizen science will heavily be involved in new digital and democratic approaches to pursue science. These will accelerate the creative output of mankind but also change how scientific impact is measured and how funding is managed. SOCIAM acts at the forefront of these developments.

We have defined a formal semantics of our operational specification language, LSC (created in the previous year) and built a theorem prover (using HOL-Lite, a generic theorem proving system) in which to prove properties of LSC specifications. This gives precision on the semantics of our language and provides new opportunities to prove (e.g.) security properties LSC specifications, which is likely to be useful as we move into healthcare applications. Also in security (via a PhD studentship additional to SOCIAM) we have developed an extension of the LSC interpreter that permits security levels to be associated with data transmitted during a social interaction and for &quot;information leakage&quot; between security levels to be detected.\nWith colleagues in Vienna University of Technology, we have produced a model and techniques to allow coordination of human workers in web-scale collaborative human computation systems. The techniques augment the existing Social Compute Unit (SCU) concept - a general framework for management of ad-hoc human worker teams - with versatile coordination protocols expressed using LSC. This approach allows us to combine coordination and quality constraints with dynamic assessments of user desires, while choosing workflow patterns appropriate to the current situation. This extends earlier work on the use of social machines to construct social machines.\nOur system for choreographing social computations using Twitter has been further developed. This has been connected to the Southampton personal data store, allowing joint engineering across process and linked data scenarios. It has also led to the concept of a &quot;shadow institution&quot;, where actions on existing social networks are mapped onto formal interaction protocols, allowing participants access to computational intelligence in a seamless, zero-cost manner to carry out computation and store information. We have merged this with our work on provenance representation (continuing our focus on PROV as a representation language), integrating it with our LSC-based Twitter system. This allows us to derive a restricted range of annotations automatically during LSC-supported interactions and it also allows us to propagate annotations with data introduced through interactions (although it does not by itself solve deeper issues of appropriate provenance merging).\n\n2. Over the past year, our work on decentralised architectures and personal data stores for the Web has focused on maintaining end-user control over personal data, identity, and privacy. Working with the W3C, we achieved interoperability between our INDX platform and their decentralised Linked Data Platform via a fully-functional heterogeneous microblogging application.\n\nA second major focus of this work is end-user management of personal health data, sourced from both clinical (e.g. EHR) and non-clinical (e.g. wearable sensor) sources. We have built a mobile INDX application for atrial fibrillation patients to demonstrate consolidated patient-centred analytics and interventions. Additionally, we are investigating enforcing user-specified Data Terms of Use constraints for expressing and detecting data re-sharing and reuse violations in decentralised settings. This framework will be demonstrated in a public health decentralised digital epidemiology application centred on the INDX personal data store in 2015.\n\n3. The Web Observatory seeks to develop the necessary technical and social infrastructure in order to observe, analyse, and predict behaviour of social machines on the Web. In SOCIAM we have built the necessary computing infrastructure required for real-time and big data analytics, and are actively pursuing new analytical methods for monitoring the state of a social machine. Central to the Web Observatory is the analysis of both historic and real-time sources of data streams in order to understand the characteristics and functionality of a social machine. We are also developing applications and visualisations to monitor and interact with a social machine's signal, and working on techniques to cross-examine activity. \n\nWorking with a number of partner labs, we are leading a network of Web Observatories in order to provide a distributed infrastructure to store, describe, query, and analyse heterogeneous sources of data. As part of this we are actively developing the necessary layers of data description and access control protocols in order to provide data owners control over their data. Our work on Twitter could be translated (with further development effort) into a tool for supporting process-based interaction with the Twitter platform. Our HOL-Lite system could be of relevance to those with an interest in proving properties of interaction protocols (e.g. in our healthcare strand of activity). Our collaborative design system architecture is of relevance to software engineering using distributed teams of engineers.\n\nOur work on INDX has been released as an open source software project on GitHub, and as the platform matures, will work with Web development communities to foster its adoption and use. Additionally, over the next 2 years we expect to trial the health data management platform with NHS patients, as well as work with the private sector, in particular Personal Data Store companies such as CTRLio, and PInCH Medical Systems, to facilitate the creation of similar capabilities in their offerings.\n\nThe Web Observatory provides two major strands of contributions, infrastructure and analytics. The platform is helping shape the way research on the Web is conducted, with the goal of providing an environment where data and tools can be shared. Our efforts in big data will provide the further analytical methods and tools for those researching social machines and more generally, the Web.
