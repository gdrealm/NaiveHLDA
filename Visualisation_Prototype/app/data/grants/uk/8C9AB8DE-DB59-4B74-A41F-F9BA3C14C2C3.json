{"id":"8C9AB8DE-DB59-4B74-A41F-F9BA3C14C2C3","title":"London women and the economy before and after the Black Death","abstractText":"<p>This project will shed light on the transformation of women's status and economic importance across the later Middle Ages. Rapid population growth in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries resulted in high population density, labour oversupply, and low wages, and as consequence most women enjoyed few personal freedoms and low status. In the mid fourteenth century successive outbreaks of epidemic disease reduced the English population by 30-50 per cent over the years 1348-9 and 1360-1. As a result, it has been suggested, acute labour shortages in urban and rural areas afforded women new opportunities as workers, increasing their social standing, particularly in the period 1380-1430. The abundant judicial and testamentary records of medieval London will be used to compare the status and roles of women in the city economy of the 1320s, a period of labour-oversupply and low wages, to the 1420s, a period of labour shortage and high wages. This will involve quantitative analysis of litigation in city and royal courts, as well as qualitative examination in the two sub-periods of the roles and status of women in the society and economy of London. The project will result in the production of articles, plus an online database of legal proceedings.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G031339/1","grantId":"ES/G031339/1","fundValue":"75530","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":" Contrary to the 'Golden Age' hypothesis, in which it has been posited that women benefited economically and socially from post Black Death (1348-9) labour shortages, this study has shown that while women may have enjoyed a modestly enhanced economic position, circa 1350-1450, this did not halt a long-term late-medieval trend towards the diminution of women's social status and freedoms. \n\n\n\nLondon women were 20-30 per cent less likely to litigate in City or Westminster courts circa 1420-60 than they had been circa 1320. However, when London women did litigate in the early to mid-fifteenth century they were roughly 10 per cent more likely to do so in economically orientated suits such as debt or detinue. Together, these contrary trends suggest a disassociation of economic power and social status for later medieval London women. \n\n\n\nA survey of non-London court records reinforces the conclusion that women were 20-30 per cent less likely to be court litigants in the post-plague era than they had been in the pre-plague era. The data and outputs will be of use to local historians, especially historians of London. The project's findings will help to stimulate future comparative research on women and the economy in the pre- and post-Black Death eras.
