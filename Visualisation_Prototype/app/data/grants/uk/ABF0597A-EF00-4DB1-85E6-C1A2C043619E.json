{"id":"ABF0597A-EF00-4DB1-85E6-C1A2C043619E","title":"Neoliberalism, Anti-neoliberalism and De-ideologisation","abstractText":"<p>Neoliberalism is characterised by an antipathy towards state involvement in economic exchange and an emphasis on the benefits of market forces. The ascendancy of neoliberal processes, rules and institutions illustrates the impact that an ideology can have, especially where it is presented as a technocratic rather than political process. In contrast, the emerging global civil society reaction against neoliberalism is exemplified in the global justice movement, which challenges a number of assumptions about the purpose and direction of economic and social reforms based on the Anglo-American model. </p> \n<p>Neoliberalism and anti-neoliberalism represent a set of ideological processes that are highly relevant to the social sciences because they can and do affect our understanding of the world and therefore impact on the policy or practical application of that knowledge. The aims of this two-year ESRC seminar series are to contribute to such an undertaking, by providing a forum in which both senior and junior academics can engage in dialogue with each other and with research users, where such users are conceived in broad terms, which will help to stimulate the debate around processes of neoliberalism, anti-neoliberalism and the broader impacts of ideological practices.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4258","grantId":"RES-451-25-4258","fundValue":"14967","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kean  Birch","coPersons":["Vlad  Mykhnenko","K  Trebeck"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
