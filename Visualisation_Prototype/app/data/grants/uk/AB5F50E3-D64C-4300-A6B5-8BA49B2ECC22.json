{"id":"AB5F50E3-D64C-4300-A6B5-8BA49B2ECC22","title":"15AGRITECHCAT3 Side Ridge Injection (SRI)","abstractText":"Environmental and health concerns have prompted the prohibition (Council Directive 91/414/EEC) or re-evaluation (Regulation 2009/1107/EC) of many synthetic chemical pesticides. The loss such a wide range of crop protection products is of great concern. For example with UK potato production only two synthetic nematicides are still authorised (Vydate and Nemathorin), but these will be subject to major risk based EU reviews in 2017. About 40% of all land used in the UK for potato production is infested with potato cyst nematodes (PCN) at levels where yield is threatened without the use of nematicides. Naturally occurring diallyl polysulfide compounds found in garlic extracts display broad spectrum pesticidal activities and offer a range of interesting leads for new 'green' pesticides.\n\nTowards this goal, ECOspray Ltd have developed environmentally benign pesticide based on garlic extracts as effective treatments for root knot nematode infestations on sports turf. Early field trials demonstrated their promise for use in preventing potato crop damage from PCN. For large scale applications in broad acre crop protection, precision delivery of such pesticides in the localised zone of individual potato plants, will be critical in order to maximise their effectiveness as well as the economy of their use. To address this, Target Set Ltd are designing and engineering back-of-a-tractor side ridge injector systems able to inject liquid pesticides into the soil ridge that immediately surrounds the planted seed potatoes.\n\nThis project aims to optimise these side ridge injector protocols and establish their effectiveness as a delivery platform for garlic-derived nematicides (through an extensive range of independent field trials), with the aim of securing regulatory approval of their use to prevent PCN damage in potato crop in the UK, across the EU and further afield.\n\nWithin this project, the UEA research team will develop quantitative (laboratory-based) analytical methods that can be used to detect, quantify and chase the fate of individual diallyl polysulfides in complex, agriculturally relevant, soil samples. These methods will be used to guide Target Set in the optimisation of their side-ridge-injector configurations for localised subsoil delivery of polysulfide nematicides. They will also be used to monitor the longevity of soil injected polysulfides during field trials in order to inform ECOspray and Target Set of the best times for repeat nematicide injections. We will also develop qualitative field-based diagnostics that can be used on-site by farmers when this delivery platform is ultimately commercialised. We will also develop methods to increase the yields of the most active diallyl polysufides obtained during the processing and preparation of garlic oils (as well as their synthetic nature-identical equivalents) in order to ensure the nematicide supplies will be able to meet demands when it receives regulatory approval for use in mainstream potato crop protection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N004817/1","grantId":"BB/N004817/1","fundValue":"183783","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher James Hamilton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
