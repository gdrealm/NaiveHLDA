It is now possible to measure hundreds of thousands of genetic variants in people who take part in large-scale medical research projects such as the UK Biobank. The problem is how to analyse these measurements so as to learn how genes and environmental factors interact. Conventional methods of analysing data are not adequate for such complex problems. We plan to develop new ways of analysing data, drawing on methods developed in other fields of research such as physics and computer science. These methods will be applied to analyse information obtained from people who have participated in large-scale studies of genetics and health. To test these methods, we shall apply them to a study of Scottish cancer patients compared with healthy individuals, and to studies of remote isolated populations such as Orkney islanders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800604","grantId":"G0800604","fundValue":"317659","fundStart":"2009-03-16","fundEnd":"2012-03-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Matthew McKeigue","coPersons":["Amos James Storkey"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
