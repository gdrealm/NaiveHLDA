The solutionwill be based upon a multidisciplinary approach combining expertise in thesynthesis of novel tailor-made macrocyclic compounds (reporter materials),formulation of lipid bilayer membranes within a robust self-assembled organicfilm, high sensitive optical registration of surface/analyte interaction andall optical sensor interrogation methods. Fundamental investigations intochemical and engineering sciences will be targeted to meet the end users'specifications and the original scientific and engineering knowledge in thesensor technology will form the basis of a further technology transferprogramme into developing a marketable product by industrial collaborators. Itis important that any developed sensor is shown to be robust and fit forpurpose and instant feedback is essential for security alert. Minimalmaintenance requirements are to be achieved for commercially viable replacementof current practices. The detection limit should also be three orders ofmagnitude better than the ppm range capability of existing technologies.A common case for support is being submitted by QMUL and UEA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E028624/1","grantId":"EP/E028624/1","fundValue":"247863","fundStart":"2007-06-20","fundEnd":"2009-06-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Asim  Ray","coPersons":["Pankaj  Vadgama"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
