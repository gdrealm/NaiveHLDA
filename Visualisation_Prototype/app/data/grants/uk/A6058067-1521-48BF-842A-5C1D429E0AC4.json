It places significant emotional and practical demands upon patients, impacts upon all aspects of daily life and consequently reduces quality of life. These costs and impact pail into insignificance however when, as a consequence of sustained inactivity which is a main symptom of depression, patients are also placed at an increased risk of a wider range of health related difficulties such as obesity, diabetes, and stroke. Despite such well established links between depression, reduced activity and physical health, interventions tend to target each of these areas individually, with little guidance available on how best to promote physical activity within mental health services. \nThe main aim of this proposal is to address this limitation by enhancing behavioural activation, an evidence based psychological intervention for depression and recommended by NICE (2009), by adding a focus on techniques that are used to encourage physical activity to develop a single intervention capable of reducing depression whilst at the same time increasing physical activity. This research approach follows the latest guidance highlighting the way to undertake research to develop interventions. To reduce the likelihood that research programmes will fail to meet their objectives such guidance proposes that prior to a large and expensive research study being undertaken to address the effectiveness of the intervention, researchers should seek to undertake a smaller pilot study to inform the development of the larger study and identify if the larger study is feasible. In line with this approach this research proposal will consist of two main phases both of which include the following specific objectives. \nPhase I: (a) Using service users and experts in physical activity promotion to identify suitable physical activity behaviour change techniques (e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring through pedometer) to develop the enhanced BAcPAc intervention; (b) Inform the development of a training programme to develop competency in the workforce to support BAcPAc; (c) Identify the factors that may prevent BAcPAc being adopted by mental health services. \nThe knowledge collected during Phase I will then contribute towards meeting the Phase II objectives which are to: (a) use BAcPAc as the basis of a pilot randomised controlled study based within primary care to provide us with enough information to clarify uncertainties in the design and delivery of a large, more definitive study; (b) Assess the acceptability of the BAcPAc intervention amongst participants with depression.\nThe main application of the results from the study will be to inform the further development of a larger randomised controlled trial to examine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the BAcPAc intervention for increasing and maintaining physical activity in patients recovering from depression. Were this intervention to demonstrate effectiveness then the BAcPAc intervention would make a significant contribution to the range of evidence based interventions for people available for people with depression. Not least, were effectiveness to be demonstrated in the full study the BAcPAc intervention could be considered for inclusion within the NICE guidelines for depression. Such a recommendation would support widespread implementation of BAcPAc across England and provide patients with an evidence based intervention that not only addressed depression but also improved physical health outcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J000337/1","grantId":"MR/J000337/1","fundValue":"291546","fundStart":"2012-06-06","fundEnd":"2014-07-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  FarrandAdrian Haffner Taylor","coPersons":["Colin  Green","Colin  Greaves","Melvyn  Hillsdon","Alex V Rowlands","Philip  Evans","Rod  Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
