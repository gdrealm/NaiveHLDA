The project concerns the fabrication and characterisation of novel high Tc perovskite structured piezoelectrics intended to replace Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 in high strain and temperature actuator and bi-morph applications. The compositions are based on the pseudoternary solid solution, BiMg1/2Ti1/2O3 / BiFeO3 / PbTiO3.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E057616/1","grantId":"EP/E057616/1","fundValue":"101512","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The work has been presented as part of several invited talks at major international conferences, e.g. CICMT in Florida April 2013. The work has continued with a grant to undertake further development to form multilayer actuators using the new high Tc piezoelectric ceramic invented during the project. This work was highly successful and we are trying to interest companies in commercialisation.\n\nA better piezoelectric materials has been invented than currently available on the market.
