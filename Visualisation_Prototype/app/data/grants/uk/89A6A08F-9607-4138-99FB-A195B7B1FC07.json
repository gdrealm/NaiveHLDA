Combining core biological and engineering skills in order to 'pharmaceuticalise' use of cryopreserved therapeutic cells - the transition from cleanroom to clinic will be streamlined to optimise (1) ease of delivery to the patient, (2) high-viability and cell dosage (and therefore high efficacy), and (3) consistency and reproducibility of high-quality product delivered. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the system will have additional applications - eg during early-stage bioprocessing - where controlled thawing of cells from banked stocks is an important processing consideration.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K500756/1","grantId":"MR/K500756/1","fundValue":"20036","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart John Forbes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
