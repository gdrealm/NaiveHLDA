{"id":"67BC8761-EF3B-4A77-975B-12DB8C900769","title":"Radicalisation in North Africa","abstractText":"<p>This project seeks to assess what role both state and sub-state factors have played in radicalisation in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia). The project will map out the various Islamist movements and assess which factors have had and continue to have the greatest bearing on Islamic radicalisation and why certain areas within the region have been particularly prone to militancy. It will examine the relative weight of factors such as the role of the tribe, family, urbanisation, ethnicity, socio-economic underdevelopment, cultural and social alienation and political forces. It will also assess the dialectic between local factors and the more global aspirations being promoted by some militant groups. In addition, the project will focus on the role of the state to assess whether in their attempts to appropriate Islam as a means of gaining greater legitimacy, the regimes of North Africa have inadvertently contributed to support for radical alternatives. Thus the project will provide new insights into the local specificities of radicalism in the Maghreb that will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of what is generally referred to as the global Islamist movement.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-181-25-0022","grantId":"RES-181-25-0022","fundValue":"234840","fundStart":"2007-11-30","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Pargeter","coPersons":["Emile George Joff√©"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
