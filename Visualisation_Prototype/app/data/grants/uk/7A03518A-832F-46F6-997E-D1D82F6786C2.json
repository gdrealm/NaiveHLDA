Brn-3a exerts its effects in two ways, firstly by enhancing the differentiation of cells to a mature neuronal phenotype and secondly, by enhancing neuronal survival. We have demonstrated that two distinct regions of the Brn-3a molecule are responsible for these two different effects. In this project we will analyse in detail the manner in which these two regions produce respectively, enhanced neuronal differentiation and neuronal survival. This work will enhance our understanding of the normal development of the nervous system and the manner in which it is regulated by Brn-3a, as well as the potential use of Brn-3a as a means of promoting enhanced neuronal survival in neurodegenerative diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D521314/1","grantId":"BB/D521314/1","fundValue":"207351","fundStart":"2006-02-23","fundEnd":"2009-08-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Latchman","coPersons":["Andrew John Copp"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
