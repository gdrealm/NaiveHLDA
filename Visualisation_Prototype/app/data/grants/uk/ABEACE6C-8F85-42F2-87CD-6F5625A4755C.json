We will work with our industrial partners (Industrial Systems Control and SciSys) to evaluate the benefits of these novel controllers within the context of regular road driving and planetary rover vehicles.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I009310/1","grantId":"EP/I009310/1","fundValue":"352599","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Amir  Hussain","coPersons":["Kevin  Gurney"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
