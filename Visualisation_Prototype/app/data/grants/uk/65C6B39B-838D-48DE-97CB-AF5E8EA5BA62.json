These courses will 1) explore the use of large datasets in the social sciences; 2) examine approaches to the evaluation of social problems and 3) offer opportunity for participants to learn about advanced analytical techniques in relation to geographical information about social issues, Course 4 will involve participants learning about ways to utilise and analyse different types of visual data.\n\nOne distinctive feature of these courses is that they will involve 'hands on' activity, drawing on established big data sets, for example, as well as researchers' own data.\n\nThey are cutting edge courses, designed to develop research capacity and possibilities for research engagement in a changing context for research","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/M005895/1","grantId":"ES/M005895/1","fundValue":"19198","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2017-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Loraine Ruth Gelsthorpe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
