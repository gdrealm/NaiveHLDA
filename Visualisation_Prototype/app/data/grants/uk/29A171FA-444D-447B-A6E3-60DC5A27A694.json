{"id":"29A171FA-444D-447B-A6E3-60DC5A27A694","title":"Studying elites: theory, evidence, practice","abstractText":"<p>This series of seminars was designed to begin a multi-disciplinary exploration of the comparative study of elites. It was premised on the belief that, after a golden age of elite studies in the 1950s and 1960s, there had been a decline in social science interest in elite study, and in particular in the cross disciplinary study of elites. The aims of the seminar were not primarily substantive – to advance a series of hypotheses tested against evidence – but rather were heuristic: that is, to create a set of events where scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds could compare their studies, and in the process to encourage the formation of informal networks that would carry forward elite studies. To that end we recruited paper givers from a range of disciplines (political science, sociology, business and management, economics and history) and from both sides of the Atlantic. While the series was not designed to produce particular substantive findings, an important common theme to emerge was the changing configuration of elites in an age of growing inequality across a range of advanced industrial societies.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0589","grantId":"RES-451-26-0589","fundValue":"18379","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Moran","coPersons":["Yuval  Millo","Julie  Froud","Glenn  Morgan"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
