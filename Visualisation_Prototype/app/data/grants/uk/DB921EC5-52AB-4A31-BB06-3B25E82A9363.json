{"id":"DB921EC5-52AB-4A31-BB06-3B25E82A9363","title":"Spectral Properties of Magnetic Operators","abstractText":"The quantum mechanical behaviour of atomic particles, such as electrons, can be modelled mathematically using partial differential operators. The spectral properties of these operators characterise them mathematically and determine the physical properties of the corresponding particles; for example, the spectrum of light emitted by an atom determines the type of the atom. By far the most significant forces influencing the behaviour of particles (at an atomic or molecular level) arise from electric and magnetic fields. There is a systematic procedure for incorporating these fields into mathematical operators which makes use of corresponding potentials. The simplest operator describing a charged atomic particle is the Schrodinger operator. Whilst this gives a good description in a lot of situations, many atomic particles also possess an intrinsic property called spin, which interacts with magnetic fields. To model the effect of such interactions one needs to consider more complicated operators, of which the Pauli operator is the prototype. The presence of a magnetic field can result in completely new types of behaviour for atomic particles. This is reflected in the fact that the corresponding mathematical operators have a very different character once a magnetic potential is included. The key purpose of this project is to study the spectral properties of magnetic operators arising in two areas where the presence of magnetic fields leads to distinct phenomena.One area to be considered will be that of zero modes. These are special states of particles with spin in the presence of a magnetic field; the interaction of the spin with the magnetic field is carefully balanced to keep the particle confined to a limited area of space. Such states have important applications in areas of mathematical physics, such as in the calculation of key quantities in quantum electrodynamics and the search for the lowest energy configurations for certain quantum systems. Although many examples of zero modes have been found they are not yet well understood. The aim of this project is to study the existence of zero modes for strong magnetic fields or, equivalently (through scaling), the existence of zero modes as one moves between the quantum and classical realms. This will provide a key advance in the understanding of zero modes in general.The second area to be considered will be that of periodic problems. Such problems arise naturally in the study of crystalline materials (such as semi-conductors). The spectral properties of the mathematical operators are directly related to conduction properties of the corresponding materials; the spectral type of the operator will determine whether electrons are localised or able to move throughout the crystal, while the number of pieces into which the spectrum is broken has implications for the resistance of the material. These basic properties can be changed fundamentally by the presence of a constant or, more generally, periodic magnetic field. The aim of this project is to extend the current picture for the behaviour of magnetic operators in two and three dimensions. More particularly, the spectral type of operators in two dimensions corresponding to constant magnetic fields will be studied in the large energy and weak electric field regimes, while work on the spectral type and the number of spectral pieces for operators in two and three dimensions will be extended from constant to periodic magnetic fields.Progress on these problems will be of interest to mathematical and theoretic physicists, both for the understanding of the underlying physical processes that will be revealed, as well as for applications in other areas. There is also inherent mathematical interest, both for the links formed between the analysis of partial differential operators and areas such as geometry and complex analysis, as well as for the new techniques developed and their application to other magnetic operators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E037410/1","grantId":"EP/E037410/1","fundValue":"204665","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Mark Elton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
