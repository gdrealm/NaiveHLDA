Heartlands and hinterlands of physics","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to examine the nature of scientific consensus by looking closely at how boundaries are established, enacted, reinforced and experienced within physics. To know what mainstream scientific consensus means, we need to know more about the process of building boundaries and the actors who contribute to it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The empirical work of this project involves a qualitative exploration of the populations of scientists and quasi-scientists on either side of the boundary between mainstream science and ‘outsiders’. Interviews will be conducted with both members of the scientific mainstream and with those attempting to take part in physics from outside the consensus. Gatekeepers to the mainstream - journal editors, specialist librarians, and those responsible for maintaining ‘open access’ resources - will be interviewed about the way in which they maintain the boundaries of physics. ‘Heterodox’ physicists, both within and outside academia, will be interviewed about their model of science as a collective and/or individual activity and their experiences of working outside the consensus. This fieldwork will take place in the UK, with one visit to the US and one visit to Australia.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006401/1","grantId":"ES/K006401/1","fundValue":"221747","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry Maurice Collins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
