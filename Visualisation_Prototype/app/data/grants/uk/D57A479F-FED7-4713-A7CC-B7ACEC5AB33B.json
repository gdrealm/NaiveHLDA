Scientists have not been able to develop tests that can help doctors reliably predict whether people will get depressed; or if they already are depressed, how soon they will get better or what the best treatment would be.\n\nThe proposed study will investigate a possible ?biomarker? or ?biological test? for depression, which we hope will be useful for doctors trying to treat and prevent depression. All people produce a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol should increase when people get stressed (this can be a physical stress, such as being starved, or a mental stress, such as a job interview). Research has suggested that cortisol increases more in people vulnerable to depression when they encounter stress. Therefore a test which measures cortisol response to stress may be a good biomarker for depression. We shall test which of two stress tests is a better potential biomarker: a physical stress [taking one deep breath of air containing a high concentration (35%) of carbon dioxide (a naturally-occurring gas in the atmosphere)] and a mental stress [participants give a talk and do some mental arithmetic in front of a mock interview panel]. Several studies have shown that these tests increase cortisol in most people, and are safe. This study will test whether cortisol reactivity is related to other known risk factors for depression; and whether it is higher in people who used to be depressed than in people who have never been depressed. Cortisol reactivity and resting cortisol will be compared as potential biomarkers.\n\nThe proposed study, by the Universities of Cambridge and Bristol, will recruit 228 Cambridgeshire 17-19 year olds who are already taking part in one of our long-term studies. We can test people?s cortisol levels from their saliva. We shall ask participants to collect their saliva 6 times per day over two days, so we can test resting cortisol. Then we shall ask them to come to our Cambridge laboratory on two occasions. At the start of the first session, while resting, they will be asked some questions about their psychiatric history and given some memory tests. In each session, they will be given one of the stress tests. After this, saliva will again be collected so cortisol can be measured. In addition, participants will be asked about how they feel, and some more memory tests will be carried out.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801443","grantId":"G0801443","fundValue":"301508","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Oliver Wilkinson","coPersons":["Ian Michael Goodyer"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
