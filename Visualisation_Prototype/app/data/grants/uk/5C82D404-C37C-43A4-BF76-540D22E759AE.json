Although a growing number of laws have been passed to protect women, governments from around the world have struggled to convert promises into prevention.</p>\n\n<p>This timely study concentrates on the 2005 'Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and the Protection of the Victims' in Cambodia.</p>\n\n<p>The research examines why investments are faltering, and how these insights could shape the strategies adopted by programme and policy-makers. Conducted in two provinces, the research uses a quantitative survey of rural and urban households to establish levels of understanding of the 2005 Law and see what associations can be made to different individual, community and societal factors. It also involves filmmaking with local communities and harnesses interviews with key individuals to uncover the range of knowledges and experiences surrounding DV (law).</p>\n\n<p>The study brings together Dr Katherine Brickell at Royal Holloway, University of London; Dr Bunnak Poch at Western University, Phnom Penh; and partner NGO, Gender and Development/Cambodia.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0674","grantId":"RES-167-25-0674","fundValue":"196355","fundStart":"2012-01-20","fundEnd":"2015-10-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine Ann  Brickell","coPersons":["Bunnak  Poch"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
