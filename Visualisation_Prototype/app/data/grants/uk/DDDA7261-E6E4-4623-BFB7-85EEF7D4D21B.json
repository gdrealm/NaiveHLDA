A key component of the immune response is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This complex contains two sets of highly variable genes that code for class I and class II proteins. These proteins activate the immune system to respond to invading parasites. Each individual has a distinct set of MHC proteins that allow recognition of a specific set of parasite molecules. The major disease faced by sheep is infection by roundworms. There is substantial genetic variation among sheep in resistance to roundworms. Farmers have started to identify and breed from sheep with enhanced resistance to roundworms. Sheep with a particular combination of class II MHC genes are more resistant to roundworms. These class II MHC genes may also play a role in fighing other diseases and most scientists agree that populations that maintain a diverse array of class II genes are more resistant to most infectious and parasitic diseases. The goal of this project is to determine whether selective breeding for resistance to nematodes will cause a noticeable loss of mhc diversity. We will do this by estimating the size of the effect that each class II gene has on nematode resistance then using mathematical models of the selection process to estimate the influence of selection on mhc diversity. The outcome of this research will improve our ability to breed roundworm-resistant sheep without adverse effects on susceptibility to other diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F015313/1","grantId":"BB/F015313/1","fundValue":"346648","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Stear","coPersons":["Louise  Matthews"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
