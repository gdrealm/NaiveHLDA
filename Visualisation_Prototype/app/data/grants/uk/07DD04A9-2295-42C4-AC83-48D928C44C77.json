{"id":"07DD04A9-2295-42C4-AC83-48D928C44C77","title":"Low cost storage of renewable energy","abstractText":"Faraion, Moixa Technology and the University of Warwick propose to collaborate to jointly develop a sodium-ion battery, as\na lower cost alternative to lithium-ion. This as an innovative energy storage solution in tandem with solar energy.\nStoring electrical energy in battery banks for release at peak times has the befit of reducing emissions, as does coupling\nthis with solar energy. Security of supply is improved as switching to solar PV and battery back-up provides support to the\ngrid when other forms of power generation go offline for any reason. Sodium is a lower cost, more abundant hence\nsustainable material than lithium as it is more abundant in the earth's crust. Sodium carbonate is on tenth of the cost of\nlithium carbonate.\nIn this project The University of Warwick will utilise facilities and technologists within its partly government funded Energy\nInnovation Centre (EIC) which has been established to provide industry with a capability to take arising battery chemistries\nfrom small scale through to representative prototype sizes. The EIC features electrode mixing and coating equipment which\nincorporates the latest technology for producing high quality, accurate electrodes. Although principally designed with\nlithium-ion technology in mind, sodium-ion represents a &quot;drop-in&quot; technology that can use all of the same fabrication\nprocesses to produce electrodes and cells, this makes sodium-ion an attractive proposition for existing lithium-ion cell\nmanufacturers and this aids the exploitation route and dissemination of output from the project. This will enable efficient\nadoption of next generation energy storage. Faradion has demonstrated cell performance of their materials as being\ncompatible to commercial lithium-ion cells in terms of cycle life, energy density and rate capability. This project will take the\ntechnology from its current position at TRL3 to TRL5 and validate prototype batteries.\nThe Energy Innovation Centre is part of WMG. WMG is a department of the University of Warwick that was established by\nProfessor Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya in 1980 in order to reinvigorate UK manufacturing and improve competitiveness\nthrough the application of value-adding innovation and cutting-edge research. Professor Lord Bhattacharyya has published\nextensively in the field of manufacturing and is a highly influential advisor to many organisations around the world. WMG is\nnow a world-renowned centre of excellence operating an international programme of research, education and knowledge\ntransfer amounting to &pound;100m a year. WMG works closely with UK regional development agencies to support the delivery of\ntheir economic strategies and also with global corporations to train executives and to develop technologies for markets\nworldwide.\nThe University of Warwick will work directly with Faradion to optimise the sodium-ion electrodes for cycle life for this\napplication. Electrodes will be produced which can be converted into battery cells for life-cycle testing at an early stage of\nthe project to provide feedback for process optimisation. Accelerated aging concepts based on predictive modelling and\nEIS (electrochemical impedance Spectroscopy) on cell testing at the coin cell level will be introduced by experts in this field\nat UoW to shorten the feedback time of life cycle evaluation so improvements in electrode production can be introduced at\naccelerated rates.\nThe aim of the research is to provide the highest quality sodium-ion cell electrodes optimised for this standby storage\napplication. The benefit to the academic community is the dissemination of practical research which accelerates the\nadoption of sodium-ion battery technology into a high value manufacturing environment. The commercialisation strategy is\nto license the sodium-ion technology IP to battery manufacturers but also to supply low cost energy storage systems\nthrough Moixa Technology to end users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N509863/1","grantId":"EP/N509863/1","fundValue":"131048","fundStart":"2015-12-16","fundEnd":"2018-12-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rohit  Bhagat","coPersons":["Richard John Dashwood"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
