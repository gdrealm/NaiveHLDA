In particular, it will look at the question of whether modernism served as a bridge between cultures based on value and those based on trust. \nThe object of the project is to establish a conceptual framework for comparative historical enquiry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113132/1","grantId":"113132/1","fundValue":"6936","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Bull","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
