{"id":"C27BB024-FB2B-4590-9506-65513ED43AF8","title":"Improving access to safe drinking water: prospection for low-fluoride sources","abstractText":"Fluoride in drinking water is one of the most significant water-quality problems affecting populations in Africa. Long-term use of drinking water with fluoride significantly above the WHO guideline value of 1.5 mg/L can have serious effects on health, manifested most prominently by dental and skeletal fluorosis. The Rift Valley of Ethiopia is an arid, groundwater-dependent region with well-established links between fluoride in drinking water and fluorosis. Despite the recognised fluoride anomalies on a regional scale, local-scale variations and their controls are poorly defined and understood. This pilot project aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of fluoride in groundwater in a selected study area of the Rift. The project will characterise the variability, evaluate the underlying causes and determine whether the variations show sufficient predictability to be of practical benefit in providing guidance on improving abstraction strategies. The institutional arrangements governing water management and supply (regulation, policy, funding, capacity and prioritisation) will be assessed in order to understand the governance context of water supply in the area investigated. Through these combined approaches, the project aims to define the most effective ways to translate an improved knowledge on fluoride distributions into improved access to sources of safe, low-fluoride drinking water.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L002027/1","grantId":"NE/L002027/1","fundValue":"84665","fundStart":"2013-08-12","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  To improve knowledge on fluoride in groundwater in Oromia, Ethiopia; workshops have raised awareness about safe sourcing and locating low-fluoride groundwater Agriculture, Food and Drink Policy & public services","person":"Pauline  Smedley","coPersons":["Jennifer Margaret Bearcock"],"organisation":"NERC British Geological Survey","findingsText":" Fluoride distributions in groundwater in the areas studied have some notable spatial structure. We hypothesise that this is due to i) surface water/groundwater interaction affecting local water quality, and ii) influx of deep geothermal water in localised areas, controlled by faults. Investigating whether this is applicable more widely than our study areas is a logical next step. Cost-benefit analysis of groundwater/surface water use in the study area places the costs of defluoridation higher than of piped water supply. Problems with maintenance, raw materials supply and user acceptance also mean that the defluoridation approach is only sustainable with NGO support and community buy-in.
