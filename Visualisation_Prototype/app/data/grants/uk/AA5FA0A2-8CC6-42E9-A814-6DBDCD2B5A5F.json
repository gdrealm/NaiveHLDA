{"id":"AA5FA0A2-8CC6-42E9-A814-6DBDCD2B5A5F","title":"Diagrams, figures and the transformation of astronomy, 1450-1650","abstractText":"In the wake of Koyr&eacute;'s La r&eacute;volution astronomique (Paris, 1961) and From the closed world to the infinite universe (Baltimore, 1961) there has arisen an enormous literature on the so-called 'astronomical revolution'. It is now generally acknowledged that astronomy in the early modern period was transformed through the invention of new instruments and techniques of observation, the introduction of new world systems and the integration of mathematical astronomy with natural philosophy. However, historians who have attended to the larger issues of change in the conduct and content of astronomy have done so largely on the basis of textual evidence. The aim of this project is to examine the little known roles of visual representations in this well known transformation. \\nSince c.1990 there has been a 'visual turn' in the history of science, marked by such works as Martin Kemp, The science of art (London and New Haven, 1990); Carline Jones and Peter Galison, eds., Picturing science: producing art (New York and London, 1998); and Wolfgang Lef&egrave;vre et al., eds., The power of images in early modern science (Basel, 2003). Drawing on earlier as well as more recent works of direct relevance, this project will investigate the types and uses of images in a variety of astronomical texts and textbooks. \\nThe projected work will go beyond existing studies in four principal respects. It will attend closely to the ways in which diagrams and figures were conceived in the period, as indicated by contemporary terminology and writings on imagery. It will trace the adaptations of images from work to work. Through analysis of interactions between texts and images, it will explore the full range of the functions of diagrams and figures. Finally, it will address the larger question of the parts played by innovations in the types and uses of images in the 'astronomical revolution' of the early modern period. \\nThis research project is based on a close scrutiny of key astronomical texts atextbooks (e.g. by Sacrobosco, Regiomontanus, Apian, Copernicus, Brahe Kepler and Galilei) from the early modern period, concentrating on materials from the important holdings of early-modern astronomical works in the Cambridge University Library, the Wren Library of Trinity College, and the Whipple Library at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science. We will also investigate contemporary reading and pedagogical practices through a study of marginal annotations in surviving copies, some of which are held in other libraries in the UK and Europe. \\nThe project team will comprise of Prof. N. Jardine, who has specialist knowledge in cosmology and has looked at the roles of non-demonstrative argument in the sciences, Dr L. Taub, who has on-going interests in genres of scientific writing and expertise in the history of astronomy and meteorology, and Dr S. Kusukawa, has worked on types of medical illustrations, faculty psychology and natural philosophy. They will be joined by one PhD student and two Post-doctoral research associates. Prof. I. Pantin, an internationally acknowledged expert in early modern astronomical imagery, will join the team for three months. This team will collaborate with other leading specialists in the field through seminars, workshops and publications.\\nThis project will publish two sets of collected essays, aimed at an international audience of specialists in early modern science. It will also make available to teachers and scholars world-wide a collection of case studies of key images and texts (with English translation and commentary) through a project website. The project website will make more accessible the contents of the rare astronomical books from the Cambridge collections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F011024/1","grantId":"AH/F011024/1","fundValue":"511342","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The outputs of the project lead to a wider appreciation of the substantial roles of visual and aesthetic appeal in the sciences.

(1) and (2) were the subjects of our first year's seminars and international conference and the thirteen articles arising from them. Two principal findings emerge: first, that the types of early-modern astronomical images are far more varied than we had anticipated, with many of them mixing plain geometrical with figural and perspectival representation; secondly, that in many early-modern astronomical texts, especially those dealing with practical aspects of astronomy, images played very substantial communicative roles, often going far beyond the arguments to be found in the accompanying texts. (3) was the subject of our second year seminars, international conference, and resulting five articles. Several of the contributions show that astronomer-authors were often closely involved in the production and setting of images, as also in the distribution, sale and exchange of their works. Further, we came to realise that early-modern astronomical printed images do not, as has generally been supposed, divide neatly into woodcuts and engravings - many were printed from engraved metallic matrices set into the type formes. (4) was the subject of our seminars, conference and the seven forthcoming articles arising from them. Further work is needed before we can draw general conclusions from this aspect of our work. Our preliminary findings confirm that there are many correspondences between the uses of images in astronomy and other mathematical disciplines. However, comparison with medicine - a discipline closely linked with astronomy via astrology - reveals radical differences, with astronomy showing a long-standing dependence on imagery, whereas in medicine images were controversial with many physicians actively mistrusting them. From our studies taken together two general conclusions have emerge: first, that in early-modern astronomy, diagrams and figures, though greatly valued were often problematic, with many errors arising in their copying, production, placement, lettering, and integration with the contents of their accompanying texts; secondly, that the role of diagrams in the &quot;battle of the world systems&quot; - Ptolemaic, Tychonic and Copernician - was far greater than has hitherto been appreciated. Overall, this well-advanced project has made substantial contributions to our understanding of the roles of diagrams and figures in the transformation of astronomy, 1450-1650. As well as making the rare primary sources and the results of our enquiries immediately available to our colleagues world-wide for purposes of research, we envisage the use of the project website by colleagues who teach undergraduate or graduate courses in early-modern science. From our own past experience of developing educational websites, however, it is clear that the website will be of value as a resource for school assignments and projects. Further, this website will highlight, and make more accessible, the valuable rare book resources from Cambridge collections. Astronomy is popular as an amateur pursuit, but the public understanding of the history of astronomy is hampered by the inaccessibility of the writings of the major astronomers. We are making some of these accessible in English, and we also offer short commentaries to introduce users to the historical context and significance of each work, and point them to useful and up-to-date further reading.
