To date, while still at an early stage in the programme, the CAS has enabled us to develop novel in situ hybridisation techniques at Nottingham which has enabled us to identify introgressions in wheat from its distant relatives whilst the Nottingham group has transferred state of the art marker technology to detect introgressions in wheat to the CAS group. The introgressions will be exploited for the development of superior, higher yielding wheat varieties which are adapted to environmental change. Chemicals","dataset":"gtr"}
