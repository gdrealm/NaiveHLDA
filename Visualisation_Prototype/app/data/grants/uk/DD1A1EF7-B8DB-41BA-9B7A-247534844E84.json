{"id":"DD1A1EF7-B8DB-41BA-9B7A-247534844E84","title":"Health literacy and the framing of health messages in the gay community","abstractText":"<p>‘Health literacy’ implies a deficit in the receiver. The starting point of this proposal is that messages may be so ‘framed’ as to reduce the likelihood that they will be received.</p>\n\n<p>The project focuses on gay men as a marginalised category. It acknowledges that there are internal differences here in terms of class, ethnicity and identity. It explores the proposition that messages about gay men’s health that apply no less to them than to straight men may have been blunted by giving overwhelming attention to HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>Qualitative interviews and observations are planned – both face to face and over the internet – in three distinct chosen-identity groups, varying in the extent to which their life styles seem compatible with men’s health messages: ‘health and fitness’, ‘bears’ and the ‘gay and lesbian choir’ (neutral group).</p>\n\n<p>The project will explore the framing of health promotion in terms of message and medium, in order to determine the extent to which appropriate tailoring might improve communication.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers are alert to the ethical issues that research among gay men involves, including confidentiality. They are committed to disseminating findings not only in the academic arena but also to those who seek to promote health among gay men.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1486","grantId":"RES-000-22-1486","fundValue":"45769","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Bellaby","coPersons":["Sara Catrin MacKian"],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
