{"id":"7AA12BFE-1119-46F8-9295-200E1DEB210D","title":"MICA: A new paradigm for testing pathway tractability in lung disease","abstractText":"Despite significant advances in our core knowledge of disease mechanism, the number of drugs that reach medicinal status has actually diminished. The current route of validating drugs involves laboratory-based assays in cells, studies in animal models of the disease and lastly a series of clinical trials of increasing size and expense culminating in large studies designed to show drug efficacy. At each point in this process the development costs rise, often exponentially and there is a high attrition rate. Further, many drugs are entered and fail in the latter stages of clinical trials without 'proof' that they were ever biologically effective against their intended target in patients with the disease. \n\nIn this proposal, we describe a novel efficient pathway for testing the potential for a drug to become an effective medicine. The pathway is designed such that a drug can only progress to an 'efficacy study' if it can be proven that it inhibits its intended target in patients with the disease. \nWe aim to demonstrate this novel pathway in patients with IPF, a devastating disease with poor survival and no effective therapy. The pathogensis of IPF is complex, but there is evidence that an enzyme, MMP9, is elevated in the lungs of patients with the disease and may be suitable drug target. Through a separate MRC fund, we are developing a 'Smartprobe' that emits a visible signal when activated by MMP9. Our co-applicants, AstraZeneca have developed a drug, AZD1236, that is a potent inhibitor of MMP9. This drug has been studied in patients with emphysema and is safe, but the results indicated the drug was ineffective at treating the disease. However it is not known if the drug actually inhibits its intended target, MMP9, in the diseased lung.\nOur first aim is to show that AZD1236 is able to switch off the MMP9 Smartprobe in cells and tissue from IPF patients. To prove 'target-engagement' definitively, we will also label the drug with a fluorescent tag and visualise, in real-time under direct microscopy, co-localisation of the drug with the MMP9 Smartprobe. If the AZD1236 fails to switch off the Smartprobe, the project will be stopped.\nOur second aim is to demonstrate that AZD1236 inhibits the MMP9 Smartprobe in the lungs of patients with IPF. This is feasible through pCLE, a tool that allows direct visualisation of fluorescent signals in the lung airways and airsacs via a telescope in lightly sedated patients. A small quantity of MMP9 Smartprobe will be instilled directly into a diseased area of lung, and the signal measured in real-time. This will be followed by instillation of a small dose of AZD1236 (or placebo) into the same area and the reduction in signal quantified. This study requires only 6-10 patients, yields immediate results and is designed to prove that AZD1236 inhibits MMP9 in diseased lung. Failure to inhibit the MMP9 signal would end further human studies AZD1236 in IPF. \nIf inhibition is achieved however, we will proceed to our third aim; a study in 20 patients with IPF in which the MMP9 Smartprobe activity is quantified before and following 3 months of treatment with AZD1236 (or placebo) given by tablet. This study is designed to prove that AZD1236 given in tablet form, the route by which the drug would ultimately be used in patients, inhibits MMP9 in lung tissue. \nThese studies are not designed to show that AZD1236 is effective at treating IPF. Such a study would still need to be performed in a larger number of patients for a longer duration. However, by first proving that AZD1236 inhibits MMP9 in the lungs of IPF patients, the risk of a larger study 'failing' are substantially reduced.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015206/1","grantId":"MR/K015206/1","fundValue":"253605","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nik  Hirani","coPersons":["Rob  Riley","Mark  Bradley","Christopher  Haslett","Kev  Dhaliwal"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
