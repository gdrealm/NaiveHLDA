Chromosome packaging is a highly regulated process that ensures that the correct cell makes the correct genes available for proper regulation specific to that cell. We are interested in the factors that regulate DNA packaging into chromosomes and in particular we are interested in the changes that happen to chromosome packaging as stem cells develop into body cells. We have made a mutant where key factors required for proper gene regulation are not placed on the DNA and the chromosomes. These experiments are designed to learn more about this key factor and how it influences the chromosomes in early development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G020930/1","grantId":"BB/G020930/1","fundValue":"366324","fundStart":"2009-12-07","fundEnd":"2012-12-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Ferguson-Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
