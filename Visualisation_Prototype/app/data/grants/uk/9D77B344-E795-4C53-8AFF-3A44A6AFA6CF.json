{"id":"9D77B344-E795-4C53-8AFF-3A44A6AFA6CF","title":"Film Sequels: Theory and Practice from Hollywood to Bollywood","abstractText":"My research examines film sequel production within its industrial, cultural, theoretical, and global contexts. Although much attention has been drawn to the resurgence of the film sequel as a lucrative intertextual format without cultural or aesthetic value, this research takes the critical stance that such views ignore the complicated ideological and social issues that permeate sequelization, in particular those cross-cultural dialogues that occur within this structure throughout Hollywood and world cinemas. By investigating sequel production around the globe within defined time frames, this research identifies and accounts for some of the major critical contexts within which sequelization operates.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E00461X/1","grantId":"AH/E00461X/1","fundValue":"23264","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Carolyn  Jess-Cooke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sunderland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
