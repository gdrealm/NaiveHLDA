The equipment proposal made here is designed to support the research we wish to conduct at Sheffield that is at the heart of this endeavor. It is closely associated with our STFC consolidated grant programme request for the period 2015-2019. Foremost amongst our work recently has been involvement in the discovery by ATLAS of a Higgs boson particle. Members of the group led and helped to develop the key 4-lepton analysis upon which the discovery was based. This work will continue but, preparing for the future, the equipment we are seeking will be critical to expanding our generic role in the ATLAS upgrade programme to build key components of a new ATLAS tracker. Our involvement in the T2K experiment in Japan also greatly benefited from confirmation of a non-zero third neutrino mixing angle, a result fundamental to our understanding of the neutrino. The group's respected work in neutrino analyses for T2K, particularly of so-called charge current and neutral current events, will also continue. However, here, bolstered by the exciting new results, our capital request is key to allowing us to participate in next generation long baseline neutrino experiments for CP violation aimed to unravel the mystery of antimatter in the Universe, notably using LBNE/F in the US and Hyper-K in Japan. For these our particular focus will be on detector construction and the requested equipment will be critical to underpinning this. For instance, we plan leading work on the precursor LAr1-ND experiment at Fermilab where we will construct the central Anode Plane Array for the detector. In parallel we need to expand our pioneering liquid argon R&amp;D. The purifier and impurity monitoring apparatus requested will allow us to produce leading results in this area, for instance on the physics of charge transport in liquid argon. This will also allow us to establish novel detector prototypes at the new CERN-based neutrino platform and for LBNE/F itself. For particle astrophysics we plan to develop new efforts on detection of dark matter, thought to comprise 90% of the Universe. There is strong motivation here because the US LUX experiment recently produced a step-change in sensitivity to dark matter particles. Supporting our computing hardware will enable us to lead analysis for the EDELWEISS experiment and then lead key simulations for the upcoming LZ experiment in the US. Our pioneering work on detectors with sensitivity to galactic signatures can also be supported this way. This includes the DRIFT direction sensitive experiment at Boulby and the new DM-ICE250 NaI experiment, which US collaborators recently agreed will be hosted at Boubly to seek an annual modulation signal for dark matter. Meanwhile, our generic detector R&amp;D and knowledge exchange programme is vital to underpinning the group's expertise and skills-base. The requested equipment focused on radio-assay of materials is required so that we can maintain leading studies of rare backgrounds that hinder many rare-event experiments, but that also have relevance in industry. For instance radon detection. This can benefit from our historic links to the Boulby deep underground science laboratory. Other areas that can benefit from the capital programme, particularly in the electronics items requested, include our muon tomography projects for climate change, spin-out work on novel motor control electronics and our novel welding technology. The latter requires, in particular, the new state of the art workshop machines requested. Our long-standing efforts to develop liquid argon technology for neutrino physics are also relevant to medical imaging requirements. The data acquisition and analytical instrumentation requested can greatly aid this to complete a new prototype instrument, building on MRC investment, as well for our core neutrino programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/N001141/1","grantId":"ST/N001141/1","fundValue":"21571","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Spooner","coPersons":["Christos  Anastopoulos","Daniel Russell Tovey","Vitaly  Kudryavtsev","Davide  Costanzo","Jonathan  Perkin","Richard  French","Lee  Thompson","John Eric McMillan","Christopher Neal Booth","Edward John Daw","Ian  Dawson","Trevor Neil Vickey","Susan Lesley Cartwright"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
