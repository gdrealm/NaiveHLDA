Typhimurium within epithelial cells and macrophages","abstractText":"According to the latest European Food Standard Agency (EFSA) statistics (2008), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is the second most reported zoonotic infection in humans and the most frequent cause of food borne outbreaks in the EU. Worldwide Salmonella is responsible for up to 800,000 deaths from contaminated food and water. Following ingestion Salmonella bacteria travel to the intestine where they invade the cells lining the gut wall (epithelial cells), causing bloody diarrhoea. In the case of systemic infections (caused by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi in humans), Salmonella invade the immune cells which are responsible for fighting infection (macrophages). Although the role of macrophages is to kill bacteria, Salmonella has adapted to evade the lethal chemical weapons deployed by macrophages. The Salmonella are able to survive and grow within the macrophages in a specialised compartment known as the 'Salmonella containing vacuole' (SCV), and thereby become systemically disseminated to other organs including the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. We recently made the discovery that the major metabolic pathway required to catabolise sugars (glycolysis) is essential for the ability of Salmonella to grow and survive within macrophages, but not within epithelial cells. In order to grow and survive within host cells, Salmonella must also have a route for generating the energy required for these processes. Together with other evidence from our research, and published data, it seems likely that S. Typhimurium generates energy via different mechanisms in macrophages compared to epithelial cells. One of the aims of this proposal is to differentiate between these alternative energy generating pathways in macrophages and epithelial cells. Such information may facilitate therapeutic interventions. One of the major questions in infection biology is the extent to which the host cell contributes to the intracellular growth of Salmonella. We will use cutting edge techniques to determine the contribution of amino acids derived from host proteins and peptides to the intracellular growth of Salmonella in infected epithelial cells and macrophages. If Salmonella is dependent on the host for some of its requirements to enable intracellular growth, then this may also represent a way to facilitate therapeutic intervention.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J001627/1","grantId":"BB/J001627/1","fundValue":"375569","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Arthur  Thompson","coPersons":["Francis  Mulholland"],"organisation":"Institute of Food Research","findingsText":" Tasks completed and in progress:\n\nTask 1: A deletion mutant of the operon encoding ATP synthase in S. Typhimurium was constructed and used in infection assays in macrophages and epithelial cell lines. We have shown that ATP synthase is absolutely required for intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium in macrophages but not in epithelial cells. We have also shown that phosphofructokinase and therefore glycolysis is absolutely required for intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium in both epithelial cells as well as macrophages.\n\nTask 2: We have collected media from infected and uninfected macrophages and epithelial cells and have begun preliminary analysis to detect predicted fermentation end products at the University of Sheffield using NMR. We will initiate C13 glucose labelling studies of S. Typhimurium followed by infection of host cells to determine which fermentation end products accumulate during infection of host cells.\n\nTask 3: We have determined from a comparison of the behaviour of mutant strains in epithelial cells (HeLa) and from transcriptomic analyses that energy metabolism is different in epithelial (HeLa) cells compared to macrophages. This was published in PLoS One: Bowden S.D., Hopper-Chidlaw A.C., Rice C.J., Ramachandran V.K., Kelly D.J., Thompson, A. (2014) Nutritional and metabolic requirements for the infection of HeLa cells by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. PLoS One Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96266.\nTask 4: In progress\nTask 5: Our analyses indicate that oxphos occurs as a consequence of the cytosolic location of Salmonella in epithelial cells enabling their rapid multiplication and possibly playing a role in cell:cell transmission and dissemination. Our data suggests that Salmonella bacteria are confined to the Salmonella containing vacuole are restricted to ATP generation via substrate level phosphorylation only. This is likely to be a consequence of nutrient limitation.\nTask 6: In collaboration with Dr. Karsten Tedin at the Freie Universit?t in Berlin we have determined the mechanism by which intracellular Salmonella gains access to host amino acids for replication. This manuscript has been submitted to PNAS. In 2014 this work provided the basis for a funding submission to the Joint Program Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) to specifically target antimicrobial peptides to intracellular Salmonella. This was a transnational submission for which I am coordinator Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
