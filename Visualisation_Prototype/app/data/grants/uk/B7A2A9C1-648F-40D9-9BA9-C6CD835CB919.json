Massive domestic and international outcry and a brief period of EU sanctions ensued. There have been numerous socio- and psycho-political studies of the charismatic ex-leader of the FP&Ouml;, J&ouml;rg Haider, and analyses of the success of the FP&Ouml; or of the 'change in colour' of contemporary Austria, but there is no significant research setting out the main sites and texts of cultural resistance to this political turn. 'Resisting Haiderisation' will make good this deficiency by documenting and analysing not the political history and electoral trends but the many artistic reactions by producers of and commentators on contemporary culture.\\nThe book charts, contextualises, and explains the popular and public forms of cultural opposition (speeches and songs, for example) as well as the intellectual and journalistic (for example in the form of published essays). It also identifies and evaluates the ways in which more traditional genres and art forms - novels, plays, films - have expressed dissatisfaction with Austria's political landscape. What emerges is a wide variety of different cultural approaches and strategies. Some adopt satirical methods, some outputs are more veiled, while others are raw and formulaic. What unites the different artists and their work is their need to put down a mark of opposition in their own chosen media.\\n.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G005222/1","grantId":"AH/G005222/1","fundValue":"28388","fundStart":"2009-04-15","fundEnd":"2009-08-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Allyson Lesley Fiddler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
