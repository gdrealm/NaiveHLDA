They allow individuals to raise their employability and to achieve the ambitions of themselves, their families and their communities. Recent research published in the report <em>21st Century Skills: realising our potential</em> (HMSO, 2003) identified specific gaps in the basic skills needed for employability. These include communication skills, literacy, numeracy and the use of IT. These are especially relevant in the context of the widening gaps between rich and poor in the UK. They also highlight the need to identify children with marked difficulties in the early years and tracking them across the lifespan. Drawing on data collected for the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), one of Britainâ€™s richest research resources for the study of human development, this study will address the extent to which language learning and literacy difficulties persist and what factors and processes are associated with breaking this vicious cycle. The BCS70 cohort involves more than 17,000 people born in Great Britain in April 1970. Data are available about cohort members at birth, 5,10,16,26, and 30 years and most recently in 2004 aged 34 years.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1748","grantId":"RES-000-22-1748","fundValue":"70392","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Law","coPersons":["Ingrid  Schoon","Robert W Rush","Samantha Jayne Parsons"],"organisation":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
