Predicted more than 50 years ago this last missing ingredient of the Standard Model offers an explanation for the origin of mass and electro-weak forces. Despite this, the origins of the Standard Model and it's place within models for cosmological and astrophysical observations remain unclear.\n\nThe second phase of the LHC, which runs until 2018 at twice the energy of phase one, aims to study the properties of this new boson and uncover the true structure of the electro-weak symmetry breaking scale. Astrophysical and cosmological observations predict new forms of matter and energy as yet unexplained by the Standard Model and there are many conjectured theories which point towards new physics around the electro-weak scale at an energy of 1-2 TeV.\n\nStudies of the data from run I of the LHC indicate the expected signals of new physics may be harder to find than originally hoped and it is for this reason that precision predictions and detailed analyses will become the focus for future LHC experiments. The project &quot;New methods for precision predictions at the LHC&quot; addresses the need for new theoretical tools which currently limit our ability to make precision predictions at hadron colliders like the LHC.\n\nHadron colliders produce huge amounts of strongly interacting radiation that must be precisely modelled if we hope to find the tiny signatures that high energy models of new physics predict. This is an extremely challenging task within the framework of Quantum-Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), our model for the strong interaction, where even perturbative approximations quickly run into areas pushing the boundaries of mathematics and computational power. Owing to the relatively large size of the strong coupling constant, high order expansions within QCD are required in order to keep the theoretical uncertainties under control and in line with the experimental errors.\n\nDespite these challenges remarkable progress has been made in recent years that now allow predictions at next-to-leading order in the pertubative expansion to be made for a wide variety of different processes. A particular highlight of these developments is the ability to look at high multiplicity processes which give access to much more flexible analyses. However, these methods are restricted to an accuracy of between 10 and 20% which is above the projected precision expected from phase two collisions. In order to make sure the theory is ready to handle the new data we must now focus on finding new solutions for higher multiplicity QCD predictions at higher order in perturbation theory and push predictions towards 5% precision.\n\nNew mathematical methods developing through formal studies of super-symmetric theories can offer elegant solutions to the problems of computational complexity. To apply these techniques to the QCD environment requires significant extensions however and high degrees of automation and we will develop state-of-the-art analytic tools to compute the necessary amplitude level ingredients. Elements of algebraic geometry and number theory are finding their first applications outside pure mathematics in these studies and the research gives us the opportunity for fruitful discussions between the two disciplines.\n\nA small group will be established within the expert theory group at the University of Edinburgh to study the application of new mathematical techniques in QCD and SM theory. These ideas will be implemented inside public codes that can be used in future experimental analyses when interfaced to Monte-Carlo event generators use to simulate the collisions. By focusing on the theoretical and mathematical techniques now we will be able to perform flexible phenomenological studies of the Standard Model and beyond in the next decade of LHC experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M004104/1","grantId":"ST/M004104/1","fundValue":"311471","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Simon David Badger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
