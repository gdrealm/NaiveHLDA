{"id":"389DDADE-B81A-4C2B-AB60-88FEABBBD093","title":"Copyright and publicly funded arts and humanities research: identifying exploitation models in the digital economy","abstractText":"Arts and humanities researchers are both prolific producers and users of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. These works are protected by copyright, a law which grants exclusive rights to the owner over exploitation of the work. So an arts and humanities researcher needs both to obtain consent to use existing works in her research, and give consent if her work is to be used by others. This can create a complex, and often opaque environment where many consents may be needed and need to be given. Challenges can then arise to dissemination and exploitation of the work if the correct permissions have not been given and obtained. Focusing on digital outputs, this project will track the creation and dissemination of works produced by arts and humanities researchers from point of funding of the research to the point at which it is disseminated in the digital economy. The purpose is to highlight some of the complexities involved and in so doing address the question: what copyright framework(s) would best support the translation of publicly funded arts and humanities research content into the digital/creative economy?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L503769/1","grantId":"AH/L503769/1","fundValue":"80599","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlotte  Waelde","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
