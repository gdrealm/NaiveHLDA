Current estimates suggest P. falciparum malaria affects 200-300 million people annually, resulting in the death of about 0.8 million individuals. Thus, despite increasing implementation of control measures, the burden of this devastating disease remains far too high. It remains unlikely that vaccines based on the whole parasite organism will be deployable, and therefore most efforts focus on vaccines encoding malaria proteins - so called 'subunit vaccines'. The most advanced malaria subunit vaccine, called RTS,S/AS01 and encoding a protein from the parasite called CSP, is currently in Phase III clinical trials across Africa, with early indications suggesting only 35% efficacy against severe disease in young children. Calls have been made for a second generation vaccine to exert 80% efficacy over four years. If this ambitious rhetoric is to be realised, new approaches to malaria subunit vaccine design are required.\n\nVaccines that elicit functional antibodies formed the foundation of success for 20th century vaccinology - with almost all licensed human products to date protecting individuals through the induction of antibodies. The malaria parasite has a number of complex life-cycle stages, and it is known that numerous stages of this cycle are susceptible to antibodies. These include the infectious sporozoite-stage which infects the liver (targeted by RTS,S), as well as the subsequent blood-stage infection which causes disease as well as the sexual cells that are taken up by mosquitoes in the infected bloodmeal thus leading to further transmission. However, with the exception of RTS,S, antibody-inducing subunit vaccine development for malaria has faced over a decade of disappointment in the clinic. One central reason for this is likely to have been a narrow focus upon malaria proteins which are highly recognised by the immune system in natural infection. As a consequence they have evolved to cope with immune pressure and are highly variable. Similarly, extremely large amounts of antibody are required to neutralise the parasite, and these levels have been difficult to achieve following human vaccination.\n\nWe have recently identified a potential solution to this problem. A protein called PfRH5 appears to perform a function that is essential in order for a parasite to invade red blood cells. It binds a protein called Basigin on the red blood cell's surface and this interaction is critical. Importantly, this interaction can be blocked by low levels of antibody, and even more remarkably, the protein is highly conserved, showing limited variation across lots of different parasite strains. This means antibodies induced by a vaccine can function against all the different types of P. falciparum parasite found in endemic areas. The PfRH5-basigin interaction appears to be the first Achilles' heel identified in the blood-stage parasite.\n\nThis three year programme of work will aim to produce a clinical grade vaccine targeting the PfRH5 protein. We have shown this protein can be made in a system that uses insect cells to make the malaria protein. We will optimise this system, and then develop a production process that is suitable for clinical grade vaccine manufacture. This process will be developed in collaboration with an industrial partner called ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies from Denmark who are world experts in the use of insect cells as a vaccine production system. Once the process has been developed, we will transfer it to a vaccine manufacturing facility at the University of Oxford where the clinical grade material will be produced, put into vials and extensively tested according to stringent quality controls processes. The final output of this research will be a batch of clinical grade PfRH5 protein vaccine. We will subsequently aim to take this new vaccine into early phase clinical trials in healthy adult volunteers in Oxford.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K025554/1","grantId":"MR/K025554/1","fundValue":"1274900","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon John Draper","coPersons":["Alexander Donald Douglas"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
