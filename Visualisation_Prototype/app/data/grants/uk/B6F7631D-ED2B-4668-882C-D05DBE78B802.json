Therefore, plant disease resistance is an important trait to develop in crop plants. Fortunately, plants have evolved a relatively robust defence system to protect themselves from diseases caused by micro-organisms. Understanding how this defence system works will lead to crops that are able to resist microbial infection more effectively, this is especially important at this time of food shortages. Previously, we have demonstrated that S-nitrosylation is a molecular switch that controls the expression of disease resistance against a broad spectrum of potential microbial pathogens in Arabidopsis, a model plant species. Increased S-nitrosylation leads to pathogen susceptibility while decreased S-nitrosylation results in pathogen resistance. Therefore, understanding how plants can regulate the extent of this protein modification may provide us with insights to develop disease resistant crops. By employing a genetics-based strategy, we have identified three genes, SPL1, SPL2 and SPL3 that appear to control the levels of S-nitrosylation during the plant defence response. Utilising standard molecular biology procedures we cloned SPL1 and found it encoded a protein that mediated ubiquintination, another key mechanism to regulate cellular processes in plants. Also, SPL1 contained motifs that suggested it physically interacted with a number of other proteins. Using a variety of molecular and biochemical experimental procedures we will characterise the role of SPL1 in the regulation of S-nitrosylation during the establishment of disease resistance. In a complementary approach, we utilised technology that enabled us to monitor the expression of all known genes in Arabidopsis plant lines that exhibit either increased or decreased amounts of S-nitrosylation. In this way we have identified genes that are directly regulated by changes in the levels of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), the products of S-nitrosylation. Loss-of-function mutations in one of these genes, SRG1, which encodes a zinc finger protein that controls gene expression, results in hypersensitivity to SNOs. Furthermore, SRG1 is S-nitrosylated. These findings suggest that SRG1 senses increasing SNO levels by becoming S-nitrosylated and then subsequently drives the expression of hitherto unidentified genes that protect plants against high levels of SNOs, termed nitrosative stress. By employing state-of-the-art genomics technologies we will identify the DNA binding sites of SRG1 and determine the consequences of this binding on the expression of adjacent genes / non-coding RNAs. We will also explore if prior S-nitrosylation of SRG1 is required to initiate this process. Collectively, this work will provide major insights how S-nitrosylation controls the expression of plant disease resistance. In the long term the results from this project may aid the development of disease resistant crops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H000984/1","grantId":"BB/H000984/1","fundValue":"414675","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We are in discussion with plant biotechnology companies to exploit our findings.

NO can modify protein function by a process called S-nitrosylation. We have identified a two proteins that are targets for this modification. The activity of both of these proteins in plant immunity can be regulated by S-nitrosylation.\nBy manipulating the S-nitrosylation status of these proteins we were able to control plant immunity. These findings provide new insights into how the plant defence system might be manipulate to provide increased resistance against pest and pathogens. Our discoveries will help guide future plant breeding efforts to develop improved crop varieties. As in Arabidopsis, barley homologs of our redox regulated E3 ligase appear to be central to resistance against powdery mildew, an economically important pathogen. A barely powdery mildew effector has been found that interacts with this E3 ligase, highlighting its importance. Selecting for variants of this protein in barley may help guide plant breeding approaches. Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
