{"id":"1FAE519D-AEFA-45DA-BF7F-C0E6FAEF3FDF","title":"Transcriptional control of house keeping genes by Sp1 and histone acetylation: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential","abstractText":"We have recently described a disease caused by a defect in a gene required for the formation of a molecule called GPI. Affected children suffer from life-threatening blood clots and severe epilepsy. \nWe found that in the DNA of these patients, attachment of a molecule called acetyl group, required for the proper function of genes, was very low; and that a drug called butyrate could restore attachment of the acetyl groups and thus restore the function of the gene. Furthermore, treatment of a patient with butyrate led to complete cessation of lifelong and uncontrollable seizures.\n\nWith this work we would like to understand better the role of these acetyl groups in causing disease and how butyrate exerts its beneficial effect. We will also explore whether butyrate can benefit patients with other inherited and often lethal disorders for which no specific treatment exists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802401","grantId":"G0802401","fundValue":"501206","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anastasios  Karadimitris","coPersons":["David Mark Layton"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
