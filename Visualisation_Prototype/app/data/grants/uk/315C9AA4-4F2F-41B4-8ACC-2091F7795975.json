This study will compare five aspects of the surgical procedures used at the time of caesarean section to see which of these aspects is associated with the lowest risk of complications. The five pairs of procedures to be compared are: (a) two different approaches to opening the abdominal wall (?blunt? versus ?sharp?); (b) whether the cut on the womb is repaired while the womb is kept inside the womans pelvis or whether it is repaired outside (extra-abdominal versus intra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision); (c) whether the cut on the womb is closed in one layer of stitches or two (single versus double layer closure of the uterus); (d) whether the peritoneum, which is a thin membrane which covers all the organs inside the abdomen, letting them slide over each other easily, (closure versus non-closure of the pelvic and parietal peritoneum); (e) which of two different types of stitch material should be used for closing the womb and part of the abdominal wall (Vicryl versus catgut sutures for closure of the uterus and rectus sheath).\n\nThe main outcome of the study will be infection in the six weeks following the caesarean section operation. \n\n15,000 women will be recruited from 12 hospitals in 9 different countries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500959","grantId":"G0500959","fundValue":"1823980","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Brocklehurst","coPersons":["Jai Bhagwan Sharma","Matthews  Mathai","Victor  Addo","Edgardo  Abalos","James  Oyieke","Mohamed  El Sheikh","Shabeen Naz Masood"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
