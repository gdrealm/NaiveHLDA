Nearly half of the patients who suffer ARDS die, and many of the survivors have long-term health problems. A small-scale study suggested that intravenous salbutamol given for 7 days early in the course of ARDS may help more patients to survive. This project will determine whether this is correct, by comparing the results among over 1300 patients, half of whom (decided at random) will receive salbutamol and half of whom will receive an inactive solution.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700478","grantId":"G0700478","fundValue":"1965150","fundStart":"2007-12-03","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fang  Gao Smith","coPersons":["Simon  Gates","Sallie  Lamb","Christopher J McCabe","Gavin D Perkins","Vicki  Barber","John Duncan Young"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
