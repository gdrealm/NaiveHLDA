{"id":"D6FAB4FB-2041-4CF2-B0DC-FF8C2EF4446E","title":"Structural and functional fronto-hippocampal maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome following very preterm birth in adulthood","abstractText":"Premature birth is a major public health problem, costing the UK &pound;939m a year. Babies who are premature may suffer many adversities after birth. As they grow up some appear to be at risk of problems relating to health, cognition and behaviour, while others are resilient. These differences may be related to neurodevelopment, the life-long process by which the brain grows and adapts to change. We will work with a unique cohort of individuals who were born prematurely and who have been taking part in a follow-up study from birth to age 19. They are now 28-33 years old. First, we will assess their cognition (including learning disabilities, memory and attention) and mental health, suspecting that many people may be &quot;suffering in silence&quot; with difficulties which are not recognised. Second, we propose to use various neuroimaging techniques to examine how the brain changes as people grow into adults. The aim of the study will be to define for the first time the patterns of brain growth that make a person at risk of poor outcome, as well as those that are associated with developmental resilience. In the future, this information will enable us to develop treatments to reduce or prevent long-term disability in people born prematurely.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K004867/1","grantId":"MR/K004867/1","fundValue":"766317","fundStart":"2013-02-04","fundEnd":"2016-11-07","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chiara  Nosarti","coPersons":["Steven C Williams","Robin  Murray","Matthew  Allin"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
