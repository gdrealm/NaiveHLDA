In each of Moyamba and Bombali Districts, comparisons will be made over two years between two similar, rural chiefdoms, one of which is an intervention condition and the other a comparison condition.</p>\n\n<p>The community-driven intervention includes work by the communities, government actors, and NGOs on preventing teenage pregnancy through a mixture of reproductive health education, family planning, and life skills. A contextually relevant survey instrument will be applied twice at intervals separated by 11 months to random samples of teenage girls and boys (13-19 years) in order to measure changes in risk and well-being outcomes for children. These outcomes were derived from a mixture of local views (in previous stages of the study) and those of international child rights standards.</p>\n\n<p>Through its inter-agency networks, the research will encourage the use of population-based outcomes measures to track the effectiveness of the national child protection system and inform strategies for aligning and linking community mechanisms with government aspects of the child protection system.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J017663/1","grantId":"ES/J017663/1","fundValue":"243842","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Wessells","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Columbia University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
