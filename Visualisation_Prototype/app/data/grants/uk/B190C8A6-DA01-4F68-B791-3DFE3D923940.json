Aberdeen) will perform a key element (WP3.1- &quot;Assessment of cellodextrin\nfermentability by human colonic bacteria in vitro&quot;) of Work package 3 within the TSB project CELLDEX. They will use in\nvitro approaches to assess the fermentability of cellodextrins by human intestinal microorganisms and to predict the likely\nimpact of cellodextrins upon microbial community composition and metabolic outputs. Cellodextrins will be incubated with\nmixed human faecal microbiota under anaerobic conditions using batch cultures and pH-controlled continuous flow\nfermentor models. Molecular approaches will be used to monitor changes in microbial community composition. The major\nproducts of fermentation, short chain fatty acids and gases, will be monitored by gas chromatography and cellodextrin\nutilization will be monitored by analysis of total sugars. The ability of a range of dominant polysaccharide-utilizing\nanaerobes that have been isolated in our laboratory from from the human colon to grow with cellodextrins as a sole energy\nsource will also be assessed here. Together with the results from molecular community analysis, this should provide\ninformation on species likely to be responsible for cellodextrin utilization. This work will precede and inform the planned\nhuman dietary intervention studies to be performed by University of Nottingham.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M013766/1","grantId":"BB/M013766/1","fundValue":"49118","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Harry James Flint","coPersons":["Petra  Louis"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
