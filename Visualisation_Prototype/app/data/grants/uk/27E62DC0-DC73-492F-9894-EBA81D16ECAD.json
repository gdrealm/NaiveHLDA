{"id":"27E62DC0-DC73-492F-9894-EBA81D16ECAD","title":"Terms of Engagement: Muslim and Jewish School Communities, cultural sustainability and maintenance of religious identit","abstractText":"<p>The study provides examination of six full-time, Muslim and Jewish schools in the UK using qualitative methods to explore the social, educational and ideological purpose of these faith-based institutions. Similarities in these schools will be considered with particular reference to religious and cultural sustainability, and engagement with or alienation from the wider community. </p> \n<p>Both Muslim and Jewish schools are representative of faith-based education, where religious knowledge forms the basis for personal and social development. In terms of learning and teaching, both groups are concerned with the quality of Muslim and Jewish education respectively, balanced against the demands of the British National Curriculum. In addition, both Muslim and Jewish school communities have experienced prejudice and in some cases Xenophobia to an extent not experienced by other denominational school communities in the UK, and this has been exacerbated by political events, and the aftermath of 9/11 and 7/7. </p> \n<p>With the proposed expansion of faith-based schooling, due to their perceived success, more knowledge and understanding of this group of schools is required. Despite geographical, historical and cultural differences, the growth of Muslim and Jewish schools in the UK provides important parallels highlighting fundamental issues of community cohesion, group identity and citizenship.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E020372/1","grantId":"ES/E020372/1","fundValue":"70650","fundStart":"2007-05-22","fundEnd":"2008-05-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"MARIE  PARKER-JENKINS","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Derby","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
