However, despite their diversity, all rodents can be assigned to one of just three groups based on the arrangement of the jaw muscles: the squirrel-like rodents (sciuromorphs), the guinea pig-like rodents (hystricomorphs), and the rat-like rodents (myomorphs). Two groups, the sciuromorphs and hystricomorphs, also have distinct modes of feeding - the former are predominantly gnawers whereas the latter are mostly chewers. The myomorphs are generalists and do not specialise in their mode of feeding. This raises a very interesting question - are the differing feeding behaviours and related muscle arrangements driving skeletal form in the rodent skull? Surprisingly, no one has addressed this fundamentally important question, even though rodents are one of the most important groups on the planet in terms of biological research, biodiversity, and environmental health. Our aim is to draw on our collective expertise in imaging, computer modelling and evolutionary biology to address the rodent form and function question by way of three core hypotheses: Firstly, it is hypothesised that the two extreme modes of feeding found among rodents (chewing and gnawing) are associated with notably different patterns of stress and strain across the skull. It is also predicted that rats, which are adapted to both modes of feeding, will show an intermediate pattern of stress and strain. Secondly, it is hypothesised that the different stress/strain patterns will explain differences in the shape of the skull and the attachment points of the muscles between the three groups. The alternative scenario is that other factors such as brain size, body size or evolutionary history are having an equal or greater effect on the skull shape than feeding. Lastly, it is predicted that rats either develop from sciuromorph muscles on a hystricomorph skull or hystricomorph muscles on a sciuromorph skull. This predicts that by modifying guinea pig and squirrel models, we will be able to create a virtual model that closely resembles a rat. To test the above hypotheses, three-dimensional digital models will be reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The models will be analysed using finite element analysis (FEA) - a technique that predicts deformation, strain and stress in a digital structure. These techniques will be used because they are non-invasive, thereby removing the need for live animal experimentation, they provide spatially co-registered data, and also because the digital models can be manipulated to test particular hypotheses or to produce hypothetical morphologies not normally found in nature. The results of this project will lead to a greater understanding of the effect of feeding on the rodent skull and the constraints imposed by the jaw muscles. This will help explain the exceptional evolutionary success of the order Rodentia amongst the mammals, and, in particular, the success of the rats and mice within the rodents. We anticipate that the research will benefit environmental and evolutionary biologists interested in modes of biodiversity and mammalian speciation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G002207/1","grantId":"NE/G002207/1","fundValue":"40413","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael John Fagan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":" Rodents form the largest order (Rodentia) of mammals comprising well over two thousand species.

Surprisingly, no one has addressed this fundamentally important question, even though rodents are one of the most important groups on the planet in terms of biological research, biodiversity, and environmental health. \n\n\n\nWe used three-dimensional digital models reconstructed from computed tomography (CT). The models were analysed using finite element analysis (FEA) - a technique that predicts deformation, strain and stress in a digital structure - which is non-invasive, thereby removing the need for live animal experimentation, and can be manipulated to test particular hypotheses or to produce hypothetical morphologies not normally found in nature\n\n\n\nThe most challenging part was defining the geometry, relative spatial positions (e.g. attachments) and internal morphology of the masticatory muscles. These soft-tissues structures are not readily differentiated on standard microCT and the spatial relationships are destroyed upon dissection. To address the challenge we developed a new method of imaging muscle, referred to as I2KI contrast enhanced microCT. This turned out to provide exquisite detail of muscle in-situ and at very high resolution (&lt;30microns), leading to the first comprehensive comparative study of the musculature. The paper enabled us to resolve several contradictions and discrepancies in the literature regarding the comparative anatomy of the rodent masticatory apparatus and formed the basis of subsequent, more complex modelling papers. The I2KI method is now being applied by a number of colleagues in the biomedical sciences. \n\n\n\nThe first stage of the mathematical modelling work that followed involved a full scale sensitivity analysis. This was critical to providing a context for subsequent work on the biological questions and was amongst the first papers to integrate the power of geometric morphometrics with finite elements analysis to map and understand subtle changes of model performance due to heuristic alterations of, for example, force, geometry and material properties. We conducted a total of 390 models with various permutations. \n\n\n\nOur key findings showed that squirrels are specialist incisor-gnawers and guinea pigs are specialist molar-chewers. This was hypothesised from the diets of these two species. We also showed that rats are high-performance generalists, that is, they have highly efficient bites at both the incisors and molars, thus making them able to feed on a wide variety of foodstuffs. We concluded that this ability may well have led to the evolutionary success of the rats, and potentially the myomorph rodents as a whole.
