Against a turbulent policy background, the profession of careers guidance is, once again, is at a crossroads.</p>\n\n<p>A recent governmental Task Force Report on the Careers Profession (October, 2010) crystallises fundamental challenges for careers guidance related to its fragmentation; the loss of occupational identity in its practitioners; the inability to recruit and retain a diverse, high calibre workforce; and the consequent difficulties in delivering professional practice of a consistently high standard that integrates research with theory. Services are, once again, under review across all four home countries of the UK.<br />The aims of this seminar series were to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>explore the professional identities of UK careers guidance and careers practitioners</li>\n\n <li>foster dialogue amongst key stakeholders</li>\n\n <li>contribute to policy discussions about the future shape of services and building workforce capacity.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The series comprised 6 one-day seminars, based at universities across the four home countries and in the Irish Republic. Seminars were highly interactive, to foster interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral dialogue, using methods to maximise participant engagement.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I002464/1","grantId":"ES/I002464/1","fundValue":"18316","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Margaret Bimrose","coPersons":["Sally-Anne  Barnes","Laurie  Cohen","John  Arnold"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
