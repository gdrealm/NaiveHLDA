{"id":"C1ADFB00-0D96-4D0B-9824-C0E84E672645","title":"Their Crime is Being Born: Children born of war in the 20th century","abstractText":"Children fathered by (foreign) soldiers and born to local women (children born of war - CBOW) have been a feature of warfare for centuries, yet they have remained largely unnoticed by public and academia. \\nThe network plans to bring together researchers and practitioners seeking to develop a better understanding of the issues affecting CBOW. This will include historians, social scientists, philosophers, lawyers, ethicists and psychiatrists, the majority of whom already have established research records in their own fields. In addition, military personnel, NGOs dealing with children born of war in recent conflicts, policy makers (e.g. in the UN) and psychiatrists will be integrated in workshops and related research projects. \\nThe network will focus on \\n- the collation and dissemination of existing literature, of previously collected survey and other data relating to children born of war in general and children of child soldiers (CCS) and of peace keepers (CP) in particular \\n- the development of an understanding of the specific problems experienced by CCS and CP through the facilitation of cross-disciplinary dialogue in the form of collaborative workshops involving academic researchers as well as practitioners and representatives of NGOs working with CBOW\\n- the adaptation of existing tools providing computer-assisted therapeutic help to discriminated, stigmatized and traumatized children for work with CBOW\\n- the utilisation of anonymised information provided by CBOW and their mothers through computer-assisted therapies on a larger scale to facilitate a better understanding of the situation of children and to allow a comparative analysis of CBOW, and particularly CCS and CP. \\nThe above aims will be achieved through \\n- A two-day round-table \\n- A three-day workshop on CBOW during and after World War II \\n- Simultaneous three-day workshops of the working groups on CCS and CP \\n- A concluding two-day conference\\n\\nCore foci of the interdisciplinary meetings are:\\n1) CBOW during and after Second World War: This is the only group of CBOW for which significant research data exists that allows an assessment of medium and long-term effects of traumatisation and discrimination. A working group will investigate the possibility of extending survey research previously carried out in Norway and Denmark to other geographical areas and to more recent conflicts in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the life courses of CBOW. \\n2) CCS and CP: Taking preliminary studies of CCS and CP as a starting point, a working group consisting of trauma researchers and front-line practitioners as well as social scientists will investigate the possibility of adapting virtual trauma psychotherapeutic approaches for work with CBOW. Furthermore, an interdisciplinary workshop involving among others psychiatrists, lawyers, social scientists and practitioners will examine the potential utilisation of data obtained in the process of computer-assisted testimonial therapy in order to study the life courses of CBOW in different historical settings. The development of a collaborative research agenda will focus on the use of a Multilingual Computer Assisted Self Interview, hitherto tested primarily by treating post-traumatic stress disorder in war victims. This tool that allows (illiterate) individuals to answer standardized questionnaires can overcome some key difficulties in treating war victims, displaced people and children, namely illiteracy, geographical limitations and/or limitations concerning psychotherapeutic treatment capacity. The working group will examine the potential of developing standardized questionnaires, taking into account the needs of the children in their distinct setting. Moreover, the group will further explore specific research issues to be identified by the interdisciplinary research team, taking into account the necessary ethical considerations associated with research in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J001554/1","grantId":"AH/J001554/1","fundValue":"35950","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings currently feed into a project (Marie Curie IIF) aimed at the drafting for guidelines for the child-sensitive post-conflict reconstruction in Africa, with particular emphasis on consideration of the situation of Children Born of War.

Findings are currently informing several further studies on CBOW in Europe and Africa. Exchange of improved methodological understanding and development of new instruments are being utilised by several research groups linked through the network. Furthermore, insights from the network are being communicated to the FCO initiative on the prevention of gender-based violence in conflict, and exchange of data with UNICEF and UNSRSG Bangura and Zerrougui is being discussed.
