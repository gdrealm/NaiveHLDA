{"id":"87499735-597E-45C7-82BF-23DA5B340F57","title":"Know Your Bristol On The Move","abstractText":"Place is fixed, but people move. Bristol's peoples move through life and across the city; they move to it and out of it; they move across the globe, and - sometimes - back again. This fluidity runs along and around fixity: ties to people and places elsewhere, which link individuals and the city itself to other points around the world, as well as the immobilities of 'marginalised' communities. This project explores strategies and tools - digital and otherwise - to trace and link the fluid and the fixed.\n\nKnow Your Bristol On The Move builds on a track record of community co-production initiatives and the 2012-13 AHRC 'Know Your Bristol' and 'Know Your Bristol Stories' projects, collaborations with Bristol City Council's Know Your Place (KYP) team and community partners, which developed a heritage research co-production toolkit. This helped partners develop community archives to support their own research, and showcased how they could be used in the KYP web resource www.bristol.gov.uk/knowyourplace. This award-winning resource, launched in March 2011, provides greater access to archives, encourages community interaction with and reuse of this material, informs neighbourhood planning exercises, and enhances Bristol City Council records through direct community, or crowd-sourced contributions to the Historic Environment Record (HER). \n\nOur project asks key questions:\n\n1) how does the collection, interconnection and presentation of contemporary, crowdsourced digital materials created and shaped through community partnerships generate new understandings of history on the move?\n2) how do mobility and longer histories of dwelling affect people's senses of place and how might this be visualised with digital mapping tools?\n3) what are the conceptual and technical challenges involved creating digital networks across different archival sources, existing tools and institutional structures?\n4) how might the intellectual property inherent in cultural heritage be shared across communities, research institutions and the public sector and what questions about ownership and data management might be generated by different approaches to web-based tools and mobile applications? \n5) how might communities co-develop archival frameworks to include domestic and informal materials that produce new understandings and experiences of place?\n6) as one size will not fit all and given the diversities of (and within) communities concerned, what repertoires of complementary tools and approaches might best support and enable different 'types' of group?\n\nTo answer these questions, the project will create: a mobile view of the existing KYP site, a new platform for community digital mapping, as well as two new apps for it. A 'Know Your Bus' will form a different kind of sustainable mobile platform: a space for digital creation and co-production of research and learning, an equipped space that can travel to sites &amp; communities. We will augment an archive at the heart of the Council's infrastructure, and we will explore the creation of mobile archives, treasure chests for family history. We will work with 8 different communities, co-developing and assessing different portfolios of tools for community research, deploying high-, low- and no-tech, working with makers, artists, software developers, the old, the young, communities of interest and communities of place. We will build on the City Council &amp; University of Bristol collaboration, as well as related activity more widely within the university and city.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L007576/1","grantId":"AH/L007576/1","fundValue":"474946","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Bickers","coPersons":["Justin Arthur  Williams","Michael Stuart  Gulliver","Timothy  Cole","Josie  McLellan","Angela Ann Piccini","Robert  Skinner"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
