The availability and use of assisted reproductive treatments are subject to the specific socio-legal contexts of nation states, but at the same time global interaction is evident in both the development of such technologies and in their clinical application. There are indications that, for a variety of reasons, individuals and couples from many developed countries are increasingly travelling outside their home states in their quest for a child. Through an analysis of what is popularly constructed as 'fertility tourism', this project seeks to deepen the understanding of transnational aspects of assisted reproduction, and to provide recommendations for user support and regulatory policy. </p>\n\n<p>Using a qualitative methodology, the study aims to explore the motivations, understandings and experiences of UK based individuals who travel abroad for assisted reproductive treatment. The study consists of three phases; a scoping phase to explore the national and international literature; an interview study with those actively considering or undertaking overseas treatment, and a stakeholder workshop bringing together service users, academics, practitioners, infertility support groups and regulators to reflect on the findings, debate the issues and suggest action points for different stakeholder groups. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3390","grantId":"RES-000-22-3390","fundValue":"82824","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lorraine  Culley","coPersons":["Allan  Pacey","Eric  Blyth","Nicky  Hudson","WENDY JANE  NORTON","Frances Laura Rapport"],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
