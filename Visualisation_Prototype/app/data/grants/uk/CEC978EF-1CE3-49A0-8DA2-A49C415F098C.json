Within the muscle cell, calcium acts as a signal to activate contraction and hence movement. Our recent work, using embryonic muscle, suggests a new role for calcium signals in the regulation of cell structure. The internal organisation of the muscle cell is important for force generation during contraction. There are several disease conditions in which the cellâ€™s calcium balance is altered and muscle function breaks down. \nOur aim is to understand the role that calcium signals play in healthy muscle cell structure. Muscle cells can be isolated and grown in dishes but they lose many of their original properties. Therefore, we have developed approaches to study muscles developing in their natural environment within the embryo. We use the zebrafish as a vertebrate model because the eggs are transparent and developing tissues can be viewed easily. Establishing the action of calcium in the muscle cell and defining how the signal works will yield important basic scientific information, contribute to our understanding of disease and offers the potential for developing new treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700216","grantId":"G0700216","fundValue":"243788","fundStart":"2008-01-28","fundEnd":"2009-07-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  Ashworth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
