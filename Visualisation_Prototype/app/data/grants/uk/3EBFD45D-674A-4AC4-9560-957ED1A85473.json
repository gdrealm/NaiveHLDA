Although nearly all children are infected with RSV by 2 years of age, immunity following natural infection is incomplete and re-infections are common throughout life. In healthy adults, RSV usually causes symptoms similar to those of the common cold. However, diseases can be severe in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. There is currently no effective vaccine and previous attempts at vaccination of infants, using an inactivated virus vaccine, resulted in enhanced respiratory disease following RSV infection. The relatively ineffective immune response induced by RSV infection and the spectre of vaccine-enhanced disease have confounded attempts to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine. There is currently no anti-viral treatment for RSV, although individuals at high risk of severe disease can be given regular injections of an antibody preparation during the winter months. There is, therefore, a clear need for a safe and effective RSV vaccine. The aim of this project is the preclinical characterization of a viral vectored RSV vaccine that stimulates protective antibody and cellular immune responses. Simian adenovirus vectors, which do not replicate or cause disease in man and which are not neutralized by pre-existing immunity induced by human adenovirus infection will be used either alone, or in a heterologous prime-boost strategy with poxvirus MVA vectors. MVA is an attenuated virus which has been used to safely and successfully vaccinate over 120,000 humans against smallpox. To this end, different chimpanzee adenovirus (AdCh) vectors and an attenuated poxvirus MVA vector expressing RSV antigens will be generated and tested for antigen expression, productivity, genetic stability and immunogenicity in mice. Once the best candidate AdCh-RSV vector has been identified, it will be evaluated for its ability to induce protective immunity against RSV in a mouse and cotton rat model of RSV infection, and also in calves, a natural infection model of RSV. The proposed study will provide Proof of Concept that vaccination with an AdCh-RSV vector protects animals against RSV infection and will lead directly to translation of the findings into clinical trials in man.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J014648/1","grantId":"MR/J014648/1","fundValue":"522059","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Geraldine  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
