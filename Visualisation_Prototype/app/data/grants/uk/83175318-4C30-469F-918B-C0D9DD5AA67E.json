These clocks regulate the behaviour and physiology of the animal, including sleep-wake times, body temperature etc. These clocks also regulate events within each cell, such as, for example, what time of day certain genes get turned on. In comparison, very few studies have looked at clocks in developing embryos, and even fewer at how the clock might actually start 'ticking'. This proposal aims to explore this issue, taking advantage of the zebrafish model system, which is well established as a tool for the study of early developmental events. We know that the mother deposits the products of key clock genes into the developing embryo. These RNA products breakdown with perfect timing, so as to generate a circadian oscillation on the first day of life. How is this achieved? We believe that molecules, called microRNAs, play a key role in this event, by timing the degradation of these clock molecules. Using newly discovered mutants, we aim to see if this is really the case, and how these microRNAs function to make the clock itself work and tell time. We also aim to make new cell lines in culture, from these mutant embryos, allowing us to explore in great detail how these microRNAs control clock genes to produce these daily changes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I003592/1","grantId":"BB/I003592/1","fundValue":"461041","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-10-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Whitmore","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" A major discovery has been to identify the large number of developmentally relevant genes that are under clock control during early zebrafish embryogenesis. This includes numerous miRNAs (not yet published). In addition we studied direct brain light sensitivity in the larvae and adult brain, and explored the role of melanopsin in the retina, and other neural tissue. It is of significance and general interest to all groups working on embryo development and circadian clocks. Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
