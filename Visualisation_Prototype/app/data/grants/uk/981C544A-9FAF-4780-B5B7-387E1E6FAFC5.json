{"id":"981C544A-9FAF-4780-B5B7-387E1E6FAFC5","title":"Decolonizing Voices: World Literature and Broadcast Culture at the End of Empire","abstractText":"&quot;Decolonizing Voices&quot; is a research project that investigates the interconnected history of radio broadcasting and literary production across three continents in the period 1945-1968. The study employs a mixture of scholarly approaches, including literary criticism, global book history, biographical writing and cultural studies. Focusing on the loosely articulated networks of literary and cultural production in the Anglophone Caribbean, the work of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in Accra, and the mediating role played by the BBC Colonial Service, we will examine the involvement of these networks and institutions in shaping the stylistic and political contours of emerging world literatures in the twentieth century. The project aims to map out how cultural forms such as novels, poems, and short stories circulate through publishing and media channels across the globe, and the ways in which this circulation is rendered highly uneven by unequal international power relations, which are often the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. These inequalities are frequently manifested in the pressures placed on writers and artists from colonized and formerly colonized countries by publishing houses, broadcast institutions, and market forces.\n\nThe project will be based around archival research into material in the Caribbean, the UK, and West Africa, much of which is relatively unexplored. This material includes transcripts, letters, and programme information relating to various radio series broadcast in the Caribbean and Ghana in the 1940s and 1950s, including 'Caribbean Voices' and 'West African Voices'. These showcased the work of authors from those regions and were important in providing access for a wider public to discussions about literary, cultural and political issues during an era in which colonial rule was ending and the prospect of national independence was on the horizon. The project is unique in that it will bring together archival material currently scattered across three continents, examining this through a global optic attentive to the uneven circulation of cultural forms.\n\nThe project will make use of exclusive access to the papers, diaries, and letters of the BBC producer Henry Swanzy. Swanzy's career is indicative of the connections that existed between literary and broadcast histories across the three continents, having produced 'Caribbean Voices' between 1946-54, before becoming Head of Programmes for the Gold Coast Broadcasting System in Accra in 1954. Moreover, Swanzy's writings in his diaries provide a wealth of stories about working life both at the BBC and abroad, while also registering key cultural trends and the social and political upheavals of the post-war era. One of the principal aims of the project is to investigate how the BBC was enmeshed in the political discussions over race and immigration at the time.\n\n&quot;Decolonizing Voices&quot; will produce a series of outputs both for an academic and a wider audience, including a popular critical edition of Swanzy's memoirs, as well as scholarly writings (articles, a short monograph) on the interconnections between literary and broadcast histories informed by recent debates on world literature and the politics of literary value. Another key output of the project will be a radio programme to be broadcast on the BBC World Service and stations in the Caribbean and Ghana. The programme will examine the importance of the historical relationships between media institutions, programme makers, and literary magazine series in the era of decolonization. Our programme, in revisiting these relationships, will help to inform and enhance discussions over the function and future of public service broadcasting in a &quot;globalized age&quot;.\n\nIn these ways, the &quot;Decolonizing Voices&quot; project will make a vital contribution to an understanding of the relationships between literary production, the role of broadcasting as a medium of cultural expression, and the legacies of empire.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007491/1","grantId":"AH/K007491/1","fundValue":"197010","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Niblett","coPersons":["Stewart  Brown","Christopher  Campbell"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
