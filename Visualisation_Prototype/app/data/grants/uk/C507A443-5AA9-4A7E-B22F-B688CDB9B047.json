{"id":"C507A443-5AA9-4A7E-B22F-B688CDB9B047","title":"Modeling Integration Effects in Language with Probabilistic Logic","abstractText":"<br />A basic result of research in linguistics and psycholinguistics is that language processing relies on information from a variety of sources, such as syntax, semantics and discourse. This project is primarily concerned with cases where these information sources provide conflicting cues to the overall meaning of an utterance. Such conflicts provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms underlying language use, and have therefore been the subject of extensive experimental study. However, to date, no large-scale computational models are capable of simulating the results of the vast experimental literature.\n<br />\n<br />Given the increasing importance of computational modeling to psycholinguistics, it is therefore a main goal of this project to develop a model which simulates the relevant behaviour and can be applied to arbitrary linguistic input. Building a model of interactions between syntax and semantics is by no means trivial: state-of-the-art computational models of syntactic and semantic comprehension use incompatible methodologies. A novel contribution of the proposed work is to use Probabilistic Logic, which opens the possibility of resolving difficulties arsing from these methodological differences.\n<br />\n<br />In tandem with the development of the model, a series of reading experiments will be run, which will provide primary data to be modelled.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1450","grantId":"RES-062-23-1450","fundValue":"273034","fundStart":"2009-03-30","fundEnd":"2012-06-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Amit  Dubey","coPersons":["Patrick  Sturt","Frank  Keller","Alex  Lascarides"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
