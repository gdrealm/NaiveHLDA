This has already led to a number of ongoing collaborative projects some of which are funded by EU or NIH. We expect this will continue to generate more outputs in areas of immune competent tissue models and immune-bioengineering.

Key skills developed during this sabbatical include use of photo cross-linking in micropatterning, cell encapsulation and developing 3D hydrogel based scaffolds. Such techniques complemented other strategies we use in developing 3D tissue models including the immunocompetent lung model we are developing as part of a BBSRC funded project. With help from my host research group at Harvard University we have now established the technology for fabrication of microppatterned hydrogels in our laboratory at the University of Nottingham. Such micropatterned scaffolds underpin a number of research projects within my laboratory. Another skill developed during this sabbatical was fabrication of microwells that enable establishing microscale single and co-cultures. Activities during this sabbatical also led to securing major research grant from the European Commission.  Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
