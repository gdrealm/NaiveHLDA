{"id":"C1EC14B0-8167-46E5-B0B0-3C53AA0A3898","title":"Housing Supply and Planning Delay","abstractText":"<p>UK housebuilding proposals need to be approved by Local Planning Authorities. Concern exists over delays in the evaluation of proposals and the negotiation of required changes. In practice, several factors may account for the time a new housing proposal takes to win planning permission. Some factors&nbsp;may be due to planning, others are related to&nbsp;the ways in which proposals are formulated and&nbsp;specific site characteristics may also play a part. </p> \n<p>Currently, there is little firm detailed empirical evidence on the causes of delay and this project aims to address this issue. The research will collect data on the time taken to gain planning permission for selected recent major housing projects from a sample of local authorities in southern England and key characteristics of those developments. The whole chain of events will be covered, including re-submissions and appeals. </p> \n<p>This information will then be analysed through ‘hedonic’ statistical techniques commonplace in housing economics but novel in the planning delay debate to highlight the factors determining the time development proposals take in the planning process. The results will then be discussed with planners and developers to explore the extent to which they offer insights and suggest improvements to the planning pipeline.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2115","grantId":"RES-000-22-2115","fundValue":"77955","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Ball","coPersons":["Philip  Allmendinger"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
