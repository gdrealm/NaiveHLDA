If we understand the way in which the body normally deals with these infections we might be able to enhance these mechanisms, particularly important as antibiotic resistant microbes are emerging in increasing numbers. In addition, as the systems that are toxic to microbes can also damage normal tissues, this understanding can also be used to limit damaging inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. The most important cells involved in protecting the body against these infection are the neutrophils, the most numerous of the white blood cells. A key question is whether the enzyme myeloperoxidase acts to generate a toxic molecule, hypochlorous acid which is present in bleach, or to remove hydrogen peroxide from within the leukocyte. We will combine our expertise in different scientific disciplines to answer this fundamental question.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700050","grantId":"G0700050","fundValue":"337592","fundStart":"2007-11-22","fundEnd":"2010-11-21","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tony  Segal","coPersons":["Peter Ronald Rich"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
