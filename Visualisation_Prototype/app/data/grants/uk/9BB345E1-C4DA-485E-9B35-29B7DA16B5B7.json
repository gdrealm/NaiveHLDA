CCPN works to promote collaboration between NMR software developers and to make better software available to the NMR user community. Our goal is to ensure that the different NMR programs can work together and use each others' results in a seamless fashion. Secondly, we want to make sure that all the results can easily be collated and made available to others. We also arrange meetings and workshops to define, and spread knowledge about the best ways of working. Since the CCPN started in 2000, we have defined a standard way of describing scientific data in our particular area. To make it easier to write programs that read and write data in this standard form, we have developed large program libraries for this purpose. We have also written a new program for the analysis of NMR spectra, and we have worked with other groups to adapt their programs to use data defined in this standard way. It is now possible to determine the structure of a protein by NMR spectroscopy, using only programs that use data in this standard form. We have additionally written programs to make it easier to write and maintain the data standard and its program libraries, and we have arranged workshops and annual conferences. In this new application we wish to expand the work we have begun to cover a wider area and to make it useful for more people. The data standard needs to have more program libraries, so that it can also be used by people who want to work in programming languages like C, C++ or Perl. It also has to work better with databases and with very large projects that generate lots of data every day. The data standard should be expanded to cover newer NMR methods, NMR data-processing, structure determination by X-ray crystallography, and other ways of analysing proteins. Our NMR analysis program should be expanded to cover the additional NMR disciplines, more tasks and different ways of working. We will use the results to work with other groups, making their programs work with the data standard. We have contacted many groups that write programs for NMR spectroscopy, and we hope that eventually many of the programs that people use in NMR spectroscopy will work together using the CCPN data standard. We are also talking to groups that work in related areas of biophysics - bioinformatics, protein target selection, large-scale production of proteins, biophysical analysis of proteins, large-scale structure determination, metabolite analysis, drug candidate screening, and analysis of the huge amounts of data all this generates - and we work to make sure that the programs that are used in NMR spectroscopy and in related areas of biophysics can all talk to each other.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E005071/1","grantId":"BB/E005071/1","fundValue":"861455","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  As an ongoing collaborative computing project, CCPN serves as promoter of an NMR community with a common computing environment. CCPN maintains the data exchange standard for the field, has a central role in collaborations to deliver software integration and pipelines, and maintains the only fully capable long-lived NMR analysis platform. These efforts feed into making NMR analysis tools more capable, easier and faster to use, increasing the productivity of the scientists that use them. The impact of CCPN follows from this increased productivity. \n\nOne measure of impact is simply the take-up of the CcpNmr software suite. As of end 2011 the major program, CcpNmr Analysis, has about 1000 users at over 150 sites worldwide, with CcpNmr FormatConverter used even more widely. The CcpNmr suite is emerging as the dominant program for solid state NMR anlysis, and has recently been extended to metabolomics. CCPN software and data standards play a key role in the deposition of data at the wwDPB and BioMagResBank, and in the remediation and re-use of already deposited data. CCPN is a key member of WeNMR, the European collaboration providing Grid computing and software pipelines for NMR. The impact is not limited to academia. Results deposited in public databases are a crucial resource also for companies in the field of biochemistry. As of end 2011 nine companies, mainly large multinationals, are paying to use the CcpNmr software suite for pharmaceutical or agrochemical research. Many of these are actively collaborating in the development of the new CcpNmr program for drug candidate screening by NMR.\n\nCCPN plays an important role in training future researchers in the field of NMR, both through its conferences, designed to introduce young researchers to best practice in the NMR field, and through training courses run by CCPN. One private company, SpronkNMR of Vilnius, Lithuania, is running courses in the use of CcpNmr software on a commercial basis.

This is a computer-intensive field, involving large amounts of data. Each study is analysed through several independent steps of automatic and interactive programs, and detailed results are deposited in public databases. It has been difficult for programs to exchange data, and in general to maintain consistency and control for the large amounts of data. \n\nCCPN produces and maintains:\n\n- The CCPN data exchange standard for NMR and macromolecular structure, that allows data to be exchanged, organised, and stored; extensive subroutine libraries to support programs using the data standard; the MEMOPS code generation framework to generate and maintain synchronized subroutine libraries in different computing languages.\n\n- The CcpNmr suite of programs for visualization and analysis of macromolecular NMR spectra, distributed for Windows, Linux and Mac computers, with facilities for a broad range of tasks, and converting data from external formats.\n\n- Collaboration on integrating third-party NMR software, so that programs can be run easily from a single starting point and can make use of results from each other. \n\n\nDuring the granting period, the Memops data modelling machinery has been rewritten, to be more reliable, easier to maintain, and to extend to new subroutine libraries. Four sets of libraries are now supported: Python+XML, C+XML, Java+XML, and Java+SQL, the latter using Hibernate for database communication. Data storage handling has been reorganised to fit better with database storage, the framework now supports a richer set of data structures, and data backwards compatibility is built into the data reading. The data model has been extended in a number of NMR-related areas, and to support software integration (se below).\n\nThe CcpNmr suite has been improved: The user interface has been made more intuitive, support has been added for solid state NMR, use of matrix decomposed spectra, NMR data analysis, and other topics. Both pre-compiled and source code versions are now released, and a system of automatic distribution of software patches has been added.\n\nCCPN has made a major effort in integrating third party software, mainly as a collaborator in the Extend-NMR, EUNMR and NMR-Life EU projects. The result is a separate software pipeline, combining access to programs TOPSPIN, MDD and PRODECOMP (data processing), MARS (automatic NMR assignment), DANGLE (torsion angle estimation from chemical shifts) ARIA (structure determination), MECCANO (structure determination from RDC), ISD (Bayesian structure determination), Haddock (data-driven docking), CING (validation), and data deposition to PDB and BMRB. CCPN has collaborated with the EUROCarbDB project for storing carbohydrate data, with Global Phasing Ltd. on the possible use of CCPN modelling technology for crystallography data standards, and with the PIMS and HalX projects on LIMS system development.\n\nCCPN has continued the series of yearly UK conferences aimed at introducing young researchers to best practice in the NMR field, has run 16 courses and workshops on the use of our software and code base, and 24 talks, demonstrations and collaboration visits across the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. As of 2014 the CCPN project is continuing to support and develop the results obtained so far, financed by a mixture of research council funding, user fees, and paid cooperation agreements with both industrial (Novartis) and academic groups (Imperial College, London). The yearly UK NMR conference and the program of user courses and tutorials both continue to be supported, and the number of users keeps growing, lately with the addition of a number of research groups at Imperial College. \nCCPN is Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
