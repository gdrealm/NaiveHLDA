{"id":"D23BF129-B7CC-4BEA-83E2-8EB9D0EDBF17","title":"The evolution of school mathematics discourse as seen through the lens of GCSE examinations","abstractText":"<p>The aim of the project is to investigate what has changed since the introduction of the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) examination in 1988 in the mathematics that pupils are expected to learn and the ways in which they are expected to approach mathematical activity. The study will provide insight into how changes in curriculum and assessment may affect pupils' mathematical learning.</p>\n\n<p>A sample of examination papers chosen from critical points in the development of the mathematics curriculum and GCSE examinations will be analysed, probing not only the content but also the ways in which pupils are expected to engage with and respond to the tasks. Tools for analysis, based on existing frameworks for analysing mathematical texts, will be developed to meet the objectives of the study. The validity of the analysis will be confirmed in consultation with an expert focus group.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>A group of current school pupils will be given a selection of questions taken from the sample of examination papers. Analysis of their written responses together with follow-up task-based interviews will investigate how differences in the ways the questions are posed may affect the ways pupils approach the mathematics.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2880","grantId":"RES-062-23-2880","fundValue":"234080","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Candia  Morgan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
