{"id":"2734F56F-3DD9-4F4B-B7A3-19CBADB5B60C","title":"Network on the Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems","abstractText":"Robots, driverless cars, unmanned air vehicles, etc, can all be built now. However, the main barriers holding back the widespread use of robotics and autonomous systems can be seen as societal: what should the legal framework be for such systems; how can the public come to trust these systems; how can we ensure they are safe; and how do we know such a system will make the decisions we would expect of it? All these are currently impossible to solve with any certainty.\n\nThe UK has numerous key research developments concerning the Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) of autonomous systems that can all impact upon this problem. These are clearly of relevance to methods for designing, constructing and deploying autonomous systems but also have importance to Psychology (e.g. social robotics), Philosophy (e.g. machine ethics), and Law (e.g. certification). Constructing autonomous systems without behaviour guarantees can lead to serious outcomes, and may consequently hold back the widespread adoption of these systems. \n\nThis Network will coalesce this activity, drive the research agenda forward, and embed the necessity for V&amp;V firmly within industry, the government, and the public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M027309/1","grantId":"EP/M027309/1","fundValue":"107725","fundStart":"2015-08-31","fundEnd":"2018-08-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Fisher","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
