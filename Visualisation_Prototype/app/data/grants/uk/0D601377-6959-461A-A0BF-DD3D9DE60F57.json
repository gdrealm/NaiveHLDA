Targets and endpoints for drug development","abstractText":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (or emphysema and chronic bronchitis) is a family of lung diseases usually but not always caused by cigarette smoking. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat this condition since existing therapies are insufficiently effective. Importantly in more advanced disease complications outside the lung become as important as the lung disease itself and in fact one of the most effective treatments, pulmonary rehabilitation (supervised exercise training) is thought to work in large part by improving the strength and function of the walking muscles; thus we believe a drug which could magnify or extend the benefit of this treatment would be every useful. Thus the aim of this work package is to bring together the groups interested this field in Great Britain with selected drug companies. Three stages of the WP are described. In the first we will assess what material is available and whether, by sharing, the consortium can achieve some ?quick wins? which will facilitate the development of drugs or ideas already known to the participants. In the second we will do some detailed studies which will relate actual rates of protein synthesis in the leg muscles to more readily accessible measures that can be obtained from blood or muscle since this will allow the latter measures to guide drug development more reliably. As part of this work we will also build the largest ever cohort of COPD patients from whom a muscle biopsy and clinical data are available. Lastly we will study patients around the time of rehabilitation (which improves muscle function) and acute exacerbation (which worsens it) to try to identify further targets for new drugs","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001362","grantId":"G1001362","fundValue":"1026750","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael I Polkey","coPersons":["Anthony  De Soyza","Paul  Greenhaff","Charlotte Emma Bolton","Paul  Kemp","William  MacNee","Michael  Steiner","John  Moxham"],"organisation":"Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Fdn Trust","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
