In 2004 there were over 100,000 doctors practising within the National Health Service, 45 per cent of those qualified from non-EU medical schools, 40 per cent from UK medical schools and 15 per cent from within the EU. The study aims to examine and compare the experiences of UK, EU (non UK) and non-EU qualified doctors making the transition to the UK workplace and explore whether factors can be identified which contribute to success or failure in this transition. </p> \n<p>The proposed research will be mainly a qualitative study involving UK, EU and non EU trainee doctors. The target sample will be 60 in each group. The trainees will be interviewed prior to starting the F1 placement and followed up at the end of their first F1 placement. In addition trainees will be asked for consent to access their assessment data to identify any common areas of strength or weakness and identify any differences between UK, EU and non EU graduates. Perceptions of educational supervisors and clinicians working with these trainees will also be obtained.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-153-25-0097","grantId":"RES-153-25-0097","fundValue":"107803","fundStart":"2007-07-09","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Janet Christina Illing","coPersons":["Charlotte  Kergon"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
