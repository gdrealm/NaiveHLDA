The bacteria replicate inside host cells, in a membrane-bound compartment called a vacuole. In order to replicate, bacteria must interfere with normal cellular processes. They accomplish this by assembling a needle-like structure on their cell surface, through which virulence proteins can be discharged across the vacuole membrane into the host cell. But before this happens, some other bacterial proteins pass through the needle and make a small hole or 'pore' in the vacuole membrane. During this time, virulence protein secretion is held in check by a specific 'safety catch', within the bacterial cell. We found recently that once the pore is assembled, the bacteria recognize the mild pH of the host cytoplasm and exploit it as a signal to trigger disassembly of the safety catch, which then allows virulence proteins to be delivered. This process is absolutely crucial for the bacteria, because if they cannot deliver these proteins they cannot replicate. Therefore the purpose of this proposal is to study, at a detailed molecular level, the way in which the safety catch responds to the pH signal. The approaches that we will take to tackle this question are well established in my laboratory, and the results may have potential applications in the design of vaccines against Salmonella and also for new antibiotics that interfere with the ability of the bacteria to respond to the pH signal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I007199/1","grantId":"BB/I007199/1","fundValue":"403293","fundStart":"2011-04-04","fundEnd":"2014-04-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David W Holden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" we identified key amino acids in the gatekeeper protein and an inner membrane protein that are required for the translocon to effector switch in the salmonella spi-2 type iii secretion system. we hope to continue to work on the sensor and to publish our work, which might then provide the basis for others to carry out follow-up studies.
