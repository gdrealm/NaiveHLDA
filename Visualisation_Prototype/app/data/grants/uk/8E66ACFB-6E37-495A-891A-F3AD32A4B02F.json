A long-term goal is to reconstruct the dynamics from the topology of the attractor.Inverse limit spaces were shown by Williams to be an effective tool to investigate hyperbolic attractors, and for Henon-like attractors, the bonding map of these inverse limit spaces are unimodal maps of the interval.This project aims at extending methods that are understood for inverse limit spaces based on periodic bonding maps to the general case to gain a better understanding of Ingram's conjecture (the main conjecture in the field of unimodal inverse limit spaces) and apply theseresults to classify Henon-like attractors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F037112/1","grantId":"EP/F037112/1","fundValue":"22150","fundStart":"2008-02-27","fundEnd":"2008-08-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hendrik Pieter  Bruin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
