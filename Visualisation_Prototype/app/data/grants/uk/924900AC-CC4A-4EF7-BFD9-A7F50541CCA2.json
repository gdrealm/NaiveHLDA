{"id":"924900AC-CC4A-4EF7-BFD9-A7F50541CCA2","title":"Functional Characterisation of Novel Disease Susceptibility Genes in the Human Major Histocompatibility Complex","abstractText":"Our immune system is critical to our ability to fight bacterial and viral infections. It is controlled by a large number of proteins which are found on the surface of cells that circulate in the blood called T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. Some of these cell surface proteins are directly involved in the recognition and elimination of bacteria and viruses from the body. However, this cannot happen without the help of other cell surface proteins which allow lymphocytes and macrophages to interact with one another and this stimulates or dampens down the immune response. Unfortunately, sometimes the immune response gets out of control and begins to attack oneâ€™s own tissue. The results of this are conditions called autoimmune diseases, a common example of which is Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to characterise two of these cell surface proteins which lie in a region of the human genome associated with susceptibility to Rheumatoid Arthritis, to understand their roles in the normal immune response through identifying which cells they are found on and which other cell surface proteins they interact with. By combining this functional characterisation with research to identify the differences which exist in these cell surface proteins in different people we hope to understand how these proteins can cause some people to be more susceptible to developing Rheumatoid Arthritis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600681","grantId":"G0600681","fundValue":"818461","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Duncan Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
