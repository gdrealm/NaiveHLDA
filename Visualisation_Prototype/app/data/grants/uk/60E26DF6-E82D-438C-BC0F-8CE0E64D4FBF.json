{"id":"60E26DF6-E82D-438C-BC0F-8CE0E64D4FBF","title":"The use of incentives in the formation of healthy lifestyle habits following the school to work transition","abstractText":"This work will test an intervention to promote and maintain healthy lifestyle habits in young people leaving school for work. We will also test whether incentives can be used to prompt such changes. Young people with low incomes and social resources are at particular risk of developing risky health behaviours (e.g., poor diet and an inactive lifestyle); however we see the transition from school to employment to provide an opportunity to change behaviour. This is because it is much easier to break habits when your environment changes than when routines are established. \n\nStudents will be recruited to the project before leaving school, and invited to an information session at their local leisure centre. They will be randomised to one of three groups; (i) three months of behavioural support for promoting a healthy diet and physical activity, (ii) three months of behavioural support with incentives (&pound;10 voucher for driving lessons or mobile phone top-ups), or (iii) an information only control group. \n\nFindings from this work will provide valuable information to inform policy on the feasibility of health promotion with this under-researched and hard to reach group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701878","grantId":"G0701878","fundValue":"262695","fundStart":"2008-07-04","fundEnd":"2011-07-03","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martyn  Standage","coPersons":["Bas  Verplanken","Fiona Bridget Gillison"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
