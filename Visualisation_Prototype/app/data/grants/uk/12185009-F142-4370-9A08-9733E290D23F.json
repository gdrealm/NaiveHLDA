There is an urgent need to lower the incidence or delay the onset of both conditions by lifestyle-related interventions. Dietary whey protein acts in the gut to affect satiety and post-meal glucose levels by increasing GLP-1 and insulin release. We aim to identify the whey bioactive(s) in order to develop a more potent whey protein supplement/food component. The project involves characterisation of the bioactive(s) via in vitro technologies working with whey protein experts to optimise fractionation of whey adding value to a sometimes waste product. This project is a necessary forerunner to human supplementation studies prior to procedure to EFSA health claims and the development of supplements and food components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K021095/1","grantId":"BB/K021095/1","fundValue":"242137","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynda  Williams","coPersons":["Janice Elizabeth Drew","John  Wallace"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
