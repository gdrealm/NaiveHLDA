{"id":"08EA8ADD-7889-4974-A586-290CF299642C","title":"The British Liquid Crystal Society Annual Training Workshop","abstractText":"Research and development in liquid crystals has been highly significant over the past 40 years, and a wide range of high technology products has resulted in high quality, flat-panel displays from watches and calculators, mobile telephones, and digital cameras to lap-top computers, desk-top monitors and large-area high definition colour televisions. These products have helped to completely revolutionize the way in which we all live and conduct our day to day activities of business and leisure.\nResearch in the area of liquid crystals continues to be intense in order to improve the well-known products, and to use the unique nature of liquid crystal materials (materials where the molecules have the mobility of a liquid, yet are not completely disordered, which provides a fluid with the important optical, electronic and visco-elastic properties of solids) to generate novel applications for high technology products of the future.\nThe training of researchers new to the field of liquid crystals is of paramount importance to maintaining the excellent progress of research, and the delivering of the desired technological achievements in the future. Such training presents particular challenges because the research area of liquid crystals is extremely multidisciplinary and necessarily involves the close collaboration of researchers from areas of chemistry, physics, engineering, mathematics, computation and biology.\nThe British Liquid Crystal Society Annual Training Workshop serves to provide the education and training needs for research scientists who are new to the field of liquid crystals research. The Workshop involves experienced scientists who are experts in their various disciplines. The experts deliver lectures to provide the background knowledge in the various scientific disciplines, they operate hands-on laboratory sessions to introduce the important practical techniques, and importantly they are available for the entire duration of the Workshop for informal discussions and general networking with the new researchers.\nHence, the Annual Workshop is invaluable for the continuous generation of trained scientists in the multi-disciplinary and technologically important area of liquid crystals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N013972/1","grantId":"EP/N013972/1","fundValue":"51385","fundStart":"2015-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Hird","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
