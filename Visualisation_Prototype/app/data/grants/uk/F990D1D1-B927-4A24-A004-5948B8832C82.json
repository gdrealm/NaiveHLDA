The infectious particle, or ‘virion‘, consists of a genome (i.e. a collection of genes) and a shell that surrounds and protects the genome, and carries it from one host to the next. In many types of virus, the shell assembles from numerous copies of one or a few kinds of protein molecule. Many form in a symmetrical manner and are often helical or spherical in shape. Viruses do not reproduce on their own: instead, they invade the cells of their host and redirect the cell‘s resources to make new virus particles. To achieve this, an infecting virion must attach to the cell‘s surface and make its way into the cell‘s interior. The virus takes over control of the cell, switching off defence mechanisms and using cellular systems to read the virus genome and follow its instructions to make new virions. These new virus particles then exit the cell, and can infect another cell in the same host or a different host. As well as overcoming defences inside cells, viruses may also be capable of evading the host‘s immune system to some extent. In many cases, virus genes mutate rapidly, thus changing the appearance of the virion to the host‘s immune system. Distinct families of viruses may be very different in their structural and functional organisation.\n\nTo understand how viruses accomplish these complex processes, we need to study the structures of virions and viral components, both in isolation and when they interact with host cells. We need to visualise the structures in sufficient detail that we can start to form ideas about how the molecules making up the structures carry out their functions in the virus life cycle. One approach to analysing such structures is to use a very powerful electron microscope, and to process the images from the microscope using a computer. The high resolution views obtained in this way should then aid understanding ofthe virus?s molecular machinery work. With such knowledge, we can begin to devise ways of blocking or derailing the actions of the virus. For example, by understanding how viruses recognise and enter cells, we can envisage designing drugs to block entry. Combined with modern molecular biology techniques, this kind of research will provide a powerful weapon in our war against infectious diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500639","grantId":"G0500639","fundValue":"483000","fundStart":"2005-09-19","fundEnd":"2010-09-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Duncan  McGeoch","coPersons":["Frazer John Rixon","David  Bhella"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
