Health service providers are under increasing pressure to increase the availability of counselling and psychotherapy. There is clearly a need to design and implement controlled clinical trials to test whether these therapies work. It is equally clear that we need to develop and implement research projects that can tell us how these therapies work, what are the sources in the variability in responses to therapy and how these might be manipulated so that the therapies can be refined and improved. Equally, if a particular form of therapy does not appear to be very effective, we can use the same sources of information to develop an improved version that might be.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600555","grantId":"G0600555","fundValue":"362936","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Dunn","coPersons":["Frank  Windmeijer","Ian  White","Andrew Richard Pickles","Linda Mary Davies","Jonathan Michael Green","Chris  Roberts"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
