{"id":"935424E3-63F8-4E66-9CF6-1BF1DDDC7A04","title":"Narratives of Living and Dying with Cancer: Sociological Perspectives","abstractText":"<p>This project involves the re-analysis of two datasets comprising in-depth interviews with adult cancer patients and their main informal carers: 88 patients and 50 carers in total. The interviews were conducted in 1998-99 and 2001-02 as part of two large NHS-funded research projects on cancer experiences. The re-analysis makes use of narrative analysis methods, something not attempted in the original data analyses. </p> \n<p>&nbsp;Research questions -</p> \n<ul> \n <li>From a sociological perspective, what narratives about living and dying with cancer are embedded in the interview accounts?</li> \n <li>What do different theoretical and methodological approaches have to offer to the study of cancer narratives? </li> \n <li>What narrative themes does this interview dataset contain on ‘differences’ associated with gender, age, socio-economic status, co-morbidity, and clinical characteristics (tumour type and disease stage)?</li> \n <li>Do themes associated with disability and disablism feature in these cancer narratives? </li>\n</ul> \n<p>Expected Outcomes -</p> \n<p>The project will make an original contribution to knowledge of sociological (sociology of cancer) and practitioner (supportive and end of life care services) significance. A book and related journal papers will result, and research experiences will be fed, throughout, into the Cancer Experiences Collaborative (CECo) – an ongoing five-year initiative funded by the National Cancer Research Initiative.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2031","grantId":"RES-000-22-2031","fundValue":"45169","fundStart":"2007-01-08","fundEnd":"2009-02-06","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
