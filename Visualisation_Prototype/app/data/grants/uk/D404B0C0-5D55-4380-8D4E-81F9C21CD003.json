Ours is a dynamic model in which community formation is seen as a continual re-negotiation of co-existence and interdependence, not confined by place, as illustrated by the thirty years of pioneering work by Southall Black Sisters. Questions about how communities conduct these negotiations become particularly important now, at a time of economic crisis, when resources are scarce and stress levels among vulnerable individuals are high.\n\nThe study will make critical connections between our understanding of community performance and participatory process across academic fields - including conflict resolution, cultural geography, public health, social psychology and sociology. It will allow a re-examination of inter-disciplinary concepts of community through arts and media practices.\n \nBelonging to a community is critical to a sense of wellbeing for individuals and families, particularly significant for those who live on the breadline. The second element of Remaking Society is the generation of narrative evidence on the cultural dimensions of poverty and social exclusion. It will add a unique inter-disciplinary arts and humanities perspective to the ESRC's national study, Poverty and Social Exclusion in the UK (www.poverty.ac.uk). Running until 2013, it is the UK's largest ever research project on the impact of poverty.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J006882/1","grantId":"AH/J006882/1","fundValue":"78513","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been widely used by arts practitioners and our fellow academics.

Together they either addressed issues, solved problems or generated alternatives - sometimes all three. \n\nWe joined these groups' exploration - through performance, visual art and digital media - of the extent to which people conventionally regarded as excluded from society can choose to negotiate their own inclusion. Future work in this area should consider our ground rules:\n\n1. Effective innovation requires the kind of engagement that is committed to change - what we call engag?.\n2. Establishing mutual respect for the moral and intellectual standing of all collaborators is essential.\n3. Spontaneous learning through practical activities of making, remaking and inventing with the resources available - bricolage - is a fertile route to create emancipatory spaces where people can work together.\n4. Beware the evidence trap. Outside assistance and resources from government agencies and other organisations are needed to address deprivation, but the agenda should be set by the people most directly affected.
