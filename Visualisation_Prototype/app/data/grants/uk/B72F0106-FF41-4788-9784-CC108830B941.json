If the commands of God determine what is morally obligated, is it possible that torturing innocent children is morally obligatory? These two questions, though seemingly very different, have a common element, namely, they both involve the concepts of necessity and possibility not only in their formulations but also in the arguments used traditionally to answer them. To take the first question, the answer given from the middle ages is 'no'. The reasoning is: if there were co-existing omnipotent beings, then their wills might conflict, and if that is so, then they could not be omnipotent for part of what it is to be omnipotent is to be able to do what one wills and these co-existing omnipotent beings would defeat each other's wills. Taking now the second question, the answer given, again from the middle ages, is 'yes'. The reasoning given is: it is necessary that what is morally obligated is commanded by God, and it is possible that God commands the torture of innocent children, so it is possible that the torture of innocent children is morally obligated.\\n\\nThe project seeks to show that both of these answers are wrong and the arguments given for them are fallacious. The arguments fail for a common reason, namely, they take the modalities in question, i.e. necessity and possibility, to be simple rather than conditional modalities, and when this distinction is made, it is clear that conditional rather than simple modality is what is called for. Let me explain. A simple modality is of the form: it is necessary that p. A conditional modality is of the form: given that p, it is necessary that q, i.e. the necessity is conditional on the holding of p. Now take the first argument, which relies on the thought that, for any action, say moving a feather, it is necessary that an omnipotent agent is able to move that feather, and the problem arises when we consider a case where one omnipotent agent, say 'Jane', wills the feather to move and another, say 'Dick', wills it to remain motionless. Now also since medieval times, it has been recognized that an omnipotent agent need not be able to do something contradictory in order to be omnipotent -- say move a feather and keep it motionless at the same time. But if this is right, then there is no problem with there being co-existing omnipotent agents provided that the thought described above is described in terms of conditional, rather than simple, modality. Put in the language of conditional modality, given that an omnipotent agent, Dick, wills that a feather F remain motionless, it is not possible, even for an omnipotent agent, Jane, to move F. However, in terms of simple modality, Dick does can keep F motionless, because there are some worlds where he wills that state of affairs to be and Jane does not will otherwise. So, by distinguishing between simple and conditional modality it seems that there is no paradox concerning the possibility of co-existing omnipotent agents. This then has relevance for one of the most famous arguments for the existence of God, the ontological argument, which seeks to establish the existence of God from what it is to be God.\\n\\nThe second argument suffers from a similar problem. I propose that the modality in the first premise be interpreted as a conditional rather than as a simple modality. The premise the divine command theorist should be committed to is that given that God loves his children, i.e. the moral agents, necessarily, if God commands that moral agents perform an action, then they are morally obligated to perform that action. Since there is no world in which God loves his children and commands that innocent children be tortured, the rebarbative conclusion does not follow. What is distinctive about my proposal is that God's love is constitutive of moral value so thatin worlds where God does not love his children, there are no truths about moral obligation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E004334/1","grantId":"AH/E004334/1","fundValue":"15500","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Efird","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
