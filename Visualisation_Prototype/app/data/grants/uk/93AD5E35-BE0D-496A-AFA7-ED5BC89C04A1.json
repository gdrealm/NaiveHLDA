In the UK, little analysis has been undertaken of the relationship between cultural participation and long-term health outcomes. The overarching aim of this research is to develop an evidence base for the long-term effects of arts and cultural engagement upon physical and psychological health.\n\nIn its first phase, this Research Development Project will test the Nordic findings in a UK context, by analysing extant English data pertaining to arts participation and physical and psychological health. In this endeavour, multiple sources will be drawn upon - from the Taking Part survey (co-ordinated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in partnership with Arts Council England, English Heritage and Sport England) to data gathered via the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale by arts and health organisations in Greater Manchester. A new dataset will be created and made widely available to arts and health researchers working in the UK and beyond, enabling analysis of the relationship between arts participation and physical and psychological health to continue beyond the end of this project.\nThis research programme will then move to consider the validity of the data being collected in this area. The methods that are currently in use, or in the process of being developed, to assess the relationship between arts participation and long-term health benefits have generally been established at some distance from the international arts and health sector. This project will involve both UK-based stakeholders and international experts in a bid to determine how these metrics might be made more appropriate to the sector. Consultation with arts and health professionals in the UK and the Nordic countries will be vital to this process.\n\nThis project is proposed by the strategic agency, Arts for Health, founded at Manchester Metropolitan University in 1987. Arts for Health maintains significant links with those active in the arts and health field in the Nordic countries, several of whom have expressed their willingness to be consulted.\n\nThis research programme is expected to generate invaluable evidence about the relationship between arts participation and physical and psychological health. As such, the academic beneficiaries of this project range from those working in the cultural field to those engaging with research in medicine and neuroscience.\n\nOf equal importance will be the impact of the project upon non-academic beneficiaries, including policy-makers, professionals working at the interface between the arts and health and the broader population. If it proves possible to substantiate a positive correlation between arts participation and health, this will have considerable ramifications for the arts and health sector in particular and the cultural field in general. The consultation process involving national and international policy-makers and arts and health professionals will give rise to a series of recommendations which, if implemented, will transform the future of cultural provision.\n\nThe innovative character of this project lies in its willingness to look beyond official statistics and current approaches, in a bid to elucidate measures appropriate to the aesthetic and cognitive character of arts participation. In its entirety, this project seeks to contribute to discussions around methods for evaluating the health outcomes of artistic participation that go beyond those found in the UK Treasury's 'green book'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L014688/1","grantId":"AH/L014688/1","fundValue":"38427","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The evidence base produced as part of this project (see Research Databases section) was launched at the annual conference of the Faculty of Public Health on 3 July 2014.

The previous studies conducted - largely in the Nordic countries - refer to life-expectancy, major diseases, dementia and obesity. This provides an important precedent for future research design. I have also been able to look more closely at the mechanisms that are proposed to explain this perceived association. This part of the project is being written up as a report, to be published by Manchester Metropolitan University and launched at a related event in Feburary 2015.\nDespite the award having finished, I am continuing to work on the primary data analysis that formed part of this project. Specifically, I am looking at use of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) as a measure of recovery in arts and health organisations in Greater Manchester. This will hopefully be written up by late 2014/early 2015. Various recommendations for future research have been made in the report submitted to the Cultural Value Project (AHRC) team. These include further longitudinal studies designed to address the dual possibilities of reverse causation and residual confounders, identified as the main weaknesses of previous studies. \n\nEvidence reviews published during the course of this research programme (particularly by Arts Council England) heightened the necessity of creating the evidence base, in favour of primary data analysis. Scope now exists to begin analysing data generated in the UK, beginning with the newly longitudinal Taking Part survey. \n\nThis project also entailed an analysis of the possible mechanisms through which any positive association between arts engagement and health might operate. These findings might be taken forward to explore some of the explanations that are speculated upon in the case that any positive associations are observed.
