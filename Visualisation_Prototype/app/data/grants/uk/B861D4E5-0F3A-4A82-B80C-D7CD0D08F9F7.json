The purpose is not to look at today's electricity system and systems of governance with respect to combustion of wastes, but to consider how a rational system would be designed that utilised all potential fuel streams (and takes into account that different wastes will contain different levels of trace elements, some of which may be quite minor). An important point is that many wastes are currently landfilled - meaning that both the energy content of the waste is lost and a bulky material ends up in landfill.\n\nHere, we will conduct experiments looking at emissions of trace elements during combustion and co-firing (with coal) of different types of &quot;waste&quot; materials (for example, wood from demolition sites), together with analysis of ashes produced. The results will then be used to generate models of power plants burning wastes, and used to determine whether, for the wastes examined, the most rational use of the waste is combustion in dedicated facilities or co-combustion. It is clear that some of the wastes we will examine currently fall within the remit of the waste incineration directive (though all will be non-halogenated). We will examine whether this is scientifically valid.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M015351/1","grantId":"EP/M015351/1","fundValue":"1035610","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Fennell","coPersons":["Jenny Marie Jones","Jia  Li","Jonathan  Gibbins","Hannah  Chalmers","M  Pourkashanian","Niall  Mac Dowell","Gareth Paul Harrison","Mathieu Serge Lucquiaud","Lin  Ma"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
