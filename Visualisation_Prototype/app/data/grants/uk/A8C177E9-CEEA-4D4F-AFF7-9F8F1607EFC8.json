{"id":"A8C177E9-CEEA-4D4F-AFF7-9F8F1607EFC8","title":"Randomised trial of genetic testing and targeted bisphosphonate therapy to prevent SQSTM1 mediated Paget s disease","abstractText":"Paget disease of bone (PDB) is a serious bone disease which causes pain, arthritis and deafness and which can cause softening of the bones causing then to enlarge and become bent. Up to 40% of patients with the PDB have inherited it from family members and a mutation in the gene SQSTM1 is an important cause of the disease. Patients who have the SQSTM1 gene usually develop severe Paget disease starting from the age of about 40 and can end up crippled. Paget disease can be treated with drugs called bisphosphonates but often the disease has caused irreversible damage to the bones before these drugs are prescribed. The aim of this research is to find out if better results can be obtained by giving early treatment to people who are genetically at risk of getting the disease because of the SQSTM1 gene, but who have not yet developed it. We will do this by carrying out genetic tests on people with a family history of Paget disease to see if they carry the SQSTM1 gene. People who are found to carry the gene will be invited to take part in a research study in which 50% will be given an active treatment which we think might prevent the disease. The other 50% will be given a dummy treatment. We will then follow both groups of people up for 5 years and compare the results at the end of this time. We will carry out special bone scans to see if people in the trial have developed bone abnormalities characteristic of the disease and to see if the active treatment has prevented this to any extent. We will also study the effects of treatment on symptoms and look for any side effects of the treatment. Neither the patients nor their doctors will know what treatment they have received so that we can make an objective assessment of the possible risks and benefits of the treatment. If the research shows that genetic testing combined with active treatment can prevent the development of the disease this is important since it could probably be introduced as part of routine care in the NHS. This could help prevent the development of the serious complications that can occur in Paget disease and improve the outlook for people who have a family history of the disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701625","grantId":"G0701625","fundValue":"1500180","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stuart  Ralston","coPersons":["Geeta  Hampson","MARY  PORTEOUS","John  Walsh","Anne Louise Langston","Gordon Douglas Murray","Ignac  Fogelman","Geoffrey Charles Nicholson","Roseanne  Cetnarskyj","Peter  Selby","Eugene Vincent McCloskey","William Duncan Fraser"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
