The most severe of these floods derive from North Sea storm surges, when wind and tide combine to drive huge quantities of water against the coast, as happened to devastating effect in 1953. This project seeks to understand the occurrence of storm flooding in the past, and to explore the ways in which people have responded to the threat. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will draw upon rich surviving documentary sources to study the impact of storm flooding upon the reclaimed marshlands bordering the tidal Thames and its estuary during the period c.1250-1550. Year-by-year accounts of the management of riverside properties will be examined and the degree to which reclaimed land was lost to the sea during the later Middle Ages assessed. The impact of population decline and agrarian recession upon the economics of coastal and river-side defence will be considered. The flood threat to medieval Londonâ€™s low-lying suburbs will be investigated and the possibility that the long-term flooding of lands down-river spared the city the worst effects of North Sea storm surges explored.&nbsp; Parallels will be sought in the modern policy of managed retreat or realignment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2693","grantId":"RES-000-22-2693","fundValue":"82728","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James Arthur Galloway","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
