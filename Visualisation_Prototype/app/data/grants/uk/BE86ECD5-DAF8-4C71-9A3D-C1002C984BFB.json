Research projects developed with partners in Asia, Africa and Latin America will link three domains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Food and agriculture</li>\n\n <li>Health and disease</li>\n\n <li>Water and sanitation</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>with three themes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Dynamics: how interlinked processes of social, technological and environmental change create possibilities for alternative pathways to sustainability.</li>\n\n <li>Governance: how institutional, political and policy processes across global and local scales enable or constrain different pathways to sustainability.</li>\n\n <li>Designs: how decision-making procedures, appraisal methods and analytical tools can enhance citizen engagement and the negotiation of pathways to sustainability under uncertainty.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Through cross-cutting analysis, targeted communications and policy-engagement activities, and concerted training and capacity building efforts, STEPS aims to connect the development of new theory with practical approaches that create opportunities for poorer and marginalised people.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-588-28-0001","grantId":"RES-588-28-0001","fundValue":"4413480","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Melissa  LeachIan  Scoones","coPersons":["Erik Paul Millstone","Jim  Watson","Gerald  Bloom","Hayley Nan MacGregor","Lyla  Mehta","James Enos Sumberg","John  Thompson","Robert Patrick David Byrne","Saurabh  Arora","Adrian Paul Smith","Linda  Waldman","Peter John Newell","Adrian Vincent  Ely","Michael  Loevinsohn","Jeremy Marc  Allouche","Andy  Stirling","Fiona  Marshall"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
