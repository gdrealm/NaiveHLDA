The research will combine a detailed discussion of the formal and thematic features of Leach's work with an analysis of its relationship to the changing social and institutional context in which it has been produced and distributed. In this way, the study is designed to shed light not just on the work of a single filmmaker but also the changing conditions under which British television drama and British films have been made and viewed. \nThe research will result in a book which will illuminate the career of one of Britain's greatest filmmakers as well as make an original contribution to British film and television history","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D500559/1","grantId":"AH/D500559/1","fundValue":"39170","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2006-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project is just at the start of its second year.

We have also collaborated with the BFI and relevant archives and cultural organisations (such as Kaleidoscope) to make some 'forgotten' work available for public viewing.
