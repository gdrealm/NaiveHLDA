In fact, recent reports suggest that the government spends over #15 billion per annum in meeting the social and economic costs of illicit drug use. While some significant progress has been made in recent years, for example with the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid abuse, one of the major difficulties faced is that approximately 70% of treated addicts relapse within the first year following treatment. In this project it is intended to develop a therapeutic agent that could be used to help prevent patients from relapsing. Another significant issue is that most addicts use more than one addictive substance and that deaths from drug misuse more often than not involve a combination of drugs rather than a single compound, or even single compound class. Indeed, the most frequent multiple-drug deaths involve various combinations of opiates/opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. The importance of finding treatment agents, including relapse prevention agents, for these combinations is clear. Fortunately, there is emerging evidence from the clinic that a buprenorphine/naltrexone combination is effective as a relapse prevention agent for opioid abuse, while also decreasing cocaine use in the same individuals. There is also a strong rational, based on preclinical studies, that this combination would reduce alcohol intake in the addict population. A significant problem with developing this as a combination product arises from the fact that buprenorphine and naltrexone need to be administered by different routes. Also buprenorphine would be subject to diversion/abuse if administered separately to the naltrexone and so some mechanism of overcoming the drug delivery problem is required. Both the compounds can be delivered through the skin (transdermally) and so during this pilot project we will determine whether it is possible to develop this method of delivering buprenorphine and naltrexone in a controllable manner and in amounts that provide maximum therapeutic effect while minimising any potential side affects. In order to be able to deliver the required amount of the drugs in a controlled manner, we will use a technique called iontophoresis, in which a mild electric current is used to help deliver the compounds across the skin. This is a technique that is already used in the clinic for the delivery of other drug molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802728","grantId":"G0802728","fundValue":"202450","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Husbands","coPersons":["Maria Begona Delgado-Charro","Richard Henry Guy","Christopher Philip Bailey"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
