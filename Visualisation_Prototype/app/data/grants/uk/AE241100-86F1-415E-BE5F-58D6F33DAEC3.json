In finding the answer, the whole question of the relationship between history and literature, or society and culture, is explored. A crucial text, the Life of Cyril Phileotes by Nicholas Kataskepenos, one of the last of the saints' lives, about one of the last of the holy men of the period is analysed to provide examples.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505481/1","grantId":"AH/E505481/1","fundValue":"35109","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2006-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret  Mullett","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
