In study one participants’ trait empathy will be assessed and then state empathy will be induced in half the sample. The other half will have no emotions induced (controls). Participants will then make judgements regarding: an offender's remorse; responsibility for the offence; likelihood of reoffending; and an appropriate punishment. Study two will duplicate study one but extend it by assigning participants to one of three conditions, where the offender has either: signed a confession and expressed remorse: signed a confession without expressing remorse: neither confessed nor shown remorse. Participants will make the same judgements as in study one. In the second part of study two participants will discuss the case in groups and make group judgements of the offender. The results will tell us whether state or trait emotions influence people's judgements and how trait and state emotions interact. Results will also tell us if an offender's expression of remorse and/or confession interacts with participants’ state or trait emotions and affects judgements made individually or in a group. This information will be useful to help identify the potential impact of emotions in legal decisions and how emotions may bias the judicial process.&nbsp; <br /> </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F04142X/1","grantId":"ES/F04142X/1","fundValue":"81047","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Louise Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" Findings showed that feelings of empathy can be generated by statements which are favourable to an offender. Findings also showed how people with high levels of empathy are likely to judge an offender as feeling remorse - even if the offender does not show remorse. In turn, these same people are likely to make more lenient judgements of the offender. That is, overall, they hold the offender less responsible for an offence and are less inclined to agree with guilty verdicts of other jurors. Our findings could be used in training of individuals involved in decision making regarding offenders. For example, members of parole boards and judges may benefit from a greater understanding of how empathy may be manipulated and how it may impact on their decision making. Previous research has tended to focus on either trait (ie personality characteristic) or state (ie current situation) empathy. However, our findings indicate that trait and state empathy may act independently under certain ci ","dataset":"gtr"}
