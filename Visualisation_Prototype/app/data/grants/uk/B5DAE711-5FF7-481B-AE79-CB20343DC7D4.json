Below is a summary of the findings, with more detail available on the project website.\n\n\n\n1) CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USES \n\nFirst Person Perspective Digital Ethnography (FPPDE) is currently being used in industry, policing, health, teaching, marketing and academic contexts. It is being used not only to record events, but also to stimulate reflexive practice. To date only a tiny subset of potential uses is being exploited, mainly because the field has been held back by limitations in technology and analysis.\n\n\n\n2) DISCOVERING NEW QUESTIONS\n\nFirst person perspective digital ethnography introduces exciting new theoretical and applied research questions. Specific questions which arise include: How do observer accounts of behaviour compare to actor recordings of behaviour? In group activities, to what extent are the accounts of multiple actors congruent? How can the method best be used to stimulate self-reflection? How can multiple steams of data, from humans moving between contexts, be integrated? Does viewing one's own first person perspective recordings lead to behaviour change?\n\n\n\n3) ANALYSING FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE DATA\n\nNew methods of digital data capture create new problems for analysing data. Traditional software for analysing qualitative data (NVivo, Atlas/ti, MiMeG, Transana, QDA Miner, Dedoose, Qualrus, MAXQDA, and Digital Replay System) is of limited use for FPPDE. Software which can handle video and transcription (i.e., NVivo and Atlas/ti) can be used for simple analysis. DIVER can also be used where the analysis team is geographically distributed. However, it gets more difficult when the data set comprises, for example, hundreds of thousands of images (SenseCam/Memoto), or, video data combined with a transcript of what occurred in situ and a transcript which comments on the activity (i.e., two transcripts) and, potentially, biosensing data. No widely available software is adequately able to deal with these issues. However, prototype software is being developed, and will become available in the coming years.\n\n\n\n4) ETHICAL ISSUES\n\nTapping into the first person perspective of actors in their lived social environments, and the recording of these perspectives, raises ethical issues that must be addressed by the adopters of digital ethnographic methods. A systematic framework is needed, and, to this end, it is advised the researchers use the framework proposed by Kelly, P., Marshall, S.J., Badland, H., Kerr, J., Oliver, M., Doherty, A.R., &amp; Foster, C. (2013). An ethical framework for automated, wearable cameras in health behavior research. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 44(3), 314-319.\n\n\n\n5) THE FUTURE OF FPPDE\n\nWith massive hardware and software projects, such as Google Glass, and the popular momentum behind lifelogging, the future will include not only a lot of technological developments but also a mainstreaming of FPPDE technologies and methods. Currently first person perspective digital recording has focused on images, videos and sound. In the future it is likely that biosensing will provide increasingly important additional data streams that will need to be linked to the video stream. As the technologies become ubiquitous, and the usage more widespread and common place, there will be a time in the not too distant future when social science researchers will potentially have access to an individual's entire life history as a first person perspective data stream, a massive data set which could be bequeathed to social science, and which would provide a massive resource for longitudinal research. Recording and analyzing what people do in real world contexts, outside of the laboratory, is crucial for many non-academic domains. The seminar series had presenters and participants from many non-academic contexts, including policing, heavy industry, software development, hardware development, interactive art, marketing, healthcare, television broadcasting and education. These presenters and participants obtained benefits in networking, access to the latest knowledge, discussion of the ethical issues, and hands-on trials with cutting edge technology. The findings will have benefits for researchers in social science, and people working in industry, policing, health, teaching and marketing contexts.\n\n\n\nWe will reach these targeted audiences through the following outputs:\n\n- Open access website resource\n\n- Media coverage in The Economist\n\n- A planned special issue of an academic Journal Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Government/ Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
