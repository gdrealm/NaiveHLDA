As a result, I have developed expertise on how assisted dying has been legalised, regulated and the effectiveness of that regulation in a number of permissive jurisdictions including the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and Switzerland, and applied this to analyse the unsatisfactory position produced by recent informal legal change in the UK. This expertise has triggered invitations to brief select committees, prepare briefings for legislators, act as an expert witness, give policy seminars, and provide information to the media. More specifically, I have given evidence to and provided commissioned briefing papers for a select committee of the Scottish Parliament and to the Commission on Assisted Dying (CoAD). This evidence has been heavily cited and has contributed significantly to public and policy debate and policy processes. My work has contributed to recent legal change in Canada and influenced the shape of proposed legal change in Tasmania. My critique of the current legal position has informed public and political debate and influenced Parliamentarians, the campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide in the UK and an ongoing judicial challenge to the current legal position.

The book examines three different routes by which attempts have been made to legalise assisted dying: rights claims by patients, which were unsuccessful in Canada, the U.S.A. and the U.K.; the defence of necessity founded on the doctor's duty to relieve suffering, used in the Netherlands; and an approach based on compassion which was proposed in France. The book investigates the context in which each route is used, asking why particular routes were or were not used in individual jurisdictions. The contours of the legal regulation of assisted dying resulting from the use of these three mechanisms of legal change are described, and analysis of legislative approaches from Oregon, Belgium and the Northern Territory of Australia is included. The examination of the impact of these different alternatives suggests that greater caution is needed before relying on the experience of one jurisdiction when discussing proposals for regulation of assisted dying in others, and the possible consequences of such regulation. The book seeks to demonstrate the need to explore the legal environment in which assisted dying is performed or proposed in order to evaluate the relevance of a particular legal experience to other jurisdictions. The legal significance of the comparative evidence in the assisted dying debate is great. Judges at the Supreme Court of Canada, the United States Supreme Court, the House of Lords and many lower courts have used 'the Dutch experience' in their dismissals of challenges to criminal prohibitions on assisted suicide, relying on arguments that the Dutch are sliding down a slippery slope with little attempt to consider the effect on such arguments of the mechanism of legal change in the Netherlands and the vastly different social context. Chapter Seven demonstrates that in the absence of evidence on the issues of causation and comparability, judicial reliance on the empirical slippery slope argument is suspect. \nMoreover, the book concludes that a legislature in a jurisdiction with no judicial history of legalisation of assisted dying based on either rights or duties (which includes all common law jurisdictions) could adopt as legally determinative the distinction between, for example, voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia (the presence of a competent request). While the duty-based approach adopted in the Netherlands does allow for non-voluntary euthanasia, the use of this fact in jurisdictions with no history of legalisation based on duties is unconvincing.\nSlippery slope arguments are widely used in debates over legalisation which occur in legislatures, courts and in the public domain. The book shows that whether logical or empirical, such arguments often make distinctly unhelpful contributions to debates over legalisation. The book proposes that we move on from the divisive, polarised arguments over alleged abuses which have dominated foreign discussion of euthanasia in the Netherlands. Instead, we should learn from the experience in jurisdictions which have legalised assisted dying while recognising that because of the different approaches to legalisation, those experiences do not directly translate to other jurisdictions.
