Statistics show that in the UK alone, more than 750,000 people are suffering from heart failure. Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement (hypertrophy) of the muscle tissue that makes up the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy develops in response to some factors, such as high blood pressure, that requires the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the walls of the chamber grow thicker, lose elasticity and eventually may fail to pump with as much force as a healthy heart.\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes of cardiac shape and function has become a major objective in heart failure research. The goal of research for hypertrophy is to find out the way stopping or reversing its progression. Although anti-hypertension drugs can attenuate hypertrophy, the extent of reversing progression is not satisfactory. The molecular mechanisms behind reverse of the hypertrophy progression are not yet known. If we know the mechanisms how hypertrophy can be reversed and how the mechanisms are regulated, we would develop novel therapeutics to treat patients with heart failure. Theoretically, cardiac mass is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation.\nIn the cell, we are equipped with an intracellular process called autophagy (literally 'self-eating'). Under starved conditions, autophagy wraps intracellular components in a double membrane and delivers it to an intracellular sac called the lysosome. Here, the material is ingested, digested and recycled, ready to be used again. We found that the heart in hypertension accumulates the debris, but autophagy clean-ups debris to protect the heart against hypertension. Autophagic activity has been known to be regulated by a protein called mTORC1. mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth by promoting protein synthesis and limiting autophagy. mTORC1 integrates 4 major signals, namely growth factors, energy status, oxygen and amino acids. One of the most important sensors for these signals is TSC1/2 complex. However, little is known how TSC1/2 complex regulates mTORC1 to determine cardiac mass. \nThe purpose of this project is to determine whether autophagy reduces the size of the heart by eating the content of the heart cell. We will examine the level of autophagy after release of hypertension in wild-type mice. Then, using the same experimental conditions, we will examine alteration of size and function of the heart in mice, in which autophagy is inhibited. These will enable us to consolidate the evidence that autophagy plays an important role in the reverse of hypertrophy.\nOnce we are able to show the pathophysiological significance of autophagy during forward and reverse cardiac remodelling, it is fundamental to clarify the mechanisms regulating autophagy to find new therapies to prevent the heart against hemodynamic stress. We will examine the role of TSC1/2 in determining size of the heart by regulating autophagy during forward and reverse remodelling. We will examine the level of cardiac mass and function in the TSC2-deficient mice in response to the exposure of hypertension or the release of hypertension. We will examine the levels of protein degradation and synthesis in the heart and attempt to identify key molecules to determine the function of mTORC1. \nThus, successful completion of this project will clearly demonstrate whether autophagy is responsible for reduction of hypertrophy. Furthermore, we would know how the TSC1/2 signalling pathways regulate autophagy to determine the cardiac mass during forward and reverse cardiac remodelling. These findings may lead to identification of target molecules for the development of treatment of heart failure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K019031/1","grantId":"MR/K019031/1","fundValue":"400975","fundStart":"2013-10-21","fundEnd":"2016-10-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kinya  Otsu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
