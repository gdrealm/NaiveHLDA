It investigates at what points&nbsp;- and why&nbsp;- religious and sexual identities are rendered more or less salient in the everyday experiences, choices and identities of queer youth (16-24 yrs) involved in the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC).</p>\n\n<p>This is situated as a specific case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in young people's lives asking: how does participation shape identifications, how is marginalisation or discrimination managed and how might religion and sexuality serve as a vehicle for various forms of belonging, identification and political expression? </p>\n\n<p>It adopts an intersectional lens, both theoretically and methodologically, uncovering the salience of other social divisions and identities in young people's lives. Using such a model is relevant and ambitious, where theorisation has yet to be fully embedded within empirical study. </p>\n\n<p>Methodologically the project is innovative and sensitive to 'blended' identities and their sophisticated enactment. Qualitative methodology will be deployed informed by a mix of techniques (interviews, maps and diaries) in order to collect rich insights into the everyday lives, practices and identities of MCC youth.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2489","grantId":"RES-062-23-2489","fundValue":"119680","fundStart":"2011-09-05","fundEnd":"2013-09-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Yvette  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
