(ACES)","abstractText":"Despite challenges with decoherence, solid state spin qubits remain one of the best practical implementations of quantum device architectures that exploit quantum state entanglement, owing to the possibility of incorporation into existing electronics technology. 'Physics for Quantum Technologies' was acknowledged in a recent EPSRC Physics Grand Challenge survey as the most overwhelmingly recognised challenge in the physical sciences. &quot;New materials for solid-state quantum electronics need to be developed&quot; was a highlighted high level requirement. Physics for Quantum Technology was also acknowledged as having the highest potential UK economic impact should the UK establish an intellectual advantage.\n\nAll electrical control of single electron spins in a practical semiconductor device would be a major breakthrough which the UK is in a unique position to achieve owing to the world lead it has in the strong spin-orbit InSb/AlInSb semiconductor material system. There are a number of key stepping stones to achieving the end goal of single electron manipulation in gate confined quantum structures. We propose to address the material growth challenges of highly mismatched InSb/InAlSb epitaxy on GaAs and Si, and achieve world record carrier mobilities and associated ballistic length, and develop device capability for advanced measurement and exploitation by the wider UK scientific community.\n\nThrough a series of standard quantum transport devices, this work will ultimately demonstrate the potential for electron spin manipulation (and therefore individual qubit addressing) by the spatial translation of single electrons in complex multiple gate field effect devices, using the Rashba spin-orbit coupling to enable local spin state control.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L012995/1","grantId":"EP/L012995/1","fundValue":"480983","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They haven't yet as this is the first six months of the grant.

These have been measured and characterised at Cardiff, and the first iteration of growth optimisation is now underway, looking to reduce material defects to increase carrier transport (enhanced electronic properties). At present this is only of direct benefit to other academic groups, with clear exploitation some time off yet.
