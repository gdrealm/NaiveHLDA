However, vaccines against many infections are ineffective and we are interested in finding ways to boost their activity. Vaccines may require special immune cells, called dendritic cells, to become activated. Thus, one reason why vaccines may not work is that these cells do not become activated enough. We have found that dendritic cells produce large amounts of steroids and that this may prevent them from becoming activated. The dendritic cells contain an enzyme that produces the steroid. Although these findings are very obvious when we culture dendritic cells in a test tube, it is now very important to work out what role this enzyme has in preventing immune responses following a vaccination. This requires that we perform experiments in mice, in which the gene that makes the enzyme has been ?knocked out?. In this case, we can take a mouse that is normal in every respect other than the fact that it cannot make the enzyme. We predict that responses to vaccination will be much better in mice that lack the enzyme in their dendritic cells. If so, this will be important, because new drugs have been developed that can block the enzyme from working. Thus, it may be possible to give a vaccine and an enzyme-stopping drug at the same time in order to get a better response.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601183","grantId":"G0601183","fundValue":"638537","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ronjon  Chakraverty","coPersons":["John  Curnow"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
