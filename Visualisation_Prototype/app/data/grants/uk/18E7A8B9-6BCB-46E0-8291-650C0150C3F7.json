{"id":"18E7A8B9-6BCB-46E0-8291-650C0150C3F7","title":"Imprinting mechanisms in extraembryonic tissues","abstractText":"An important part of gene regulation during development involves so-called epigenetic marks. These are chemical additions (eg methyl groups) to the DNA or the chromatin (the histone proteins) and instruct genes to be active or inactive. There is increasing evidence that faults in these epigenetic marks can lead to diseases in humans, particularly those affecting growth or behaviour. Recently it has been realised that defects in cloned animals and some rare diseases that occur in children born from IVF, can be explained by defective epigenetic marks. In this application, we describe work on a new epigenetic mechanism based on attachment of methyl groups to histones, rather than DNA. It is possible that the histone marks are less stable than the ones in DNA, and this could be relevant to the defects that occur in disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400154","grantId":"G0400154","fundValue":"344492","fundStart":"2005-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Wolf  Reik","coPersons":["Myriam  Hemberger"],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
