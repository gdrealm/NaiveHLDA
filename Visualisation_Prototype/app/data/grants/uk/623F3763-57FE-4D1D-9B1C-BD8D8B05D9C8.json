Research in both laboratory animals and humans, suggests that this is not only because of our genetic similarities with our parents, but because our early life experiences shape the way we look and behave in adulthood. However, two major uncertainties exist in the development of these patterns. First, do we simply resemble our parents because we share the same environment? Second, do parents actually shape our development through varying their levels of investment in us, and if so, when does this happen and for whose benefit is it? To answer these questions we must use an animal in which we can ethically move offspring around in a natural setting at different stages of their development and then measure their behaviour in adulthood. I will use a 50g Australian bird that lives, like humans, in family groups in which offspring are reared by a variable number of helpers in addition to parents. I have been studying ~90 breeding groups of the chestnut-crowned babbler in the arid zone of south-eastern Australia for the last 8 years. This species is perfect for the aims of this project because mothers vary tremendously in their investment in offspring, varying the timing and amount of investment in eggs, as well as the number and sex of competitors with which offspring will be reared. Similarly, mothers, fathers and helpers vary significantly in how much food they provide to offspring after hatching, with some providing almost nothing and others contributing the majority of it. Finally, the success of a group depends on how many helpers it has: the survival of offspring increases until group size reaches 8, after which there are no further increases. Because helpers are almost always offspring from previous years, a small group of babblers should try to produce helpers, whereas a large group should try to produce dispersers that go off to start a new babbler group. By moving offspring between groups of different sizes and at different stages of their development, I will provide an answer to the following questions. (1) To what degree do mothers, fathers and helpers try to create helpful versus selfish offspring, and do they all agree when this should be? (2) Do offspring ignore this 'arrangement' or benefit from it, or are they being manipulated to behave in a way dictated by their up-bringing? (3) If one's upbringing influences the way they look and behave in adulthood, when is this effect generated, is it by the mum's before hatching, is it when they receive food in the nest, or is it determined after they leave the nest and begin to fend for themselves? The answers to these questions will shed new light on how the upbringing of animals and humans shapes the way we look and behave in adulthood and help answer the long-standing questions of what makes a good mother, father and helper and who is it good for? If, from these results, we are able to predict the cooperative versus selfish tendencies of offspring given their development, we can begin to direct future studies in humans to ask whether there is a sensitive period during child development that shapes our behaviour in adulthood? When is it and what types of experiences is it most sensitive to?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K005766/1","grantId":"NE/K005766/1","fundValue":"424968","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The project aims at blue skies research and as such the primary beneficiaries are academics, post-graduate and under-graduate students. However, because the system under study is an arid zone specialist of outback Australia, it is anticipated that, in due course, the study will reveal how species occupying desert environments, which are explanding as a consequence of climate change, deal with their unique challanges. As the grant is little over a year old, the impact as yet is obviously limited.

In particular, females with no helpers, ie first time breeders, gain help either by chosing mates with helpers or failing this, mating multiply to attract help from multiple breeding males; (2) decisions to help are determined solely by kinship, rather than an attempt to show off parenting capabilities or as a form of rent payment for being allowed to remain on the natal territory beyond independence; and (3) our findings contradict a major emerging theory in the evolution of cooperative societies, that cooperation is selected among monogamously breeding parents. Not all of these results are yet published, but it is anticpated that they will be published in high impact journals and will have a signifciant impact in the field. The study aims at the first investigation of how mothers generate helpers in a cooperative vertebrate society. As such, the findings of this study are already inspiring other researchers to consider that altrusits in cooperative societies can be generated by parents by adaptively changing mating patterns and rearing conditions of offspring. It is anticpated that as the outcomes of the grant become published, the results will generate a major shift in the way that we view the evolution of cooperative societies, including in humans.
