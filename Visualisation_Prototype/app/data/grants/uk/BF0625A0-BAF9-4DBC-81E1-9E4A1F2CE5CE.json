Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains the leading cause of death worldwide. \n\nDespite the presence of chemotherapy, extensive rise in antibiotic resistance is a cause of concern around the world, including the UK. In a reported case of extreme drug resistance (XDR) there is no new drug available that can combat the disease. Hence there is an urgent need for new drug development. \n\nA key feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the unique cell wall of consisting of three major layers - peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acid covalently linked. The cell wall architecture and presence of ?peptidoglycans?, not only helps in maintaining the shape and size of the bacterial cell, but also protects the bacteria from toxic radicals, osmotic lysis, and foreign attack. \n\nThus the crucial nature of the protective cell wall-peptidoglycan in M. tuberculosis should be exploited for new drug discovery against TB. Characterisation of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis will help in identification of potential targets for new drugs.\n\nThe proposed study aims to identify those cellular components (enzymes) that are vital to the production of this protective cell wall, and thus essential for the survival of the TB-bacteria. We will be investigating, in detail, the structural and functional dynamics of the enzymes that play major roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In addition, we will also modify these vitally important TB enzymes and observe how the TB-Superbugs survive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801956","grantId":"G0801956","fundValue":"475560","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sanjib  Bhakta","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
