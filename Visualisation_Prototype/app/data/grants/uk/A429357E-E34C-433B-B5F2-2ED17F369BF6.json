She has been invited to talk to a large group of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists at the Joint Meeting of the Brazilian and French Psychoanalytic Societies; she gave a key-note talk at the International Video Interaction Guidance Conference that brought together researchers and practitioners across a wide range of fields. \nAlso, she talked about the research and the results to nurses, midwifes, obstetricians and neonatologists at the site of research, as well as to well over 100 parents of newborn infants while working on the research project. \nAdditionally, colleagues with a focus on disseminating research on early years have been talking about the PI's results from the project.

Part of the impact is expected to be longitudinal, long-term, and intergenerational. Informed, sensitive parenting of the neonate is expected to have a long-term benefit not only in the development and the mental health of the future child, adolescent, and adult, but the effects to extend well beyond into the next generations.

Several studies failed to replicate the results or regarded it as an artefact. Imitation is still lacking a comprehensive ethological, neurophysiological description in neonates. Recent explanations include the theory of intermodal mapping and the mirror neuron system model. These models however, have not been tested as potential mechanisms of neonatal imitation. Arbib (2005) suggested that a part of the brain, called the mirror neuron system has developed through the evolution to equip humans with the ability to communicate through language. He suggested an evolutionary line from simple imitations through more complex imitations, towards protospeech and finally to language. Our earlier study (Nagy &amp;amp; Molnar, 1994, 2004) described how newborn infants use imitations for reciprocal communication, as part of their first dialogues. Based on these two models, we proposed that neonatal imitation is not only an existing, valid phenomenon, but is guided by parts of the same mirror neuron system Arbib is proposing. Such explanation could explain why babies imitate immediately after birth, and how neonatal imitation equips babies with the skill to be able to develop and maintain intimate interactions much before they have mastered language.\n\nOne of the main aims of the research project was to confirm the phenomenon of neonatal imitation with a very large sample of neonates. Using a novel, purely statistical approach in the coding and the analysis aimed to ensure the objective, interpretation-free results. The second aim of the study was to explore the underlying mechanisms in neonatal imitation. We did so by using a gesture, that was different from those used in previous studies, but similar used in studies that described the mirror neuron system in adult humans and apes. The project therefore aimed not only to show that newborns can imitate the index-finger movement gesture but by using the gesture, to investigate the laterality thus the potentially different contribution of the left and right hemispheres in neonatal imitation. Such result could allow us to speculate whether the lateralized components of the mirror neuron system are part of the neural network underlying imitation. \nA further aim was to explore the complexity, representation and potentially the meaning of imitative finger movements by modelling a range of movements, such as one-finger movement, a gesture representing number 2, and a gesture representing number 3. As a final aim, the project investigated how neonates are able to process and copy complex, sequential movements, such as clapping movement. \nThe results from all studies showed a selective increase of the targeted movements during imitation, thus with a very large sample size, with the use of an objective, statistical-based coding, the project confirmed the evidence of neonatal imitation through a series of studies and gestures. These gestures included fine motor finger movements, movements representing numbers, and sequential, complex movements. Although bilateral imitation was the most specific, there was an advantage of left sided imitative movements, as they occurred earlier and faster than right-sided ones. This result can be attributed to the underlying neural structure, the lateralization in the mirror-neuron system, thus confirms our assumption that a lateralized brain-system could contribute to the mechanism of neonatal imitation. As for the potential mechanism of neonatal imitation, results allowed us to further explore the mechanism of imitation, and found that imitation has a learning component and that general arousal can solely be responsible for neonatal imitation. This means, imitation must be part of a primary motivational system serving intersubjective communication. \nFurther investigations of the mechanisms described here will be needed however. Our future studies plan to monitor not only behavioural but also the psycho- and neurophysiological responses of the baby during imitation to obtain direct evidence on the underlying mechanisms. \nThe current study used the methods of the quantitative experimental psychology, a very much needed approach to investigate the existence, and the main features of neonatal imitation. Pilot analyses of the data as next step in the research (such as explorations into the interpersonal aspects of neonatal imitation) however indicated, that in the next phases of this research, qualitative, case-based, bottom-up micro-analytic descriptions will also be needed, integrated with the quantitative, objective, statistical based analysis used in the current project. \nThe results not only further our understanding in neonatal imitation, but also offer data-based insight into the social-communicative competence of human neonates. The data show that newborn infants have an innate motive and complex skills to imitate, thus to relate to others. Such results call for the importance of sensitive, intuitive parenting and caretaking from the very first moments of life. Based on it’s potential impact, the project brought closer researchers and primary care professionals in the area, disseminating the notion of the socially competent newborn among paediatricians, midwifes, nurses and though the debriefing and the videos, among large number of parents. This increased awareness could lead to real difference in parenting and infant mental health care from the very first moment of life. 1.

The project leads to new research projects in clarifying the nature and the mechanisms of neonatal imitation. \n4. The views of mental health professionals, physicians, midwives, nurses and early years educators on the earliest stage of development and the newborn period thus could transform our views on parenting. \n5.
