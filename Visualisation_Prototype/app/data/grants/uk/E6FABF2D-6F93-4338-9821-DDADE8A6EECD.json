Unlike existing analytical approaches, the sensor is a rapid diagnostic platform, yielding real-time data and a conclusive test \nresult within minutes of the sample being taken. The idea is to combine this with novel electronic multiplex techniques and large area graphene to create a multiplexed \nbiosensor array technology to enable the detection of multiple biomarkers of dementia simultaneously with the potential to significantly increase throughput.\nAn objective of the project is to demonstrate a novel, low-cost, reliable, POC diagnostic platform, based on multiplex graphene biosensors, for early detection of \ndementia and following its progression from biological fluid such as blood. \n\nThe development of a low cost, point-of-care biosensing technology that makes it possible to detect dementia, objectively, in the early stages and to \nmonitor disease progression, rapidly, from a simple blood test would revolutionise diagnosis of dementia and have a huge positive impact on the selection of \nsubjects for clinical trials for new drugs and for monitoring response to treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M006301/1","grantId":"EP/M006301/1","fundValue":"988105","fundStart":"2015-02-01","fundEnd":"2018-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Emmanuel  Ifeachor","coPersons":["Camille  Carroll","Daniele  Doneddu","Owen James Guy","Shakil Ahmed  Awan","Genhua  Pan"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
