Through our work in educational journalism - interviewing curriculum planners and teachers - it was an opportunity we recognised some time ago, motivating us to develop and test methods of making cutting-edge science accessible and interesting.\n\nScience communication often focuses on content and overestimates a reader's or listener's ability to absorb that content through written and spoken language. This can create high barriers for learners. At the heart of our whole approach is the aim of breaking down those barriers, using knowledge gained from research and classroom practice of what works in learning and literacy. \n\nThe principal partners - Real Science and Glasgow Science Festival - have made considerable progress, including interviewing dozens of researchers, testing the methods in schools, refining and developing the initial concepts, and creating a new resource called Three Minute Learning.\n\n3ml is designed to take science learning and literacy to a new level, by engaging users with short, readable texts on a wide range of topics. Simple reading activities - described in more detail below - are employed within an appealing online learning resource. Essentially 3ml is a method of smuggling science into every subject in school. \n\nThe proposed project now plans to use this resource as a vehicle to engage schools and the wider community with cutting-edge physics research. We will create and test a new library of stories based on interviews with STFC-funded researchers in Scotland and at CERN. We will pilot this extensively in schools. We will test a new method, based on our research, of engaging learners with science stories, even when they have little prior knowledge of the content.\n\nThe long-term aim is ambitious but, we believe, achievable. Science will no longer be seen as esoteric, occasionally interesting but inaccessible to normal people. Big ideas in science will be discussed as readily as politics and economics are now. Higgs bosons, gravitational waves and dark matter will take their rightful place in modern culture, alongside Shakespeare, Dickens, Mozart and Monet.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001640/1","grantId":"ST/L001640/1","fundValue":"9987","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Rebecca  Crawford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
