This disruption can occur when regulatory elements responsible for controlling white blood cell development malfunction. We recently discovered that a disturbance in the function of a ubiquitously expressed element protein kinase C during white blood cell development, initiates a specific type of leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). CLL is the most common adult blood cancer in the Western world, for which there is currently no cure. While many research groups are engaged in investigating the mechanisms that can induce CLL cell death in patients as a mechanism to remove the leukaemic cells, little is known about the origin of CLL cells. Until now it has been almost impossible to address this question, as the factors responsible for this initiating this leukaemia have remained elusive. However, our novel mouse model provides us with a unique opportunity to gain fundamental knowledge about the cellular origin of CLL, and may assist in the generation of novel treatments to cure CLL. Within our university-based research laboratory, we will perform established cellular and molecular techniques to identify which cell is responsible initiating CLL. In parallel with these experiments, we will characterise the CLL-initiating cells in CLL-patient cell samples. In this way, we will uncover important information regarding the cell of origin for CLL.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601099","grantId":"G0601099","fundValue":"363854","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Michie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
