In this publication, I made three key arguments which are the starting point for this project; firstly, our comprehension of life in Ancient Greece is richer if we understand how individuals, households and communities organised themselves to construct the houses in which they lived rather than only seeing them as the places in which activities took place; secondly, digital technologies and quantitative analysis offer exciting opportunities to enhance how we see and make sense of the ancient world; and thirdly the tasks of daily life and experiences in the home caused bodily transformations that affected people's quality of life and altered perception of self and the economic productivity of the household.\n\nA fourth major driver in the development of this project, which was an unplanned consequence of my research leave, is the success of teaching an undergraduate module on Classical houses and households. Students examine Classical houses, in both group work and independent guided learning to explore broad ranging themes including display and consumption, hygiene and sanitation, gendered spaces in the home and identity formation. Significantly, students develop their skills of digital technology (using social media to communicate within groups working on the same archaeological site and SketchUp Make to develop skills of 3D modelling, and Computer Aided Design) and quantitative data analysis using Excel to analyse household assemblages. The responses to these digital learning experiences and improvement of student performance stimulated the development of this project.\n\nWhilst this project builds upon my previous AHRC funded research, it extends its impact beyond both academic research and university teaching. Over the course of twelve months, this project will use my research on the houses of Ancient Greece to engage and collaborate with schoolteachers and children, and third sector organisations. There are two key aims of the project. The first aim is to reach out to teachers to disseminate my research and collaborate with a selected group of teachers to create resources and enhance teaching of Ancient Greece at Key Stage (KS) 2, 3 and 4 and as a consequence promote interest in the study of the Greek and Roman worlds, and to enhance the provision of Classical Civilisation at GCSE and A level. The second aim is to provide successful evidence of the benefits of integrated cross-curricular teaching for student engagement and achievement to a large international audience through the dissemination of open access resources with teacher evaluations on professional websites (TES Connect, The Guardian Education and The Historical Association) that have international readership.\n\nIn order to achieve these aims, the project will implement targeted phases of activities that are structured over a twelve-month period. These include the creation of original curricula and lesson plans by the project partners; online training of teachers in 3D modelling software; Virtual classroom visits by PI to start activities. Online workshops will enable teaching materials and practice to be evaluated and best practice will be shared. \n\nThe project will also produce a special edition of the journal of The Classics Library including an article explaining the context of the research, lesson plans, reports by the teachers, observations on the success of the cross-curricula syllabi, and summary of the main findings of the project. The different outputs will ensure maximum impact as they are housed on open access websites that have global reach.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N003543/1","grantId":"AH/N003543/1","fundValue":"78864","fundStart":"2016-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Fitzjohn","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
