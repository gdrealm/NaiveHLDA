Miniaturization will be achieved by putting in place a genuine paradigm shift, namely the change of the main mechanism used to measure gravity with quantum systems: we will use the gravity-dependent phase acquired by an oscillating optically-levitated quantum system. This is in stark contrast with previous proposals based on the free fall of matter-like systems. While the first design will assume a classical framework where gravity is assumed Newtonian, we will develop new technology aimed at detecting, for the first time, general relativistic effects. We will consider two experimental platforms. The first employs an optically-levitated nanodiamond that contains a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre. This setup has the advantage that it operates at room temperature. The second is a cold-atom setup that provides a natural arena to extend the proposal to the general relativistic regime. We will assess thoroughly, both experimentally and theoretically, the effects of potential systematic errors and noise sources in both setups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M003019/1","grantId":"EP/M003019/1","fundValue":"44820","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ivette  Fuentes-Schuller","coPersons":["Gavin William Morley","Ilya  Kuprov","Mauro  Paternostro","Lucia  Hackermueller"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
