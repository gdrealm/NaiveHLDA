{"id":"3ADAE7A0-7330-4FB1-98A2-1EA4423CDEA0","title":"Biomedical Catalyst â€“ Q-CANCER: development of a sample to result device for low cost, rapid tumour profiling","abstractText":"This project is concerned with the development of a fully integrated, low test cost, sample to result medical device that will enable a histopathologist (or a technician) to perform multiplex genotyping and tumour staging &amp; profiling, within minutes, from formalin fixed &amp;/or fresh tissue samples, providing a molecular adjunct to a histopathologist's standard practice. The device will automate sample prep &amp; DNA sequencing at the press of a single button, following the introduction of a sample. The tissue sample is processed using a number of novel &amp; innovative but proven microfluidic and nanotechnologies that allow for massive multiplexing potential. The device will enable fast turnaround of high quality genotyping that integrates with established clinical practice. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly profile &amp; stage a tumour or identify genetic mutations will lead to improvements in patient outcomes, reduce patient anxiety &amp; result in cost savings in treatment programmes","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13031","grantId":"MC_PC_13031","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Pike","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
