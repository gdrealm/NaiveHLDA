Tweezer methods generally operate by exerting a force that attracts particles to regions of high intensity, usually the centre of the laser beam. This mechanism, and others that are employed in laser cooling and trapping of atoms, utilise forces that operate directly on individual particles of matter. \n\n\n\nQuite recently, a wave of excitement was created by the discovery of something quite different: optically induced forces that operate between particles, over nanoscale dimensions. Such inter-particle forces offer a number of highly distinctive features which can be exploited for the controlled optical manipulation of matter. Through such interactions, new opportunities for creating optically ordered matter have already been demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, leading to the introduction of terms such as 'optical binding' and 'optical matter' in the literature. Whereas the forces that determine normal physical and chemical behaviour owe their origin to the intrinsic properties of individual molecules, these optically induced forces operate very differently - and best of all, they are experimentally controllable. \n\n\n\nSince the first, tentative theoretical work, experimental studies have been growing in number and scope. This area of science is now advancing with extreme rapidity, its enormous potential having been first predicted in an influential paper on the future of chemistry, published twenty years ago. As a prelude to the present study, the Principal Investigator and co-workers at the University of East Anglia developed a comprehensive theory of optically induced inter-particle forces, identifying a number of effects not previously determined, and showing that such forces can be either attractive or repulsive according to given conditions. Calculations based on the new theory were performed for a variety of systems, identifying and illustrating the scope for applications. The first results on carbon nanotubes indicated possibilities for optically modifying the structure of nanotube films, while subsequent applications identified new forms of optical patterning and clustering. \n\n\n\nComprehensive theory has now been developed for application to more complex systems, helping pave the way for innovative technical applications. The first task was to construct a detailed representation of how these inter-particle forces operate within a variety of systems including nanoparticles and molecular clusters. By mapping out the associated potential energy surfaces, the formation and stability of optically ordered microarrays was examined in detail and related to experimental observations. A significant breakthrough was the discovery of multi-beam conditions under which optically induced forces could be modified - and even cancelled, allowing both the steered accretion and controlled collapse of nanoparticle assemblies. Further work identified mechanical effects in parallel nanostructured surfaces. Experimentally characterising such effects should unlock significant materials applications. \n\n\n\nAttention has also been given to identifying special effects that arise when particles are irradiated by the complex optical fields associated with structured light, such as the exotic laser beams known as 'optical vortices'. This work led into the development of new quantum electrodynamical theory, specifically tailored for application to multiple-site light scattering and related optomechnical interactions, including quantum inteference effects. Since it has been shown that holographic methods can simultaneously trap and steer hundreds of suspended particles, the results of experimental investigations into such phenomena are now keenly awaited; all of the necessary theory is now in place\n\nThe results revealed novel ways to modify the forces that usually exist between molecules - those which in fact usually hold everyday objects together. The results also gave new insights into how to introduce forces between micron-sized particles and nanoparticles when they are trapped in a laser beam. As a result of this research, there were important outcomes at several levels. \n\n\n\nFirst, it became apparent how the use of laser pulse sequences with purpose-designed synthetic materials can be used to produce finely controllable motion, and even an ultrafast, reversible modification of material properties such as shape. Importantly, many of these applications can be put into operation with very little consumption of energy.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the work provided new insights into how micron and sub-micron sized particles can be organized and held together by nothing more than light. In this way, such particles can be drawn into pre-determined assemblies, rather like the way that atoms are drawn together in a molecule The difference is that when the light is turned off, these larger assemblies will naturally fall apart.\n\n\n\nThirdly, some significant new calculational methods were devised. These proved to greatly simplify the analysis, and also to provide significant new insights into the underlying mechanisms. These methods are now available to greatly simplify and speed up future work on light and the forces between molecules; new developments on this basis are already well underway. The work in this area is developing towards the designed optical assembly of nanoparticles, and principles enabling the optical separation of large molecules and nanoparticles in mixtures according to their intrinsic structural properties.
