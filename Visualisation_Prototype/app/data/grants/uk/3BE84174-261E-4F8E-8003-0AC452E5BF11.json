This is mainly driven by deployment of the FTTx technologies and the emergence of ever more bandwidth demanding, dynamic and heterogeneous e-services such as 3D games, virtual worlds, and network based high quality media applications such as HD and UHD IPTV.As 100 Gbps Ethernet is becoming commercially available, researchers are focusing on 1Tbps transport by investigation solutions for achieving bit rates at 100Gbps and beyond per wavelength channels which can be deployed in a dynamic network environment. A promising solution for transmission of high bit rate at 100Gbps and beyond per channel is optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM). It can take advantage of multi-level modulation schemes; enable the efficient compensation of transmission impairments and also adaptation of data rate and transmission format of the transmission channel. This features make the O-OFDM technology an attractive solution for future optical Internet where dynamic bandwidth allocation is requiredThe PATRON proposal combines advantage of multi-level modulations, Optical OFDM multiple Access (O-OFDMA) concept and network elements programmability and proposes an advanced programmable optical transmitter and receiver capable of transmitting different user data with different bit rates and different modulation format in a dynamic O-OFDMA core network. The research novelties of this project are:1- Design and implement a programmable O-OFDMA transmitter and receiver that can be attached to a commercial electronic edge router or optical cross connect and constitute edge or core router of an O-OFDMA network.2-Deployment and adaptation of O-OFDMA technology in core optical networks by proposing a novel transmitter/receiver capable of mapping real time data from metro/access network into high speed subcarriers at different wavelength channels in a core O-OFDMA network3- Core network programmability through on-demand and programmable network partitioning and bandwidth allocation with fine granularity at wavelength and subcarrier level enabled by the proposed transmitter/receiverThe major outcome of this project will be an implementation of a programmable O-OFDMA transmitter and receiver supporting the above functionalities, which will be demonstrated and validated in a lab trial.The outcome of PATRON project can potentially enable network network operators to partition their network to several segments, each with different bandwidth and QoS capability. The partitioning criteria such as bandwidth and QoS can be defined based on user or application requirementsThis proposal aims to open a new field of research for the Principle Investigator (PI) inline with the current activities within High Performance Networking Group (HPNG) in University of Essex. . The outcomes of PATRON will enable the PI to advance the HPNG rich portfolio in two dimensions: 1- high-speed optical transport for future core optical network based on optical OFDM technology and 2- programmable and application-ware optical networking for future Internet based on optical OFDMA technology. It will enable the PI to build his own independent research field by further developing the novel concept of optical core network infrastructure partitioning using O-OFDMA networking technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H051678/2","grantId":"EP/H051678/2","fundValue":"28230","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Reza  Nejabati","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
