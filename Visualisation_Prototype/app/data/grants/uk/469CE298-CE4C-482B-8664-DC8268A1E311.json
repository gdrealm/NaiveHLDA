Unfortunately, psychological and pharmacological treatments for addiction are often unsuccessful. Some progress has been made in behavioural treatments for addiction which may involve exposing addicts to reminders of their drug / alcohol use, while preventing them from actually taking the drug/drinking. This is called exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. However, many who complete this type of treatment still relapse when they are in environments where temptations or reminders of drug use are present. This happens because memories which influence drug-use are particularly strong and automatically trigger drug taking / drinking. \nHowever, it is possible that if psychological treatment is combined with a drug which improves learning, old, drug-taking memories might be ?over-written? more successfully. One drug called D-Cycloserine (DCS) has been successfully used in treating anxiety disorders when combined with ERP. Another drug, cannabidiol (CBD), has proved effective in addicted animals when it is combined with a version of ERP. Since there are some parallels in the psychological processes which occur in drug / alcohol addiction and anxiety disorders, we want to investigate whether DCS and CBD can improve psychological treatment for drug / alcohol addiction. If they can, this may prove to be an important breakthrough in the treatment of the very harmful disorder of addiction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802718","grantId":"G0802718","fundValue":"217066","fundStart":"2009-07-06","fundEnd":"2011-09-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sunjeev  Kamboj","coPersons":["Celia  Morgan","Helen Valerie Curran"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
