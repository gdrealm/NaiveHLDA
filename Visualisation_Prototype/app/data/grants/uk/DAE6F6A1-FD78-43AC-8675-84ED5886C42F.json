He invited a number of interested parties to meet and instigate what has become the 'Spring Group', a broad and interdisciplinary group of academics and partners in industry.\nAll of the group believe that lateral thinking and creative experimentation are fundamental tools to ensure the progression of their subject and creativity as-a-whole. Through the development of its networking activity, the group intends to set up the following strategically timetabled events:\n? Structured and recorded meetings with partners from industry to enable the development of creativity between all parties. \n? The development of the potential public projects already being researched by the group alongside new collaborative initiatives. These involve the proposed production of a public sculpture linked to cosmic ray activity, sited in Britain, together with the production of &quot;outreach&quot; information to assist the Bjerknes Centre communicate their important work on Climate Change to schools and the general public.\n? The production of a major exhibition and conference at the end of the project's two-year period to chart the progress of the group's activities, present new displays and create a public forum for debate.\nThe group's overall goal is to share its initial inroads into areas of creative thinking and promote creativity within as wide a field of education and industry as possible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E508340/1","grantId":"AH/E508340/1","fundValue":"24475","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlie  Hooker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
