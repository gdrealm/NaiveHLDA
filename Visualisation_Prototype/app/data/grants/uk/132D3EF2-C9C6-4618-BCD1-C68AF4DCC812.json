Accurate protein synthesis is achieved through the interplay of many different molecules, including ribosomes (the molecular machines that actually achieve protein synthesis), tRNAs (adapter molecules that transport amino acids to the ribosome), and translation factors (helper proteins that establish the correct contact between ribosomes and tRNAs). In order to achieve accurate protein synthesis it is critical that the levels of each of these elements are matched exactly to the frequency with which they are used: if cells contain too much or too little of any of these elements, protein synthesis errors occur more frequently and cellular health declines. In normal cells that only produce proteins from their own genes, the protein synthesis system and levels of the molecules described above are optimised to achieve the required low error rates and high translational speed. However, in industrial applications additional genes are often introduced into cells with the aim of producing specific proteins that are not naturally produced by them. This strategy is used in hte pharmaceutical industry to produce the latest generation drugs against cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis. When cells make proteins from foreign or artificial genes, the protein synthesis machinery must deal with a situation for which it has not been optimised. We predict that this will increase error rates during the production of the relevant proteins. Protein synthesis errors have negative effects for the ease with which protein-based drugs can be purified and formulated following synthesis in the host cells, and may also adversely affect the potency of the final product. A second prediction we make is that, if we understood the principles of optimisation in detail, we might develop strategies that restore optimal protein synthesis and reduce error rates. Both predictions follow logically from existing knowledge of the translational machinery, although to date they have not yet been experimetnally tested and therefore we can not be completely sure whether they are true. Because our predictions on the relationship between optimised protein synthesis and expression of foreign proteins have important consequences for our ability to make high-quality protein-based drugs, we wish to test them in a small pilot study. We will develop computational models of protein synthesis that will help us to understand the principles of optimisation in protein synthesis. We will then use thes models to suggest strategies for achieving optimisation under conditions of foreign protein synthesis in a simple yeast-based expression system. Lastly, we will test experimentally whether these strategies do indeed improve the quality of proteins, and facilitate their processing following synthesis. If this pilot study confirms our predictions, we will use this as basis for a larger study in which we develop optimisation strategies for the various protein synthesis systems used in the pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I010351/1","grantId":"BB/I010351/1","fundValue":"66449","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We have had one collaborative project with an industrial partner following this grant where we optimised a test sequence for this partner.\nWe have had a proof-of-concept project funded through our local commercialization department to adapt findings from this project to industrial recombinant protein expression systems.

These include current frontline drugs against diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and others. The efficient production of such drugs is both important for the health of patients and as an economic factor, since the market for protein-based drugs was estimated at nearly 150 billion dollars in 2010.\n\nProtein drugs are large and complex chemical structures that differ strongly from older, so-called &amp;quot;small molecule&amp;quot; drugs. One of the main differences lies in their production: while small molecule drugs are produced via purely chemical processes, protein drugs are produced by introducing artificial genetic material into microbial or animal cells grown in culture. In response to the new genetic material, these cells then start to produce the new protein, which can be purified and given to patients.\n\nAlthough this strategy works generally well, some poorly characterised consequences arise from the fact that host cells containing additional genetic material make more protein than they would normally do. This additional demand on the protein synthesis machinery could potentially lead to sick cells, and in turn result in drugs with undesirable properties and less than the best possible quality. \n\nOne of the key properties of genetic material is that slightly differing variants of a gene can produce the same protein. At the outset of our study, our hypothesis was that different genes making the same drug should affect host cells in different ways. Such differences could be exploited to minimise negative effects arising from the additional demand on the protein synthesis machinery in cells that produce protein drugs.\n\nIn our study, we initially constructed computer models of the translational apparatus of a particular type of host cell (yeast cells). By comparing predictions from our computer models to experimental measurements of protein synthesis in yeast cells, we ensured that these models were an accurate representation of protein synthesis in real cells. We then analysed simulations performed with the models, and found that upon introduction of additional genetic material, a particular resource called the ribosomes becomes limiting. This limitation can strongly impair the health of drug-producing host cells. Our simulations also predicted that the different genetic variants that produce the same drug impair cell health to different degrees, thus validating our initial hypotheses. All of the predictions from our computer simulations were then verified by targeted experiments. \n\nIn summary, we were able to identify mechanisms by which the production of proteins from artificial genetic material can negatively impact cells. We were also able to develop strategies for minimising this negative impact, thus enabling the generation of protein-based drugs with improved properties. Our computational models will be useful tools for improving sequence design strategies for recombinant protein encoding sequences. Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
