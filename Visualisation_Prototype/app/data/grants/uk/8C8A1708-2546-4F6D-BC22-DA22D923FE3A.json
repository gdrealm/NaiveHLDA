{"id":"8C8A1708-2546-4F6D-BC22-DA22D923FE3A","title":"An Alternative Improvement Agenda: Transforming Learning Capacity","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series draws upon research conducted between 1999 and 2003, detailed within the book ‘Learning without Limits’ (Hart, Dixon, Drummond and McIntyre: 2004). The project was prompted by concerns that determinist ideas about ability were being given renewed legitimacy within the government improvement agenda and as part of official models of good practice. It brought together a group of nine classroom teachers from a variety of primary and secondary schools and studied their practice in order to identify the chief concepts and methods that are distinctive of teaching free from determinist assumptions of ability. As a result a credible alternative to ability-based teaching was articulated, emphasising the power of education to transform learning capacity. This seminar series brings together the work of a range of researchers in the UK and draws upon international practice in order to extend understandings of ‘transforming learning capacity’ as the basis of an alternative improvement agenda for primary and secondary schools. The series will inform and empower a wide group of stakeholders (including teachers, teacher trainers, post-graduate students, researchers and policy makers) by further articulating a clear theoretical perspective around ‘transforming learning capacity’ and rooting it firmly in the practicalities of every day school life.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4217","grantId":"RES-451-25-4217","fundValue":"15125","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Taylor","coPersons":["D  McIntyre"],"organisation":"Bishop Grosseteste University College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
