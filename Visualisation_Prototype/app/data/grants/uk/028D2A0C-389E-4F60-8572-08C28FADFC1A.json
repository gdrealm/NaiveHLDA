Algorithmic composition involves the use of\nstep-by-step procedures, usually encapsulated in software routines, to create\nmusic. Most conspicuous amongst proponents of musical algorithms is\npop-musician Brian Eno. The power of such systems is still not fully\nunderstood or deeply investigated by musicians and composers, whether highly\ntrained or not. There are many riches to be mined, as the expression of\ncompositional ideas in software often leads to unexpected and surprisingly new,\nexciting results, most of which cannot be achieved via traditional means.\nAlgorithmic composition techniques can thus play a vital and energising role in\nthe development of modern music across all genres and styles.\n\n&quot;slippery chicken&quot; is a package of music composition software written in the\nprogramming language Common Lisp. The system produces music of any aesthetic.\nThe original focus was to facilitate the combination of electronic and\ninstrumental sound worlds, not just at the sonic but at the structural level.\nIt uses a sequence-based approach to generating, in one pass, complete musical\nscores for traditional instruments, or with the same data writing digital music\nfiles for synthesisers or samplers. Its top-down, generative approach would be\nof great interest to media/film/TV composers working to tight deadlines.\n\nFor mainly practical reasons, the software is not yet publicly available: at\nmore than 33,000 lines of code (c. 580 pages), the project has not yet been\nformally documented, fully tested for every eventuality, and packaged into some\nauto-installable form. This could, however, be accomplished within one year\nwith the help of a technician; funding is being sought to undertake this work.\nWeb-based documentation will be accompanied by illustrative musical material\nand other outputs: an audio CD, a European lecture-concert tour, workshops, a\nconference presentation, a journal paper, and downloadable demonstration\ncompositions that show off the software's unique features.\n\nAlthough the system would be released as open-source, freely-downloadable\nsoftware which the music community at large may use without cost for\nnon-commercial purposes, securing commercial licensing agreements is another\nfocus of the project. This would be two-tiered: (a) licence to integrate\nslippery-chicken in whole or in part into commercial music software programmes;\nand (b) pay-for-support services for individual professional users of the\nsystem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J004529/1","grantId":"AH/J004529/1","fundValue":"95141","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Edwards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
