A study of Government, the BBC and UK Film Council","abstractText":"How is creativity, both as a concept and as a practice, affected by UK government policy? This project will analyse creative industries policy since New Labour's coming to power in 1997. It will document where ideas about cultural creativity and its economic significance have come from and investigate how policy debate was shaped. It will also undertake two detailed case studies of the impact of policy on creative practice in the BBC and the UK Film Council. Finally, addressing the question of how devolution affects policy and practice, attention will be focused on BBC Scotland and the film agency, Scottish Screen.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112152/2","grantId":"112152/2","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Schlesinger","coPersons":["Simon  Frith","Richard  Paterson"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
