In addition, the HIV/AIDS component of the evaluation will use the PBF treatment as an instrument to investigate whether or not improved health status from access to ART improves the socio-economic status of HIV/AIDS patients’ households.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence generated will serve the Rwandan health community as they prepare for expansion of PBF programs within Rwanda, as well as the international community as it searches for more effective methods for addressing critical health care delivery issues.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-167-25-0259","grantId":"RES-167-25-0259","fundValue":"722164","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefano Michele Bertozzi","coPersons":["Sergio Antonio Bautista","Agnès  Binagwaho","Paul Jerome Gertler","Paulin  Basinga"],"organisation":"National Institute of Public Health","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
