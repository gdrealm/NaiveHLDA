In order to pick up new patterns of behaviour with the potential to spread rapidly, we will study health information seeking behaviour in one relatively remote rural area, one rural area with good transport links to Dhaka and one slum in Dhaka.</p>\n\n<p>We will use a questionnaire survey, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to explore how men and women use mobile phones and how and where they find information and advice for different kinds of health problems. We will look for early adapters of new ways of using mobile phones and the internet. We will also organise interviews with key decision-makers in the health and telecommunications sectors to discuss their views of the regulatory challenges associated with a technology that enables suppliers of pharmaceuticals and specialised services to communicate directly with potential consumers.The findings will be relevant to ongoing debates about how to increase access to reliable and trustworthy health information and advice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018651/1","grantId":"ES/J018651/1","fundValue":"395954","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our preliminary findings have been presented to an advisory committee, chaired by a senior official of the Bangladesh Department of Health.
