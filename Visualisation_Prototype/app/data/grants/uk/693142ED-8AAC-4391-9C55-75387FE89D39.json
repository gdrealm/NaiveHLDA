Lincoln and e2v technologies (the industrial partner providing the novel sensor technology) work closely together on the development of smart sensors that perform such analysis, and transmit such information to a central hub. Lincoln's first key task, in conjunction with e2v technologies, is to develop the algorithms to integrate this tracking with the new sensor systems.Lincoln also has a record of research in the development of computer algorithms that analyze the behavior of a subject for assistive care purposes, based on the subject's location and movement. In this part of the project Lincoln will build upon this experience to develop algorithms that can identify specific causes of concern in the behavior of the subject (e.g. if the subject becomes inactive for an unusually long period of time, is prone, or is agitated), or if the behavior is unusual (perhaps indicating confusion or distress). This information can be used to alert or inform carers.Similarly, Lincoln will develop algorithms to identify causes for concern in the pattern of behavior of obese patients, including the integration of information gathered both inside and outside the home.The performance of these algorithms will be tested in a home environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=TS/H000143/1","grantId":"TS/H000143/1","fundValue":"129516","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Impact to date is further research only.
