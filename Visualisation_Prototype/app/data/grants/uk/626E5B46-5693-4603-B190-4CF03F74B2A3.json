The Jos plateau in Nigeria is a heavily populated area home to almost a million cows kept by settled pastoralists who live alongside subsistence farmers. Trypanosomiasis causes severe production losses in livestock in this area, as it does through out Sub Saharan Africa. It affects the livelihoods of the poorest and most disenfranchised populations living in rural communities. The parasites that cause trypanosomiasis are transmitted by tsetse flies feeding on blood from an infected host. Treatment of the disease is both affordable and effective: a single treatment with a cheap injectable drug is sufficient to clear the animal of all circulating trypanosomes Therefore, although these parasites are a double constraint to development, their control is equally of double benefit to humans and their livestock. In the absence of large scale tsetse control programmes, sustainable methods of trypanosomiasis control need to be found. It is not appropriate or possible to treat every animal without the risk of resistance to the drugs developing. It is thus necessary to target interventions to high-risk carriers of disease amongst livestock and wildlife. In this project, we aim to (i) maximise livestock health through integrated disease management (ii) Identify the major risk factors for trypanosomiasis at different times and locations iii) formulate a policy for effective government support of community based disease management. The project will enable policy makers, public institutions, communities and individual smallholder farmers to identify appropriate and cost-effective methods for the sustainable farmer based control of trypanosomiasis in livestock.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009213/1","grantId":"BB/H009213/1","fundValue":"927259","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our results are currently being used by the Plateau State government, National Veterinary Research Institute and Nigerian Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research by:\n\nDisseminating project results to pastoral communities which opens further avenues for extension services\n\nRefining their recommendations to pastoralists for endemic disease control and increased productivity\n\nRefining allocation of resources and institutional cultures of collaboration to align with the reality of endemic diseases as \n\nAlso being used by private sector feed and pharmaceutical industry partners to continue to expand their retail network amongst the Fulani in Plateau State in ways that meet pastoralist needs and circumvent barriers to access and uptake identified in this project.

These include Rickettsia spp. which may pose a previously unrealised public health concern with regards the risk of zoonotic infection to the local livestock herder community. \nThe limited range and diversity of tsetse and low rates of trypanosomiasis has been fully mapped, this has improved our understanding of the changing epidemiology of this disease within the study area. \nAltitude, season, migration and other husbandry practices were identified as significant risk factors for disease \nDespite the relatively low prevalence of intestinal helminths recorded, this group of diseases had the most significant health and productivity impacts.\nWith regards to the management of vector challenge, restricted application (RAP) of insecticide and Pour-on treatments successfully reduced disease prevalence but not prophylactic treatments with Isometamidium chloride. RAP has proven to be affordable and feasible for herders with moderate uptake amongst Fulani. \n\nAnimal health care delivery.\n We have identified important differences in perceptions of herders and animal health workers on disease, diagnostics, treatments and shared responsibility for control pose additional barriers to access and uptake of veterinary services. \n\nFulani livelihood findings\nThis research also included an extensive qualitative and quantitative study of pastoral livelihoods. Findings show that the majority of Fulani are agro-pastoralists who are in 'middle' or 'better off' categories in terms of cattle, but poor in terms of land. \nCompared to 1975, resilience to 'shocks' has increased but productivity, particularly reproductive rates, has decreased. High vulnerability to the 'new' risks of marginalisation and lack of access to natural resources. \nIncome is primarily from livestock sales, as well as cash crops, dairy products and off farm activity. \nAn increase in seasonal migration due marginalisation in access to pasture and water was recorded. The associated increase in herding requirements has led to very high production costs.\n\nGender related issues\nComparative study of gender issues in 3 rural communities highlighted different constraints to health and livelihoods of women. The absence of women's social/community groups amongst the Fulani of the Jos Plateau places them at a disadvantage for access to income generating opportunities, ability to voice their concerns within the community and ability to benefit from external interventions/messaging compared to their indigenous peers or Fulani women in the Kachia grazing reserve. General opportunities for earning income and messaging/engagement amongst the Fulani are less inclusive of women than those of their host communities on the Jos Plateau. Further publicity and advocacy would increase uptake of RAP amongst livestock producers\n\nFurther engagement opportunities with pastoralists to increase awareness of endemic disease prevalence and recommendations for control.\n\nMolecular methods developed for diagnosis of tick-borne diseases.\n\nQuantitative aspects of pastoral livelihood analysis can be used to cost future interventions for feasibility and affordability to pastoralists.\n\nEndemic disease epidemiology useful to veterinary health care workers and policy makers for prioritising resources Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
