Through seven thematic seminars and an end of series briefing in the House of Commons, the series will bring together leading and early career scholars from across International Development, Politics and History, along with partners in non-academic and policy communities, including Chatham House, Institute for Public Policy Research and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa.<br /><br />Through these events, the series traces how UK Africa policy changed under Labour, considering how this relationship reflects national concerns, such as political party identities and public image, as well as international ones, including relative UK position on a global stage. It also brings this analysis into the contemporary context by exploring how UK Africa relations post-2010 are managed, presented and justified under conditions of financial austerity, coalition government and increased public scrutiny that resulted from ring-fencing aid budgets. Through the seminars and outputs the series will therefore provide the first in depth examination of contemporary Africa policy, establishing a new cross-disciplinary research network around this important area of UK foreign policy and domestic politics.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000725/1","grantId":"ES/L000725/1","fundValue":"26956","fundStart":"2013-11-15","fundEnd":"2016-12-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Danielle  Beswick","coPersons":["Stephen  Hurt","G  Harrison","David McBeath Anderson","Thomas  Cargill","Sarah  Mulley"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
