This protein, called eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, or elF4E, exists in all cells of higher organisms and plays a central role in producing other proteins by reading messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that plants without this protein can be resistant to infection with some viruses. Although specific viruses (Potyviruses) that depend upon this protein have an RNA with a slightly different structure from that of mRNAs, we believe that elF4E plays a very similar role in helping the viral RNA to produce other proteins. From studies of different crop plants that are resistant to potyviruses, we know of the existence of different forms of elF4E which cannot assist potyvirus infection. It appears that the inability of these resistant plants to produce viral proteins is associated with a failure of elF4E to bind to the starting-end of the viral RNA. In our studies of peas resistant to pea potyvirus (called Pea seed-borne mosaic virus: PSbMV), we have also identified another very surprising property of elF4E. It also has the ability to assist PSbMV to move from one cell to another, to spread the infection through the plant. Hence, altered elF4E prevents the virus from both replicating and spreading in resistant pea plants. Cell-to-cell movement of large molecules is also important for plant growth and development although the mechanisms involved are generally very poorly understood. Therefore, the study of elF4E can tell us about several very important areas of biology: how viruses infect plants and the potential for resistance in plants, the translation of RNAs to produce proteins, and cell-to-cell communication. We will make new changes in the elF4E protein and relate these to the potential of plants to carry out mRNA translation, virus replication, and virus movement from cell to cell. We will also determine the atomic structure of the elF4E and virus proteins that join together in a complex. In this way we will understand how the proteins join together and what we need to do to stop it happening. From this information we will identify mutant pea plants where the complex cannot form and therefore plants with potential to exhibit new resistance to PSbMV and other potyviruses. We will also identify mutants for the experimental plant Arabidopsis, which will establish a range of genetic and biological tools for further dissection of cell-to-cell communications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D521949/1","grantId":"BB/D521949/1","fundValue":"251063","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2009-04-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Maule","coPersons":["David Mark Lawson"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
