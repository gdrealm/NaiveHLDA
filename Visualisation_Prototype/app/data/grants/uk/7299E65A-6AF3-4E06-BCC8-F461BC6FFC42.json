Themain challenge in this work is the presence of singularities ofthe Green's kernels, which make the known asymptotic methodsinefficient and require additional analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F005563/1","grantId":"EP/F005563/1","fundValue":"562545","fundStart":"2007-10-15","fundEnd":"2010-10-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Vladimir  Maz'ya","coPersons":["Alexander  Movchan"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
