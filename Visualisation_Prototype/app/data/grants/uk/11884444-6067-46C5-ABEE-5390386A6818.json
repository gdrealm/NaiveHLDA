While the biology of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is quite well-understood as it occurs in outbreak settings in developed countries, this understanding has not been applied to regions of the world where the virus is permanently present. This is particularly unfortunate, since FMD has serious impacts for small-farmers, and previous studies rank FMD as one of the most important livestock diseases associated with poverty. Tanzania has the third largest population of domestic livestock in Africa, and livestock are critical for the nutrition and economic welfare of the millions of people who live in rural Tanzania. Rural communities depend directly on livestock for food, milk, use of animals in crop production, and in raising money through local sales. FMD causes animals to lose weight, reduce milk production, become immobile, and reduce in financial value, and therefore its control is particularly important for communities who depend directly on the well-being of their livestock. FMDV is often found to infect buffalo and other wild ungulates, and wildlife are often suspected to be either the direct of ultimate source of viruses causing disease in domestic livestock. This has led to conflict between the management of wildlife, which is itself a hugely important financial resource in countries like Tanzania, and domestic livestock, with calls for the construction of fences similar to those constructed in southern Africa that serve to reduce contact between domestic livestock and wildlife. There is an urgent need to understand how important wildlife is as a source of FMD for domestic livestock, and to find more environmentally-friendly ways of preventing the virus from moving out from wildlife sanctuaries. FMD can be controlled through the use of vaccination, but the vaccines are not perfect, providing only short-lived protection from the symptoms of the disease rather than infection itself, and protecting against only a limited range of genetic types of the virus. In order to use vaccination effectively, it is critical to know the genetic types of the virus that are likely to cause infection in animals, so that the best vaccines can be chosen. Unfortunately, although quite easily obtained, this knowledge is almost completely lacking from very large areas of Africa in which the virus is thought to be present. This project aims to conduct a large-scale survey of FMD in livestock and wildlife in 10 different areas across Tanzania. Blood samples will be collected from domestic livestock and wildlife and tested for evidence of previous infection by FMD and this will provide a crude picture of the most important types of virus that are present. Where virus is actually isolated we will sequence parts of the genome to obtain much more detailed information on the virus types. We will also focus on one area in northern Tanzania to carry out a more detailed longer-term study, collecting blood samples from herds at regular time intervals and collecting viruses during FMD outbreaks and sequencing them. Using these data, we will be able to determine where virus that causes infections comes from (is it wildlife or other domestic animals in the region, or does it evolve within the herds that its infecting?). We will also study the role of animals that have long-term infections of FMDV, identify other farming practices that are associated with infection by FMDV, and study just how much immune protection caused by infection with one strain can protect animals from infection with other strains.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009302/1","grantId":"BB/H009302/1","fundValue":"892423","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results from this project have been directly taken up by the Government of Tanzania, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, for development of the national plan for the control of foot-and-mouth disease in Tanzania within the international framework of the Progressive Control Pathway (PCP).

The results of this research have generated the most comprehensive set of data on endemic FMD in East Africa and a greatly improved understanding of the epidemiology of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa, and the likely effectiveness of potential control strategies.\n\nThe study generated several key findings:\n1. FMD is widespread across pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livestock production systems, but is present at lower levels amongst rural smallholders. Higher levels of infection were also seen in buffalo in wildlife-protected areas close to agro-pastoralist and pastoralist farming systems than in buffalo from parks adjacent to smallholder farming systems. \n2. Analysis of data from cross-sectional studies indicate that cattle are more at risk of FMD infection than small ruminants, and cattle in pastoral and agro-pastoral herds at greater risk than those in rural smallholder herds. Risk factors for infection were not associated with proximity to wildlife-protected areas or frequency of livestock interactions with susceptible wildlife. This suggests that, overall, wildlife populations are not an important source of infection for livestock in northern Tanzania, in contrast to the situation in southern Africa, where buffalo are considered the primary source of transmission to livestock.\n3. FMD outbreaks occur at a high frequency in Tanzania, affecting the majority of cattle herds in pastoral and agropastoral communities every year. At least five distinct outbreaks were recorded over the three-year period of this field study. The herd-level impact of FMD is variable, but can be severe, with substantial impacts on milk production and sales, and affecting traction capacity and potential for agricultural crop production. \n4. Genetic analyses of viruses isolated from FMD outbreaks suggests that successive outbreaks in livestock are caused by different virus types (serotypes), involving viruses conventionally associated with buffalo in southern Africa (SAT 1 and SAT 2 viruses) as well as viruses more typically associated with livestock (O and A viruses). Our findings indicate that cattle are likely to be able to maintain SAT 1 and SAT 2 viruses independently of buffalo. The genetic similarity of viruses isolated from across East Africa suggests FMD occurs as serotype-specific outbreaks sweeping across the region. The temporal sequence of the virus types causing successive outbreaks may be predictable, which has important implications for the design of potential vaccination strategies. \n5. Mathematical models have been developed to use serological data to infer the timing of outbreaks and virus type causing outbreaks. This has allowed retrospective detection and characterization of FMD outbreaks that were not detectable through outbreak surveillance systems and has great potential to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of FMD in Africa, where livestock serological data are frequently collected and available for analysis, but capacity for outbreak investigation and isolation of viruses very limited.\n6. Existing O and A vaccine strains are likely to provide protection against the O and A viruses that are currently circulating in East Africa, but are not likely to be protective against circulating SAT viruses. Livestock vaccination using vaccines against O and A virus could mitigate against the economic and animal health impacts associated with at least 50% of outbreaks occurring in northern Tanzania. \n7. This study provided the first demonstration of SAT 3 virus and O virus in buffalo in Tanzania. These findings will be further investigated, but the isolation of a typical livestock virus (O virus) from buffalo suggests that cattle may be able to act as sources of infection for buffalo. No SAT 3 viruses have yet been detected in cattle, which further reinforces our conclusion that buffalo are unlikely to be a major source of infection for cattle in Tanzania, with buffalo-to-cattle transmission a relatively infrequent event. These findings further support our conclusions that effective cattle vaccination strategies could be implemented that would generate important benefits for rural communities affected by FMD in Tanzania and elsewhere in the east African region. Furthermore, disease control strategies that rely on separation of wildlife and livestock, such as veterinary game fences that have many damaging environmental impacts, are not likely to be necessary to reduce disease impacts in traditional farming systems in East Africa, thus allowing for land-use strategies that allow for mixed livestock and wildlife systems and optimal delivery of ecosystem services in biodiverse savannah rangelands.\n8. This study evaluated several diagnostic tools for FMD detection and characterization in the field, including lateral flow devices, and mobile molecular diagnostic platforms (RT-PCR and RT-LAMP). The operational utility and performance of these tools was investigated in the field during outbreak investigations, and further work is on-going to evaluate how they can best be applied for management and control of FMD, as well as for addressing future research questions. Findings generated by this project have contributed to national and international advocacy and policy agendas in multiple ways. The Tanzanian government has adopted the Progressive Control Pathway (PCP) for FMD, a step-wise approach devised by international bodies (Food and Agriculture Organization and World Organization for Animal Health) to provide a roadmap for endemic countries to control FMD. This project has provided essential epidemiological and socio-economic data, which have contributed to progression along Stage 0 and towards Stage 1 of the PCP. The project has also identified potential control options for FMD in Tanzania (PCP-Stage 1) with expected beneficial consequences for the livestock and wildlife sectors, and local communities. Specifically, prevention of infection in livestock, including cattle vaccination and movement control, is expected to be an effective approach towards reduction of national- and local-level impacts of disease. On the contrary, strategies focusing on separation of wildlife and livestock , such as veterinary fences, would have little impact given the high level of disease present in livestock, and could have considerable damaging consequences on the preservation of Tanzanian unique ecosystems. The project has generated essential data on FMD viruses circulating in Tanzania, which have contributed to vaccine matching and development studies. Such studies have demonstrated that existing vaccine strains are likely to provide protection against at least two of the serotypes circulating in Tanzania (O and A) and therefore vaccination against these serotypes would address a substantial component of the current disease burden. The predictability of outbreaks that our study has highlighted also suggests that vaccination efforts against these two serotypes could be appropriately timed. Finally, the project has addressed a critical knowledge gap related to the socio-economic consequences of FMD for livestock-dependent communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings have demonstrated the potential for FMD control to reduce vulnerability through increased milk and crop production, and are therefore expected to further contribute to current momentum towards global FMD elimination as a means to alleviate poverty.
