{"id":"A752A17D-2A4F-4D31-8D4C-4D5BB032DBE9","title":"Carl Peters, A Biography of German Imperialism.","abstractText":"The aim of my research is to write the first comprehensive biography of the eminent German imperialist Carl Peters. Wilhelmine Germany's most prominent colonial 'hero' was a highly ambivalent person, a philosopher and a traveller, an administrator and a propagandist. To unearth the person behind the myth and the propaganda is the first task of my biography. It will combine the individual with the structural dimension and as an 'exemplary biography' (Ulrich Herbert) explain the general features of German imperialism through the particularities of Carl Peters' life and work. In so doing it will create a biography of an epoch, bridging not only the gap between metropolitan and regional perspectives, but also between the political and cultural. \\nMy biography of Carl Peters supplements ongoing research into the intellectual and discursive underpinnings of imperialism, which have gained importance under the influence of postcolonial theories in two important regards: firstly, it adds into the bigger picture the German experience (which has often been ignored in international scholarship); and secondly it bridges the gap between discourse and day-to-day colonial practice by analysing a prominent figure, who was both a writer and traveller, a man of science and an administrator. It is a contribution to the debate about the significance of German colonialism for German history, which has intensified in the wake of the public polemic about German genocide in Southwest Africa (1904-1908). It will not only address questions about the peculiarities of German colonialism, but also broaden the scope by introducing a European perspective. Being familiar both with the German and the British and American discussion on (post-) colonial history will enable me to combine British and German perspectives into a truly transnational perspective on imperialism.\\nThe project will result in a monograph of 80 000 - 100 000 words and subsequent articles in major peer-reviewed journals. Its findings will be presented at conferences in the UK, Germany and internationally.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E003699/1","grantId":"AH/E003699/1","fundValue":"24146","fundStart":"2008-02-11","fundEnd":"2008-06-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Juergen Karl Zimmerer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
