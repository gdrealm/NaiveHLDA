We anticipate that the proposed programme will lay the groundwork for the future exploitation of an extensive range of previously inaccessible metal-containing block copolymers. This will make a major contribution to the area of metal- containing block copolymers, a relatively unexplored but highly promising field, and subsequently to the areas of materials science and nanoscience. Once the synthetic scope of this novel polymerization process is understoset for applications to be targeted. This future aspect will be the subject of other research proposals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F056974/1","grantId":"EP/F056974/1","fundValue":"331172","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has contributed to the global fundamental research database and has had considerable impact in this regard.
