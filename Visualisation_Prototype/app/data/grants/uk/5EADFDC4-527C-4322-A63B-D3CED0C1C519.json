{"id":"5EADFDC4-527C-4322-A63B-D3CED0C1C519","title":"SWEPT2","abstractText":"The SWEPT2 project aims to develop a sophisticated tool for modelling of wind turbine wakes and wake interactions. It is\nwell known that present wake models are inadequate, especially for application to large offshore wind farms, and have led\nto wind farm designs with larger than expected wake losses. Improved wake models are essential for improved wind farm\ndesigns with improved energy yield. Validation of wake models is critical but difficult to undertake at full scale. Therefore,\nthe EnFlo Laboratory at the University of Surrey will use its specialist wind tunnel facility, the EnFlo stratified flow wind\ntunnel, to make measurements on model wind turbines wakes, wake-wake and wake-turbine interactions, in a range of\nwind flow conditions. The wind tunnel, one of the very few such facilities globally, is able to simulate stable and unstable\natmospheric wind flow. Atmospheric stability has a large affect on turbine wakes, and the controlled environment of the\nlaboratory allows more detailed studies than can be obtained from field measurements. One will complement and provide\nchecks on the other. Both will provide insight into the relevant physics and test-case data for the development of\ncomputational prediction tools in the consortium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508512/1","grantId":"EP/N508512/1","fundValue":"89825","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip E Hancock","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
