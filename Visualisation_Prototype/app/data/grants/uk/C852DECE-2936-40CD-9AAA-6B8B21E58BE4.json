Previous research has identified multiple options and measures for future urban flood risk management that align with more general targets for water centric, sustainable communities. However, it remains unclear how these options and measures can be:\n\n(1) delivered in practice, and; \n(2) comprehensively evaluated in terms of their benefits and costs. \n\nRecognising this, the project proposed here will develop novel ways of driving new, resilient urban forms and fabrics through delivering measures to manage flood events sustainably while enhancing urban life; providing scope for radical solutions under new build; and, realising possibilities for improving existing performance through retrofit and urban renewal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K013661/1","grantId":"EP/K013661/1","fundValue":"1434820","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin Reginald Thorne","coPersons":["Heather  Haynes","Nigel  Wright","Richard  Fenner","Leonard Allen Smith","Christopher  Kilsby","Sue  White","Jessica  Lamond","Dabo  Guan"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
