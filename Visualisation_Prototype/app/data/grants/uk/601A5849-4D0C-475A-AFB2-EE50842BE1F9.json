{"id":"601A5849-4D0C-475A-AFB2-EE50842BE1F9","title":"The Willingness to Pay for Innovative Consumer Products","abstractText":"<p>The development of new, innovative consumer products is a major driver of economic growth and increased economic welfare. The contribution of new products to economic welfare is a central question for understanding the growth of modern economies. We already have good reason to believe that new goods make a large contribution to economic welfare through the founding of whole new markets and industries, and through systematic improvements in product quality. Furthermore, recent results suggest that new goods may make another important contribution through increasing variety in mature branded consumer products industries. </p> \n<p>The two most important empirical objects which investigators seek to identify are consumers' willingness-to-pay for a product innovation and the competitive reactions (in terms of the effects on price setting behaviour) of the manufacturers of other products in the market. The quantification of these effects is complex and controversial (see for example Hausman (1997) and Bresnahan (1997), Nevo (2001), Petrin (2003) and Reiss and Wolak (2004)). The contribution of this research project will be to develop a robust nonparametric method of identification of the willingness-to-pay component in a way which is consistent with the fundamental theory of consumer behaviour in these types of markets.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1416","grantId":"RES-000-23-1416","fundValue":"69609","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Crawford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
