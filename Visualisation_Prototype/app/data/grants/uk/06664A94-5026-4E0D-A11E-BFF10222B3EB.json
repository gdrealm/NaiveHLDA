Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects thousands of babies born in the UK each year, many die and others are left with serious medical problems including brain damage. Each year in South East England alone 120 babies will die as a consequence of IUGR. We do not fully understand why certain otherwise normal babies in normal pregnancies stop growing properly. We know that the environment and the genetically inherited parts called ?genes? both have a role. Understanding the biology of growth in the womb will lead to diagnosis, treatment and maybe even one day, prevention of IUGR. There are a group of genes called ?imprinted genes? that play an important role in fetal growth and are only active when they are inherited from the mother or the father. Unlike most pairs of genes they are not active from both. We have shown that the imprinted gene, PHLDA2, a growth suppressor, which is active from the mother, is significantly higher in the placenta of small babies. This gene could be developed as a biomarker to use to diagnose IUGR during pregnancy. If this marker is found to be at high levels during the pregnancy of an IUGR baby it will allow the doctors to keep a closer eye on the baby that is at risk. Most importantly by understanding exactly how this gene works and affects the growth of the baby we should also be able to help very small babies to grow better in the womb.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801438","grantId":"G0801438","fundValue":"245455","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Gudrun  Moore","coPersons":["Philip  Stanier"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
