Many diseases and\nconditions can cause intractable pain, for instance rheumatoid arthritis or nerve damage caused by\ninjury or virus-infection, and these pains frequently have devastating consequences. While scientists\nhave yet to identify fool-proof treatment options, they have made some important advances in\nunderstanding what goes wrong in the body of a chronic pain sufferer. In particular, we now know that\nthe way our immune system responds to injury or infection can have an important impact on chronic\npain. What is less clear, is which cell types are involved exactly and what it is about their responses\nthat is so damaging to the surrounding neurons. Could the nature of this immune response predispose people towards developing chronic pain?\n\nIn this grant, we would like to investigate these questions further. We will use new experimental\nmethods to isolate immune cells and study their molecular responses. We will also study patients\nsuffering from acute pain to identify whether their immune response makes them more or less likely to\ndevelop persistent pain. Our experiments have the potential to identify risk factors for chronic pain as well as novel avenues for treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M501785/1","grantId":"MR/M501785/1","fundValue":"347204","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Brendan McMahon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
