Mendeley's readership includes Psychology, Computer and Information Science, Biological Sciences, Medicine, and Humanities. \n\nMy work has been cited in a broad range of academic peer-reviewed journals including brain imaging (e.g., Vecchiato et al., 2014), behavioural methods in psychology for visual (e.g. Naples et al., 2014) and auditory stimuli (e.g., Choi et al., 2014), Artificial Intelligence (e.g., Kotsakis et al., 2014, Kalliris et al., 2014), postgraduate theses in Engineering (e.g., Sandel, A 2014), undergraduate theses in Psychology (e.g., Sheppard, 2014) a book (communication skills for care workers - van Alphen, 2014) and featured in the BPS Readers Digest (July 2014). \n\nBased on the success of my work, I have developed a number of international and national collaborations to build dynamic models of facial expression signals in clinical groups such as Autism Spectrum Disorder with Prof. Ralph Adolphs - CalTech, USA, and Prof. Jim Tanaka - Victoria, Canada (both of whom are world leaders in emotion processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder groups), high suicide risk (with Prof. Rory O'Connor - UK), across different cultures (e.g., Japan - Dr. Michiko Koeda, China - Prof. Hongmei Tan, The Mind Museum - Philippines, Mozambique - Prof. Jose-Miguel Fernandez-Dols), other socially relevant face signals such as smile types (Prof. Paula Niedenthal - Wisconsin-Madison, USA), emotional intensity (Prof. Daniel Messinger - Miami, USA), circumplex model of emotions (Prof. Jim Russell - Boston, USA), and gamers (Prof. Daphne Bavelier - Rochester, USA/Geneva). \n\nTogether, these demonstrate the immediate impact my work has had on the academic community, by providing new opportunities to examine dynamic facial expression signals across a broad range of fields. \n\nMy work has also featured as a Case Study in Dimensional Imaging 4D\nhttp://www.di4d.com/case-glasgow-uni.html demonstrating how we combine computer graphics with subjective perception and psychophysics to gain a competitive edge in advancing knowledge of dynamic social signals.

Here, we aimed to understand how different cultures signal basic emotions. \n\nFirst, using a state-of-the-art Generative Face Grammar, I reconstructed 3-D dynamic models of the 6 basic facial expressions in two cultures, to reveal clear cultural specificity in both facial expression signals and the conceptual organisation of basic emotions. My data raised new questions: how are emotions conceptually organised by different emotions? How do cultures represent these emotions as facial expressions? \n\nTo address these questions, I used semantic network reconstruction tools to map the conceptual landscape of a broad spectrum of emotions in two distinct cultures, and identified culture-specific clustering of emotion categories. I then identified both culturally common and culture-specific facial expression signals by applying data reduction and classification techniques to a broad spectrum of facial expression models in each culture (30 in Western culture, 53 in Chinese). \n\nFinally, I examined the dynamical nature of facial expressions of emotion using information theory and Bayesian classifiers applied to models of the six basic facial expressions of emotion. Here, I showed that dynamic facial expressions transmit an evolving hierarchy of signals over time, where early, simpler face signals support the discrimination of four emotion categories - i.e., (i) happy, (ii), sad, (iii) fear/surprise, and (iv) disgust/anger - whereas later, more complex signals support discrimination of all six emotions. My data question the widely accepted notion that human emotion comprises six basic categories, instead suggesting four.\n\nMy results have broad implications for science and modern society. My data advances knowledge of emotion communication beyond the limited set of six Western specific static face images, thereby informing emotion communication to foster healthy societal relations, including clinical groups. My improved facial expression models provide practical benefits for Social Science research, Computer Science, Human-Robot Interaction, the commercial gaming industry, and the digital economy (e.g., development of avatars and companion robots). Together, my data makes a timely contribution to the rapidly evolving communication needs of society with great benefits for the economic performance of the UK.
