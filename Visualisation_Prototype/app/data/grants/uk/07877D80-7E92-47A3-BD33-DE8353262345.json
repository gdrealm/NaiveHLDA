For example, they need to learn that ingesting some items is appropriate while ingesting others is not. Of course, the environments that most animals face are complex and there needs to be a basis upon which important relationships are learnt about whereas less important or spurious relationships are not. Across a number of academic disciplines (Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, Psychology) it has been popular to suggest that such relationships are learnt by animals forming mental or neural associations between stimuli. There is a great deal of laboratory research showing that associations become stronger as a consequence of repeated pairings of one stimulus with another, that associations form most readily between intense stimuli, and that the stimuli need to be presented close together in time. These three laws of association (frequency, intensity and contiguity) provide a clear basis upon which relationships that are likely to be important are most readily learnt. However, recent evidence has suggested that there is another constraint that influences associative learning. Thus, when the influences of frequency, intensity and contiguity are held constant, associations are more likely to form between stimuli that are similar than between those that are dissimilar. This is an intriguing finding because it is not anticipated by influential theories of learning and memory. This project will examine why animals (humans, rats and pigeons) are more likely to learn a relationship between two similar stimuli than between two dissimilar stimuli. The research will allow us to gain a better understand of the fundamental process of association formation in different species.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F000553/1","grantId":"BB/F000553/1","fundValue":"360143","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our published findings have had an impact in the academic domain.

It has shaped our analysis of why certain conditions favour new learning. And it has shown that this analysis is conserved across different species (human, rat and pigeon). In the first instance the impact of the research is on the academic community. However, understanding the conditions under which learning best occurs, and the basis for why such conditions are important, should be of relevance to those involved in education.
