{"id":"F2EB16CC-C28C-4D41-9AC5-6642A6CB09A5","title":"The Future of our Food: Resilience, Security and Justice in a Global Context","abstractText":"<p>Globally agricultural and food systems are undergoing significant transformations as a result of globalisation, industrial development and changing lifestyles. These result in a variety of ecological, social, cultural, political and economic changes which affect the ability of food systems to grow food sustainably and distribute it fairly. These challenges have been discussed in a range of scholarly fields and have also been addressed by a range of policy frameworks, political institutions, civil society organisations, corporations and popular social movements. However, there is very little consensus on what sustainable agriculture entails and how to design just and resilient food systems. Three key bodies of academic literature, however, are converging around the idea that sustainability, justice and resilience are, first, interlinked and, second, that they all emerge from democratic food systems in which producers and consumers can exercise autonomy over the choices they make. Our series of workshops will bring together academics, policymakers and representatives of the private and third sectors, along with input from members of the general public, to advance understanding of what sustainable, resilient and just agri-food systems look like in the UK, Brazil and India, which together represent important exemplars of food-system challenges.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001594/1","grantId":"ES/L001594/1","fundValue":"30267","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Steffen  Boehm","coPersons":["Antonio Antonio Ioris","Tim  Lang","Terence K Marsden"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
