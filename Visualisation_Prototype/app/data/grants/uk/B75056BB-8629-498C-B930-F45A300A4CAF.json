Other compartments do different jobs and have their own set of proteins that perform these tasks. Proteins are transported to these compartments in tiny carriers that shuttle between the different compartments like trains on a track. For a particular protein to be sent to a specific compartment, the protein must contain a signal that acts like a ticket to direct that protein from one compartment to another. The ?ticket? is read by other proteins that act like ticket inspectors to make sure that the right proteins are sent to the correct destination. If the process goes wrong, either because the ?ticket? is damaged or incorrect, or because the ?ticket inspectors? can?t read the ?ticket? properly then proteins end up in the wrong place and that can cause diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease. We aim to study one of the pathways in the cells to identify all the various ?ticket inspectors? in that pathway and understand what ?tickets? are required in that pathway.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700750","grantId":"G0700750","fundValue":"328177","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew  Seaman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
