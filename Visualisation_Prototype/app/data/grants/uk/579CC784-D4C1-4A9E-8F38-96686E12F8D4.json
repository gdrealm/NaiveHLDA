Despite the massive expansion of technologies and biotherapeutic drugs over he last 20+ years, little of this enormous effort, either at the drug target or drug product level, or at the level of developing novel expression technologies for difficult to express proteins, has focussed upon application of such approaches and technologies to developing new drugs, detection and diagnostic tools, or expression systems for biotherapeutics in the area of neglected tropical diseases. One such example is the in the area of human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness). This disease threatens millions of people in the sub-Saharan area of Africa. The development of new, more reliable and economic diagnostic biomarkers and assays is essential, particularly for distinguishing between early and late stages of the disease to inform the drug regimen used if this disease is to be reduced further in the sub-Saharan. As such, some recent developments in this area have focussed upon identification and validation of new diagnostic markers of HAT to complement or improve upon the current Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), whilst others continue to investigate the possibility of developing a vaccination to this disease. Hence, for both the development of new diagnostics and for potential new vaccines, the availability of appropriate expression systems for the generation of recombinant protein molecules is required. \n\nHe we have used existing expression systems and applied them to new areas of need/challenges with a view to create a new platform technology which could be used for tropical zoonotic diseases.\n\nSo far through the project we have\n1. Established a collaboration between the University of Kent and the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).\n2. Established the LEXSY expression system in the laboratory at Kent for the generation of novel antigens to use in new diagnostics for HAT. \n3. Generated appropriate constructs for HAT antigens, and constructs for a model IgA for expression in the LEXSY expression system (Leishmania).\n4. Undertake preliminary expression of the model antigen proteins by transforming Leishmania cells by electroporation and purifying the expressed proteins by His tag chromatography (for the tagged HAT antigens).\n5. Begun to characterise the glycosylation of model proteins produced in LEXSY cells.\n6. Begun to assess the antigenic properties of these targets in collaboration with the Tropical Institute of Medicine in Belgium.\n8. Start to investigate the development of an ELSIA based diagnostic for HAT.\n\nThe overall objective is for the development of new HAT diagnostics in the field. We are currently still undertaking the project and ahead of the objectives to be achieved at this stage of the project. These findings will be able to be developed by others in the field looking to develop new rapid, pint of care and low cost diagnostics for tropical diseases, specifically for HAT.
