{"id":"449857F6-83B8-4318-A22C-0D362AA85566","title":"Pictures of Peace and Justice: Documentation, Evidence and Impact of Visual Material in International War Crimes Prosecution","abstractText":"Pictures of Peace and Justice: Evidence and Impact of Visual Material in Internationalised War Crimes Prosecutions\\n\\nThis project builds on three previous projects: an AHRC funded project on War Crimes, a US Institute for Peace funded project on the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and an ESRC project on media and security, which produced research findings on moving images in relation to war crimes and transitional justice. The project is a pilot study to investigate the importance of visual material vis a vis other types of material at three stages of the process of establishing internationalised judicial processes (i.e. international courts and domestic processes with both significant international input and context). The first of these is the context in which these judicial bodies are created. The second is the conduct of trials. The third is the impact beyond the courtroom on issues of peace and security. The project will (i) identify, document, critically appraise and create data sets of examples of visual evidence at each of the three stages identified; (ii) conduct semi-structured interviews with judicial, policy, media and military-security practitioners to investigate knowledge, understanding and judgement on the relative importance of visual material at each of the three stages; (iii) carry out focus group research to investigate beliefs, values and attitudes regarding particular examples of visual evidence, in light of stages (i) and (ii), including generating processes and cases, use as evidence in trials, and impact on post-conflict societies and communities. The pilot project will test the feasibility and potential significance of research in this area for a subsequent larger research funding proposal. Asa pilot project, the scope will be limited to investigation of these issues primarily in relation to the mid-twentieth century cases of Germany and Japan, where established research and resources will be exploited, and the late-twentieth and twenty-first century cases of the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, where the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator have extensive research experience.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H015566/1","grantId":"AH/H015566/1","fundValue":"121160","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew JAMES Gow","coPersons":["Rachel Clare Kerr"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" The research investigated investigated the importance of visual material in relation to war crimes prosecutions. It did so with regard to three broad phases - prior to prosecutions, at trials and beyond the courtroom. We found that visual material was important at each of these stages, but that it was particularly important in the last of these phases, reaching out beyond the courtroom to connect with wider publics and shaping public appreciation and memory of war crimes. This could make some difference in terms of peace and security, where our research confirmed that, otherwise, internationalised judicial intervention has been found wanting by victims and communities it was believed war crimes prosecutions would help. The focused use of visual material, where relevant, in outreach work might well enable international judicial bodies to be more effective in their mission to restore and maintain peace and justice. This research used four main methods. (1) Identification, documentation, critical appraisal and recording of examples of visual material in relation to war crimes in three discrete phases: generating processes and cases; use as evidence in trials; and impact on post-conflict societies and communities. This included survey of secondary sources; survey of accessible visual resources, including You Tube, Sense Agency, the ICTY and other international judicial bodies, material in the Liddell Hart archive and personal collections at King's College London, the Robert H. Jackson Center, the Imperial War Museum, London, commercially available material, and private collections. (2) Semi-structured interviews with judicial, policy, media and military-security practitioners to investigate knowledge, understanding and judgement on the relative importance of visual material at each of the three stages. (3) Critical appraisal of content and visually-related discourse in relation to examples of visual material salient at the three stages identified, or where the absence of visual evidence has been significant or visual evidence has been qualified by other forms of evidence. (4) The core of our research comprised 21 focus group research sessions we conducted to investigate beliefs, values and attitudes and publics in the former Yugoslavia and London regarding images and war crimes, as well as particular examples of visual evidence identified in the research regarding the different phases under investigation. Our research has been important outside academia in three ways. First, we have confirmed the great importance of visual material in trials, both as evidence and as a way of shaping the courtroom and the conduct of proceedings. This is of benefit to those engaged in the courtroom and reflexively our work has raised awareness of this among prosecution and defence counsels in the course of our research. Secondly, in the course of our research and research workshop in Belgrade, we brought the issue of visual material and war crimes to the attention of the Legal Consultant to the OSCE Mission to Serbia, who became interested in this area and invited the project to submit questions to a major public opinion survey the Mission was commissioning on the issue of war crimes. These questions were discussed and included in the survey, the results of which are about to be known at the time of completing this report. Thus, our research added a new dimension to the OSCE's own research agenda and helped shaped its research, in practice. We anticipate discussing results with the Mission and contributing to the OSCE's own critical evaluation of findings. Finally, our finding regarding the impact of visual material beyond the courtroom and its potential for connection the work of tribunals with relevant communities has been discussed with the Head of Outreach at the ICTY, who has engaged with us in the course of the research, and with whom we have discussed the possibility follow-on research, in which we will work collaboratively to investigate the ways in which the potential for visual material to make a difference beyond the courtroom can be harnessed in conjunction with other activities and modes of communication.
