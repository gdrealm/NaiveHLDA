The present proposal presents strategies to assemble complex molecular architectures or value-added compounds using simply synthesized organometallic complexes. The proposal adopts a two-prong approach. On the one side the design and synthesis of organometallic catalysts are proposed and on the other, some of the catalysts already synthesized by our group and the novel ones proposed will be tested in important greener chemical transformations. The catalytic activity of these well-defined complexes range from C-H bond functionalisation using CO2 to fluorine sources. The aims of the proposal are to develop and understand useful synthetic tools and methods, readily transferable to synthetic chemists, permitting facile protocols enabling the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies using plentiful under-utilised resources such as CO2 and C-H bonds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J011053/1","grantId":"EP/J011053/1","fundValue":"671286","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Steven Patrick Nolan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
