According to this paradigm, a clear distinction between mechanisms that operate on 'orbital' and on 'millennial' timescales is no longer made. The slow orbital (insolation) pacing of the ice-ages would thus engender strong positive feedbacks, which could themselves emerge on much shorter timescales. Glacial-interglacial fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 are emblematic of this notion; they clearly make an important contribution to glacial-interglacial radiative forcing, but they appear to accrue through rapid changes that are somehow linked with asymmetric inter-hemispheric climate anomalies (the 'bipolar seessaw'). However, not all rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. This raises the important question of what has controlled millennial CO2 changes in the past, and what (if anything) is special about deglacial versus mid-glacial CO2 pulses. Current data does not allow us to address these questions adequately. What is needed is a new set of high-resolution reconstructions of Southern Ocean up-welling and deep-water ventilation, which can be linked to the ice-core chronology and thus compared with similarly detailed records of abrupt North Atlantic climate variability. This project sets out to provide these reconstructions, and on thus place our understanding of past millennial CO2 variability on a more robust observational footing than has hitherto been possible.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J010545/1","grantId":"NE/J010545/1","fundValue":"250591","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  I am not aware that our findings have been used for any economically aspirational purpose.

However, so far we have been able to shed light on the role of the Southern Ocean as a key locus for changes in climate and carbon cycling. We have found that changes in the ventilation of the deep ocean, specifically via the Southern high latitudes, have played a key role in driving changes in atmospheric CO2 during the last deglaciation, as previously proposed for the last deglaciation. We have been able to demonstrate the active role in these carbon cycle perturbations of distal changes originating in the North Atlantic, which have been transmitted extremely rapidly to the Southern Hemisphere via both oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections.
