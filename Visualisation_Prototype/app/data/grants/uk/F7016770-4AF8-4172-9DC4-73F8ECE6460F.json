This applies to both current production methodologies such as rolling, forging etc and emerging disruptive technologies such as shaped metal deposition. Over the last ten years IMMPETUS (Institute for Microstructural and Mechanical Process Engineering: The University of Sheffield) has developed its unique systems driven approach for process and property optimisation for the latest metals process routes with significant success on the national/international stages. The ideal for predicting microstructure and properties is to use multi-scale modelling driven by well defined physically based equations. However, even where the process is well established and thought to be well understood, the reality is that there are inevitable uncertainties within such multi-scale models, and consequently most are not truly physically-based. Rather they rely on empirical parameters that allow the models to fit the data. Moreover, where the process is immature, as is the case with the projects we intend to investigate, the basic physics cannot be described accurately until the mechanisms are fully established experimentally, which can prove time-consuming. In order to cover the intractable factors not adequately and entirely described by physically based models, and to fast track the development of emerging non-traditional metal manufacturing technologies, we use hybrid models that merge (fuse) discrete data with knowledge-based and physically-based models to account for the uncertainties in the material processing route. This is a powerful approach for accurate and transparent process behaviour prediction even when data is sparse, knowledge is imprecise, but updated more often than not. All the modelling is informed and verified through the use of an impressive but parsimonious array of experimental techniques. We believe it is timely to apply such a strategy to new exciting technologies where the research is inevitably high risk, high adventure and certainly high impact. Specifically, we intend establish a novel approach to the modelling of friction stir and linear friction welding of steels and titanium alloys using a combination of our unique arbitrary strain path and thermomechanical compression machines and access to fully instrumented friction welding machines. In addition, we will bring our skills to bear on innovative metals processing with direct access to state-of-the-art equipment for e.g. shaped metal deposition. Pervasive to all of these processes is that the final microstructure is formed through transformation under dynamic conditions, with the presence of steep thermal gradients, intentional/unintentional stresses and plastic strain rates for which the current phase transformation models do not adequately predict microstructure. For all these areas, it is essential to retain highly skilled staff who have a proven track record in interdisciplinary integrated research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E063497/1","grantId":"EP/E063497/1","fundValue":"871509","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is increasingly popular but remains a challenge for Ti alloys and steels. The complex material flow and thermal history makes it difficult to fully understand, predict and design. In our work, novel intelligent modelling and advanced data-driven correlation analysis have been applied to improve the efficiency and reliability of FSW. For the first time, a systems-modelling framework (based on Granular Computing) has been developed to predict and optimise the process' operating window, replacing expensive experimental trials and allowing a fundamental understanding of the process/properties relationship. A fully-coupled thermomechanical finite element model of FSW has been created using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation of Abaqus to predict temperature, strain, strain rate and stress distributions. Model formulation and validation has been greatly aided by a novel fully instrumented sensory platform (ARTEMIS), which gives real-time in-process variables, allowing us to introduce on-line control for optimised welds, critical for success in steel and Ti alloys. FSW of Ti alloys is one of the greatest challenges as a result of low thermal conductivity and high reactivity. Understanding the FSW process is complicated by phase transformations on cooling that eradicates the high temperature structure. We have developed a unique approach through reconstructing the high temperature crystallographic texture from the room temperature structure. This has shown for the first time that most of the weld is formed in the beta phase, with a simple shear texture, giving a final texture related to the fixed axis of the work piece and not the local shear reference frame, i.e. the thermal stresses appear to dictate the crystallographic variant selection. In addition to our unique approach to quantifying high temperature deformation structure, we have used this to bring new insight into the thermomechanical processing of Ti alloys, specifically to produce gas turbine alloys free from macro zones that are known to origin of dwell fatigue crack initiation. Based on this work TIMET are introducing new production schedules with tangible benefits in reducing susceptibility to dwell fatigue. In addition, a validated physically-based model of microstructure and texture evolution during thermo-mechanical processes has been developed which includes microstructure deformation using a Crystal-Plasticity Finite Element model coupled with a Phase-Field model (which has proved far more powerful than the cellular automata model which we initially worked on). Our high-value manufacturing sectors (e.g. gas turbine engines) depend on traditional metal-forming technologies of forging and casting. Near Net-Shape (NNS) manufacturing technologies are disruptively displacing traditional technologies with greatly reduced resource consumption. The PG has allowed a major expansion of our Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) facility to address the needs of industry, hand in hand with fundamental research. A combination of thermodynamic modelling and expert experimental design has informed a programme which has taken the process from novelty to one which can produce complex shapes with mechanical properties that at least match those of the conventional route. We have not only made the process commercially viable for Ti-6Al-4V aerospace alloys, but also for a wide range of applications including heat shields for formula 1 and hip prostheses. A key challenge with ALM is that it currently uses alloys designed for the conventional wrought route which are unlikely to be optimum for ALM-the future will require alloys designed specifically for these resource efficient process routes. We are employing our integrated modelling methodologies to develop new alloys for ALM, including Ti alloys and Ti aluminides. Our novel alloy design approach is also being applied to new generation materials including metallic glasses and high entropy alloys.

The ARTEMIS system, developed by TWI, has been the subject of research for a number of years, however we demonstrated, for the first time, a framework for on-line and real-time process monitoring and control, that makes use of the complex experimental data measured by the ARTEMIS unit. The new real-time processing framework provides gearing for the link between weld quality and tool performance, with the latter being the current bottleneck in using FSW in critical steel and titanium applications.
