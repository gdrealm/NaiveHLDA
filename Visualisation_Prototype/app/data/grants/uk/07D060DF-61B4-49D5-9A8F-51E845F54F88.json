They make specific responses against these agents in the form of antibodies and 'killer' T lymphocytes and also develop immune 'memory' which allows us to respond more quickly and vigorously if the same agents are encountered again. The populations of lymphocytes that we possess develop through several stages in specific anatomical locations, namely the thymus (for T cells) and the bone marrow (for B cells) before emerging into the blood and lymph tissues (e.g. spleen, lymph nodes). The size and distribution of these lymphocyte populations is tightly regulated, enabling the immune system to function with high efficiency. During an immune response, lymphocytes bearing receptors specific to the invading agent divide and expand in number and become activated to fight the threat. Afterwards, these expanded populations must contract back to roughly their starting level as well as creating small numbers of memory cells. These dynamic processes are subject to complex mechanisms to ensure the accurate generation and maintenance of the repertoire of mature lymphocytes. There is currently strong interest in these mechanisms as they are very relevant to prominent health-related issues such as the effectiveness of vaccinations, the control of chronic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and the frailty of immune responses often observed in the elderly. \nThis research will address the role played in lymphocyte development and maintenance by a family of proteins called GIMAPs which are one group within a large class of enzymes called guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). GIMAPs are needed for lymphocytes to develop normally in mammals but the reasons for this are unknown. Some previous work suggested that they might regulate other proteins that are involved in the process of 'programmed cell death', a form of cell 'suicide' that allows unwanted cells to be removed from multicellular organisms. New evidence, however, suggests that GIMAPs may be needed for a different process, a special cellular mechanism called autophagy. Autophagy is a process by which a cell can break down its own constituent parts. This is used for the removal of defective proteins/organelles but can also be beneficial in circumstances such as starvation when a cell can extend its life by digesting non-essential components. Autophagy can also be important for the proper control of the number of mitochondria (the 'batteries' of the cell) inside some cells including lymphocytes and if this goes wrong the cells may die from oxidant stress. The experiments planned aim to uncover new evidence favouring either the 'programmed cell death' or the 'autophagy' explanation for GIMAP function: it could actually find that both are affected by the GIMAPs since new connections between the two processes are emerging in other areas of study.\nAutophagy is a mechanism of strong current interest because of the potential benefits of stimulating autophagy for health across the lifespan. It is also emerging that autophagy contributes to immunity e.g. in defence against intracellular parasites (tuberculosis organisms; protozoa) and to processes during development. A lot has been learnt from detailed studies in yeast but the complexity of the system in mammals is much greater and many new discoveries can be expected in this area. The GIMAPs may be regulators of autophagy attuned to the special requirements of lymphocytes. Further knowledge of their mechanism/s of action will not only advance our understanding of how lymphocyte populations are generated and controlled but may also point to novel and specific ways of regulating lymphocyte survival and function useful in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, in enhancing immunity and in controlling transplant rejection mechanisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J001856/1","grantId":"MR/J001856/1","fundValue":"539129","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Butcher","coPersons":["Martin  Turner"],"organisation":"Babraham Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
