Antibiotics that disrupt bacterial cell wall construction, such as vancomycin, are clinically important in the treatment of infectious diseases. However, bacteria can adapt by developing resistance to these antibiotics making them ineffective for treating infections. \n\nDespite some recent progress, relatively little is understood about exactly how bacteria sense an attack on their cell wall by an antibiotic, and how this can then be turned into responses that allow them to survive. We are using a harmless group of bacteria that live in the soil, streptomycetes, as a model system to investigate how this is achieved. Streptomycetes make the majority of antibiotics that we use to treat infectious diseases, and so are the ultimate source of most antibiotic resistance systems. This is because they have to be able to avoid the harmful effects of the antibiotics that they produce. \n\nIf we can understand better how these resistance systems work, it may eventually be possible to develop new drugs which are still active but which do not trigger the bacterial resistance mechanisms, consequently outsmarting antibiotic resistance in clinical infections.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700141","grantId":"G0700141","fundValue":"300507","fundStart":"2008-01-17","fundEnd":"2011-01-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Hee-Jeon  Hong","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
