{"id":"CE458F87-666F-477F-A951-F71CAD95B9F0","title":"Novel thermostable enzymes for industrial biotechnology (THERMOGENE)","abstractText":"There is an increasing demand for new thermostable enzymes with enhanced performance and/or novel functionalities that could provide savings in time, money and energy for industrial processes in the areas of high value chemical production and many other &quot;white&quot; biotechnology applications.\nEnzyme chemistry can make reactions feasible that are currently unavailable using conventional chemical methods. Use of enzymes for chemical processes is a route to lower energy consumption and reduced waste generation. In addition the selectivity of enzymatic processes reduces raw material costs and the safety issues surrounding the production of wasteful bi-products. Optimised enzyme production will lead to economically viable and cost effective, sustainable production.\nTHERMOGENE will focus on the discovery of selected transferase enzymes with known and potential commercial applications. These include enzymes able to transfer 2-carbon units, transketolases; able to transfer amine groups, transaminases; able to transfer isoprenyl or prenyl groups, prenyltransferases and able to transfer methyl and hydroxymethyl groups, methyl and hydroxymethyl transferases. \nThe use of enzymes in green chemistry and biotechnology is increasingly important. This is partially driven by the pharmaceutical sector in the development of new therapeutic agents that are required to be optically pure compounds. The number of new drug intermediates produced by enzymes is expected to rise significantly in the next few years.\nOne disadvantage of using enzymes is that proteins are often not stable during the reaction conditions required for the industrial process. This is still a major bottleneck in the commercial use of enzyme catalysts.\nThis proposal will concentrate on discovery of novel enzymes from marine and terrestrial environments. This will use newly sequenced genomes of thermophilic bacteria and archaea and metagenomes isolated from thermophilic environments. The latter will allow us to sample the DNA from organisms not able to be cultured in the laboratory and also the genetic material from viruses. The enzymes isolated from organisms able to grow at high temperatures will have higher stability in water based and solvent based conditions which are required for the industrial processes. It will also seek to discover enzymes with new and novel activities which are often found in these organisms that have evolved to have different fats in their cell membrane and different pathways in their metabolism.\nAt the end of the project we will identify many new biological catalysts that can be used to replace and work together with traditional chemical processes. This will lead to a greener and more sustainable environment for future generations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L002035/1","grantId":"BB/L002035/1","fundValue":"235215","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Discovery of new stable thermophilic transfer enzymes have interest to applications in biocatalysis.

This project is developing stable new transfer enzymes, which can add different chemical functionalities to molecules, that have currently not been studied in detail for their biocatalytic applications. It aims to make them available to others so that new processes can be developed for industry to carry out chemical synthesis in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.
