What is actually seen in the LHC detectors is often called &quot;mundane physics&quot; and it is only indirectly related to the kind of physics we hope to explore. As it turns out, the relationship between the particles of interest and the ones that are observed cannot be measured directly but needs to be modeled theoretically. Such a complicated relationship between the objects of interest and the measured ones is an unavoidable consequence of the complex nature of particle interactions at very high energies, like the ones achieved at the LHC.\n\nThe theoretical modeling of particle interactions is complicated in a number of ways. There is the pure computational dimension: due to the complexity of the required calculations new and dedicated computational approaches often need to be developed; then there is the dimension related to the imperfect precision of the calculations; finally, there is a usability dimension which simply means that one has to adapt the theoretically computed results to the specifics of the LHC detectors. \n\nThe goals of the research performed in the Center for Precision LHC Studies is to: first, increase the precision of the theoretical descriptions by one whole level; second, implement it into computer software which is simple to use and can be utilized by many other researches and, third, study problems related to LHC measurements that could not be explained without the existence of these computational tools. Ultimately, we hope that our research will significantly increase the discovery potential of the LHC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L002760/1","grantId":"ST/L002760/1","fundValue":"328330","fundStart":"2014-03-26","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander  Mitov","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
