For women with preeclampsia currently available therapies improve the outcome of the illness, but the final cure only comes with delivery of the baby. Prompt delivery, preferably by the vaginal route rather than by caesarean section, is therefore vital to achieve good maternal and neonatal outcomes. There are various methods available to start the woman?s labour, and it is crucial that the method used is both effective and safe for mother and baby. This is especially important in low resource settings where the underlying illness is often severe and there are few facilities for monitoring the mother and baby. The World Health Organisation currently recommends two low cost options ? oral misoprostol (OM) tablets and transcervical Foley catheterisation (TFC). Whilst in the former method a tablet is swallowed every two hours, in the latter a thin rubber (?Foley?) catheter is threaded through the neck of the womb and held in place with a small inflated balloon at its tip. Although OM has been widely studied, it is infrequently used in India. Furthermore, there is comparatively little research on the TFC and the two methods have never been directly compared despite their great promise. Current evidence suggests that OM may be faster but sometimes ?overcontract? the uterus, whilst TFC may be slower but safer.\n\nWe propose a study to be conducted in two large government hospitals in Nagpur, India. 800 women with preeclampsia will be randomly allocated to use OM (25mcg tablets 2hrly) or TFC (size 18F with a 50ml balloon for 12 hours) for their induction. The main outcome is the attainment of vaginal delivery within 24 hours, and a variety of other measures of maternal and neonatal morbidity including cost effectiveness will also be collected. Currently 15% of mothers with preeclampsia suffer stillbirths in this setting ? this trial will also examine whether the use of the balloon catheter can reduce this.\n\nRecruitment rates in a recent study of preeclamptic women using the same team and site demonstrate that 800 women can be recruited in 2 years. The study will be managed on a daily basis by the successful team of Dr Mundle in GMC Nagpur and Gynuity Health Projects, one of the most successful low-resource setting clinical trial specialists in the world.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100686","grantId":"G1100686","fundValue":"583569","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Weeks","coPersons":["Eric Brian Faragher","Shuchita  Mundle","Alan  Haycox","Hillary  Bracken","Zarko  Alfirevic","Beverly  Winikoff"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
