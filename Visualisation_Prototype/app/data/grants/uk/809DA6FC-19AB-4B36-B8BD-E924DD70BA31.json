{"id":"809DA6FC-19AB-4B36-B8BD-E924DD70BA31","title":"Locating the Hidden Diaspora: The English in North America in Transatlantic Perspective, 1760-1950","abstractText":"The English were the largest group of emigrants in the British World and one of the largest European groups in the US. Yet while they settled alongside the Scots, Irish and other migrant groups who powerfully exerted ethnic awareness, the English are not ascribed the attributes of ethnicity associated with other immigrant groups. The idea that the English may have been 'ethnic' in the way the Irish or Scots were, is overlooked, ignored or imagined to be false. In short, there is little acknowledgement of an 'English diaspora'. This research, therefore, will uncover the hidden English Diaspora in North America between 1760 and 1950, when expatriate culture was strong and vibrant and the written record is rich. \\n\\nDrawing upon hitherto un-used historical archives, and by employing a transnational perspective that connects the US, Canada and England, the project will explore English immigrant community life, particularly English associational culture, and the wider political and cultural impact of English identity in North America. A select number of case study locations in Canada and the US have been chosen for this comparative exercise, namely New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Toronto and Ottawa. This new comparative focus is particularly crucial to advance knowledge on how English ethnicity and culture interacted with and between republican and imperial contexts.\\n\\nThe proposed project's overall aim is to offer an original reading of English ethnicity in North America within a transnational perspective. The objectives are to analyse the emergence, development and anatomy of English associationalism; to investigate English literary, folk and political cultures; and to explore how the formation of ethnic identities in North America contributed to a shared transatlantic identity, and influenced concomitant developments in England. The latter component of the proposed project, together with the PhD student's UK-centred research into the post-1900 period, will also throw light on current debates in UK identity politics and Englishness. At a deeper level, our questioning of the neglect of the English permits consideration of what might be learned from studying ethnic communities generally, and how ethnic groups, through the expression of their identity and culture, contributed to the making of their respective new worlds.\\n\\nA wide group of academics and non-academics will benefit from the research, which offers a knowledge-shaping new approach to the transnational study of English immigrant community life and ethnicity. The core monograph and articles will make a major and original contribution to knowledge. The edited collection on ethnic culture and politics will present a wide-ranging series of multidisciplinary accounts which we hope will tap audiences beyond the historical community. The conference will bring together presenters from a wider geographical range than our project covers. The mapping of English associational life and activities is of great significance, offering new insights into the English immigrant community to those working in migration and diaspora history, but also social, cultural and economic history, opening new avenues for wider comparative research. The data mined will also be of great interest to genealogists, expatriate communities and folk groups as it relates to their immediate life experience. In view of the study's second strand, politics and identities, the findings will benefit policymakers, informing contemporary debates on Englishness in the UK. Several public events will extend considerably beyond the academy. The material gathered throughout the project, some of which will be showcased online, and the various published outputs, will become standards for courses/modules on English migration, American immigration, ethnicity in North America, and English ethnic culture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I001042/2","grantId":"AH/I001042/2","fundValue":"111529","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They have been by associations, such as the Royal St George's Societies, universities overseas, and in conferences, radio, and public events.

This has implications for our understanding of English identity in the world, but also the definitions of ethnicity that we use and our tendency to define all ethnics agains, rather than with, the English.\n\nThe findings clearly complicate simple and linear notions of identity and social integration. Primarily, they may be used by museums, authors of curricula, teachers, and others, to offer a different view of America and Canada's immigrants histories. \n\nThey may also be used by museums to add crucial sub-narratives to exhibitions on immigration which otherwise exclude the English. \n\nIt may be possible to develop TV and radio programmes. Also, popular written histories will need to take account of our work. Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
