{"id":"A7F04EC6-D93F-4676-BB29-7CD385E5B2D9","title":"Design and Analysis of Trials of Group Treatments","abstractText":"Health service providers are under pressure to increase the availability of non-drug treatments for mental health and musclo-skeletal problems. Sometimes these treatments are delivered to patients in groups. Examples of such treatments include exercise classes for the treatment of back or joint pain, group therapies for mental health problems, and self-help groups for smoking cessation or alcohol problems. \n\nIt is important for patients and policy makers that the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this type of treatment are properly tested in well-designed randomised controlled trials, but there are reports of serious weakness in the design and statistical analysis of trials of this type of treatment. \n\nWhere a patient receives treatment in a group, the result of treatment may be more similar to a patient in the same group than to patients from other groups. This is because the group treatment may involve interaction between patients with some groups working well and some not. This variability in outcome between therapy groups is an example of clustering. To compensate for clustering, clinical trials of group treatments need to have larger numbers of groups. Unless special methods of statistical analysis are used to take account of clustering, the results of the trial may not be valid.\n\nTrials of group treatments, such as these, are often compared with a treatment delivered to the patient individually. For example self-help groups for smoking cessation might be compared to an individualised counselling or use of nicotine patches. This creates special problems for statistical analysis, as standard methods assume clustering in both the treatment group and the control group. Another complications, is how should those patients who do not attend their therapy group be included in the statistical analysis of the trial. \n\nThe proposal will use computer simulation to test the performance of methods of statistical analysis. This involves repeatedly simulating the data, and then testing how well different methods of analysis work on the simulated data. Statistical methods will also be tested on real dataset from trials of group treatments.\n\nWhen planning a trial of group treatments, information on the clustering effect is needed to calculate sample size. As part of this work we will carry out literature searches to find estimates of the clustering effect and dataset from which we can extract this information by reanalysing the data. These estimates will be made publicly available as a resource for researchers and trialists.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800606","grantId":"G0800606","fundValue":"278387","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Roberts","coPersons":["Steve  Roberts","Graham  Dunn"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
