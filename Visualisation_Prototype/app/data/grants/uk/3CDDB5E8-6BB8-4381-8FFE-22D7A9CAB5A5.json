We have shown that a common skin infection, Staphylococcus aureus, can dramatically alter how the body reacts to harmless environmental proteins or allergens. Therefore individuals are more likely to react to an allergen, such as house dust mite, if they encounter it at the same time as staphylococcal infection. Our findings potentially provide a new mechanism for atopic dermatitis and also for atopic and other allergic diseases, including asthma, hayfever and peanut allergy. We will investigate whether by combining anti-bacterial treatment with allergen desensitisation it is possible to improve symptoms in adult individuals with severe atopic dermatitis. We will also take blood samples from study subjects to examine changes in the immune response during treatment. This will give us important insights into how the disease occurs and how we can improve on our results in future clinical trials.\nWe will present our findings at scientific meetings and through publications, but will also liaise with the public and press whenever appropriate. Dr Graham Ogg has been involved in the presentation of science to the public, for example at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition and through the national Public Understanding of Science events and promotes the importance of public engagement in science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701693","grantId":"G0701693","fundValue":"309187","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Ogg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
