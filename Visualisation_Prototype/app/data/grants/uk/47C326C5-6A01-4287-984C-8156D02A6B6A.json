A chemical (neurotransmitter) is released from a neuron and travels across the synapse to activate receptors in the adjacent neuron. Synapses can change their strength (known as 'synaptic plasticity') by altering the number of receptors found on the surface of the neuron in the synapse. This process is thought to underlie learning and memory, because the memory is likely to be stored in a circuit of interconnected neurons. An important mechanism for moving receptors around neurons involves a protein called actin, which forms filaments that shrink and grow to physically manoeuvre parts of the cell or its constituents. We have found that a protein (called PICK1) is involved in controlling the formation of these actin filaments, and in this way controls the movement of neurotransmitter receptors to or from the synapse. Individual neurons are constituents of neuronal circuits that control complex behaviour or memory systems, and these neurons receive various inputs that trigger biochemical reactions inside them. These biochemical reactions can influence countless different processes in cells, and we propose that PICK1's regulation of actin could be controlled in this way. Therefore, in the proposed research, we aim to investigate how PICK1 is 'switched on' or 'switched off' with respect to its control of actin filaments. We are going to investigate three types of biochemical reaction in this work, all of which are specific varieties of well-known cellular mechanisms. We will initially carry out experiments on protein molecules in test-tubes to study the biochemical processes, and then do experiments in living neurons cultured in vitro to investigate how manipulating these biochemical reactions affects synaptic plasticity. We will use two approaches to study synaptic plasticity in neurons. First, we will visualise the movement of neurotransmitter receptors using microscopy, and second, we will analyse the activity of neurons by recording their electrical activity. This work is important because it will lead to a wealth of new information about synaptic plasticity, and hence learning and memory mechanisms. The movement of neurotransmitter receptors to and from the synapse is thought to underlie the altered neuronal activity in several brain diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's, and also in drug addiction. Therefore, the mechanisms that we will study in this research will add to our knowledge about these debilitating diseases, and may contribute to developing therapies. In addition, the control of actin is absolutely essential to numerous processes in all of the cells in our bodies, not just neurons. Therefore, this work will provide important information that will enhance the study of many other cellular processes and disease mechanisms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H014284/1","grantId":"BB/H014284/1","fundValue":"498863","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The impact on academic research beyond my own lab, or on research in the pharmaceutical industry has not yet been realised.\nThe new knowledge now forms part of our undergraduate teaching material, so it is contributing to education.

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity at excitatory synapses involves alterations in AMPAR number at the synaptic plasma membrane in processes involving the regulated trafficking of AMPAR-containing vesicles. A decrease in synaptic strength involves the internalisation of AMPARs from synaptic sites in a process known as Long Term Depression (LTD), whereas an increase in synaptic strength involves an increase in the number of synaptic AMPARs, in the process of Long Term Potentiation (LTP). Related trafficking events can alter AMPAR subunit composition at the postsynaptic membrane to determine calcium permeability, which is a critical aspect of a number of neurological disease states. \nWe previously showed that the AMPAR-associated protein PICK1 regulates actin polymerisation via inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex to drive a reduction in surface-expressed GluA2 subunit-containing AMPARs. \n\nIn the current work, we have defined a signalling pathway involving the small GTPase Arf1 and the Arf GAP GIT1, which modulates the inhibition of Arp2/3 activity by PICK1, and in so doing, controls GluA2 trafficking. Our results show that Arf1 is required for LTD. We also found that Arf1 regulates not only AMPAR trafficking, but also dendritic spine size, which is another important aspect of synaptic plasticity. An important question that now arises from this work is how GIT1 is regulated by synaptic activity to trigger the signalling pathway.\n\nWe also investigated the role of Ca2+ ions in regulating the PICK1-Arp2/3 interaction (because PICK1 is a Ca2+ binding protein). We found that there was no direct effect of [Ca2+] on PICK1-Arp2/3 interactions. This was presented as a single panel in a paper published in EMBO Journal (Nakamura et al., 2011). Since this paper was published before the grant started, I have not included it in the outputs for this grant.\n\nIn addition, we investigated the role of PICK1 phosphorylation in regulating its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. While we do have some data on this part of the work, it was left &quot;on the back burner&quot; while we finished off the Arf1 paper. We were unable to bring this part of the work to a publishable conclusion in the time available. We have defined mechanisms of GluA2-dependent AMPAR trafficking. A number of disease states (ischaemia, TBI, ALS, etc) as well as synaptic plasticity associated with drug addiction involve subunit-specific AMPAR trafficking. Hence researchers working on these conditions, including those in the pharmaceutical industry, would find our results interesting and useful.\nIn addition, our work defines a novel mechanism for regulating actin polymerisation (via Arf1 and PICK1). Researchers working on the regulation of actin polymerisation in a range of different cell types or systems will therefore benefit from our findings.
