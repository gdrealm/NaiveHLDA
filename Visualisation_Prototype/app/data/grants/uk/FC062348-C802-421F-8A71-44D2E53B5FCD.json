Specifically, the PMT will be responsible for:\n- Monitoring research progress\n- Budget monitoring \n- Facilitating communication, collaboration and integration among the consortia\n- Facilitating data management for the Programme\n- Planning impact and knowledge exchange activities\n- Logistics support\nKey Programme management activities are described below.\n\nPROGRAMME COORDINATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT: To assist the PMT in fulfilling their responsibilities, the PMT will appoint a Programme Coordinator to help them in research and budget monitoring, report writing, and managing communication across the Programme (e.g. organising annual meetings, website development and maintenance, etc.). The HMTF Programme will also appoint a Programme Data Manager who will: (1) Assist in development of data nomenclature, archiving and metadata protocols; (2) Ensure well documented data collection and data encoding; (3) Support importing of new data into the existing databases; (4) Facilitate compatibility of data between the various databases, including suggesting modifications of existing databases and nomenclature; (5) Ensure and develop comprehensive metadata and data set descriptions through frequent liaison with all investigators; (6) Report to the PMT and NERC, on data management needs and progress. The outline Data Management Plan for the HMTF Programme is presented in Appendix B. \n\nPROGRAMME COMMUNICATION: Communication within consortia, among consortia and with external actors will be facilitated by the development of a HMTF Programme website, with separate portals for each of the consortia. Among-consortia communication will be further facilitated by a meetings budget that includes funds for bringing Brazilian and Malaysian partners together with the UK-based researchers. \n\nIMPACT AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE: The PMT will also coordinate the impact and knowledge exchangee activities of the three consortia. Specifically, the PMT will: (1) provide KE support during the initial stage of fieldwork, when projects are establishing field sites and liaising with multiple stakeholders including private landholders and reserve managers; and (2) support the dissemination of results, in particular providing detailed feedback to key stakeholders, including landholders, relevant industries, and local and national government departments. Programme funds will support these activities in Malaysia and Brazil through non-academic Knowledge Exchange officers who will be tasked with preparing dissemination materials and meeting with stakeholders. These will be hired on short-term contracts, providing the PMT with crucial KE support when and where it is most needed. Delivery of the impact plans put forward by the individual consortia will be devolved to the KE officers who will lead a unified, cross-consortia approach to delivering impact. \n\nLOGISTICS SUPPORT: The HMTF Programme will provide funds for logistics in Malaysia and Brazil. Malaysian funds have been allocated to support SAFE/SEARRP and the costs of the NERC-ARSF. For Brazil, funds will be allocated to support transport costs, offsetting unforeseen budget reductions by FAPESP in this area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M017516/1","grantId":"NE/M017516/1","fundValue":"96014","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2018-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Yadvinder Singh Malhi","coPersons":["Owen  Lewis"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
