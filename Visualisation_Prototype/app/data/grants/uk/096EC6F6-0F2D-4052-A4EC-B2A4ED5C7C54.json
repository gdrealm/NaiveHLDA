Yet the role of the state in citizenship, education, and cohesion is being transformed as the myriad implications of globalisation, decentralisation, and migration take effect.</p>\n\n<p>This project therefore seeks to re-examine these long held assumptions and to re-assess the extent to which school policies and practices still have an impact on civic and political socialisation. Some of the questions that will be addressed include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do countries with more centralised state school systems have higher levels of cohesion and civic engagement than countries which have more independent schools?</li>\n\n <li>Does placing more emphasis on national identity in education help to create a stronger sense of belonging and civic commitment?</li>\n\n <li>Does citizenship education increase support for democracy or a greater willingness to participate?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This project will examine these questions from an inter-disciplinary and quantitative perspective, and using data from the 2009 ICCS study.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001620/2","grantId":"ES/K001620/2","fundValue":"139754","fundStart":"2013-04-30","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This grant is still on-going but I have disseminated some of the initial findings to a variety of national and international audiences, including: \n\n- Citizenship teachers in England (through an article in the termly journal &quot;Teaching Citizenship&quot;). \n\n- School leaders in Slovenia (through a keynote lecture to the annual school leadership conference, at the invitation of the Minister of Education).\n\n- Citizenship practitioners in Europe (by leading a workshop on the evolution of citizenship education at the NECE annual conference). \n\nIn addition, I am also building relationships with NGOs and activist groups in England and elsewhere to try to provide evidence and a greater understanding of the relationship between schools and civic outcomes.

So far, however, I have completed several research publications and found that: \n\na) Learning about Europe at school is associated with higher levels of European identity among students and higher levels of support for freedom of movement and equal rights for EU migrants. Learning a foreign language has a similarly positive relationship. \n\nb) In comparison, school activities that promote inter-cultural contact (such as school exchanges) have a comparatively effect. However, schools may be able to help students from low income families to participate (and thereby benefit from) these types of experiences. \n\nc) School-based activities such as school councils, mock elections and debating teams can have a positive and lasting impact on political engagement among English youth. \n\nd) Schools can still play an important role in youth civic socialisation, but their role is comparatively small, and they should not be seen as a panacea for political or social problems. This grant is still on-going, and the analysis is not yet complete. I will be pursuing these questions further in the coming year. \nThe findings that are available thus far will be of interest to NGOs, advocacy groups and policymakers that are interested in protecting the place of Citizenship in the English curriculum or evaluating the European dimension to national curricula. Some of the ways in which I have been working with user-groups to date are discussed in the Narrative Impact section.
