In order to develop treatments, it is important to understand why heart cells fail to manage stress properly. Recently it could be shown that members of the zinc finger protein family such as e.g. MLP (muscle LIM protein) are involved in heart disease. Zinc fingers help a protein to connect to other proteins and nucleic acids and therefore members of this protein family are probably involved in signalling. Our study aims at studying the role of several different zinc finger proteins in heart development and disease. We want to find out how these proteins speak to other parts of the cell and why their absence or their mutation changes crucial structures of heart cells such as the myofibrils and the specialised types of cell-cell contact, the intercalated discs. For this we use mouse models of heart disease as well as cardiomyocytes grown in the culture dish. The expected results of the whole project will provide new insight into how a cardiomyocyte deals with stress at the level of the cell itself.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400153","grantId":"G0400153","fundValue":"539225","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elisabeth  Ehler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
