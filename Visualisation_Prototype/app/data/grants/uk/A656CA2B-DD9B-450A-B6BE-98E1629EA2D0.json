{"id":"A656CA2B-DD9B-450A-B6BE-98E1629EA2D0","title":"Sheffield T2K ECAL bridging funds","abstractText":"See main T2K proposal. The aim of the T2K experiment is to measure the oscillation of muon-type neutrinos, produced by a high-intensity proton beam, into electron-type neutrinos. This will complete the characterisation of the 'mixing matrix' for neutrinos (the only fundamental particles of the Standard Model known to change identity during propagation). This requires two detectors, a 'far detector' to observe the beam after oscillation (T2K uses the well-known and well-understood Super-Kamiokande detector) and a 'near detector' to characterise the beam before oscillation. The near detector will be built on the JPARC accelerator site, and the contributions of the UK groups include the construction of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the experiment, and well as design of a Light Injection system for calibration and major contributions to electronics, data acquisition, and the designs for the target and beam dump. Sheffield has responsibilities for parts of the ECAL and for the Light Injection system. The 3 posts are required to contribute to this effort.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G003440/1","grantId":"ST/G003440/1","fundValue":"78550","fundStart":"2008-08-14","fundEnd":"2009-10-13","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Lee  Thompson","coPersons":["Susan Lesley Cartwright"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
