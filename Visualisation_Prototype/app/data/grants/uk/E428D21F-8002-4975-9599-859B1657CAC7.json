{"id":"E428D21F-8002-4975-9599-859B1657CAC7","title":"Design, material culture and popular creativity in suburban faith communities","abstractText":"This project explores the ways in which suburban faith communities create space focusing on architectures, material cultures, rituals, music and performance. The project seeks both to analyse the dynamic cultural aesthetics of faith in one specific locality in suburban West London and to work with faith communities to support their creative engagements with this suburban location and the wider community. The project is founded on an ongoing theoretical engagement with the relationship between religion and suburban space, which combines historical and comparative research. It is also shaped by a sustained relationship with artistic and design practioners with whom critical approaches to both understanding the material cultures of faith and shaping new suburban faith spaces have been developed. \n\nThe project has four main aims:\n\n- To investigate how the aesthetics of faith, and particularly migrant faiths are materialised and negotiated? \n- To analyse the material cultures, practices and performances of faith in suburbia and to map these through community, public and domestic spaces\n- To analyse how suburban faith communities engage creatively and meaningfully with their suburban locations and to seek to enhance these capacities. \n- To explore how design and creative practice might be used to create new forms of community belonging for suburban faith communities\n \nThe project is based in Ealing in West London and focuses on eight different faith community case studies selected to represent different faith and migration traditions. These cases studies also represent different aesthetic and material cultures in their faith traditions and practices and in their buildings and community spaces. The project involves four main research strands: Survey and ethnographic work in all eight case study sites; ethnographic work with community members to explore home-based faith cultures and practices; ethnographic work on religious music and performance; three artistic projects which involve members from across the different faith communities. The artistic projects include an architectural design workshop focusing on creating a new space for faith in suburbia; a photography project exploring domestic faith practices; a creative making project focused on sharing the creative skills and practices undertaken in diverse religious communities. \n\nOutputs from the project will include exhibitions in the locality and in central London venues as well as a traveling exhibition which will visit all of the eight places of workshop; academic papers and a co-edited book; project workshops aimed at academics, policy makers, cultural actors, the project participants and the wider public; public events including a performance; online resources and a permanent local museum exhibit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M001636/1","grantId":"AH/M001636/1","fundValue":"482142","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2019-01-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire Lucy  Dwyer","coPersons":["David  Gilbert"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
