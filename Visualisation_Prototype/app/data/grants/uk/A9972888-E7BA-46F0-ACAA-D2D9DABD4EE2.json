This knowledge may identify additional ways to diagnose and treat these important infections. The concentration of carbon dioxide is 150 fold higher inside our body than in the air surrounding us. When fungal pathogens of humans sense the higher CO2 inside the host, they initiate a series of development changes, which permits it to infect that host. Previously we identified the CO2 sensor responsible for these changes. Now we want to investigate precisely how this enzyme senses CO2. CO2 serves other functions important for the survival of fungal pathogens. For example it is a fundamental part of basic cellular metabolism. We also propose to study whether the CO2 sensing enzyme is related to fungal metabolism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601049","grantId":"G0601049","fundValue":"406294","fundStart":"2007-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Fritz  Muhlschlegel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
