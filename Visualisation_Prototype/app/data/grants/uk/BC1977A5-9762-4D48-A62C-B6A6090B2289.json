{"id":"BC1977A5-9762-4D48-A62C-B6A6090B2289","title":"Resilient and Testable Energy-Efficient Digital Hardware","abstractText":"The UK is home to some world-leading electronic companies including semiconductor IP supplier of low-power microprocessors (ARM), multimedia and communications cores (Imagination Technologies); which are at the heart of today's and future consumer electronics, and home entertainment. Power management is an essential enabling technology in such electronics and will become more prominent in future electronic systems. The downside of power management is that it decreases the reliability and increase the testability cost of energy-efficient hardware as demonstrated by recent academic and industrial research including that reported by the investigation team. This is because energy-efficient hardware often have no provision for tolerating run-time soft errors (unless for safety critical applications); and current methods for testing such hardware for manufacturing defects don't explicitly target power management circuitry. There are currently no fault models or test methods for power distribution networks and power management circuitry and no on-line soft error monitoring and correction methods for power management hardware. This grant application is focused on developing new fault models, methods, circuits and their validation (simulation, FPGA and AISC) to quantify and improve the resilience and testability of energy-efficient digital hardware. Particular emphasis is placed upon cost-effectiveness through joint consideration of reliability, and test and re-using on-chip hardware to minimise silicon area, power consumption and impact on functional performance. This is a three-year project involving two post-doctoral researchers (one for three years and the other for two years), and ARM (Cambridge) as an industrial partner. The project will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. F. Kurdahi (Uni. of California, Irvine) and Prof. M. Tehranipoor (Uni. of Connecticut). Both acknowledged world experts in the proposed research. \n\nThis project will significantly advance the present state-of-the-art in reliable and testable energy-efficient hardware and will lead to the following research deliverables:\n1. New fault models for power management circuitry and power distribution network (PDMC) to underpin their logic and timing behaviour due to soft errors and manufacturing defects; \n2. New methods and circuits and their practical validation for improving testability and diagnosis (against manufacturing defects) and reliability (against soft errors) through online monitoring and correction. \n3. A design automation methodology for embedding automatically into an energy-efficient design the required circuitry to enable enhanced reliability and testability using existing EDA tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K000810/1","grantId":"EP/K000810/1","fundValue":"449117","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project continues and it is too early to report upon impact  ","person":"Bashir M.

The downside of power management is that it decreases the reliability and increase the testability cost of energy-efficient hardware as demonstrated by recent academic and industrial research including that reported by the investigation team. Particularly, we showed that existing delay-based testing techniques for power gating are based on simplified models of the power-distribution-networks (PDNs) and exhibit both fault coverage and yield loss due to deviations at the charging delay introduced by the distributed nature of PDNs. To restore these losses, which could reach up to 67.7% of false passes and 25% of false fails due to stuck-open faults, we proposed a design-for-testability (DFT) logic that accounts for a distributed PDN. The proposed logic is optimized for flexibility between test-application-time and hardware overhead and reuses silicon already available on the devices. Through physical layout SPICE simulations, we showed complete fault coverage and yield recovery on single stuck-open faults. This research was the first analysis of the PDN impact on test quality and offers a unified test solution for both ring and grid power gating styles. The analysis of the investigated problem, the proposed solutions and the validation simulation results on the grid style power gating are presented at the 23rd Asian Test Symposium in November 2014 under the title &quot;High Quality Testing of Grid Style Power Gating&quot;. The complete research, so far, on both ring and grid power gating styles are under review for publication at the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems.\n\nThe project continues and will report further in due course. Manufacturing testing is conducted after the manufacturing of the integrated circuits to assure that defect-free devices are shipped to the customers. The effectiveness of the developed DFT architecture has already been demonstrated for manufacturing testing. As a result it could be adopted by industry testing of power gating. Moreover, the DFT is integrated in the devices and can be reused for in-the-field applications to increase the resilience of them. One possible direction could monitor the supply current locally on the devices and provide feedback for the state of the supply network towards the power management circuitry in order to activate a reliability enhancement mechanism. The supply current quality has already been demonstrated to affect the aging of the devices. So, monitoring the aging of the devices through the usage of the results of the proposed research is another possible direction.
