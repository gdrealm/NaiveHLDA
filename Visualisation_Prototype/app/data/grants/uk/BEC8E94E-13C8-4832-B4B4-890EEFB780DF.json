New understandings of how mathematics pedagogy relates to learner engagement and hence outcomes will be important to both mathematics education research, and policy and practice. Capturing five years of progression (Year 7-11) in one year will pose methodological challenges, the resolution of which will contribute to the literature of combining longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses, and dealing with missing data.</p>\n\n<p>The main phase of the study will involve a sample of about 50 secondary schools matching the national demographic characteristics. An average of 3 to 5 classes in each year group will be surveyed with a questionnaire capturing students' mathematical dispositions and their perceptions of teaching at three time points establishing longitudinal data: at the start and towards the end of the academic year 2011/12, and at the beginning of the next academic year.&nbsp; A teacher survey will map teaching practices at mathematics, during the first academic year. Additionally, three contrasting case studies will be performed to provide evidence of mathematical teaching practices and narratives of students' developing dispositions and decisions throughout a year. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0538","grantId":"RES-061-25-0538","fundValue":"228656","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Pampaka","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
