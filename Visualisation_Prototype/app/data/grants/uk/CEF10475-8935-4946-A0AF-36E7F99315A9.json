{"id":"CEF10475-8935-4946-A0AF-36E7F99315A9","title":"Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Trial 15 (AML 15)","abstractText":"The cure rate of patients with AML under 60 years is improving as a result of increasing intensity of treatment (1980 - 12%: 2000-53%). In this trial two induction combinations (H-DAT and FLAG-Ida) will be compared. H-DAT was the better arm from the recent MRC Trial and FLAG-Ida is widely used but never compared in a randomised trial. The trial will try to refine treatment to prevent relapse. The best chemotherapy arm of the current MRC trial will be compared with high dose Cytosine-Arabinoside (Ara-C) which is widely used in the USA. Two dose levels of Ara-C will be tested. It is not clear how many total courses of treatment are needed. This trial will compare 4 vs 5 courses and will add to the experience of the 4 vs 5 course comparison from the present AML12 trial. A new agent which is a drug attached to an antibody to specifically target leukaemia cells has recently been developed. This trial will assess the value of adding this immunoconjugate to both induction and/or consolidation treatment.\n\nAbout 15% of cases are Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia. It may be possible to cure a high proportion of cases (~80%) as done in the current AML12 trial, but with much less intensive chemotherapy developed by the Spanish Group. We will compare the MRC versus the Spanish approach. We anticipate a recruitment of 550 patients &lt;60 years per annum from 200 centres in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9901427","grantId":"G9901427","fundValue":"1378800","fundStart":"2002-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan Kenneth  Burnett","coPersons":["Keith  Wheatley"],"organisation":"University of Wales College of Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
