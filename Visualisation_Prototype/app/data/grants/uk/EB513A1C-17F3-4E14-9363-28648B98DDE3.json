{"id":"EB513A1C-17F3-4E14-9363-28648B98DDE3","title":"Law and Agency: The Micro-Foundations of Institutional Change in National Corporate Governance Systems","abstractText":"<p>Much debate has taken place concerning the link between the 'quality' of a country's company law, its financial development and the nature of its corporate governance system. It has been argued that countries with strong legal minority shareholder protection will have well-developed financial markets. This claim has not only influenced the policy recommendations of IMF and World Bank, but arguably directly inspired the legislators in at least one EU country (the Draghi law adopted in Italy in 1998).</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, few researchers have systematically investigated the impact of changing legal rules on corporate governance practices at the firm level. We therefore know comparatively little about what impact recent legal changes had on companies' behaviour and how this affects a country's corporate governance regime as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this research is to compare the evolution of corporate governance practices of the largest companies in four European countries (UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) to legal changes over the last twenty years. The study creates a Shareholder Orientation Index (SOI) of corporate governance practices that is comparable across countries and within countries over time. This will generate new insights into the relationship between law and agency in corporate governance reform.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0518","grantId":"RES-061-25-0518","fundValue":"225254","fundStart":"2011-11-21","fundEnd":"2015-05-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerhard  Schnyder","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
