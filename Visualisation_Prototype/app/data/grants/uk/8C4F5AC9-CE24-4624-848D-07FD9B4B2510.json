This series consisted of four seminars involving academics, policy makers, practitioners, activists, students and interested individuals. The interdisciplinary team involved in organising this series were from disciplinary backgrounds including: geography, sociology, women's studies, dietetics, nursing and midwifery, education, and sports and exercise science.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0768-A","grantId":"RES-451-26-0768-A","fundValue":"16873","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main routes to impact were the seminars themselves, the website and blog coverage. All of the seminars were attended by activists, practitioners, interested members of the public as well as academics and there was a clear focus on engagement between these different groups with presentations from all three. The international speakers helped raise the profile of UK based research/activism/practice. The following elements of the seminar were key to ensuring engagement between these groups:\n\nCreating a positive and accessible space: key to engaging audiences from diverse backgrounds was the creation of a safe, positive and accessible space, accessible to those with mobility impairments and with seating comfortable for bigger bodies. Bursaries ensured that the seminars were financially accessible. At the beginning of each seminar, the ethos of the series was clearly outlined - emphasising the focus on size-positive, non-judgemental and supportive discussion. Important here was the decision not to invite mainstream media coverage, but rather to seek coverage through alternative media. This decision was taken to avoid any potential misrepresentation of the content and to ensure that the seminars were non-judgemental spaces.\n\nEncouraging engagement: each event had time for unstructured community discussion and combined academic presentations with presentations from activists, practitioners, and individuals talking about their own embodied experiences. In addition, most of the seminars had some 'alternative' activities: the second seminar involved a discussion with members of the 'Well Now' patient group based in Coventry; the third seminar included a poster display (of Unskinny Bop artwork), a mini-Big Bum Jumble, a Fat Studies book stall, a discussion of a fat/queer/trans timeline, and a film screening; and the final seminar had several artist performances and displays of artwork.

The development of a richer, deeper network of fat studies and HAES researchers within the UK and showcasing this to international audiences (through the involvement of international speakers and through the website). This has ensured that UK based researchers are part of international academic networks and editorial teams.\n2. Helped inform the development of a special edition of Critical Public Health to showcase interdisciplinary debates on fat studies and HAES to a broader academic audience.\n3. Increased the degree of collaborative and interdisciplinary research amongst those involved – there have been jointly authored publications (several in the planned special edition) and one (unfortunately unsuccessful) joint grant application.\n4. Enabled conversation between Fat Studies and HAES scholars which has helped identify key points of collaboration and contention. In particular, key debates emerged around the authority of those who speak for/about fat bodies and HAES; and the need to pay attention to the multiplicity of experiences of fatness and fat politics. \n5. Helped identify key areas for future research in the fields of Fat Studies and HAES (in particular, intersections with queer and disability theory). \n6. Helped develop methodological tools for researching and communicating fat studies and HAES research (this was the explicit focus of the final seminar).\n7. Generated a new resource (the website) useful as a teaching resource.\n8. Enhanced the personal research agendas of early career researchers through increasing the range of personal research contacts and raising individual’s research profiles. A core aim of the seminar series was to bring together academics, activists and practitioners. There is significant overlap between these communities and many of the impacts and outputs listed above are also relevant for impacts in practitioner and activist communities. Specific impacts are as follows:\n\n• The series has put the UK on the map in terms of fat activism and HAES – two fields dominated by the USA.\n• The series has broadened practitioner awareness of HAES. \n• The series has facilitated increased collaboration between activists, academics and practitioners ensuring that these fields are not developing separately.\n• The seminar series has broadened public awareness of fat studies and HAES. The seminar received interest from online media, particularly bloggers (these are outlined in the academic outputs section) and the website continues to open up the seminars to a much larger audience. In addition, all of the seminars had some participants who were not activists, practitioners or academics, but were interested individuals keen to find out more about fat studies and HAES. Subsequent art collaborations have also involved school children.\n• The series has also broadened public engagement of fat studies and HAES scholars through collaboration with artists (this was a particular focus of the final seminar and has led to several further collaborations detailed in the next section).
