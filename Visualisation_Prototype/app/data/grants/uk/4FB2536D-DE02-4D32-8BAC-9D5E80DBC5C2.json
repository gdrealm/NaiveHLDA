The mechanism by which this happens is not clear. One suggestion for which there has been some supporting experimental data is that certain genes in the foetus are modified by addition of a methyl group ? so called DNA methylation. Alternatively, we propose, similar modifications may occur to the proteins around which DNA is wound, and this too can alter the way in which genes are expressed. In this project we will use new large scale DNA sequencing technology to identify all the genes that are modified by DNA methylation and all those that are modified by methylation of associated proteins. This pattern of modifications across the genome in early life should reveal the key mechanisms that lead to the phenomenon of foetal programming. Understanding these mechanisms will ultimately allow us to predict the presence of such changes and perhaps to reverse them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801269","grantId":"G0801269","fundValue":"607565","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian John Clark","coPersons":["Simon  Langley-Evans","Peter  King","Vardhman  Rakyan"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
