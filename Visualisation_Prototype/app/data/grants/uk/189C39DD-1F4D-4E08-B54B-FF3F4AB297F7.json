The brain requires high levels of food and oxygen to function effectively. By using a lot of oxygen to generate energy, the brain produces a by-product. This by-product is toxic forms of oxygen and is termed Reactive Oxygen Species or ROS. Normally the brain can cope with low levels of ROS that are generated as a by-product of normal metabolism, but as the brain ages, the self-repair mechanisms become less effective and ROS become excessive. ROS are destructive to cells by a self-perpetuating cycle of damage. Primarily, ROS generation occurs in the structure within the cell responsible for producing energy from food and oxygen called the mitochondria. We term ROS generated by the mitochondria, mitochondrial ROS (m-ROS). An ageing brain struggles to clear itself of cellular material damaged by ROS. As waste material accumulates, it can also generate a second source of ROS, generated by metals within the accumulated waste material reacting with oxygen to produce more ROS. We term these cytoplasmic ROS (c-ROS). Both sources of ROS now contribute to the increasing cycle of damage as neurons age. We found that the connections between nerve cells, called synapses, grow excessively when ROS are excessive. Synapses are normally known to grow while the brain carries out learning and memory functions and the connections between nerve cells improve their communication efficiency. We therefore find it surprising to see synapses growing during a period when we would expect a decline in the efficiency of neuronal communication. In this proposal we will examine and uncover the processes in nerve cells that react to ROS to cause synapse growth. We have already found that nerve cells activate a process of self-renewal when ROS are present in the brain and suspect that this may be inducing synapse growth. Exactly how this happens we aim to determine. The changes that we have observed are very likely of critical importance to our understanding of the decline in brain function as we age. This work will help us to understand the mechanisms, events and molecules that cause failure in nerve cell function in the ageing brain. The results of this work have every potential to aid the discovery of drugs and treatments to alleviate adverse effects of ageing and will thus, in time, benefit society as a whole.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I01179X/1","grantId":"BB/I01179X/1","fundValue":"365076","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results from our research have not yet been published (in progress), and they have therefore not yet been applied elsewhere.

They are inherently plastic and capable of great computational feats. They are also energetically extremely demanding. This proposal focuses upon how these two attributes of nervous systems, namely plasticity and energy consumption, are inherently linked. &quot;Homeostasis&quot; describes the processes by which many nerve cells strive to maintain constant synaptic function. For example, if increases in one ion channel make a nerve cell more excitable, the expression of other ion channels will change to offset this effect; at the synapse, increases in presynaptic neurotransmitter release can be compensated for by decreased postsynaptic receptor density for this neurotransmitter. We previously discovered that nerve cells also undergo structural homeostatic adjustments in response to changes in nerve cell activity, changing the size of their synaptic terminals (presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites) and the number of synapses. What has remained unresolved and what we have now begun to understand is the important question of how nerve cells &quot;know&quot; when they depart form their preferred activity range. Intricately linked to the activity of excitable cells is the issue of energy, consumed in large quantities when pumping ions across the cell membrane following membrane depolarisation. Our current work suggests that nerve cells gauge the level of their activity by measuring metabolic by-products of energy (ATP) generation. Specifically, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which are constitutive by-products of mitochondrial respiration, act as second messengers that are both necessary and sufficient to regulate activity dependent homeostatic growth of synaptic terminals. We demonstrated that, at the presynaptic side, hydrogen peroxide is the main signal, transduced via oxidation of DJ-1&szlig;/Park7 sensor to changes in PI(3)Kinase signalling, a known cell growth pathway. At the postsynaptic side, in contrast, superoxide appears to be the key metabolic signal for synaptic growth, though its downstream effectors remain unclear. The importance of these findings is twofold. Academically, our discoveries are a major advance of the fundamental question of how nerve cells set and measure their activity range. Clinically, ROS are known to increase to toxic levels in nerve cells as we age and in pathological neurodegeneration. This work demonstrates critical roles of ROS at low levels, during normal nervous system development and function. These allow us to understand how deviations from normal ROS levels, as occur with age and disease, actually impact on synapse structure and function. Our findings assign a fundamental and until now unappreciated role to metabolic by-products as key signals in regulating neuronal synaptic communication. This has far reaching implications, from our basic understanding of how neurons measure their own activity levels, how synaptic structures are regulated locally and globally, and how defects in this signalling system impacts on nervous system performance as is the case during normal ageing and under neurodegenerative conditions. In addition, it will prompt a re-evaluation of oxidative stress and associated molecules from previously seen as purely destructive entities to being part of a cellular homeostatic, compensatory response.
