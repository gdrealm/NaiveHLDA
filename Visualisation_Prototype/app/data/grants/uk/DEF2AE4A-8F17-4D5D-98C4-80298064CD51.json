This work, along with the subsequent requirements to protect and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children, from infancy to adolescence, through accurate and appropriate communicate with them, demands highly developed professional skills. Whilst there is a substantial body of knowledge about the circumstances surrounding social workers' communications with children in the extraordinary contexts of children being seriously harmed or killed, less is known about how social workers communicate with children in ordinary, everyday practice, the challenges they encounter in this process and the sense social workers and children make of these interactions. There is an urgent need for research to be conducted into social workers' communication with children at key points and places in a child's safeguarding and 'looked after' journey. Two such key points include the social worker-child interaction at the point of referral and assessment and in the course of longer-term relationship building if children become 'looked after'. To date we have relied largely on the retrospective reflective accounts of participants in these social worker-child encounters. We have some ideas as to what happens (children are overlooked or inadequately engaged with), how it happens (parents' use of space, and physical presence to exclude child from conversation) and why it happens (time pressures, power, intimidating emotional dynamics, exposure to risk, fear of what might be said and what to do with what is said). Currently what is missing, and the central focus of this study, is the direct observation of social worker-child interactions. To address this gap in knowledge this study will explore how social workers communicate with children in their ordinary, everyday practice and how the social workers and children involved in these encounters experience and understand them. \nThe research will take place in two specific settings to encompass communication that takes place across a range of key social work tasks with children: firstly, in the reactive domain of frontline assessment teams, where relationships with children have to be developed rapidly, and secondly, in the more controlled environment of teams working with 'looked after' children in foster, residential or kinship care, where there is the potential for longer-term relationships. The project will have three phases. Phase one will be located in assessment teams in four local authorities across the four UK nations and will involve observations of practice and semi-structured interviews with social workers. In phase two social workers and looked after children in two local authorities will be videoed when meeting to review the child's care arrangements and the video will be used in interviews with children and workers to stimulate their reflections on the meeting. These data will be complemented by a small scale participatory video project with children involved in the study. Phase 3 involves the development of dissemination and training tools, utilising the data from the first two phases, plus videoed discussions of the findings with groups of practitioners from the four local authorities involved in phase 1. \nThe findings will make an important original contribution to:\n -social work policy and practice in national and international settings\n -qualifying and post-qualifying social work education\n -inter-professional work with vulnerable children\n -social science knowledge\n \nImpact will be realised in different, complementary ways:\n -digital and paper-based resource packages for professional training and development\n -academic and professional conference presentations; \n -publications in academic and professional journals; \n -academic-practice knowledge exchange activities. \n -enhanced professional knowledge and skills of practice and research participants","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006134/2","grantId":"ES/K006134/2","fundValue":"126305","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gillian Margaret Ruch","coPersons":["Viviene  Cree","Karen  Winter","Mark Philip Hadfield"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
