In particular, it has been suggested that causal learning usually requires actively reasoning about the relationship between different events, and that this reasoning process may be demanding and effortful. If this is the case, then it may be that there are developmental changes in children's ability to engage in causal reasoning that are related to their reasoning abilities and to the extent to which they have the capacity to hold in mind and process information. </p>\n\n<p>This project will examine such developmental changes and how they relate to other cognitive abilities. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H004882/1","grantId":"ES/H004882/1","fundValue":"170555","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Teresa  McCormack","coPersons":["Tom  Beckers"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
