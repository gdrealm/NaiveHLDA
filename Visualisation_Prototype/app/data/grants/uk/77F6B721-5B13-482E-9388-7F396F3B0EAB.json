Maritime security and related national economical and political interests are strategically important priorities for the UK Government and the world community in general. The most recent example can be found in the Persian Gulf, a region which sees billions of pounds of merchant traffic annually and where a lack of maritime security has created opportunities for piracy. Another example is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (the result of technical problems) which demonstrated the cost of this kind of maritime catastrophe which might make it a potentially attractive target for a terrorist attack. It also highlighted the problem of the detection and dynamic tracking of oil spills. \n A number of systems are currently employed for the remote monitoring of the sea surface. Each system has its own capabilities and limitations. It seems unlikely, therefore, that any one system could be developed to solve all the problems of sea monitoring with a resolution sufficient to permit the detection and automatic identification of small objects. The solution lies in a combination of systems. For this reason, the introduction of new tools and specifically tools capable of filling the gaps in the existing security systems is very much welcomed. \n This project aims to develop a brand-new, cost-effective security sensor network for maritime application. The proposed system would be maintained on a chain of light anchored buoys spread over a range of several miles equipped with ultra-wideband (UWB) forward scatter (FS) sensors enabling earlier automatic detection and identification of non-cooperative intruders in all-weather conditions. The network targets the detection of low-visible, small, and potentially low-speed maritime targets such as boats (which might be used for suicide missions or for smuggling people, drugs or weapons); semi-submerged objects (lost containers or icebergs dangerous for maritime traffic and offshore installations); environmental control (oil spill detection); etc. The system could be used where more traditional monitoring tools are unable to operate and would replace or complement them. It would be effective for emerging maritime situations, e.g. to protect offshore wind energy farms and EEZ boundary, to track the routes of pirates and so forth. The engineering outputs from the project will include a demonstration and testing of the system fragment in real marine conditions leading to a detailed production specification of the system developed with industrial partners and end users. Eventually a brand new product would be developed and manufactured for the world market and it would bring economic benefits to the UK and strengthen its position in the high-tech market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008419/1","grantId":"EP/J008419/1","fundValue":"251573","fundStart":"2012-06-05","fundEnd":"2015-06-04","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hugh Duncan  Griffiths","coPersons":["Karl  Woodbridge"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
