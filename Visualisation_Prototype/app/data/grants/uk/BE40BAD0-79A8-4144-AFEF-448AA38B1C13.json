{"id":"BE40BAD0-79A8-4144-AFEF-448AA38B1C13","title":"Molecular mechanism of muscle regulation by troponin","abstractText":"Muscle contraction is triggered by a brief pulse of calcium inside each muscle cell. The calcium binds to a protein called troponin in the muscle thin filaments, producing a change in the filament structure. This allows the motor protein myosin in the nearby thick filaments to bind to and pull on the thin filaments, causing the muscle to shorten. The same process occurs in all the muscles that move the skeleton and in the heart, where a pulse of calcium triggers each heart beat.\n\nOur aim is to determine the molecular structural changes caused by binding of calcium to troponin, and to discover how they control muscle contraction. There have been many previous studies of calcium binding to isolated fragments of troponin, but we will take a radically different approach, in which the structural changes in troponin will be measured inside a working muscle cell. This is necessary to preserve the normal transient interactions between the muscle proteins that take place during a single contraction. We will label isolated troponin with fluorescent probes, and replace the native troponin in muscle cells by the labelled troponin. We can then use the polarisation of the fluorescent light to follow structural changes in troponin inside the cell. We have developed and refined this approach over the last ten years, and tested it on other muscle proteins, so we are confident that the method can reveal how troponin controls muscle contraction.\n\nIt is important to understand the normal mechanism of muscle control to understand how it fails in muscle disease, which can help in designing drugs and therapies. The mechanism is essentially the same in skeletal muscles and in the heart. Muscle weakness impairs the quality of life of many elderly people, and heart disease is a major threat to human health. Some inherited heart diseases are caused by specific errors in the structure of troponin, but we don?t know how these cause the disease because we don?t know how troponin works normally. This project aims to provide this knowledge. \n\nNormal function of all cells and tissues depends on many proteins interacting in a complicated but coordinated way, and it is often difficult to understand how a defect in one protein leads to a complex set of symptoms. The approach we are developing to measure changes in protein structures inside cells should help to overcome this general limitation of current biomedical research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601065","grantId":"G0601065","fundValue":"546185","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Irving","coPersons":["David  Trentham"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
