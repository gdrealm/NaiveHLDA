{"id":"D5EC771B-136B-4625-B5F6-0D16FE8D766D","title":"Post-Launch Support for the Venus Express Magnetometer Instrument","abstractText":"Imperial will perform the small but important task of validating the magnetometer data. The steps in the data-processing chain are summarised as: 1. Retrieval and checking of raw data (Graz) 2. Calibration of magnetometer data (Graz) 3. Removal of spacecraft interference (Graz, Kosice, Sheffield) 4. Removal of Residual Offsets (UCLA) 5. Validation of data (Imperial College, Graz) 6. Submission of data to ESA Planetary Science Archive (Imperial College) Data validation is a checking process which is necessary to ensure that the semi-automated calibration and interference steps have worked correctly, that no artefacts have been introduced to the data, and in particular that no (or minimal) spacecraft interference remains. It is also a check against data which may become corrupted on the telemetry downlink or ground-processing. Validation is part-automated and part-visual process which requires knowledge of both magnetometer instruments and the environment in which they operate. For expediency, Imperial will also take over task 6 from Graz, since we routinely do the same for Cluster and Rosetta data sets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G004153/1","grantId":"ST/G004153/1","fundValue":"34468","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Michael Carr","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
