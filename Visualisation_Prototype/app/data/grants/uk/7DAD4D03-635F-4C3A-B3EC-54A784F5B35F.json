Typically \nthis field has addressed and overcome issues associated with the mass production of therapeutic proteins, by utilising \nrecombinant DNA technology and cultured cells to produce the protein efficiently and at high yield. More recently however, \nit is the cells themselves that have been the subject of biotechnology manufacturing for therapy, and cells are much more \nfragile and complex than the proteins this industry is more used to working with. However, a more elegant approach is to \nprovide to patients human cells capable of producing such proteins within the patient. One good example would be \npancreatic cells able to produce insulin rather than have diabetic patients having to self administer insulin on a daily basis. \n\nThe use of whole cells for therapeutics is becoming increasingly important for regenerative medicine and other therapeutic \nniches with early stage clinical trials currently underway and many more at early discovery stage. Preliminary whole cell \ntherapies have included vaccines against pre-existing melanoma and prostate cancer and more recently a regenerative \nmedicine whole cell therapy to help with the effects of stroke. The quality of manufacture of these cells will be critical if they \nare to be effective when applied to the patient. It is generally accepted that the manufacture of these therapeutic cells \nrequires careful consideration and forward thinking from the outset. Initial cell sourcing to expansion phases to storage and \ndelivery to the patient all require a great deal research and development to ensure the quality and intended functionality of \nthe cells remains high and constant throughout these stages.\nThe term bioprocessing has become an umbrella term for the separation of cells from their culture medium and transfer to \na liquid vehicle that allows transfer to a patient. Bioprocessing therefore involves different steps many of which cause a \ndegree of stress to the cells. In addition, it has recently become evident that during the cell manufacturing process it is \nessential to include holding stages prior to and post processing and prior to administration to the patient. This allows \nflexibility within the process and is essential when dealing with vast numbers of cells in numerous cell culture vessels. \nThese holding stages may last up to several hours and we have found that they often lead to decreased quality and \nspecification of the cells prior to application to the patient. This project aims to address these issues by utilising clinically \nrelevant cell lines to investigate bioprocessing and storage problems associated with cellular stress and instability. This \nproject will create stabilisation formulations to investigate short, intermediate and long term storage of cells in both liquid \nrefrigerated and frozen states and combine this with ultra scale-down processing techniques developed by UCL which \nmimic the stresses the cells undergo during large scale manufacture. A panel of biological tests will be applied to the cells \nto investigate their quality following the physical insults. This will help establish a) the optimal stabilisation formulations and \nb) the robustness of the cells during storage and bioprocessing holds. The objective is to create a robust toolkit that will be \nof value to the biotechnology and regenerative medicine sector. The toolkit would be used in the early stages of product \nR&amp;D enabling cost effective use of precious cells whilst developing a robust manufacturing and administration protocols \nthat meet the current regulatory and economic challenges.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021415/1","grantId":"BB/J021415/1","fundValue":"262686","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Hoare","coPersons":["Ivan  Wall"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
