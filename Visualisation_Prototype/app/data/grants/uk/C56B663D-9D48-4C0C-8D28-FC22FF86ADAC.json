It asks for a description of some coefficients, called the Kronecker coefficients, appearing in the representation theory of the symmetric group. More recently, this problem has been shown to play a key role in Geometric Complexity theory, an approach that seeks to settle the famous P vs NP problem.\n\nWe have recently proposed a completely new approach to the Kronecker problem using the duality between the symmetric group and the partition algebra. Early results suggest that this may well lead to a complete solution. This proposal aims at developing this tool further (and extending it to positive characteristics) to give a systematic study of the ordinary and modular representation theory of the symmetric group.\n\nIn parallel, we plan to liaise with the Computer Science community to investigate the implications of our work to the celebrated P vs NP problem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L01078X/1","grantId":"EP/L01078X/1","fundValue":"314580","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2017-06-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Maud  De Visscher","coPersons":["Anton  Cox"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
