We believe this study has made a small but significant contribution to methodological understanding on how students can be engaged ethically to ensure maximum impact of educational and social research findings on matters affecting them. Participatory research with children has become relatively commonplace yet few examples exist exemplifying their participation in knowledge dissemination and research impact activities and strategies. Using a children's rights' compliant methodology, this inquiry documents and critically examines the effectiveness of a follow-on project concerned to maximize dissemination and impact of key findings from a previous study. CPAL1 identified 10 key principles that helped and hindered students' learning and assessment in KS3 classrooms. Systematic analysis of the CPAL2 research process and impact data identified a number of underpinning themes on their effective participation which have become disseminated as research-based guidelines. These reinforce the power of young people's engagement, creativity and discernment in planning for research impact. They also underscore the importance of sound ethical negotiation, the role of impact capacity-building with them, the generative potential of creative and imaginative activities, the effectivness of successful child-centered events and the penetrative power of interactive social media. Methodologically, the utility of the UNCRC Art. 12 based model of space, voice, audience and influence (Lundy, 2007) as a heuristic for young people's engagement in research impact activities is confirmed particularly in relation to giving children's voice 'due weight'. \nThe main finding is that children's participation in research dissemination and impact assures their views are given 'due weight' on matters affecting them. UNCRC Art. 12 is the main rationale underpinning children's 'right to have a say' and 'pupil voice' in educational/social research but less is understood about how to assure the second half of this right, concerned with their views being listened to and having due influence on matters of significance. CPAL2 has developed practical and ethical guidelines for use by other researchers. These are presented as 29 Steps under 4 headings: \nPlanning for Impact; \nWorking Creatively with Research Findings; \nStrategic Dissemination and Impact; \nFollow-through, Evaluation and Celebration. already submitted to funder.\no A short animated student-directed film A Classroom Tale to disseminate the key findings hosted on Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfxWZayRoGI) (8,600 views); Use by public. \n. We believe that due to the mechanisms that we have in place (web-based, social media, electronic) and the collaborations we have engendered that interest and impact of the various resources will continue. Despite having no financial support for the project for over a year the project has continued to demonstrate increasing impact. We anticipate that there will be greater international interest and penetration of the findings with the journal publication and a part-time presence in Norway, which is a country strongly committed to AfL and children's rights.\n\no Access to the film and to teacher and student surveys on the C2KNI technology platform for schools - can be used by teachers as practical resources or for information;\n\no AfL classroom activities for teachers including stimulus postcards, student-designed leaflets etc to encourage deeper conversations between teachers and learners on the best conditions for learning and assessment.;\n\no Dedicated project website (www.cpal2.org) hosting project outputs for researchers, education professionals and teachers ;\n\no Child-animated poster on the10 pupil AfL principles for use by schools and classrooms; \n\no Staff development training resources /programme for primary and post-primary teachers on developing greater student participation in classrooms.;\n\no Findings and outputs used as input and stimulus activities on initial teacher education programmes in 5 university/colleges.
