In order to explore the ways in which the challenge of food waste reduction is being framed, interpreted and responded to, 20 in-depth qualitative interviews will be carried out with a range of relevant stakeholders including retailers, activists and charities.</p>\n\n<p>These key informant interviews will be contextualized by analysing the content of secondary data sources including policy documents, company reports, print media and campaigning materials. Particular attention will be paid to the processes through which food waste has been positioned as an issue that households and retailers must take responsibility for. Concomitantly, quantitative datasets will be analysed (existing surveys of UK eating habits) in order to develop social scientific accounts of household food waste.</p>\n\n<p>Particular attention will be paid to the organisation of everyday life, cultural conventions, household dynamics and a range of different actors within the food system. Additionally, through a series of multi-stakeholder workshops and exhibitions - involving academic researchers, retailers, non-governmental organisations and policy makers - this project will share data, develop state of the art thinking about food waste and identify innovative practical mechanisms for its reduction.&nbsp; </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00514X/1","grantId":"ES/L00514X/1","fundValue":"161296","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Evans","coPersons":["Dale  Southerton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
