The project willbe executed in the following stages: (1) Benchmarking and intercalibrating the sensorsperformance, (2) Sensor device automation, (3) Sensor packaging for specific users, (4)Development for automated on-line use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H502343/1","grantId":"EP/H502343/1","fundValue":"104115","fundStart":"2010-06-14","fundEnd":"2011-06-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A working sensor has been developed for detecting biomembrane active compounds in water. The system has been semi-automated and a full performance evaluation has been carried out. This portfolio has been presented to several end-users resulting in the development of collaborations with them. These collaborations have allowed us to win two further grants.
