{"id":"4A35FCE5-E9AC-46A1-8024-7997E97BBDDB","title":"Forensic Un/Certainty and Political Remains","abstractText":"<p> In 2013, a catastrophic rail crash devastated the community of Lac Megantic, Quebec, resulting in the death of 47 people. Officials at the local, provincial and federal level responded by initiating processes to identify those killed. These processes to identify the missing, however, are not apolitical, but involve a network of actors, expertise, technologies and practices. As key decisions are made - such as what does or does not constitute evidence, who has the authority to speak, what constitutes remains, and when to close an investigation - a series of decisions are made with social and political consequences.</p> \n<p>As the first anniversary approaches, this study will map the networks and practices that were enacted during the identification process at Lac Megantic. Comparing, contrasting and connecting these practices to UK and international standards in investigation procedures and forensic science, this study will make a direct contribution to the development of UK and international policy with implications for the social welfare of communities affected by disaster and conflict in the UK and internationally.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008394/1","grantId":"ES/L008394/1","fundValue":"56368","fundStart":"2013-12-02","fundEnd":"2015-10-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucy Catherine Easthope","coPersons":["Elspeth Sarah Van Veeren"],"organisation":"University of Lincoln","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
