Interactive Stories of Digital Technology and Social Change","abstractText":"We are investigating and creating innovative ways of telling the story of Catalyst and its impact by using interactive video techniques. We are bringing existing video footage of Catalyst projects together in a viewer-led narrative: viewers could start with a video and then click on different parts of the video, which would lead them to discover further information about the research process, the stakeholders involved, up-to-date information on the impact of the projects, or would lead to further video footage related to the clicked link.\n\nThe central premise and intrigue is that film already acts as a potent tool for the dissemination of impact, However, film is necessarily static and linear. This forms a strong baseline which we can develop into new dimensions. If project content could be explored and queried dynamically. If it was realized as a navigable 'environment' for exploration both by the projects' audience but also amongst its' participants then it could remain a powerful means of propagating impact. By acting as a social boundary object to communicate outwardly but also facilitate communication within the project. A 'dynamic information environment' would be a powerful means of propagating the impact of research.\n\nThe easiest way to think of this concept is to think of the 'adventure books' we all read as children, which contained passages such as &quot;You encounter an orc. If you decide to fight the orc, turn to page 74. If you decide to reason with the orc, turn to page 36&quot;. In a similar way, we imagine a video platform, using available technology, that would allow viewers to construct their own journeys through the Catalyst story. This would create an interactive, engaging and exciting way to explore the impact of Catalyst. But it would also serve as an exemplar for how to communicate impact of EPSRC-funded research projects.\n\nWe envisage the prime output to be an interactive video supported by novel dissemination methods.\n\nFirstly, OURUS (Robert Potts and Daniel Morrell) will work directly with specific communities involved in each Catalyst project to best capture attitudes and emotions (highlights and turning points) to present multiple stories of the research. The emphasis will be on capturing the multiple facets of any research project: each participant brings his/her own perspective to the story. \n\nOURUS will lead on creating an overall methodology, a vision, and craft documentary films to do this. Specifically this will involve training teams in the use of camera, video and story construction; utilizing different media to generate audience driven tales; and creating 'daily' impact diaries. Participants will be drawn from those directly involved in the Catalyst community, and following our practice encouraging 'citizen innovation', each will determine their own priorities, being encouraged to collect and share stories in untraditional and creative ways. The result will be a combination of existing and new Catalyst footage that viewers can weave together to create their own stories of the impact of Catalyst in the 'adventure book' style described above.\n\nOur dissemination practices will be animated through the interactive video accompanied by an evolving exhibition. This exhibition will take multiple shapes in the form of 'Catalyst Tardis'. The 'Catalyst Tardis' will showcase and outline stories from the 'adventure book' style above, and metaphorically catapult itself outwards to inspire user involvement and interaction. The 'Tardis' will present itself as a creative environment to generate profile and enable high volume participation at external events eg. seminars, conferences, festivals, and street markets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L025892/1","grantId":"EP/L025892/1","fundValue":"10081","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Whittle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
