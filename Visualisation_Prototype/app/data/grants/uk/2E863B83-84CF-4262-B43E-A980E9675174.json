This proposal intends to study the use of helically corrugated waveguides to investigate the scalability of this concept to higher Ka-band (26.5GHz to 40GHz) and W-band (75GHz to 110GHz) frequencies. Two substantial problems immediately present themselves as one looks to increase the frequency, namely the requirements to fabricate an adequately accurate profile with a sufficiently smooth surface to produce the required dispersive properties with a tolerable loss. At the lower Xband frequencies hitherto investigated CNC mills have been used to produce the required 3D surface, but at higher frequencies the proportionately reduced tolerances plus the reduced clearances for tool access will prohibit this technique. The project will therefore investigate the alternative fabrication techniques available, including hydraulic and mechanical forming, electroforming, casting and spark erosion, all combined with electropolishing and thin surface plating. The fabricated waveguide sections will be measured by a Vector Network Analyser (VNA). The VNA will be used to measure the wave dispersion of helical structures by comparing the evolution of the principle value of the phase angle of the radiation as a function of frequency as it propagates through a known length of the waveguide. Measurements of the wave dispersion of amplifier and oscillator interaction regions and helical compressor sections will be benchmarked and compared with the predictions of theory and modelling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D500842/1","grantId":"EP/D500842/1","fundValue":"212786","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Radiation sources and amplifiers, in the spectral region from microwave to terahertz, are extensively used in UK industry and public sectors such as security, defence, health and the environment. Companies, including e2v Technologies plc. (e2v) and TMD Technologies Ltd. (TMD), have developed and sold new radiation products based on post-1996 research undertaken at the University of Strathclyde. Their devices accessed new frequency ranges with considerable increases in power and bandwidth. The designs were transferred to industry, where devices have been constructed, jobs created, policy changed and considerable investments made. These sources have had extensive beneficial impact through applications in defence, surveillance, materials processing, health sciences and environmental monitoring. \n.\n\nThe impact this would have is twofold. First, there is the obvious benefit to the environment, but second, the development and ultimate commercialisation of such technology would create wealth for the UK's economy.\n\n\n\nThe current extraction process used by the mining industry involves passing rocks through a crusher to reduce them to a fine dust from which minerals and ore can be removed. However, this simple process comes at a high cost and uses an estimated 4% of the world's energy resources. This is where high-power magnetrons could make a big difference.\n\n\n\nWhen you put something unsuitable in your microwave, like a china cup, it tends to crack. If you do the same with rock, it also cracks, so that when you come to crush it, it just crumbles. High-power magnetrons would be used to pre-treat rocks with microwaves in order to reduce the amount of energy required to crush them.\n\n\n\nFunding provided by the EPSRC, under its Pathways to Impact programme, will help Adrian Cross and his team to reach their goal. The award will be used to initialise a collaboration with e2v Technologies, a UK-based company already manufacturing and selling world-class magnetron technology. &quot;e2v is one of the companies in the UK that can exploit the technology that we are developing,&quot; explains Cross. &quot;We want to provide impact by working with e2v, who have the market to sell these high-power magnetrons worldwide.&quot;\n\n\n\nTwo members of the Strathclyde group are already working in tandem with e2v, thanks to the EPSRC's funding. The hope is that the collaboration will pool together the design expertise of the Cross group with the manufacturing capabilities of e2v to produce a truly world-leading high-power magnetron.\n.
