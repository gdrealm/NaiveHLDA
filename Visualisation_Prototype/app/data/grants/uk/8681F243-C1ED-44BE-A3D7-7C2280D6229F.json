Work packages one to three are for studies of conventional bolted connections for frames executed of pultruded FRP shapes that shall be fit for purpose when subjected to actions over the working life. Characterisation will therefore be required for both short and long-term (creep) loadings, which for building structures will be static. In work package one a comprehensive series of targeted physical tests will be conducted to characterise pin-bearing strengths; one objective being to find a test method that can be a standard for the determination of this key strength property. New test results will allow us to understand how this material design property changes with: the bolt diameter to material thickness ratio; the clearance hole size (including tolerance for hole drilling); the position of the pin relative to the centreline of the hole; the presence of bolt thread; hot/wet environmental conditioning. The physical tests in the second package will be to understand the behaviour of plate-to-plate bolted connections, corresponding to both those found in practice and permitted in universal design standards, such as in preparation. Specific questions to be addressed shall include the following. What is the strength reduction factor for the single-lap plate-to-plate configuration? What is the open hole stress concentration factor for by-pass load? What is the distribution of force between bolts in a multi-row connection? Can we have a design formula for the staggered bolt arrangement? By how much does viscoelasticity affect how the load is transferred between components and the connection fails? Many aspects of this structural engineering research are novel, and in work package three there are to be new studies for stiffnesses and strengths of bracing joints with eccentrically loaded members, and for frame joints subjected to tension action (for disproportionate collapse). For serviceability and ultimate designs, additional novel tests will be completed for the determination of the moment-rotation curves of beam-to-column, splice and column-to-base connections. The programme of research is planned to address the many gaps in knowledge that impede the opportunities for engineers to specify these eco-friendly, durable building components in projects for refurbishment and/or sustainable construction. The results will be evaluated and findings will be used to revise and/or modify the design guidance, which, in a code of practice, shall encourage wealth creation and innovation. Conventional bolted connection details for buildings are not always suitable for bridge engineering as the latter need to be slip (and fatigue) resistant. The fourth work package will be for a study to find and characterise a new method of connection that will give a structural performance (slip resistant) similar to what riveting offered the Victorian/Edwardian engineers in their execution of steel structures. The results of this study could, after follow-on development research, give us a transformative step-change leading to the execution of longer span structures with FRP components. Dissemination of the results and findings from an evaluation of the test series will have a major impact on structural engineering research and will assist a growing industry by way of the preparation of recognised design rules, such as to be found in the new-build parts to the future structural Eurocode for fibre reinforced polymer materials. Design standardisation for the structural material of FRP will provide the confidence for wealth creation and future innovation towards buildings and bridges that have an overall performance to satisfy the drivers for sustainability and a Green Economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H042628/1","grantId":"EP/H042628/1","fundValue":"445030","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To date the (extensive series of) test results for the resistances of bolted connections and joints of (pultruded) fibre reinforced polymer shapes has been used to inform: \nan American standards committee (with ASCE) preparing new standard Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) of Pultruded Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Structures (expected publication date is 2015);\nacademics on what we know and where additional testing is needed to address gaps in knowledge towards the community preparing reliable (safety critical) design guidelines for general civil engineering practice. \n\nOur promising test results on the performance of using resin injected bolts for a slip and fatigue resistant method of connection have given professional engineers the information to considered using this approach in FRP bridge engineering.

This standard is to be published (in 2015?) by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\nFurthermore our experimentally based research has given confidence for the slip and fatigue resistant method of connection that involves voiding in a (conventional) steel bolted connections being filled by injecting in a polymer resin that hardens. The test results from the series of tests in work packages 1 to 3 for the resistances of steel bolted connections for FRP shapes are going to be used by others (with myself) to inform the preparation of design procedures. With effective calibration the design formulae will be developed for introduction in recognised codes of practice. The UK government (BIS) is keen to support work that publishes design guidance to support client and other stakeholders aspirations to execute bridges of FRP materials, \n\nThe specific (preliminary) and very promising test results from work package 4 towards having knowledge on the performance of resin injected bolted connections for FRP material has the potential to be a practical method of joining in bridge engineering. No other method of connection can offer the level of slip and fatigue resistance that has been achieved because of this work. Construction","dataset":"gtr"}
