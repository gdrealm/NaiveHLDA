Despite this, our understanding of the role that cultural beliefs play in IPV perpetration is limited. \n\nMales in substance abuse treatment are more likely to be violent towards their female partners than non-substance abusers. Research suggests that 34-68% of men in substance abuse treatment have a history of IPV. Despite this, many perpetrator interventions do not address substance use, and therefore, reach far fewer individuals than substance abuse treatment programmes could. As a result, it has been argued that treatment for IPV should be integrated into substance abuse treatment. Currently, most substance abuse services lack the competencies to respond effectively to IPV. Few studies have examined IPV perpetration among substance abusers. None have examined cross-cultural issues. \n\nAims\nThis project will examine and compare the prevalence and cultural construction of IPV perpetration by males in substance abuse treatment in London and S&atilde;o Paulo. In addition, current policies, treatment protocols and care pathways for male substance abusing perpetrators in both countries will be reviewed, and key stakeholders interviewed to identify the barriers and facilitators to working with this client group. The research will inform the development of an evidence and theory based cross-cultural capacity framework for working effectively with male perpetrators in substance abuse treatment. An International Learning Alliance Steering Group of expert academics, practitioners and policy makers from England, Brazil, Spain and the US will be establishe at the initiation of the project; to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, research, best practice and policy, and to determine how alcohol and drug services can best respond to IPV perpetration. In addition, local Learning Alliance networks of service users and providers, policy makers and academics will be established in both London and S&atilde;o Paulo to develop cross-sector solutions to this complex problem, building on the knowledge transferred from this project into practice, thereby improving interventions for substance abusers who perpetrate IPV.\n\nPotential applications &amp; benefits \nThe major potential benefit of this project is the capacity framework, developed collaboratively and inter-disciplinarily by members participating in the International Learning Alliance Steering Group and the local Learning Alliance networks in London and S&atilde;o Paulo. The framework will consider how best to identify, assess and respond to intimate partner violence in substance abuse treatment and will clearly lay out the expected minimum standards for practice in working with perpetrators for the three levels of the substance abuse treatment workforce. \n\nThe mainstreaming of IPV perpetration interventions to substance abuse treatment will ensure that perpetrator interventions reach a wider number of perpetrators than the Criminal Justice or Domestic Violence programmes alone and may decrease substance use and violence and improve the family functioning as a whole. In addition, these local partnerships between the substance abuse and domestic violence sectors will foster collaborative and cross-agency working; and raise awareness of the need for integrated policy for both sectors. \n\nAnnually, IPV costs in the UK are estimated at &pound;36.7 billion. Potential benefits of this work include the reduction of IPV perpetration by male substance abusers that should lead to a reduction in the resulting financial burden.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002589/1","grantId":"ES/K002589/1","fundValue":"284892","fundStart":"2014-03-17","fundEnd":"2016-04-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research is still ongoing.

We found little integration in policy. Although drug strategy documents referred to the co-occurrence of substance misuse and domestic violence in families with complex needs, there was little attempt to encourage e.g. co-location of services for domestic violence perpetrators in substance use treatment services. In alcohol policy documents, there was a more explicit link made between alcohol misuse and domestic violence. Department of Health Guidance under the Labour government encouraged local alcohol commissioners to consider services for vulnerable alcohol users including those experiencing domestic violence. The Localism agenda (moving more decision making powers from central to local government) introduced by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat government in 2010 however changed the way that services for alcohol and drugs were commissioned and removed 'ring fenced', priority funding for alcohol and drug services. Policy for domestic violence has focused on safeguarding victims and prosecuting perpetrators. \nAn examination of protocols and assessment guides used by three treatment providers in initial assessments found few specific questions concerning domestic violence perpetration although there were questions about victimisation and about general violence (outside the family). Interviews with substance misuse professionals confirmed that domestic violence perpetration in substance misusers tends to be uncovered opportunistically in the course of key work unless victims and perpetrators are both using the same service. Other themes that emerged in these interviews concerned the normalising of violence in drug misusing relationships, that although by no means all drug misusing relationships are unequal, where both men and women are substance misusers there tends to be gendered patterns of control by male substance misusers over access to female partners' drugs and health care for example. There was a lack of knowledge on the part of staff from substance misuse services concerning available services and care pathways for perpetrators of domestic violence outside Criminal Justice System provision. Perpetrators were not considered particularly difficult to work with by staff but they suggested that there is a lack of awareness of services and lack of confidence on the part of many staff in substance misuse services regarding how to address domestic violence perpetration in the course of key working. \nPolicy makers interviewed were concerned that there is a lack of evidence of the prevalence and relationship between substance use and domestic violence. They agreed that there is a gap in provision for substance misusing perpetrators and emphasised the need for joint working arrangements and information sharing between substance misuse services and domestic violence agencies. Staff from substance misuse services were considered to be well placed to identify and address domestic violence perpetration but there was a concern that their focus on addressing drug and alcohol misuse must not be diluted and that staff in these services are already asked to identify and seek information from service users on a wide range of issues. \n\nRecruitment of male substance misusers for Phase 2 is currently underway in England and Phases 2-5 will be completed within timescale during the remaining period of the research grant. Of the 11 objectives in the original proposal, 6 have been achieved (see below). The remaining 5 objectives will be achieved by the end of the research grant. \n\n5. review and compare current strategies and policies in relation to IPV perpetration and substance abuse in England and Brazil.\n6. map and compare current referral and care pathways for substance abusers who perpetrate IPV in England and Brazil.\n7. examine and compare substance abuse treatment protocols and practice in relation to identification and treatment of IPV perpetration in England and Brazil.\n8. determine how professionals from substance abuse treatment in England and Brazil make decisions regarding the identification, care and referral of male substance abusers who perpetrate IPV and identify the barriers and facilitators to this process.\n9. elicit the experiences and opinions of policy makers in England and Brazil regarding how interventions should best be provided to reduce IPV perpetration among male substance abusers.\n11. develop an international and local Learning Alliance s to disseminate findings from the research to policy makers, practitioners and service users in England, Brazil, the US and Spain; and facilitate the translation of evidence into policy and practice.\n\nAs well as the research, International and local Learning Alliances have been established but these are described in the narrative impact section. The research will inform the development of an evidence and theory based cross-cultural Capacity Framework and training resource for working effectively with male IPV perpetrators in substance abuse treatment. International and local Learning Alliances of expert academics, practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users will be established at the initiation of the project; to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, determine how alcohol and drug services can best respond to IPV perpetration by male clients and enhance translation of findings to policy and practice in England, Brazil, Spain and the US.
