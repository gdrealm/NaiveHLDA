The production and analysis of very large amounts of data therefore play a central role in modern biology. These data are frequently organised around the concept of the genome, the set of all genes for each organism, so are said to be 'genome-scale'. One area of particular interest is the study of protein interactions, that is the various ways in which proteins (which make up the molecular machinery of the cell) are able to combine and communicate with one another. By understanding more about protein interactions and the biological networks that they support, researchers hope to explain many of the processes that keep cells alive. However, we only have a partial view of the complete set of protein interactions, even for a relatively simple organism such as yeast. It is known that almost all of the available data is biased towards reporting certain types of interactions, which may vary depending on the type of experiment used. Interactions drawn from small-scale experiments will often be biased towards well-studied proteins, leaving large parts of the genome untested. In addition, these experiments are not 100% accurate, so a certain amount of 'noise' enters the data in the form of incorrect or missing interactions. All of these factors together have a large impact on computational analyses of protein interaction networks, meaning that some features of the network might appear to be significantly different from those expected, when in reality they are not. Detecting, measuring and correcting for these errors and biases is therefore essential before we can produce reliable assessments of the properties of protein interaction networks and their implications for the function and evolution of biological systems. In this project, we will use statistical modeling to address these issues and produce software that can correct for the biases present in the data. Using this software, we will re-test many of the currently held ideas about protein interaction networks to see if they are still valid when bias is taken into account. To help other researchers make the best use of the available interaction data, we will also produce a web-driven service to provide a confidence score for each possible interaction and the probability that it has been tested correctly.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I002421/1","grantId":"BB/I002421/1","fundValue":"261965","fundStart":"2011-05-03","fundEnd":"2014-08-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Ascertainment biases affect data sources from many fields, in particular data collected from WWW participation.
