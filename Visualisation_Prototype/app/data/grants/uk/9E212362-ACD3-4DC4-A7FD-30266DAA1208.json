{"id":"9E212362-ACD3-4DC4-A7FD-30266DAA1208","title":"The cognitive and interactional causes of regularity in language","abstractText":"<p>The languages of the world are superficially rather different: they employ different sounds and build complex utterances in different ways. However, all languages seem to share a common set of structural properties. Where do these fundamental properties of language come from? One influential hypothesis suggests that they are a reflection of a highly-constraining blueprint for language, which children impose on language during learning. An alternative possibility is that these properties might be due to weaker biases in learners, which have a very small impact for a particular child learning a particular language, but have a strong effect as a result of the transmission of language over thousands of episodes of language learning.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This grant seeks to address both these hypotheses. One strand of research applies artificial language learning methods, where children and adults attempt to learn miniature languages, to test for differences between adults and child learners, and the extent to which single learners can re-shape a language. A second strand features experiments where adult participants learn, transmit and interact using artificial languages, to simulate the transmission and use of language in a population and its consequences for linguistic structure.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K006339/1","grantId":"ES/K006339/1","fundValue":"449901","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kenny  Smith","coPersons":["Elizabeth Anne Wonnacott"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" This is an ongoing grant exploring how language learners respond to variable linguistic input.
