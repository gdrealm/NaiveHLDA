Medicines targeted at GPCRs are used very widely. Although the U.K. public are, in general, less well informed than their American counterparts, there is widespread recognition of the Product names of many of these medicines including a variety of anti-histaminergics and anti-hypertensive drugs. Dissemination of information produced from these studies will concentrate on traditional routes such as publication of articles in peer-reviewed Journals and the presentation of talks to informed audiences. I have published more than 350 articles and give some 15-20 lectures furth of Glasgow each year. However, I also plan to present public lectures related to my work to groups, including school children and junior undergraduate students to extend their knowledge base. The Glasgow Science centre and the outreach programmes of Glasgow University offer excellent opportunities to enhance public understanding of science. I have also previously been involved with presentations at the Edinburgh Science Festival and my position as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh offers further opportunities as this is a central remit of the Society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9811527","grantId":"G9811527","fundValue":"1638140","fundStart":"1999-07-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Graeme  Milligan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
