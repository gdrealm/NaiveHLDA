Thus the overarching aim of this series is to address this inattention. We aim to generate a theorised direction for global citizenship as a graduate attribute and an underpinning pedagogic direction for its encouragement. We anticipate that these directions will be sufficiently expansive to grapple with the dynamic and complex interrelationship between social differences and commonalities among humans.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0888","grantId":"RES-451-26-0888","fundValue":"16533","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Glynis  Cousin","coPersons":["Douglas  Bourn","Joelle  Fanghanel","Elizabeth Margaret Grant","Silvia  Sovic"],"organisation":"University of Wolverhampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
