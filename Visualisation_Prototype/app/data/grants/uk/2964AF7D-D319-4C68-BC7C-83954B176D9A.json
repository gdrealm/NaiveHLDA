These include insect's faunas from large-scale excavations dating from the Roman, Saxon and late medieval periods. The insect faunas provide a valuable insight into living conditions, urbanisation and the economic development of London as it rose to be a major European centre of commerce and trade. Both descriptive and multivariate statistics will be used to present and analyse patterns within the substantial dataset (approximately 40,000 individual identifications).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113058/1","grantId":"113058/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2006-05-08","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
