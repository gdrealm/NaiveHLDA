Our results have attracted the attention of several major international healthcare manufacturers who see the potential of laser-patterning of porous materials like paper for their future product range and who want to work with us to further develop this technology. We are submitting this follow-on proposal to (1) develop a laboratory-standard process for laser-based paper-patterning for fluidic devices, (2) use our technology in trials for a point-of-care diagnostics demonstrator sensor that allows detection of specific diseases such as tuberculosis, as well as dramatically reducing detection limits, (3) extend the technique to incorporate methodologies for fluid delay, multiplexing, and patterning of 3-D devices, and (4) explore applications beyond planar devices in paper, including 'Light-Up Paper' and functionalised fabrics for 'Smart Plasters'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N004388/1","grantId":"EP/N004388/1","fundValue":"586822","fundStart":"2015-10-07","fundEnd":"2018-10-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert William Eason","coPersons":["Paul T Elkington","Anthony  Williams"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
