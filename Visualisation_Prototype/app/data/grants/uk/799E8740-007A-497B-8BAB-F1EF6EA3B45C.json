This collaboration aims to transform Education Scotland's material for teachers and learners on a pivotal period of Scottish History, between Edward I of England's conquest of Scotland in 1296 and Robert Bruce's victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Over 90 % of schoolchildren in Scotland study this topic by age 15. \n\nEducation Scotland is keen to develop an approach that will advance the reform of the curriculum introduced in Scotland in 2010. Flexibility is at the heart of this reform, allowing teachers to choose material that is most relevant to the learners in their care. The full potential of this new approach can only be achieved by providing appropriate resources across all levels of schooling. Nothing like this is currently available for the Scottish War of Independence. \n\nEducation Scotland has recognised that the 'People of Medieval Scotland' database (www.poms.ac.uk), a major outcome of a recent AHRC-funded project (see below), has the potential to be used to create resources on a sufficient scale to transform the teaching of the Scottish War of Independence from early years to age 15. As a result, learners and teachers across the country will be able to view the topic through a range of perspectives, rather than being restricted to the well worn narrative of Wallace and Bruce and their battles. The aim is to give learners and teachers access to information on scores of individuals or groups during the War. This will allow them to explore the War through their own local perspective, and to approach the War through the varied experiences of individuals and groups from different walks of life. In this way, the Follow-On project will bring new insights and tools from the research of the 'People of Medieval Scotland' (PoMS) database into the classroom. \n\nThis can only be achieved through the collaboration of researchers and teachers. The aim is that the Research Associate, supported by the Research Administrator, will provide a mass of source-based material that can then by adapted for the classroom on the basis of feedback from teachers in Review Days. Teachers will then use this material in Workshops to create 'learning journeys' for all levels up to age 15. 'Learning journeys' are broader and more flexible than lesson plans. They provide questions and prompts that enable learners to explore a body of material in a way that is appropriate for their particular level. This leaves enough flexibility for the teacher to decide how best to deploy the resource in their own classroom. The learning journeys and accompanying source-based material will be accessed by learners and teachers on Education Scotland's free intranet for schools ('GLOW').\n\nThe project culminates in the creation of a Professional Learning Community of teachers on GLOW committed to sustaining and developing this material in the classroom.\n\nThe immediate beneficiaries of the project are learners and teachers, who will have a wideranging and flexible body of material designed specifically for their use, and based on innovative research of proven quality. Education Scotland will also benefit from having a resource that demonstrates the full potential of the reformed curriculum to meet the needs and interests of individual schools and localities. \n\nIn the longer term the project has the potential to challenge the cultural hegemony of the simple approach to the Scottish War of Independence typified by 'Braveheart'. By offering a broader understanding of the varied experience of this pivotal period of Scottish history to 90% of schoolchildren, the project has the potential to reduce the impact of the cruder views of the War of Independence, and change the nature of the War's significance for Scots in the longer term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L00450X/1","grantId":"AH/L00450X/1","fundValue":"64028","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The 32 resources and 14 learning journeys have been enthusiastically received in all local authorities in which CPD sessions were held, and by Education Scotland.

This was accompanied by the development of an approach to History itself as a discipline which placed centre stage the recreation of the past in the present through gaining an intimate experience of what is intrinsically remote.\n\n\n\nThe project outcomes--the thirty-two themed resources (with supporting materials) and fourteen learning journeys--represent a significant increase in original bespoke material for Broad General Education in the interdisciplinary context of Curriculum for Excellence, This has been welcomed enthusiastically by teachers in CPD sessions, and has led to collaborations with the intranet for teachers (GLOW) and a network of teachers engaging with the project's outcomes.
