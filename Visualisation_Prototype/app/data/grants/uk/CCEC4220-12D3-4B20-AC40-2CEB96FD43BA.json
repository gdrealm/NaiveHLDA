Population level declines in wildlife have resulted from exposure to pharmaceuticals (e.g. diclofenac in vultures in Asia). Furthermore, some reproductive disorders associated in humans are now a major health issue and parallel those effects seen in wildlife that have been associated with exposure to environmental chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. The UK holds a strong lead in the field of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment and the applicants have contributed to the unfolding explanation of how some such contaminants interfere with normal reproductive activity in fish. . Information on interactive effects of inbreeding and pollutant exposure is extremely limited and essentially nothing is known for pharmaceuticals, which is surprising given that inbred strains of animals are used most commonly for laboratory testing of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. This project will provide an understanding of the vulnerability or resistance of inbred populations of fish for exposure to the pharmaceutical,ketoconazole (a synthetic antifungal drug employed as an agricultural pesticides and clinically to prevent and treat skin and fungal infections), as a representative of a group of widely used group of fungicides. The use of genome-wide approaches (gene arrays) will enable us to dissect out gene expression networks most intimately associated with physiological stress for exposure to this pharmaceutical. The data from the project will further provide insights into the critical determinants of vulnerability of fish to a pharmaceutical of importance to human health. The data on the comparative responses to ketoconazole in inbred and outbred populations and impacts on breeding dynamics will also be highly informative for ecological and environmental risk assessment. This proposal will thus provide new information on gene-environment interactions for chemical exposure effects in fish. The project is also likely to deliver a more informative set of biological (molecular) effects tools upon which to base environmental impact and health assessments for ketoconazole and other allied fungicides. This work will provide substantive information on the health impacts of ketoconazole in the natural environment for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity and will contribute more widely to environmental impact assessments and will thus be of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public. A key element of the project is an enhancement in the partnership between academia (University of Exeter) and an end-user (Astrazeneca). This partnership will facilitate the uptake of genetic and genomic methods for chemical hazard identification (and developed through NERC funded science) into the pharmaceutical industry. It will further facilitate an enhanced understanding in academia of the practical research needs of the chemical/pharmaceutical industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F007787/1","grantId":"NE/F007787/1","fundValue":"65088","fundStart":"2008-02-11","fundEnd":"2009-08-10","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  A major impact of this research project was the knowledge transfer to Industry (AstraZeneca) from\nExeter on the use and application of a wide range of molecular tools and techniques, including \nDNA extraction techniques, q RT-PCR, and DNA microsatellites for their application in (eco)toxicology. \nEqually from this partnership Exeter gained an enhanced understanding of end user needs for the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, and access to world class chemical exposure and analysis facilities.\n\nExchanges of researchers (Ross Brown and Lisa Bickley) provided the main conduit for transfer \nof information between the collaborating laboratories.

Please explain for a non-specialist audience.\n\nWe undertook to collect zebrafish from wild populations in Bangladesh to investigate whether their responses to chemical challenge were comparable with zebrafish that have been maintained in the laboratory for many generations (and were inbred) that are used widely for standardised OECD tests. \n\nThe studies n included making assessment on the interactive effects of the fish genetics (inbred versus outbred lines of zebrafish) and an endocrine disrupting chemical (clotrimazole) on sexual development and breeding. Clotrimazole affects an enzyme called aromatase that is involved with the conversion of testosterone to oestrogen and is thus fundamental in the process of sexual differentiation in fish (reinforcing the feminised phenotype).\n\nWe show that there were differences in responses (sensitivity for effect) when considering the genetics of the zebrafish for chemical exposure and this has implications when considering the use of zebrafish lines in standardised regulatory chemical testing. Furthermore, the research identified that the timings differ for gonadal sexual differentiation for inbred versus outbred zebrafish with direct implications for use of an established OECD test guideline - where gonadal sex is a key endpoint for chemical effects assessments. The research undertaken highlights the need to better reporting on the genetics of fish strains/lines used for chemical testing (and indeed research more generally) that would more accurate comparisons for research findings between different laboratories adopting different fish strains/lines. \n\nThe research undertaken in this project has been disseminated widely through conferences and workshops to relevant stakeholders and been featured in three full primary data research papers: \n\nBrown AR, Bickley LK, Le Page G, Hosken D, Paull,GC , Hamilton PB, Owen SF, Robinson,J., Sharpe AD and Tyler CR* (2011).
