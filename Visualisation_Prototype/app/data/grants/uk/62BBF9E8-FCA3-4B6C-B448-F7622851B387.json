The Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering will draw lessons from nature to engineer innovative solutions to our grand challenges in energy, water, materials, health, and living space. \n\nRather than imitating nature out of context or succumbing to superficial analogies, research at the Centre will take a decidedly scientific approach to uncover fundamental mechanisms underlying desirable traits, and apply these mechanisms to design and synthesise artificial systems that hereby borrow the traits of the natural model. The Centre will initially focus on three key mechanisms, as they are so prevalent in nature, amenable to practical implementation, and are expected to have transformational impact on urgent issues in sustainability and scalable manufacturing. These mechanisms are: (T1) &quot;Hierarchical Transport Networks&quot;: the way nature bridges microscopic to macroscopic length scales in order to preserve the intricate microscopic or cellular function throughout (as in trees, lungs and the circulatory system); (T2) &quot;Force Balancing&quot;: the balanced use of fundamental forces, e.g., electrostatic attraction/repulsion and geometrical confinement in microscopic spaces (as in protein channels in cell membranes, which trump artificial membranes in selective, high-permeation separation performance); and (T3) &quot;Dynamic Self-Organisation&quot;: the creation of robust, adaptive and self-healing communities thanks to collective cooperation and emergence of complex structures out of much simpler individual components (as in bacterial communities and in biochemical cycles). \n\nSuch nature-inspired, rather than narrowly biomimetic approach, allows us to marry advanced manufacturing capabilities and access to non-physiological conditions, with nature's versatile mechanisms that have been remarkably little employed in a rational, bespoke manner. High-performance computing and experimentation now allow us to unravel fundamental mechanisms, from the atomic to the macroscopic, in an unprecedented way, providing the required information to transcend empiricism, and guide practical realisations of nature-inspired designs. \n\nIn first instance, three examples will be developed to validate each of the aforementioned natural mechanisms, and simultaneously apply them to problems of immediate relevance that tie in to the Grand Challenges in energy, water, materials and scalable manufacturing. These are: (1) robust, high-performance fuel cells with greatly reduced amount of precious catalyst, by using a lung-inspired architecture; (2) membranes for water desalination inspired by the mechanism of biological cell membranes; (3) high-performance functional materials, resp. architectural design (cities, buildings), informed by agent-based modelling on bacteria-inspired, resp. human communities, to identify roads to robust, adaptive complex systems.\n\nTo meet these ambitious goals, the Centre assembles an interdisciplinary team of experts, from chemical and biochemical engineering, to computer science, architecture, materials, chemistry and genetics. The Centre researchers collaborate with, and seek advice from industrial partners from a wide range of industries, which accelerates practical implementation. The Centre has an open, outward looking mentality, inviting broader collaboration beyond the core at UCL. It will devote significant resources to explore the use of the validated nature-inspired mechanisms to other applications, and extend investigation to other natural mechanisms that may inform solutions to problems in sustainability and scalable manufacturing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K038656/1","grantId":"EP/K038656/1","fundValue":"4980770","fundStart":"2013-11-29","fundEnd":"2018-11-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We are completing the 1st year only and still to generate findings that may be used.

In this respect the Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering (CNIE) is working towards the original objectives:\nO1) To establish a sustainable world-leading Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering at UCL, which is open and welcoming broader participation in the UK and internationally.\nO2) To concentrate interdisciplinary effort and expertise, state-of-the-art laboratories and technical facilities, at UCL and beyond, to generate world-class research addressing timely challenges related to resource efficiency (energy, water, materials), the environment, and manufacturing.\nO3) To validate the nature-inspired engineering methodology as a platform via Flagship Projects in each of the Centre's\nThemes (T1)-(T3), to a level that would allow for further development in a more applied, industrial context.\nO4) To engage and foster the use of the validated engineering methodology, and expand it via sandpits, workshops and exploratory projects to new applications and areas, which will be researched through internal and external collaborations.\nO5) To provide a pathway for translating research findings into practice, in particular through engagement with industry. The Centre will become a national hub, an enabler, with a unique platform approach to innovation. It will stimulate many areas of critical, national importance, in particular in the focus areas of sustainable manufacturing and resource efficiency. This is underscored by letters of support from over a dozen industries (Maxeler, Shell, Johnson Matthey, AFC Energy, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Harris, Aedas, Sabic, Synfuels China, Antecy/BIOeCON, Air Products/MATGAS, GE,\nPSRI, ExxonMobil, and Quantachrome). More than half of these are based in the UK, or have very significant commercial,\nmanufacturing and/or activity in the UK. There is a balance of SMEs and multinationals, start-ups and companies with a long history.\nSenior technical representatives from these companies serve on the Centre's Advisory Group, and are involved in\nworkshops, sandpits and annual show and tell vents. Companies will share expertise and resources. \nThere will be joint UCL Impact; studentships (co-funded by industry and UCL), as well as internships and secondments. This boosts the success and practical relevance of the projects, and opens roads to implementation and commercialisation. This mechanism also trains researchers to be future leaders.\n\nUCL Business will facilitate the generation and exploitation of intellectual property, and has ample experience in doing so.\nAn example is the Electrochemical Innovation Lab, headed by co-I Dan Brett, and established in 2011 to identify commercial opportunities early in the development cycle and accelerate progression through Technology Readiness Levels, via targeted research programmes. This already led to two spin-outs this year.
