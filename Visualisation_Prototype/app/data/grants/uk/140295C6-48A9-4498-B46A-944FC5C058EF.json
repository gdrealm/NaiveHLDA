UV-B induces physiological responses in plants, including changes in morphology and development and the regulation of various genes involved in secondary metabolism, chloroplast function and protection of the plant from damage by UV-B. Remarkably very little is known about how UV-B is perceived by plants and how it initiates responses. However, the first component involved in these processes has recently been identified, a protein called UVR8. The aim of this project is to characterise the UVR8 pathway, its interaction with other photoregulatory pathways and components, to understand how UV-B regulates UVR8 and to determine how UVR8 regulates transcription of target genes. Establishing how UVR8 is regulated and how it functions to control gene expresion will help us to understand how UV-B regulates aspects of plant growth and development and how plants survive in sunlight.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D019281/1","grantId":"BB/D019281/1","fundValue":"385272","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth Islwyn  Jenkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
