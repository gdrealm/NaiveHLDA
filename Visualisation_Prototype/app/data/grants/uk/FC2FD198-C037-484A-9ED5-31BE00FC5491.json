{"id":"FC2FD198-C037-484A-9ED5-31BE00FC5491","title":"Control For Energy and Sustainability","abstractText":"Control engineering is concerned with the design of control systems (controllers) that can improve the performance of all dynamic processes. Relevant examples include the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from internal combustion engines and power plant, the reduction of pollutants generated by chemical plants, and improvements in a power system's ability to respond to random load and/or supply variations. New technologies for clean electricity generation, fuel efficient transport, and environmentally friendly waste disposal will all depend on a new generation of special-purpose control systems. Current research trends in control engineering, which address complexity and uncertainty, have a great, and as yet unrealised potential to contribute to these technologies.The aim of this research programme is to develop new control engineering techniques which can be applied to a number of energy and sustainability related problems in order to achieve significantadvances in the exploitation of renewable energy and vehicle fuel efficiency. The clean energy aspect of the programme will address major challenges arising from distributed renewable generation, taking account of the integration of wind power into a network, transmission, local network control, and random intermittency of supply. In transport, our goals are to develop new technologies for a future generation of fuel efficient road vehicles (focusing attention on engine management, and aerodynamic and vehicle design optimisation) and to devise new air traffic management schemes to reduce fuel consumption of aircraft resulting from air traffic congestion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G066477/1","grantId":"EP/G066477/1","fundValue":"5536490","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research from this portfolio grant has advanced basic understanding of control engineering, extended applications of control engineering in the energy and transportation sectors, promoted public understanding of the field and resulted in stronger links between universities and industry Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment,Transport Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Richard B Vinter","coPersons":["David  Limebeer","Goran  Strbac","Glenn  Vinnicombe","Jan  Maciejowski","Bikash  Pal","Alessandro  Astolfi","David Quinn  Mayne","Malcolm Clive  Smith","Jorge  Goncalves","Keith  Glover","Timothy  Green"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" Grant established a world class research activity in the UK, developing new control engineering techniques and applying them to improve energy efficiency in electricity production and transportation, at a time of intense concern over the consequences of excessive energy use and emissions on global warming.\n\nIt opened up areas of control theory to address problems of energy efficiency, beyond the reach of currently available techniques. These include new methodologies for stochastic decision making, forecasting, nonlinear control, decentralized control, control based on concepts of 'passivity' or energy dissipation, etc., that accommodate the special model structures and design constraints arising in technologies promoting energy efficiency.\n\nIt provided new methodologies based on stochastic modelling, for designing and operating power systems including renewable power sources, and for quantifying risks of failure.\n\nIt provided new techniques of decentralised control for power systems, inspired by TCP algorithms for information flow on the internet.\n\nIt provided substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of waste recycling schemes, based on application of new theories of adaptive nonlinear control.\n\nIt achieved substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of internal combustion engines, through the use of state-of-the-art hybrid control techniques for engine management.\n\nProvided control techniques to Alleviate of air traffic congestion through improved air traffic management schemes.\n\nIt achieved significant improvements in energy efficiency of road vehicles through design and novel control-based suspension and steering components.\n\nIt provided training of technical staff and building the skills base in areas of technology relating to green energy production and energy efficiency.
