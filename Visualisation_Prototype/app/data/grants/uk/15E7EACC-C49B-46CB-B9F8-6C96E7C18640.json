{"id":"15E7EACC-C49B-46CB-B9F8-6C96E7C18640","title":"The Films of the Amber Collective (1968 to the present): A Critical History","abstractText":"The proposed research project represents the first comprehensive, critical assessment of the cinematic work of the Amber collective, an independent film group that has been based in the North East of England since the late 1960s. This project will locate their films within the context of British cinema, more specifically the realist tradition and the independent workshop movement, and will also pay attention to their national and international reception.\\n\\nAmber was founded in 1968 by a group of London-based students, who sought to document the working-class communities of Tyneside. They were drawn in particular to Newcastle, a city that was characterised by a rich industrial past but also rapid economic and social decline. Amber's arrival coincided with the rise of the regional 'workshop' movement, of which the collective would become a key player. But whilst other independent groups tend to remain only as footnotes in traditional histories of British film-making, Amber remains very much part of the cultural landscape. Over the last forty or so years they have been producing a body of highly regarded, if relatively unknown work, encompassing documentary portraits, community projects, feature films and photographic exhibitions. \\n\\nSuch is the importance of Amber, it seems somewhat surprising that their work has been sidelined in almost all histories of British cinema and television. In order to redress this imbalance, this study will interrogate and contextualise their diverse work. A critical history of Amber to be published as a monograph thus seeks to situate their films within national and international filmmaking traditions and to delineate continuity and change within their oeuvre. Special attention will be paid to Amber's alternative film-making practices, the reception of their films locally, nationally and internationally, their relationship with television and new digital media and their own critical assessment of their work. \\n\\nWe will also be editing a special edition of the peer-reviewed journal Visual Culture in Britain on the subject of Amber and independent film culture. The intention is to help generate a body of original, inter-disciplinary research that broadens an understanding of Amber's work. We will consider other appropriate means for the dissemination of our research, such as the contribution of material to online database (for example Screenonline and the British Universities Newsreel Database). We will also target a popular newspaper/ journal with a broad readership such as Sight and Sound with an article relating to the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H008217/1","grantId":"AH/H008217/1","fundValue":"63742","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This grant application did not incorporate an impact plan/strategy, and was conceived as a contribution to scholarship, with primarily academic beneficiaries.

","person":"James Edward LeggottTobias  Hochscherf","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":" The main purpose of this grant was to support the research and writing of a scholarly monograph on the subject of the films of the Amber Collective. At the time of writing, this book is almost completed, with a plan for publication in 2015 (possibly 2016 depending on publisher's schedules).\n\nThe monograph was conceived as an intervention with scholarship on British visual cultures, not only offering the first in-depth academic analysis of a film-making group with a distinctive body of work, but enriching an understanding of how a regional-based film-making practice can be placed in both a national and international context. The book combines analysis of individual Amber films and projects with a consideration of their social, political and cultural relevance and influence. My main finding, as anticipated, is that Amber's body of work has a great significance within the history of British film and television culture. Amber's work is simultaneously an archive and record of post-industrial change in north-east England, and an intervention within debates on the most appropriate strategies for representing local communities, landscapes and people. The research represented by the published monograph may encourage further scholarly engagement with the subject of British film and television history and culture. It suggests possibilities for new engagements with non-canonical film-making activities, as well as histories of experimental or &quot;realist&quot; practices. It also emphasises the contribution of &quot;regional&quot; film-makers and subject matter to British visual culture, and the significance of models of creativity that challenge the traditional valorisation of the director or writer as sole author.\n\nThe research may also have relevance for a non-scholarly constituency, such as readers with a general interest in Amber or their cultural and political significance. The work of this project also has a relevance for those with an interest or stake in discussions around post-industrialisation, heritage, archives and cultural regeneration.
