We have identified a negative genetic correlation for fitness in the vicinity of the TYRP1 gene underlying a coat colour polymorphism in Soay sheep. We propose to characterise sequence diversity and patterns of linkage disequilibrium in an ~600 Kbp region flanking TYRP1 in order to dissect the molecular basis of the genetic correlation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F001371/1","grantId":"NE/F001371/1","fundValue":"31306","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2009-04-06","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  In scientific publications, on scientfiic blogs, in outreach events (e.g. school visits and open days) and in annual reports on the St Kilda Sheep Project (which are distributed to stakeholders).

The results and methodology will be useful for scientists interested in hybridisation, introgression and admixture.
