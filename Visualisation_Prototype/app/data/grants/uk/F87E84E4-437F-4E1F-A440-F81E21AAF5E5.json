The archaeological evidence for this crucial period is exceedingly sparse and poorly dated. The dramatic climate and environmental changes that occurred during this period were likely to be critical influences, but in the absence of reliable dating methods it is difficult to link the patchy human record with existing continuous global climate records, or regional records where they exist. The picture has begun to change with the development of new dating methods and accumulating evidence for the early occurrence of modern behaviours, such as marine resource exploitation and the appearance of decorated or decorative objects in several sites. The latter include indications that ostrich eggs were used as containers and as decorative beads. However, at present none of these artefacts can be dated directly and precisely. One method that can be used to date shells and eggshells directly is amino acid racemization (AAR) geochronology, which measures the decay of proteins. Because the decay rate is driven by time and temperature, the relative age can be deduced by comparison with other samples. Determination of an absolute date is more challenging. In order to provide a robust and precise age estimate, the mechanisms that drive the decay reaction must be understood. We have been developing a refinement of amino acid geochronology, called 'Intra-crystalline Protein Decomposition' (IcPD), isolating and analysing only the protein from a particular fraction of shells, where the proteins have been trapped within the shell crystals. This effectively forms a protein 'time capsule', within which changing concentrations of the products and reactants of protein decay should enable us to pick apart the reaction pathways. In the past we have been limited by crude measurements of decay, but technological advances, notably in mass spectrometry, now enable us to observe both products and reactants in considerable detail. We plan to explore the reaction pathways in ostrich eggshell fragments, the ultimate 'egg-timer'. Preliminary results reveal the first evidence of a decay pathway in the main protein entrapped in ancient shell, called struthiocalcin. The protein first appears to split into three pieces and each piece is 'nibbled away' from one end. By using a combination of model systems (synthetic peptides, heated shells and shell proteins) and shell fragments recovered from the stratified and well-dated archaeological sequence in Elands Bay Cave, South Africa, we can explore how this initial pattern develops. Once a more complete picture of decay is understood, we will put together a model of the decay path (which identifies the temperature sensitivity of key reactions). We will then apply this model to estimate the age of eggshell fragments found in a rich archaeological sequence at Pinnacle Point, South Africa, to refine the chronological framework of these early modern human sites. But the ostrich eggshells are more than just egg-timers - if we look at the isotopic composition of the eggshells, this also reveals information about climate and environment. Thus we can establish a robust, directly dated record of changes in vegetation and importantly, in aridity, for the region. This data can be linked to longer climate records to build up a more complete picture of the relationships between changing human behaviour and changing environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G004625/1","grantId":"NE/G004625/1","fundValue":"414508","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our work has formed the basis for several public outreach events, from schoolchildren to the general public, informing on how analytical chemistry can be used to understand our human and Earth's history.

This has resulted in improved accuracy for amino acid dating, and a better understanding of protein breakdown in general, which has implications for medical studies.\n\nWe have provided the first experimental evidence for in-chain racemisation of serine, through the unique application of soft-ionisation mass spectrometry and chiral amino acid analysis.\n\nWe have established the difficulties of using high temperature experiments to simulate diagenesis in the laboratory, and published recommendations for their qualified use.\n\nWe have developed a way to identify &amp;quot;burnt&amp;quot; material (relatively common in the archaeological cave sites in question), which allows us to exclude these samples and therefore increases the accuracy of the dating technique.\n\nAAR has been shown to successfully provide age information for the ostrich eggshell from the archaeological sites of Elands Bay Cave and the Pinnacle Point early modern human sites from South Africa.\n\nWe have analysed the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition from the directly-dated ostrich eggshell samples from these sites to provide a chronologically robust climate sequence.\n\nWe also instigated an international inter-lab proficiency test, involving the world's active AAR dating labs. The accuracy of amino acid dating on ostrich eggshell will allow it to be used routinely for dating Palaeolithic sites in South Africa. This dating work could also be extended to other parts of the world where eggshell is abundant.\n\nDeveloping isotopically-based climate / environmental records on directly-dated material is likely to be of great interest to palaeoclimatologists and Quaternary scientists.\n\nThe detailed work on protein breakdown mechanisms is of interest not only to the amino acid geochronology community, but also to medical researchers, as the nonenzymatic (chemical) modification of protein-bound L-Ser to D-Ser has been found to play a role in the aging of &quot;long-lived&quot; proteins in cartilage, brain, dentine and eye lens, and has been correlated to aging and pathophysiological processes, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe inter-lab proficiency test lays the groundwork for a more detailed full-scale collaborative trial, which will put the international AAR community in a position where they are able to directly compare results between labs.
