Expertise in India is restricted to certain veterinary personnel and a number of zoological research centres and the community is extremely fragmented. We have arranged to run a yearly update meeting via funding in India as part of their BTV network of laboratories. This will ensure integration of entomology with the primary source of virological data and build capacity in this area. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
