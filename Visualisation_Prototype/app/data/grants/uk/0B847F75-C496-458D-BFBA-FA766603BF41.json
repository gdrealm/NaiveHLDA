Persistently narrowed blood vessels limits the flow of blood to important organs like the kidney, heart or brain and at the same time puts a strain on the heart. Potassium channels produced by the KCNQ family of genes are proteins that provide a pathway to allow potassium ions out of the cell and in doing so reduce the likelihood of muscle cells in the wall of blood vessels from contracting. This in turn improves the ease at which blood flows through blood vessels. Recently the applicant's group showed that these channels contribute to physiological dilators of blood vessels such as adrenaline but they become less effective in high blood pressure. \n\nAims:The proposed work will study proteins encoded by KCNQ genes in the arteries serving the kidney and brain in rats that have normal blood pressure and ones with high blood pressure. It will also do the same comparison in abdominal arteries from patients undergoing routine surgery who have normal or high blood pressure. The project will identify how these specific protein pores are opened by chemicals found in our blood to keep blood vessels open and to understand how they may become less effective in disease. \n\nBenefits: Understanding how a blood vessel can be kept open is crucial for developing new treatments for when these processes go wrong. The proposed body of work will provide fundamental information on how KCNQ proteins stop blood vessels from becoming overly constricted and the factors that cause these proteins to have less functional impact in disease conditions. As such it will provide new lines of therapeutic treatment as well as enhancing our basic understanding of blood vessel control and disease mechanisms .","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K019074/1","grantId":"MR/K019074/1","fundValue":"584050","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Iain  Greenwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
