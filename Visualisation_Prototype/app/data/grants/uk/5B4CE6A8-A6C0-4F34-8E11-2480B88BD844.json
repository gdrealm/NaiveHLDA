MicroLab Devices (MLD), Forsite Diagnostics (FD) and UoL have combined their technology to develop\nan innovative point-of-care (POC) diagnostic system combining microfluidic and lateral flow technology to provide a\ndisposable, zero energy platform for measuring this combination of sepsis markers. The project will refine the POC system\nfor the introduction of raw saliva or blood samples directly into the system and validate the device using clinical samples to\ncreate a diagnostic algorithm to guide decision making. The innovation lies in the novel combination of biomarkers AND the\ncombined platform technologies that provide a new diagnostic system to allow the detection of sepsis rapidly and cheaply.\nThe test has the potential to reduce delays in diagnosis and unnecessary admissions to hospital and the platform has the\npotential to impact across the whole POC market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K503630/1","grantId":"EP/K503630/1","fundValue":"158621","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Enitan  Carrol","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
