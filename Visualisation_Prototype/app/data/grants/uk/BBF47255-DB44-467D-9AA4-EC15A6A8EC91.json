There is however, a disconnect between human activities and impact in energy and carbon externality. By monitoring energy use for a specific human activity, Ubicomp technologies may help us uncover this hidden impact. Our aim is to bring Computer Science, Economics, Carbon Profiling and Sociology together to explore the feasibility of identifying and informing people of 'critical moments in their daily activities that have carbon impact', so they can individually and collectively make savings. We will work with an actual community using a novel set of technological and cultural probes, involving embedded sensors, smartphone applications, aggregated 'crowdsourced' data and ethnographic field work, to deliver a richer understanding of behaviour that leads to lower carbon lifestyles, backed up by experimental data showing the impact of our intervention feeding this back to end-users. Our software, high level results, algorithms and models will be placed into the public domain and communicated through our programme of engagement, such as developing teaching materials with local schools.Our hypothesis is people are unaware of their direct and indirect energy usage and its associated climate change impact: this is a barrier to understanding how to achieve 'low carbon living' personally, as communities. During a 2 year feasibility study our objectives are to:1. Gather baseline data about energy use and associated carbon footprint that is personally attributable;2. Develop real-time models of financial and environmental tradeoffs for identifing opportunities for savings;3. Communicate opportunities for making savings back to individuals, enabling greater awareness and making it easy to chart the effect of household 'energy related experiments';4. Provide methods for comparing the usage against others in one's social network i) as an incentive, and ii) to raise awareness of low cost opportunities for collective action (such as ride-sharing);5. Create online resources and teaching materials to communicate our findings to a wider population beyond the study group.We have established links with Galloway Carbon Action Project (a community of 2,800) homes who have pledged us support and access to the three communities involved. This is a perfect complement for gathering real world data and findings from end-users and for communicating our findings and having a significant real-world impact. We also have links with local schools who are prepared to help us develop teaching materials, to help us communicate the key lessons to local communities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I00033X/1","grantId":"EP/I00033X/1","fundValue":"371245","fundStart":"2011-01-18","fundEnd":"2013-07-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings from this work has been used by the students union to help influence student behaviour (to reduce carbon footprint).

We offer detailed accounts of how energy use links to everyday life, and design insights at a range of low- and high tech levels intended to help reshape and reduce the impact of the practices we observe. These studies can inform future sustainability research, and the design of new technologies aimed at encouraging To help design more efficient appliances for the home; design cooking facilities that encourage more sustainable cooking; new heating controllers to encourage adaptive (non-setpoint) heating; for institutional settings looking to stimulate lower energy or more sustainable behaviours.
