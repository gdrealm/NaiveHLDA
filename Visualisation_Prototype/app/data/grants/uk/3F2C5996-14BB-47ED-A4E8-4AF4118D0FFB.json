{"id":"3F2C5996-14BB-47ED-A4E8-4AF4118D0FFB","title":"UK Dementias Platform","abstractText":"The UK Dementias Platform (UKDP) is a radically new approach to dementias research, bringing together data from around 2,000,000 study participants from 22 cohorts to try and discover the causes of dementia and to find out ways of slowing it down. The platform has been funded to the level of &pound;4.5M and invited to apply for a further &pound;7.5M. \n\nTo achieve our goals of discovering the causes of dementia and finding out ways to slow it down, we will analyse data collected over many decades from throughout the UK to identify targets for drugs studies. \n\nWe will also enrich strategically selected cohorts to provide resources for dementias research in general. This will involve finding out how the early dementia processes begin, how our genes affect our risk of dementia and where our body goes wrong in maintaining and repairing itself. \n\nThere are many practical challenges involved in doing this work including knowing how to assess dementia in large studies where having everyone examined by a doctor would be prohibitively expensive. Another challenge is how to measure cognitive decline in the population as when people begin to decline they are frequently less motivated to do cognitive tests.\n\nThere are also important ethical issues surrounding this work and we have specific projects looking at ethical legal and social issues surrounding taking part in detailed measurement studies as well as in considering brain donation.\n\nTo help make an impact as soon as possible, we will work closely with industry partners who are best placed to turn basic scientific knowledge into effective therapies.\n\nEven if we cannot cure dementia in the short term, it would count as a success if we found ways of slowing it down so that nobody need lose their dignity as they grew older.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L023784/1","grantId":"MR/L023784/1","fundValue":"13148900","fundStart":"2014-06-30","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Gallacher","coPersons":["Ronan Anthony Lyons","Cathie  Sudlow","John  Starr","Jean  Manson","Nick Charles Fox","Carol  Brayne","Marcus  Richards","Julie  Williams","Simon  Lovestone","Martin Neil Rossor","Jonathan Mark  Schott","Craig William Ritchie","Paul  Matthews","Ian J.
