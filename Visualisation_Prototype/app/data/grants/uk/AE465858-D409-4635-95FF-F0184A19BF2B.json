{"id":"AE465858-D409-4635-95FF-F0184A19BF2B","title":"Cross border trade union collaboration and Polish migrant workers in Britain","abstractText":"<p>This main aim of the project is to examine cross border collaboration between British and Polish trade unions in organising Polish migrant workers in the UK. The research will explore how British and Polish trade unions have established structures and policies to raise awareness among potential migrants from Poland and to organise these workers in the UK. </p> \n<p>The project will begin by examining national level initiatives taken by the Trade Union Congress in Britain and the three main trade union federations in Poland, namely Solidarnosc, OPZZ and Forum ZZ. Further, three case study British unions who have taken initiatives organising Polish migrant workers will be investigated. The project will examine how far collaboration is reflected in the practices of trade unions in UK and Polish regions, chosen to reflect contrasting industrial structures and union traditions.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>Finally case studies of individual workplaces will be conducted to examine the responses and attitudes of Polish workers through using questionnaires and focus groups. The results of the project will be used to identify and disseminate good practice to practitioners in an enlarged and enlarging Europe.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2034","grantId":"RES-000-22-2034","fundValue":"75882","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-10","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane Ann Hardy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hertfordshire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
