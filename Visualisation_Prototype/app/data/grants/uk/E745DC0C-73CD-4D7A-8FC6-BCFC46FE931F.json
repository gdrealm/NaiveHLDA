{"id":"E745DC0C-73CD-4D7A-8FC6-BCFC46FE931F","title":"Examining the emotional impact of verbal irony","abstractText":"<p>People often use ironic language in everyday conversation. For example, if someone does something stupid, their friend may make the comment, “That was clever!”, which on the surface of it, is the opposite of what they actually mean. Given the risk of misunderstanding, it seems likely that using irony serves some other communicative function, such as evoking a particular emotional response in the recipient.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to investigate the emotional impact of verbal irony by measuring peoples’ immediate emotional responses to ironic comments, compared to the same message delivered literally. Skin conductance will be recorded as a direct measure of emotional arousal, to assess whether irony enhances or mutes the emotional force of an utterance when used to deliver criticism or praise, and whether the use of devices such as emoticons can influence this. In order to examine more specific emotional responses, eye movements while reading, and electrical brain activity while listening, will be used to assess whether people expect ironic comments to be more hurtful, or more amusing, than their literal counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>Findings will be used to develop theories of irony processing and to help understand conditions in which irony comprehension is impaired (eg, autism).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000121/1","grantId":"ES/L000121/1","fundValue":"180139","fundStart":"2014-01-06","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Filik","coPersons":["Hartmut  Leuthold"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
