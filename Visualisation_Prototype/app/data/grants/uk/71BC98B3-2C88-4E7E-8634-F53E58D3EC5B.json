COROT is a CNES/ESA/International satellite project. Roxburgh is the ESA selected scientist on the Scientific Management Committee and a co-I. COROT has two primary goals: 1. The detection and characterisation of planets around stars; 2. The detection of the oscillation properties of selected target stars, and their use to map the structure and dynamics of stars. The camera has 4 CCDs, 2 of which are dedicated to planet searching, and two to stellar oscillations. COROT will spend intervals of 5 months on each of 5 (or more) primary target fields, measuring the variation in light received form selected target stars, and shorter intervals on other fields. The detection of planets is by the transit method, that is detection of the slight decrease in the light from a star as a planet passes in front of the star and in the line of sight of the observer. Some 5000 stars mostly of spectral type F,G,K,M and with mv&lt;11, will be observed simulateously in the field of view of the telescope, and up to 6 such fields will be observed, each for 5 months duration. COROT should detect earth-like planets somewhat larger than the Earth and very many gaseous giant planets. The detection of oscillations is to be achieved by measuring the light received from a star as a function of time and taking a Fourier power spectrum of the time series. COROT will monitor approximately 10 target stars per field (each of 5 months duration), the targets chosen to give a wide spread of stars with different properties and in different stages of evolution. These oscillation frequencies are diagnostics of the interior structure of a star and therefore enable us to map, or place constraints on, the internal constitution and dynamics of stars, so advancing our understanding of stellar evolution. As a co-I Roxburgh has rights to the data from the seismology fields and, as a selected GI, to the data on the 500 brightest stars in the planet search fields. The oscillation properties (eg frequencies) of a star are determined by its internal structure and dynamics, different stars giving frequency sets with different properties. So in principle, if we have a set of observed frequencies for a star we can infer properties of its internal structure. The tools to do this are what we call diagnostic techniques. For a high quality data set we can infer the detailed internal structure; for data of lesser quality some averaged properties and signatures of the boundaries of interfaces between a convective core and surrounding envelope (or convective envelope and radiative core), for poorer quality data some averaged properties of the star that can still be used to place constraints on the interior structure. The proposed research is to analyse the data from COROT using the suite of diagnostic techniques developed by Roxburgh and Vorontsov over the last few years (and techniques developed by others) to map, or place constraints on the internal structure of the observed stars, so testing our current models of stellar structure and evolution, and providing the information needed to develop a better understanding of how stars evolve.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E001793/1","grantId":"PP/E001793/1","fundValue":"331181","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Roxburgh","coPersons":["S  Vorontsov"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
