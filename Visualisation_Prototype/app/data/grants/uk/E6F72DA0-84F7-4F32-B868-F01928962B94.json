This is true not only in respect of tissue or organ restoration but also the ability to heal wounds without a scar. The long term aim of this group is to extend our abilities to repair and regenerate after injury and loss. In order to contribute to these goals we work on mammals and also on animals which have significantly greater ability to restore tissues or heal wounds. If we understood more about the mechanisms that underly such processes, then this would provide new opportunities to promote them in mammals.\n\nWe work in a variety of contexts that are relevant to regenerative medicine. These include the regeneration of sensory receptors in the ear, a cell type whose loss is a major cause of deafness, the regeneration of the lung, a significant focus in relation to the increasing incidence of emphysema and other smoking related disorders, the regeneration of limb, heart and the ocular lens, the mechanisms underlying scar free healing of wounds, the regeneration of the deer antler, a rare example of substantial regeneration in adult mammals, and the regeneration of the nerve cells in the spinal cord. Our experience is that the experimental approaches and results from one context are often helpful for progress in another and hence that there are clear benefits from such a group organisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9723286","grantId":"G9723286","fundValue":"49797","fundStart":"1998-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Martin","coPersons":["Andrew  Forge","Patrizia  Ferretti","Jeremy Patrick Brockes","Malcolm  Maden","Joanna  Price","Jonathan Edward Gale"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
