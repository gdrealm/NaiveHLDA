{"id":"A346C97F-0828-4CB2-9558-6C0EFE443996","title":"Immigration and the Transformation of Chinese Society","abstractText":"The growth of mega-cities and more generally rapid urbanization in China not only include hundreds of millions internal migrants, but an increasing number of foreign (including Taiwanese and returning ethnic Chinese) migrants as well. At present, foreign migrants fill relatively small and specific skills and knowledge gaps, but also include marriage migrants, traders, investors, retirees and unskilled workers. However as China's population growth levels off, population ageing sets in. China's working age population is set to decline, slowly at first but increasingly rapidly, especially roughly after 2025. Moreover, the population's sex imbalance will become ever more pronounced and China will face an increasing shortage of marriageable and working age people. Although international migration is set to make an important contribution to these increasing demographic and labour market shortages in China, little research has as yet been done. Our project will provide estimates and projections of the role of international and internal migration on population dynamics in China. The central focus of our project is on the impact of the second demographic transition in China, including family changes, ageing, migration and regional population changes. We will collect vital data on the interaction between labour markets and population dynamics, the consequences of migration, integration policies in China, EU-China mobility, and shifting patterns of inequality and the cultural division of labour. The project therefore speaks directly to the issues under the theme Understanding Population Change of the Europe - China call for collaborative research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L015609/1","grantId":"ES/L015609/1","fundValue":"400513","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elena  Barabantseva","coPersons":["Biao  Xiang"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
