One important family of protein messengers are called Wnts (pronounced wints). When the message is received, the responding cell switches on a number of genes in its nucleus that in turn bring about changes to processes such as growth and cell type. The connections inside the cell that transmit the Wnt signal from the cell surface to the nucleus are very important since they control how the signal is amplified and aimed at the right genes. The proposed research will use a method to the order in which connecting Wnt signalling components function inside the cell. The basic idea is to use a very sensitive cells that have been engineered to send out a burst of light when the Wnt signal is active in the nucleus. We then use a new method called RNAi to remove proteins that might be Wnt connecting components. If the protein IS required, the burst of light will be lost. This question is asked again and again for many genes using robots to speed up the process. We can ask whether and how many genes are required for Wnt signalling Once we know which proteins are involved in the Wnt pathway, we can study how they work and how they control animal development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D00117X/1","grantId":"BB/D00117X/1","fundValue":"347682","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings have been important in developing small molecule inhibitors of the Wnt signalling pathway as anti-cancer therapeutics.

Primary screen hits included known 'core' Wnt pathway genes like APC, Axin, b-catenin and TCF7. Comparison with Wnt pathway regulators identified in recent genome-scale screens in HeLa and DLD-1 cancer cell lines uncovered a small shared set of regulators that were selectively enriched for 'core' pathway components. Based on comparisons of primary and validated hit identification rates, we argue that the majority of 'non-core' Wnt pathway regulators have cell-specific functions. Morpholino-oligonucleotide mediated depletion of novel regulators induced Wnt-dependent phenotypes in zebrafish embryos that were consistent with tissue-specific roles. These findings underscore the importance of cell context when considering therapies for diseases involving deregulation of the Wnt pathway. Alterations of the expression of the identified gene products may be linked to dysregulation of the Wnt pathway in disease. The genes and reagents that target them can be used as biomarkers of pathway activation and response to therapeutic molecules that target distinct branches of a Wnt network.
