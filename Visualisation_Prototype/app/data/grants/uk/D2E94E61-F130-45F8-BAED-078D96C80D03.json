Although the diseases are quite different in how they affect patients, they are all caused by underlying mutations in the DNA which can be inherited in families, and they are studied using the same laboratory techniques. The first step in understanding a genetic disease is to genetically map it to a specific part of the total human DNA and to identify the actual gene which ahs the mutations. This has been done for these diseases. The disease can then be studied using cells in culture, which can give a lot of information about what is actually wrong with the cells. However, for many diseases, especially ones affecting very defined tissues of the body such as the retina in eye diseases or epithelia in cystic fibrosis, only a limited amount of information can be gained using cultured cells. Therefore, we will use animal models of these human diseases. The affected animals, usually mice are then used to study the disease, which involved taking tissues from the mice at different stages of development and after treatment with potentially therapeutic drugs. As the basic defect in all these disorders is mutation in the DNA, they can all potentially be treated by gene therapy which is the addition of the correct DNA to the cells of the body, which are affected by the disease. This group of scientists is developing methods for DNA delivery which are suitable for the specific diseases being studied; for instance delivery to the lung for cystic fibrosis and to the neurons for ataxia. The final aim of the research is to develop effective treatments for cystic fibrosis, asthma, some forms of blindness and neurodegenerative diseases. The results of our research and their relevance to the development of novel therapeutic approaches as well as their ethical implications will be widely publicised in meetings and scientific articles","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9805886","grantId":"G9805886","fundValue":"309266","fundStart":"1998-12-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Miguel C Seabra","coPersons":["Charles  Coutelle","Clare M Lloyd","Tracy  Hussell","Margaret J Dallman","Clare  Huxley","Michael  Themis","Herbert Terence Cook","Charles Henry Rodeck","Richard William  Titball"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
