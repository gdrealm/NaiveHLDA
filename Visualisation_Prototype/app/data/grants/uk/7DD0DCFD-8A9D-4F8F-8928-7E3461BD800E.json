{"id":"7DD0DCFD-8A9D-4F8F-8928-7E3461BD800E","title":"Transdermal delivery of macromolecules mediated by microneedle arrays","abstractText":"Traditional pharmaceutical drugs are small chemical molecules that treat the symptoms of a disease. Biopharmaceuticals are large biological molecules, known as peptides and proteins and these target the underlying mechanisms and pathways of a disease. They can deal with targets in humans that are not accessible with traditional medicines. Recently, there have been rapid and revolutionary developments in this field of biotechnology. Therapeutic peptides and proteins are expected to be used extensively in coming years as vaccines and treatments for cancer, high blood pressure, pain and blood clots, as well as many other illnesses. However, one of the major challenges to successful clinical use of these 'biotech' molecules is their efficient delivery to the site of action. The body breaks these drugs down when they are swallowed and they are generally not well-absorbed into the blood. As a result, they have to be given frequently by injection, which causes pain and means that such drugs are usually only given to people in hospital. If these new drugs could be delivered across the skin, then many of the problems associated with their administration could be overcome. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to overcome the barrier presented by the outer layer of the skin. This skin layer, known as the stratum corneum, has evolved to protect us from the external environment. It prevents entry of dirt and microorganisms, but also most medicines. In this project, a novel type of transdermal patch will be developed that will by-pass the stratum corneum barrier. On its surface will be many tiny needles that pierce the stratum corneum without causing any pain - the sensation is said to feel like a cat's tongue or sharkskin. These needles will either dissolve quickly, leaving tiny holes in the stratum corneum, which will let proteins and peptides enter the body, or swell, turning into a jelly-like material that keeps the holes open and will allow continuous drug delivery. The technology developed here is unique and could potentially revolutionise delivery of peptides and proteins. This is likely to be of great benefit to patients, as it will make these advanced medicines readily available to everybody.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E020534/1","grantId":"BB/E020534/1","fundValue":"338840","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Working with a range of international companies to develop commercial products.

Realisation of the concept of microneedle arrays prepared from swellable hydrogels. \n\nThis technological development allows transdermal delivery of physiologically-active doses of peptides/proteins. The best example was significant reduction of blood glucose levels in diabetic rats in vivo. Delivery of small molecule water-soluble drugs and nanoparticles was also achieved. In addition and importantly, such systems, which were produced in this project for the first time and are unique to my Group, also take up significant quantities of skin interstitial fluid, meaning they can then be used in minimally-invasive therapeutic/diagnostic monitoring of drug substances or endogenous biomarkers.\n\n\n\n2. Optical coherence tomographic (OCT) real-time in vivo investigations \n\nOCT, the optical analogue of ultrasound, was used, for the first time, to study microneedle insertion and swelling/dissolution in skin in human volunteers. Vital information was gained with respect to the impact of application force on depth of insertion and skin recovery following microneedle removal. Enhanced delivery of therapeutic agents, minimally-invasive patient monitoring, enhanced in-skin delivery of active cosmeceutical ingredients My Group are currently working with 5 international companies in a wide range of fields to take the patented technology developed during this project to market. Funding from BBSRC's Super Follow-on Fund will facilitate manufacturing scale-up and reliable patient application. This will undoubtedly facilitate commercialisation of this exciting technology.
