After a heart attack, surgeons work to restore blood flow to the heart, but paradoxically this can actually cause further damage to the heart. This may be due to an excess of calcium, or to damaging by-products of oxygen metabolism, but it has been difficult to measure these factors in the intact heart. We are using multi-photon microscopy to generate high resolution images of the cells inside rat hearts. We maintain these hearts alive for several hours after removal from a terminally anaesthetized rat, and simulate a heart attack by temporarily cutting off their oxygen supply. \n\nBy directly measuring the changes occurring in the heart over time, we hope to be able to determine what makes them susceptible to injury. Armed with this important information, future research will be directed at protecting these cells, and thus, the heart, from lethal injury during heart attacks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700933","grantId":"G0700933","fundValue":"505835","fundStart":"2007-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek  Yellon","coPersons":["Michael  Duchen"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
