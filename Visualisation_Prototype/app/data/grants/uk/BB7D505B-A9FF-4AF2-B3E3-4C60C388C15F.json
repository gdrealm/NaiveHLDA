It will also explore what are the key factors here in determining whether individuals progress through the education system to HE or not.</p>\n\n<p>The analysis will be based on the innovative use of three linked administrative data-sets:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>the National Pupil Database (NPD) for Wales</li>\n\n <li>the Lifelong Learning Wales Record (LLWR)</li>\n\n <li>Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) data. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>It will be possible to trace individual trajectories through the education system to entry to HE; and to compare systematically the trajectories of those who do participate in HE with those who do not. Sophisticated statistical techniques will be used to determine the most influential factors in shaping patterns of HE participation. Results will be compared with those that have been produced by similar analyses in England.</p>\n\n<p>A second part of the study (funded by additional resources made available by the HEFCW) will investigate the development of distinctive approaches to widening access to HE by successive Welsh administrations since devolution in 1999.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004247/1","grantId":"ES/K004247/1","fundValue":"149152","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Rees","coPersons":["Rhys  Davies","Stephen James Drinkwater","Christopher Matthew Taylor"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
