However, incomplete understanding of the processes involved in the development of this condition acts as a barrier to the development of better ways for treating and preventing the disease. \n\nIn the past few years, collaborative efforts in human genetic discovery have identified over fifty positions in the human genome where individual sequence variation is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. In principle, each of these genetic &quot;signals&quot; holds important clues to the mechanisms that are responsible for the maintenance of normal metabolic health. However, in most of these regions, we have yet to define the specific genetic variants responsible for the signal, or the particular genes through which the effects on diabetes-risk are mediated. As a result, the pace of biological insights has lagged behind that of genetic discovery. A key challenge for the field is to develop strategies that enable genetic signals such as these to be mined for the biological clues they can provide. \n\nWe recently demonstrated that one of these diabetes signals maps near a gene named KLF14, and that this effect on risk of diabetes is driven by a reduced ability of insulin-sensitive tissues, including muscle and liver, to respond to insulin. We have also shown that, in fat tissue, the same variants near KLF14 have widespread effects on the levels of expression of a wide range of genes, including KLF14 itself. These data are consistent with a model whereby KLF14 acts as a major regulator of events in fat tissue, with these alterations in the levels of KLF14 leading, through as yet unspecified mechanisms, to peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. \n\nThe overall aim of this research is to define the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms which are responsible for the relationship between KLF14 and type 2 diabetes. To do this, we will pursue a number of complementary research strategies which include studies of human genetics and physiology and cellular studies in fat cells.\n\nMore specifically, our work aims to:\n(a) define the specific sequence variants that are responsible for all of these effects, and how they influence levels of KLF14 within fat cells;\n(b) characterise the suite of genes that are turned on and off by KLF14, and understand the consequences of those secondary changes on the function of fat tissue; and\n(c) understand how it is that these KLF14-dependent changes in fat tissue lead to changes in the ability of remote tissues (such as muscle and liver) to respond to insulin. \n\nWe expect that, by focusing on the role of KLF14 and the ways in which it leads to an increased risk of diabetes, we will gain valuable, generic insights into the mechanisms whereby events in fat have widespread metabolic effects in other tissues. An answer to this question would help us improve our understanding of the connections between obesity and diabetes, an issue of supreme importance given that much of the increase in diabetes prevalence around the world is driven by changes in the amount, distribution and function of fat. \n\nThe research provides an opportunity to capitalise on recent discoveries in human genetics to advance understanding of disease biology. In the application, we explain how the biological information generated by this project can be exploited in directly translational studies to define novel approaches for treating, preventing, diagnosing and monitoring type 2 diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J010642/1","grantId":"MR/J010642/1","fundValue":"605221","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Ian McCarthy","coPersons":["Fredrik  Karpe","Kerrin Shannon  Small","Roger David Cox"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
