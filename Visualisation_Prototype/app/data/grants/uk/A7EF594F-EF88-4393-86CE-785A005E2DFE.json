{"id":"A7EF594F-EF88-4393-86CE-785A005E2DFE","title":"Object-directed motor imitation in children with autism","abstractText":"<p>Nearly every rigorously designed study on action imitation in children with autism has found a deficit, except with regard to activities that involve manipulating objects. However, previous research has often failed to distinguish imitation (learning about the actions of a demonstrator) from emulation (learning about the affordances of objects). The proposed research carefully distinguishes between action- and object-centred learning. In study one, children with autism, together with age, motor and intelligence matched controls, will watch a demonstrator use a rake to reach a prize. We predict that here children with autism will look proportionally less at the demonstrator than will controls. In study two, participants will be presented with six different puzzle boxes for which they will either receive no demonstration, a full demonstration, a demonstration where the boxes are animated to move and open without being manipulated (the ghost condition) or a demonstration in which a person mimes appropriate actions adjacent to the boxes. We hypothesise that children with autism will show some capacity for object-directed imitation, but that they will nonetheless exhibit a bias toward the object- versus action-centred aspects of the demonstrations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2006","grantId":"RES-000-22-2006","fundValue":"82027","fundStart":"2007-01-04","fundEnd":"2008-07-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah  Custance","coPersons":["Pamela  Heaton","Elisabeth  Hill"],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
