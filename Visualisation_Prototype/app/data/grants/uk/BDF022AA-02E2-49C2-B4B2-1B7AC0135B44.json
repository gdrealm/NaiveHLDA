In 2008 significant changes were made to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990) that regulates the provision of infertility treatment. These included reform of the child welfare assessment that, under s.13(5) of the Act, clinics have a duty to perform before offering regulated treatments. </p>\n\n<p>This reform was followed by a new Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Code of Practice, providing guidance on how to interpret the new law. A new welfare of the child assessment regime is thus in place. On the basis of original empirical research this project aims to assess the impact of the amendment of this provision. </p>\n\n<p>Our exploration will rely on a detailed analysis of the published documentation which accompanied this reform process, and a series of semi-structured interviews at around one quarter of licensed clinics, which will explore the views of clinicians, clinic counsellors and nursing staff. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to provide a unique assessment of the operation in practice of the revised welfare assessment, and to disseminate findings to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>research users</li>\n\n <li>academics</li>\n\n <li>treatment providers</li>\n\n <li>patients seeking or receiving treatment</li>\n\n <li>policy makers</li>\n\n <li>NGOs.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4291","grantId":"RES-000-22-4291","fundValue":"79236","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ellie  Lee","coPersons":["Janet  Macvarish","Sally  Sheldon"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
