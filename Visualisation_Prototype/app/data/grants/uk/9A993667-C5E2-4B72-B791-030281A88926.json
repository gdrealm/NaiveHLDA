In the vast majority of cases the physical size of the cavity components results in the repetition rate being in the 10s of Megahertz regime. It is often difficult to vary and if it is variable it generally involves a reconfiguration of the cavity. Similarly, the duration of the pulses produced by the mode locking technique are predetermined by the cavity parameters and are not readily selectable over large ranges. Optical filters can be placed in the cavity to restrict the bandwidth and so affect the temporal format of the generated pulses. However, inserting such filters usually requires a reoptimisation of the cavity and pulse widths cannot be continuously selected. This places considerable restriction on the versatility and applicability of conventional laser systems.\nThe configuration we propose employs a single pass technique. The repetition rate of the generated pulses is simply determined by the drive frequency to an in line phase modulator. In conjunction with a transmitting edge filter the signals are turned into a corresponding series of pulses. Since the input signal is also a continuously operating laser it can be easily tuned over the complete gain window of the seed laser. In order to achieve continuously selectable pulse widths from this assembly, use is made of the fact that they can be made operate in the soliton supporting region of an optical fibre. Here the nonlinear intensity dependent non linear effects can be balanced by anomalous dispersion. The generated soliton has a fixed &quot;area&quot;. The product of intensity and duration is constant, consequently if the soliton can be amplified, and this must be undertaken adiabatically, such that no energy disperses from the soliton, its duration will decrease. The slow, exponential gain provided by Raman gain in an optical fibre is ideal for this slow adiabatic amplification. Control of the gain, simply allows control of the pulse duration and by simply changing the pump power the output pulse duration is continuously selectable over a large range.\nWe propose to seed the system from a narrow line thulium fibre laser and amplify in a specially designed high gain Raman amplifier fibre in an all fibre configuration that will allow average powers of up to 2 watts, pulse durations selectable between 20 picoseconds and 200 femtoseconds, at repetition rates between 5 and 10 GHz . Extension up to 20 GHz should be possible in the near term. Using additional follow on in fibre non linear optical processes should permit continuous tuning from 1950 nm to 2500 nm, providing unique performance characteristics in a region of importance for medical application and molecular fingerprinting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K037056/1","grantId":"EP/K037056/1","fundValue":"111539","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
