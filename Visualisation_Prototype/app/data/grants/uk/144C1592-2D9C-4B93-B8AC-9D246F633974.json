Soluble DF may also have unique benefits associated with its high viscosity. However, the daily intake in UK adults is substantially below recommended guidelines. Wheat is the most important source of DF in the UK, with bread providing 20% of the daily intake. Improving wheat DF is therefore an important target. \nBy contrast, high fibre and high viscosity are detrimental when wheat is used as feed for poultry and as raw material for alcohol production in distilling and biofuel plants. \nWe have identified wide variation in the amounts of total and soluble fibre in the Watkins collection of wheats which were collected across the world in the 1930s. This variation will be studied in more detail and tools developed to facilitate its exploitation to produce new wheat cultivars with improved end use properties, in collaboration with a major wheat breeder and with the Scotch Whisky Research Institute","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M020525/1","grantId":"BB/M020525/1","fundValue":"199255","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Shewry","coPersons":["Alison  Lovegrove","Simon  Griffiths"],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
