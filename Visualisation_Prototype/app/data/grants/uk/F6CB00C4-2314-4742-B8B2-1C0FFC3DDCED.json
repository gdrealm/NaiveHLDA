Being of an intermittent nature, the renewable sources for\nelectricity generation require installation of energy storage devices. Redox flow cells are considered to be a strong\ncandidate to store energy in the range of few kW/kWh up to tens of MW/MWh. An innovative technology, patented and\ndeveloped by Imperial College London, has demonstrated excellent performance using a redox flow battery based on the\nreaction of hydrogen (gas) and vanadium (liquid), and the feasibility of combining this innovative chemistry into cells and\nstacks developed by Arcola Energy will be explored in this project, along with the potential value of the technology for grid\nscale storage application (by Alstom UK).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508585/1","grantId":"EP/N508585/1","fundValue":"148011","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel Peter Brandon","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
