The reduction of bone stock available for subsequent implant fixation is responsible for poorer results. Currently there is no consistent method which can effectively repare bone defects and restore bone stock.The aims of this project is to develop a tissue-engineered orthopaedic implant which can treat bone defects in revision total hip replacements. The innovatin of the study is to combine techniques in tissue engineering science, biomaterila science and implant design.A biomaterial called trabecular metal will be used for scaffold, which is made of porous tantalum with three dimensional porous structure. Biomimetic layer of calcium and phosphate will be deposited through the structure","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E024211/1","grantId":"EP/E024211/1","fundValue":"414252","fundStart":"2007-04-23","fundEnd":"2010-10-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jia  Hua","coPersons":["Gordon  Blunn","Melanie Jean  Coathup","Allen  Goodship"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
