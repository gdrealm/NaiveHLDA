Over the period 2010-2015 we propose to conduct experiments which will extend the applicability of adaptive optics correction down to visible wavelengths, and continue our successful programme of atmospheric characterisation using SLODAR. We will also continue our joint programme with ESO to develop a next generation real-time control system for future adaptive optics systems. We will continue to exploit our in-house manufacturing capability for high precision micro-optics with a focus on closed-loop correction systems and precision grinding of ceramic materials for lightweight optics, and will explore the application of photonics technologies to improving the versatility and efficiency of future astronomical instruments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H002154/1","grantId":"ST/H002154/1","fundValue":"2582780","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ray Martin Sharples","coPersons":["Richard Michael Myers","Simon Leo Morris","Jeremy  Allington-Smith","Gordon  Love","David  Robertson","Richard  Wilson"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
