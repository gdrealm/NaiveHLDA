{"id":"A237F1BC-1986-47E7-A407-DAB154497965","title":"Self-interacting stochastic systems","abstractText":"The goal of this project is to explore the properties of certain random systems of particles that continuously interact with one another or with themselves.This type of processes arises in areas as diverse as population genetics, statistical mechanics or computer science, and mathematical progress in the understanding of these systems is crucial for applications.There is, of course, a large variety of systems which are governed by self-interactions. This project will focus on two main types of examples. These are, on the one hand, processes of coalescence, which typically involve a large number of particles that may collide with one another, and on the other hand, self-interacting random walks, where there is usually one particle whose future evolution is greatly influenced by its past.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G055068/1","grantId":"EP/G055068/1","fundValue":"290518","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nathanael  Berestycki","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
