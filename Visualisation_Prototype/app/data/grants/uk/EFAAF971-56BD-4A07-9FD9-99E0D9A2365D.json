{"id":"EFAAF971-56BD-4A07-9FD9-99E0D9A2365D","title":"Optimising polymer photovoltaic devices through control of phase-separation","abstractText":"In principle, photovoltaic devices could meet all our energy requirements in a sustainable way, but at the moment the capital expense of conventional photovoltaics is too great to be competitive, and the volume in which they can be produced is much too small to make a serious dent in our electricity generating needs. Their relatively high manufacturing cost and the difficulty of scaling the manufacturing process is an intrinsic feature of their energy-intensive fabrication process. In contrast, non-conventional PVs based on organic semiconductors can be processed from solution using high-volume roll-to-roll printing technologies, offering the possibility of large area devices being fabricated on flexible substrates at very low cost. Unfortunately at present, organic PV devices are characterized by prohibitively low external power efficiencies (&lt; 6%). Closing the gap in efficiency between organic and inorganic PV devices is a significant challenge / one which will require a full microscopic understanding of the processes that currently limit organic PV efficiency. The most promising organic PV devices are currently based on solution-cast blends of conjugated polymers doped with fullerene derivatives. Relatively little is however known regarding the role of the self-assembled nanoscale morphology of such systems on their operational efficiency. In this proposal, we seek to develop a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the self-assembly processes by which nanoscale structure arises within such PV applicable materials. In particular we propose to study the evolution of nanoscale phase-separation during film casting using X-ray scattering. We will also utilize a range of complementary microscopy techniques ranging from environmental scanning electron microscopy, to time-resolved near field microscopy. The combination of such techniques will permit us to develop a complete picture of film structure from molecular to microscopic length-scales. Our proposed project draws together some of the UK's leading polymer scientists and technologists, with our goal being to significantly advance the understanding of the processes that limit organic PV device performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F017057/1","grantId":"EP/F017057/1","fundValue":"96564","fundStart":"2008-01-24","fundEnd":"2011-01-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The information gained during this research has been used to further the development of organic semiconductor thin-films in photovoltaic devices.\n\nAs part of this research (and via other RCUK projects that ran in parallel), Sheffield set up the spin-out company Ossila. This company helped to commercialise the know-how developed within the Sheffield group and continues to help other researchers working in the same area by accelerating their research through the provision of a range of specially designed consumer products.\n\nWhile scientific output was the primary outcome for both Diamond and the academic groups in the collaboration, an additional benefit from this grant was in a better understanding of the technical and scientific requirements for user experimentation in this field.\n\nThese findings were used to prepare an internal proposal for continuation funding, to the sum of ?350,000, for additional GiSAXS infrastructure on beamline I22. The ultimate aim of this follow-up funding is to allow, not only the original collaboration to improve their data collection, but expand the technique to new user communities including those working on inorganic deposited thin films and biological lipid bilayer systems.

While the funding available through the grant allowed the University collaborators to collect useful data on their organic photovoltaic systems it also provided valuable information on the more generic requirements for future experimentation in this area. The work helps provide important information for other people interested in developing plastic solar cells. The work provides design rules for the development of materials and the ways in which such materials should be processed. We have established a technological base from which better in-situ measurements can be added to the grazing incidence Small Angle Scattering technique, GiSAXS. The follow-on funding mentioned will directly benefit all researchers coming to Diamond working on thin-film technologies in the healthcare e.g. Biosensors, environment e.g. Pollution and manufacturing technologies e.g. Coating walls and packaging industries.
