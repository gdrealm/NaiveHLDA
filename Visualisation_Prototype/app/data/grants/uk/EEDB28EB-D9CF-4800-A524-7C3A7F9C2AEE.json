{"id":"EEDB28EB-D9CF-4800-A524-7C3A7F9C2AEE","title":"Measuring Risk and Time Preferences: Large-Scale Field Experiments","abstractText":"This project aims to conduct a web-based field experiment to measure individual risk and time preferences. I will utilize the CentERpanel, an online, weekly, stratified survey of over 2000 households in the Netherlands, as a field environment. An innovative graphical interface will be incorporated into the CentERpanel Survey to permit me to collect a rich, individual-level dataset in a much larger pool of subjects than was possible in previous laboratory experiments. The survey dataset includes information on economic variables, such as income, wealth, pensions, mortgage, and investments on other financial assets, and socio-demographic information for each panel member. Combined with this survey dataset, experimental data will enhance our understanding of important economic activities involving risk and time, such as saving and investment. \n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G001936/1","grantId":"ES/G001936/1","fundValue":"170585","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Syngjoo  Choi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
