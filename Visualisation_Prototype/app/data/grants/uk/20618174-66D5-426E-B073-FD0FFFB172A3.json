{"id":"20618174-66D5-426E-B073-FD0FFFB172A3","title":"MICA: The Role of GABAB Receptor Mechanisms in Chronic Cough","abstractText":"Coughing is the most common reason for which people visit their GP, but currently we know very little about why people cough and the current medications for treating cough are not helpful. Some people suffer from severe coughing which can last from eight weeks to many years, and yet they seem to have no obvious cause for their cough. This is known as a Chronic Cough. One theory is that chronic cough might be a response to a condition known as gastro-oesophageal reflux, where food and acid in the stomach flow back into the oesophagus (food pipe). Gastro-oesophageal reflux usually causes heartburn and indigestion which can get better with acid blocking medicines, but in people who develop cough, rather than heartburn, acid does not seem to be the problem and these treatments do not work. Previous research has suggested that in up to 50% of patients with chronic cough, the coughing may be triggered by gastro-oesophageal reflux.\nThis project will study a new medicine, known as a GABA-B receptor agonist, developed to reduce the amount of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Although this medicine was not found to be helpful in patients with heartburn who were already taking acid blocking treatments, but we will test whether it improves chronic cough which has been triggered by reflux. This new medicine may also reduce the sensitivity of the nerves that make people cough and could also be helpful in chronic cough patients where reflux is not a problem for them. \nWe plan two studies using this medicine. Firstly we will test this treatment in healthy people to see whether it reduces the sensitivity of the nerves responsible for coughing. Secondly we will test the treatment in patients with chronic cough and measure any reduction in the number of times people cough compared to a placebo (dummy) treatment. In this study we will also measure gastro-oesophageal reflux and the sensitivity of the cough reflex to work out which patients might find this medication helpful in the future.\nIf these studies show this GABA-B receptor agonist improves chronic cough, then this could lead to the development of more effective treatments for coughing, which in turn may help more patients that just those with chronic cough.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015141/1","grantId":"MR/K015141/1","fundValue":"357028","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jacky  Smith","coPersons":["Brendan James Canning","Alison  Holt","Lesley  Houghton","Graeme  Wilkinson","Ashley  Woodcock"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
