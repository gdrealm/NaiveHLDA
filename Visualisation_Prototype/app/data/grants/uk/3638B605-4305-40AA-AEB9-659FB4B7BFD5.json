It turns out that for a particular, but ubiqiutous familyof random matrices, certain real numbers (eigenvalues) that are fundamental to its description are in one-to-one correspondence with the n Fermions mentioned above.To understand the collective behaviour of this system, we apply a small external probeand observe the response of the system. It turns out that if the probe is asmall and in some sense smooth perturbation, thesystem will tend to remain in the original unperturbed state.However, even a weak but non-smooth external probe can produce responses qualitatively distinct from what can be normally expected. In such situations, the usual approach of expansion in terms of small parameters --- the perturbative treatment --- breaks down completely. New methods to deal with non-perturbative effects will be developed in the proposed research to explain such behaviour.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F014198/1","grantId":"EP/F014198/1","fundValue":"42561","fundStart":"2007-09-24","fundEnd":"2008-09-23","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Igor  Krasovsky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
