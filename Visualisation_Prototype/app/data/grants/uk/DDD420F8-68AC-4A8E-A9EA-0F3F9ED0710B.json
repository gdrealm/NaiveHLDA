In this research we will consider how raising the understanding of how fiscal localism can produce new complimentary economic models to build a more sustainable society.\n \nThis fiscal localism will be promoted through the creation of a system to support ethical trade, which incorporates practices that promote more socially and/or environmentally responsible trade, in a local community. Encouraging individuals to move from seeing themselves as private consumers to public citizens presents two clear challenges to address in relation to supporting wider adoption of local ethical trading:\n\ni. for those who have already bought into ethical trading, how can we provide more information on exactly how their purchases are contributing towards a more ethical and sustainable local economy, thus helping them make informed choices? \nii. for those who haven't yet bought into it, how can we use data on the impact of ethical versus non-ethical trades to encourage them to adopt new purchasing behaviour?\n\nTo address this challenge we propose to investigate whether mobile and ubiquitous computing can be applied to support local ethical trade initiatives by: combining elements of social networking, in particular rating, ranking and reputation systems, alongside design practices derived from game feedback systems and elements derived from Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) and Local/Community currencies to produce a new approach we term a Local Wealth Generation System.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K012584/1","grantId":"EP/K012584/1","fundValue":"193931","fundStart":"2013-04-29","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Coulton","coPersons":["Jon  Whittle"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" The key outcomes of this project relate to design techniques for creating systems to promote behavioural change. In particular the proposal of a rhetorical inspired approach that encourages users to consider the overall issue not just an isolated issue. In particular it enrages design that encourages people to see themselves as citizens rather than individual users. The BARTER open source project suit consists of 2 mobile user interfaces (android_terminal and customer_app), 1 centralised mysql database and a responsive web dashboard. These platforms make up the BARTER system; the mobile and web dash have been designed to operate independently from one another, this means that if the web dash is not required users do not have to set it up on your server.
