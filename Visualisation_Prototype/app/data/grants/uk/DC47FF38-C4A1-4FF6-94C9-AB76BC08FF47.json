The aim of this project is to develop a realistic model of grammatical category development by taking ideas from recent computer models that group together words at a single point in time, and building them into a model called MOSAIC that learns language more gradually. MOSAIC is a computer program that takes as input speech directed at language-learning children, and produces as output child-like utterances that get longer as the model processes more input. These utterances can therefore be compared with those of children at different points in development.</p>\n\n<p>The current project will involve:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>measuring differences in the productivity of different categories in transcripts of children's speech</li>\n\n <li>building several different versions of the model that group words into categories in different ways</li>\n\n <li>evaluating the different versions of the model by comparing their performance with respect to each other</li>\n\n <li>looking at whether it is possible to get better results by taking account of how much information humans (and particularly young children) are able to deal with at any one time. </li>\n\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J011436/1","grantId":"ES/J011436/1","fundValue":"321529","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have influenced theories of word class acquisition Education,Other Cultural","person":"Julian Mark Pine","coPersons":["Daniel  Freudenthal","Fernand  Gobet"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" We have identified a number of weaknesses in current computational approaches to word class acquisition and developed a method which shows the same advantage that young children show for classifying nouns versus verbs Our findings could be used to build more realistic computer models of word class acquisition Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
