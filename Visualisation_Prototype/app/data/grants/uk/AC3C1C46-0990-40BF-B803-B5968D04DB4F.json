Our target audience is 8-13 year olds but the workshop materials which highlight natural history, ecology and the environment will be suitable for all age groups.</p>\n\n<p>The organisations involved in the project will present 5 science workshops covering marine organisms, plants, insects, birds, fossils and evolution and the future of taxonomy. Visitors will have the opportunity to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>learn why it is important to classify living and non living organisms</li>\n\n <li>why scientific names are Latin or Greek</li>\n\n <li>appreciate how taxonomy provides us with information about evolution and the planet's biodiversity</li>\n\n <li>how it enables us to help conserve species and habitat diversity for future generations</li>\n\n <li>design their own 'alien' organism and give it a scientific name to win a prize. </li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0138","grantId":"RES-168-26-0138","fundValue":"700","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare  Buckland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"SAHFOS","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
