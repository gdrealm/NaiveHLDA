One important means of communication is through the protein Notch, which is essential for the normal development of the body. Defective Notch proteins are also the cause of some cancers and are associated with a number of late onset diseases. \n\nRecent sequence of human and Drosophila genomes suggests that over 2000 human disease genes are conserved in flies. The goal of our research is to take advantage of Drosophila (where Notch was first discovered) as a model, to find out which other genes are needed to successfully interpret the information that comes through Notch. \n\nSo-called genetic screens in Drosophila make it possible to sift through all the genes in the genome to find which ones are needed for Notch to work properly. We will confirm whether the same players are present in human genome, and will ask whether any of these contribute to known diseases. \n\nThrough the identification of new players and the development of new assays we aim to provide valuable tools for developing drugs or diagnostic assays, in cases where Notch is a potential target.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200457","grantId":"G0200457","fundValue":"806956","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Bray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
