Many markers such as systolic blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels are now routinely measured on individuals to predict conditions such as heart disease. Levels of markers that indicate an individual is at high risk of disease are subsequently modified by suitable interventions to help prevent disease onset and/or progression. However, there has much controversy regarding the proportion of risk actually explained by such markers and the generalisability of risk markers between different populations. To enable a more comprehensive and powerful evaluation of the relevance of such predictors, it is often necessary to pool data from different studies. I plan to advance the development of statistical methods for use in such data pooling approaches by working on detailed information previously collated on up to 40,000 cases of heart disease from over 1 million participants in 104 studies. The main aim is to develop statistical methods that will enable more reliable conclusions to be drawn about (i) the relationship between predictors and disease; (ii) the predictive ability that can be attributed to risk models and (iii) the generalisability of risk models to different populations. The methods that will be developed will have applications to many different situations and to different diseases, and will become increasingly important as the trend continues towards data sharing and pooling in large, collaborative multi-centre studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701619","grantId":"G0701619","fundValue":"428063","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Angela  Wood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
