Topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy is a treatment for such wounds which involves the application of a suction force to the wound via a dressing. \n\nTNP therapy is widely used in the NHS, yet there is no valid research evidence to support its use. This is not the same as saying TNP therapy is ineffective â€” just that research evidence is lacking. \n\nDespite this lack of evidence it is too premature to initiate a large randomised trial (the best way of evaluating a treatment) as more information is required about how feasible such a trial is and how it should be designed. \n\nWe are conducting preliminary work to investigate whether funding a large trial of TNP therapy is likely to offer good value for money and what treatment(s) we should compare TNP therapy with. Once these questions are answered we will do a pilot trial. This will determine whether a large trial is feasible (i.e. are there sufficient numbers of eligible patients?). Our study will ensure that any future trial it is more likely to answer the questions is TNP therapy is clinically and cost-effective?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501814","grantId":"G0501814","fundValue":"271327","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola Anne Cullum","coPersons":["Cynthia Paola Iglesias","David John Torgerson","Karl Phillip Claxton","Elizabeth  Scanlon"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
