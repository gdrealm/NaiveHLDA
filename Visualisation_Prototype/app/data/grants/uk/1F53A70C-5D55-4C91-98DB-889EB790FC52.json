It brings leading national and international experts together with UK researchers in a year-long programme of research activities focused on an emerging theme in the mathematical sciences. The proposed symposium for the 2016-17 academic year will concentrate on the theme of &quot;Partial Differential Equations and Their Applications&quot;. \n\nPartial differential equations provide the fundamental objects which are used to model the world around us. Classically they are used in geometry, mathematical physics, fluids, mechanics in general and biology, and increasingly they are employed in social sciences. In very general terms, the symposium will constitute a forum for the leading resarchers to discuss and propose solutions of emerging problems in theory and applications and to develop techniques for the analysis and numerical approximation of PDEs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N003039/1","grantId":"EP/N003039/1","fundValue":"180120","fundStart":"2016-09-01","fundEnd":"2017-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charlie  Elliott","coPersons":["Christoph  Ortner","Jose Luis Rodrigo","Andreas  Dedner"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
