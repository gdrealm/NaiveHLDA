The reduction occurs before the onset of dementia. In people who already have AD, the more marked the reduction in blood flow through the brain the more severe their dementia. Patients with AD do tend to develop structural changes to the blood vessels in the brain - degenerative small vessel disease (SVD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the distribution of the reduction in cerebral blood flow differs from that of the structural changes to cerebral blood vessels in AD, and there is increasing evidence that it is largely mediated by functional rather than structural abnormalities of the vessels.\n\nThe brain damage and memory disturbances that occur in AD are thought to result from the accumulation of a substance known as amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain. This occurs in two main forms, a shorter one (Abeta40) and a longer one (Abeta42). In AD there is an increase in the proportion of Abeta that is of the longer form (Abeta42). The longer form of Abeta causes nerve cells to produce more of an enzyme called ACE that, in turn, produces the chemical Ang II. In addition, both forms of Abeta increase the production of another chemical called endothelin-1 (ET-1): Abeta42 does so by acting on an enzyme (called ECE) that synthesizes ET-1 in nerve cells, and Abeta40 by stimulating the production of ET-1 in the lining of blood vessels in the brain. Both ET-1 and Ang II cause blood vessels to constrict, narrowing their lumen. This reduces blood flow through the brain in patients with AD, and thereby impairs the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to nerve cells and slows the removal of waste products, adversely affecting nerve cell function. In addition, experimental studies suggest that the reduction in blood supply may increase the production of Abeta and thereby accelerate the progression of the AD. In a rat model of AD, other researchers showed that injection of ET-1 led to more accumulation of Abeta, more marked secondary degenerative changes and impaired performance in memory tests.\n\nET-1 mediates its reduction in blood flow by acting on specific receptors in the vessel walls (ET-A receptors). Ang II mediates its effects by acting on other receptors (Ang II receptors). By blocking either or both sets of receptors, it should be possible to improve blood flow through the brain. We now wish to explore the utility of (i) zibotentan, a specific ET-A blocker produced by AstraZeneca, and (ii) losartan, a licensed Ang II receptor blocker, for improving blood flow through the brain in a rat model that combines ET-1-mediated reduction in blood flow and Abeta accumulation in the brain. The rat studies will allow us to examine the effects of zibotentan, losartan and a combination of the two in great detail, including how these drugs affect maintenance of flow when there are changes in blood pressure or brain activity, and what the effects are on Abeta metabolism (including on the activity of ECE and ACE, both of which help the brain to remove Abeta).\n\nBoth zibotentan and losartan are well tolerated when given over long periods of time to elderly people. These studies will clarify their separate and combined potential for restoring blood flow in AD - and potentially therefore improving memory and slowing the progression of dementia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015397/1","grantId":"MR/K015397/1","fundValue":"524331","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Seth  Love","coPersons":["Patrick Gavin Kehoe","Julian Francis Paton"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
