{"id":"4D6DCF61-CB46-4201-8087-F245D2FC033A","title":"Core Capability for Chemistry Research at the University of Liverpool","abstractText":"This grant will underpin the Chemistry Department's core research capability by upgrading capital equipment in four key areas of Chemistry instrumentation, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray structural analysis and atomic level microscopy. These techniques provide the ability to characterise the new chemicals and materials produced in the Department of Chemistry at Liverpool, to determine their atomic structure and to examine their properties, supporting research activity across the entire Chemistry research portfolio. The new facilities will provide access to state of the art instrumentation for Chemistry academics, early career research staff, post-doctoral research workers and research students, enhancing the quality of the research carried out. Replacement of obsolete instrumentation and extending the capability of the instrumentation base will enhance sample throughput and productivity, permit unstable samples to be analysed, reduce the need for external analysis of samples and allow more complex analysis to be performed. Research programmes relying on these techniques include Materials Research, research into Green Catalysis and new Battery Materials, Drug Discovery and Drug Delivery, and the design of Functional Interfaces. Upgrading the instrument base will also ensure the training provided to research students remains compatible with the instrumentation they will meet in industry, supporting the skills needed by employers and the UK Chemical Industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K039687/1","grantId":"EP/K039687/1","fundValue":"918309","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The impact of this equipment grant will be on all aspects of the Department's research and impact portfolio over the next 10 years or longer.

These materials have applications across all areas of the Department's research activity, ranging, for example, from the development of new anti-malarial agents and inhibitors for human alpha-methylacyl CoA reacemase (AMACR) for the treatment of prostate cancer, through to new catalysts for the hydrogenation of imines. New materials developed by the Department will be investigated for commercial potential. Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
