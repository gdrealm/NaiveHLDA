{"id":"173608C8-9019-4060-BFD1-19659886BB09","title":"Cultural Planning for Sustainable Communities","abstractText":"The research project aims to use cultural planning as a way to explain and value the relationship between the arts &amp; culture and the environment in the UK. Ideas of behaviour towards the natural environment, the countryside and 'ecosystems' - whether urban or rural - tend to lack a cultural dimension, or include the cultural sector of arts organisations, centres, artists and other creatives. This includes community cultures and local cultural amenities, amateur groups and activities. By using cultural mapping, where cultural 'assets' of all kinds can be mapped using local knowledge and various data sources - social/demographic, land-use etc and their catchments/usage, with accompanying visual images and comments 'from below' - a rich landscape of an area's culture can be developed, visualised and appreciated. This inclusive cultural base, which will be developed by this project, will be used to express how community cultures relate to their environments, how they are used and contribute to development and growth decisions and processes e.g. land use development (e.g. new housing, industry), recreation/tourism, heritage, conservation and resource use (e.g. water). \n\nThe project will build on cultural mapping and planning techniques and data/maps developed for area-based 'Living Places' case studies in London, Portsmouth and North Northants, and consult with these local communities and cultural organisations using GIS mapping-Participation workshops in order to test out and articulate this culture-ecosystem relationship; how the two fields inter-act and opportunities for culture-based sustainable development might be taken forward. \n\nIt is hoped that by applying cultural planning and mapping to the planning and ecosystem assessments undertaken by local and national government and their various environmental agencies, that the value of local and regional culture, cultural facilities and activities can be included in decisions over the environment and how we express our relationship and aspirations towards 'nature'. The project seeks to develop detailed guidance on how to incorporate cultural planning within environmental decision-making and assessment using the results from case studies, consultation and practical data mapping tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00414X/1","grantId":"AH/K00414X/1","fundValue":"31734","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  By local communities and agencies in pilot/test bed sites and development areas, LLDC (Olympic Park), Bioregional (environmental awareness), e.g. in urban design, accessibility and community safety.
