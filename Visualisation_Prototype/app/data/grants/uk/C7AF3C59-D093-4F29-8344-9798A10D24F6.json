The technology will simultaneously and unobtrusively provide stress-free monitoring of incremental changes in individual cow condition and lameness to inform and improve nutrition management, cow health, welfare and productivity leading to increased herd lifespan and more efficient milk production. These traits are currently measured by manual visual assessment requiring high skill levels and training, and so are open to the subjectivity of individuals. Our novel imaging technology will enable much more precise, reliable and frequent measurement, creating greater opportunities to improve cow performance and welfare. Individual cow data will be stored within a central web database to enable benchmarking and on-line dissemination of analysed data back to the farmers and others in the value chain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L017407/1","grantId":"BB/L017407/1","fundValue":"209356","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Melvyn  Smith","coPersons":["Lyndon Neal Smith"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
