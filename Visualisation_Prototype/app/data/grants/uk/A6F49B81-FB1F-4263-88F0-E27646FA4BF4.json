We are trying to find ways to encourage repair in individuals that suffer brain or spinal cord injury by studying signalling molecules in nerve cells that are important for axon growth. \n\nAxon regeneration is actively prevented by a variety of proteins made by surrounding cells. An axon responds to these proteins using receptors on its surface that set off a chain of signals within. Axon behaviour can be radically changed using drugs to alter the activities of these signalling molecules. \n\nWe want to improve our understanding of the functions of one very important signalling molecule, called cyclic AMP, which can enhance axon regeneration when activated. We can study its activity and the functions of proteins that it activates in living rat nerve cells in culture using the most modern cell imaging techniques. We can therefore monitor the events that accompany axon contact with tissues, cells and proteins that they encounter in vivo, as well as the effects of using drugs to alter cyclic AMP activity. We aim to provide information that will lead to new approaches to promoting CNS repair in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500801","grantId":"G0500801","fundValue":"298530","fundStart":"2006-04-10","fundEnd":"2009-04-09","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Derryck  Shewan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
