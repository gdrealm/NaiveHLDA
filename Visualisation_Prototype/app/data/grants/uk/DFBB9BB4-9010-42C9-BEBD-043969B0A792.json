{"id":"DFBB9BB4-9010-42C9-BEBD-043969B0A792","title":"The Retirement Transition and the Celtic Fringe: Mobility trends and migrant and rural community well-being","abstractText":"This project seeks evidence of a retirement transition affecting the mobility patterns of the 50-64 year old age group within the UK’s Celtic fringe.&nbsp; The retirement transition concept refers to the behavioural changes affecting pre-retirement age groups, and assumes that the expectation of retirement acts as a catalyst for change, including a change of residence.&nbsp; Such migration is commonly associated with peripheral and scenically attractive areas. Accordingly, the project focuses on rural areas of Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland.\n<br />\n<br />It has two main aims – to examine the retirement transition concept and to evaluate its consequences for an ageing society, individual migrants and rural destination communities.\n<br />\n<br />The methodology involves four main stages. First, an analysis of Census datasets to explore the migration patterns of the 50-64 age cohort. Second, a household survey and migrant interviews to examine the characteristics, origins, decision-making processes, and consequences associated with pre-retirement and other migration flows.&nbsp; Third, a postal survey of non-movers. Fourth, interviews with selected local service providers and local and national policy-makers to consider the implications of retirement transition migration on an ageing society and for the social and economic well-being of rural communities.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G002843/1","grantId":"ES/G002843/1","fundValue":"220589","fundStart":"2008-12-04","fundEnd":"2011-05-02","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Aileen  Stockdale","coPersons":["Lorna Jennifer Philip"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
