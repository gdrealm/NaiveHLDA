Living alone, or solo, is increasingly common across adulthood and has grown particularly rapidly in this age span. Although more concentrated in cities, solo-living is not exclusively an urban phenomenon and the trend may have a significant impact in rural areas. It is particularly important to fragile rural communities to retain people of working and parenting age. This research focuses on solo-living men and women aged 25-44 from large urban areas, remote towns and rural areas in Scotland, an obvious part of the UK in which to do the research. Scotland has a large rural land mass and higher rate of solo-living and lower fertility than other parts of the UK. Men and women are included equally in the study to enable exploration of gender differences and issues. The Scottish Household Survey will provide a sampling frame to identify potential participants in semi-structured interviews. The aims include providing evidence relevant to theoretical debates about social change and to policy discussion concerning the implications of this trend.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0172","grantId":"RES-062-23-0172","fundValue":"230956","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynn  Jamieson","coPersons":["Frances  Wasoff"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
