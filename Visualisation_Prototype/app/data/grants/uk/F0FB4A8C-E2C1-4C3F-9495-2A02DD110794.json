This will lead to better security for these important systems. \n\nBased on what we learn from this analysis we will work with the company Level 3 TRL and Parsons Brinckerhoff to generalise our methods into business processes that other owners of industrial control systems can use to help ensure their systems are safe from cyber attacks.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M002845/1","grantId":"EP/M002845/1","fundValue":"395222","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Clive  Roberts","coPersons":["Mark  Ryan","Xiao-Ping  Zhang","Tom C Chothia"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
