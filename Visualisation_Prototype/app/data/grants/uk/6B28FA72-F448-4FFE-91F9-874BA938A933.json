When detached from ambient cues, circadian clock cycle ('freerun') at periods slightly different from 24 hr. This endogenous rhythm is adjusted to the 24 hr solar day by entrainment to various stimuli, primarily light. Modern life introduces situations, such as trans-atlantic flights and shift work, where the circadian rhythm and the external light cycle are too dissimilar to reconcile; accumulating evidence suggests that people exposed repeatedly to such disruptions suffer from wide range of health problems, including 'jetlag', sleep disorders, seasonal depression, and cancer. In the last few decades, a great deal has been learned about the molecular details of the clock. Drosophila has been instrumental in identifying circadian clock genes, which are well conserved in mammals, both in sequence and function. By inducing mutagenesis and screening for Drosophila mutants that show aberrant light response, two proteins were identified to be involved in light transduction: TIMELESS (TIM), which is a circadian light-sensitive core-clock protein, and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), a dedicated blue-light photoreceptor of the circadian system. These two proteins interact with each other, and light-activated CRY attaches itself to TIM, degrading it rapidly. Our research at the University of Leicester focuses on natural genetic variation related to circadian photo-responsiveness. Rather than inducing random mutations, we aim to understand the clock mechanism by identifying natural variants, or natural clock alleles that have been evolved in different wild populations, serving as molecular adaptations under different light and temperature conditions. In collaboration with CPK and ER at Leicester and the Costa lab at Padova, we have identified a natural polymorphism in Timeless that involves a single-base insertion/deletion, situated between two alternative translation starts. We have found that this polymorphism follows a robust latitudinal cline and is maintained by directional selection. We subsequently tested natural isolates and transformants flies and found that photo-responsiveness is significantly different between flies with the different alleles. This difference was correlated with the variation we have observed in the photoperiodic response of flies with the different alleles suggesting that this polymorphism represents molecular adaptation to cold environments. Recently, another protein named JETLAG (JET) has been identified as being involved in light-induced degradation of TIM. Interestingly, it turns out that the phenotype of jet mutants is only expressed in strains carrying a specific natural tim allele. These discoveries have demonstrated how natural genetic variation modulates light sensitivity of the circadian clock, and how in turn, could the better characterization of natural adaptations lead to a better understanding of the circadian-clock mechanism. The current proposal is aimed at identifying natural variation in clock genes by testing strains derived from wild-populations, using tools of quantitative genetics combined with molecular techniques. We propose to use various genome-wide screens to identify these variations, including Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping, artificial selection and global expression analysis. Our preliminary QTL screen indicated four genomic regions (QTLs) that show significant contribution to variation in circadian light-sensitivity. By using various deficiency and mutant strains we will carry complementation tests that will allow us to identify the causal sequence variations that account for these variations. The results of this study will allow a better understanding of light entrainment of the clock, and provide candidate genes for studying in mammals, including human.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G02085X/1","grantId":"BB/G02085X/1","fundValue":"293672","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eran  Tauber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" The project was aimed at identifying natural polymorphisms in genes that modulate circadian light sensitivity and serve as molecular adaptations in various light/temperature conditions.\n We assayed the circadian photosensitivity of 123 recombinant inbred (RI) strains generated at the lab of Sergey Nuzhdin at the University of Southern California. Extensive variation in the light response of these lines indicated a substantial heritability of 30% . Interval mapping has indicated a single significant QTL on chromosome 2. We used quantitative deficiency complementation tests, using fly strain carrying defined chromosomal deletions, and refined this QTL interval into two smaller QTL consisting of 140 candidate genes. Complementation tests to null mutation strains suggested segregating alleles of timeless (tim) (and possible cycle ) contribute to the variation in light response. Further genotyping revealed that the previously reported (European) s/ls polymorphism in tim is segregating in our RI strain collection (derived from North-America population), and as expected, is associated with variation in light response of RI strains.\n To identify candidate genes within these QTLs we carried a global gene expression profiling by microarrays. Two recombinant inbred lines that show different photo-sensitivity, 104 (High) and 58 (Low) were used. RNA was extracted from heads of treated (light-pulse at Zt15) and the control flies (no-pulse), and labelled cDNA was generated and hybridised (a two colour design) to Drosophila oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified the top 500 genes that show large fold change in strain 104 (H), compared to 58 (L). Six genes are located in the QTL interval and may serve as candidates for causative genes underlying the light-sensitivity QTL. A manuscript summarising the QTL mapping is in preparation. \nIn another set of experiments we profiled gene expression in a laboratory wild-type strain (Canton-S) using Affymetrix GeneChips. To date, this is the first dataset in Drosophila showing the whole transcriptome response to light pulse. The analysis revealed 209 differentially expressed genes, with several biological processes such as signal transduction, gene regulation, glutamate receptor activity, cellular communication and chromatin remodelling were statistically over-represented. Targeted knockdown of these genes by dsRNAi in clock neurons has further demonstrated the role of these genes in the light response. In addition, the microarray experiments indicated that histone modifications may also play an important role in light entrainment of the clock. Consistently, an aberrant light response was associated with 6 genes, using mutant and transgenic strains in which histone acetylation, de-acetylation, and methylation (of DNA and histones) is defective. Our study has generated a large number of candidate genes that play important role in light entrainment of the circadian clock. This provide ideal starting point for other research team to explore the mechanism by which these gene (or genetic variation which these gene) regulate circadian sensitivity. Given the high level of conservation of the circadian system in flies and in human, these candidate genes are likely to be useful for diagnostic of health issues relate to light entrainment of the clock in human, including seasonal depression and shift-word associated sleep disorders.
