The Nordic/Baltic region combines established, aligned and non-aligned democracies and post-communist states, wedged between stable Scandinavia and unstable Russia in a way that no other region in Europe does. From a British perspective, the region has mental similarities&nbsp;- firmly in Europe, yet somehow not quite&nbsp;- and historically significant ties to the United Kingdom, most recently highlighted by financial ties to the Nordic countries and&nbsp; the remarkably high numbers of migrants from the Baltic states. </p>\n\n<p>The Nordic and Baltic states are under-researched, yet provide an ideal ground for analysing the dynamic interplay between economic, cultural and historical factors and testing hypotheses about region-building processes (eg within the frameworks of the EU and NATO) and convergence (eg economic, social and health policy, value orientations). <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0747","grantId":"RES-451-26-0747","fundValue":"6901","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Charles Mole","coPersons":["Jan Titus Hjelm","Mary Katherine Hilson","Allan  Sikk"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The seminar series successfully brought together academics and practitioners working on a broad range of social, political and economic issues. Those with an existing knowledge of the region were able to develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the Nordic and Baltic lands, while for the larger majority, for whom the area was less well known, the presentations and subsequent discussions introduced them to an important but underanalysed region, challenging stereotypes and highlighting the key roles these states play in the broader regional and European context. The presenters were able to make contacts across disciplinary and geographical boundaries and obtain in-valuable feedback on their papers, in preparation for submission to academic journals. \n\nThe seminar series has allowed us to develop collaborations with the representatives of the region's diplomatic missions in London, with Embassy staff in attendance at some of the seminars including three Ambassadors (Iceland, Latvia and Finland) and several deputy heads of mission. The Norwegian Embassy funded the travel expenses of one speaker.\n\nThe final seminar in the series, &quot;Lessons from the North?&quot; was organised as a collaboration with the Finnish Institute in London as part of their education series. The audience consisted mainly of teachers, educationalists and journalists. The Finnish education system in particular continues to generate much interest among UK educationalists and policymakers, along with other aspects of education policy in the region, e.g. the Swedish free schools and although it is difficult to gauge the impact of this particular seminar, it has to be seen in the context of this wider interest. One of the journalists present was speaking to speakers and participants as part of the preparation for a BBC documentary on Finnish education which is planned to be filmed during the autumn. Following the event Mary Hilson was invited to attend a House of Commons seminar on Finnish education. See also the posts at http://blog.finnish-institute.org.uk/.
