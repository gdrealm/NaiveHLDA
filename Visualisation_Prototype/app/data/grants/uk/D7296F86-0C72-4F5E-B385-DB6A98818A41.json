The methodology, exploiting reactivity of singlet oxygen in diastereo- and enantioselective reactions, will be developed. The proposed methodology is, uniquely, based on the synergy between recently discovered highly effective generation of 1O2, mediated by silicon nanocrystals assemblies, and the novel reaction engineering concept of multifunctional structured reactors with imbedded light-emitting diodes. The proposal identifies the significant potential of adopting new concepts of process intensification (via non-thermal activation and miniaturisation, i.e. enhanced mass and heat transfer) and functional nanomaterials in clean organic catalysis. Most significantly, the proposal addresses the underdevelopments in the areas of clean organic synthesis and non-thermal activation of molecules.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E012183/2","grantId":"EP/E012183/2","fundValue":"49197","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexei  Lapkin","coPersons":["Dmitry  Kovalev"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
