{"id":"CA292CBB-3F83-4405-90AF-ECD34A33D83E","title":"Oxidized phospholipid ionic transduction mechanism of human vascular cells","abstractText":"At least half of the European population dies from cardiovascular disease, often prematurely and following prolonged periods of disability. There is compelling evidence that this type of disease and several related diseases are caused, or accelerated, by unwanted inflammation, excessive oxidative stress, inactivity, and high fat load. Seminal studies over the past decade have identified special types of fat (lipid) in the disease conditions that are collectively referred to as oxidized phospholipids. There is excellent evidence that oxidized phospholipids play pivotal roles in cardiovascular disease but there is little fundamental understanding of how cells sense or respond to the lipids; or defend against them. In our new studies of vascular cells from patients with cardiovascular disease we have identified a striking initial reception mechanism for the lipids and so propose investigation of how the mechanism works as well as identification of genes that encode the mechanism. Through this work we will provide new insight into an important and poorly understood area of human biology and lay the foundations for valuable therapeutic interventions with high relevance to major human diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901761","grantId":"G0901761","fundValue":"576725","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Beech","coPersons":["Martin  Stacey","Asipu  Sivaprasadarao","Karen Elizabeth Porter","Mark  Kearney"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
