{"id":"8A9613E7-D210-440B-BEAC-A731A571551E","title":"Cellular and Viral Immunology Resource at the Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff University","abstractText":"Research in general is very labour intensive, often requiring large quantities of reagents for use in experiments. Thus, a lot of time and effort is required just for reagent generation, even before any experiments can be carried out. The idea of this proposal is to fund a facility that specializes in large-scale reagent generation (including antibodies, soluble proteins, cell lines and viruses), which can then support the research of multiple projects and collaborations. In so doing, it facilitates all of the studies, allowing more time for the researchers to carry out actual experiments rather than spending inordinate amounts of time generating reagents. In addition, it brings together researchers from different backgrounds with different expertise, allowing interaction and complimentation to enhance the research. Finally, such a facility would provide a bank of resources that can then be used whenever needed in the future. In this way, it will enhance the productivity and progress of immunological research at the Wales College of Medicine, as well as research associated with it nationally and internationally. This research ranges from understanding the basic mechanisms that control inflammation and immunity (to viruses, cancers or self ), to studies investigating arthritis and the way that disease-causing pathogens such as persistent viruses impact on the immune response. The results of this research will be presented at conferences and to wider audiences as it advances.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500617","grantId":"G0500617","fundValue":"188883","fundStart":"2006-04-23","fundEnd":"2010-01-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Eddie Chung Wang","coPersons":["Awen  Gallimore"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
