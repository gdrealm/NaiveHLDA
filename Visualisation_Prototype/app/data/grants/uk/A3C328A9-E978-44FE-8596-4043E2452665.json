This strong growth occurs because the legumes are infected by bacteria (called rhizobia), which can capture N2 gas from the atmosphere and convert it to a form (ammonia), that can be used by the legumes. In order for rhizobia to efficiently infect legume roots, they must attach to root-hair cells, where they produce chemicals that induce changes in the legume root allowing infection to occur. The way that rhizobia attach to root hairs is unusual / they stick on in a polar manner using one of their ends. In contrast rhizobia grown in the laboratory attach side-on to glass surfaces. We have recently shown that an unknown compound that is exuded by pea roots enables Rhizobium leguminosarum to stick end-on to glass surfaces. In this work we will identify what this compound is and how it promotes this end-on attachment. This will involve identifying which genes are induced during end-on attachment, defining (by mutagenesis) the genes that are required for attachment and identifying if any of the induced proteins are targeted to the bacterial poles. We will analyse how the root exudate compound induces the gene induction required for the end-on attachment and where and when this induction occurs. By analysing legume infection by the mutant bacteria we will determine the contribution of end-on attachment to legume infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E017045/1","grantId":"BB/E017045/1","fundValue":"438195","fundStart":"2007-09-18","fundEnd":"2010-09-17","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"J Allan Downie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
