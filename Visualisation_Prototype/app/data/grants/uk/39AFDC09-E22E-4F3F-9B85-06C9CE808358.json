In this project we propose to undertake an ambitious programme of study designed to probe whether conformationally dynamic biphenyls can be combined with simple chiral amines to generate a diverse array of organic catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. As part of this study we plan to investigate application of these catalysts in a range of important carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond forming processes. This project will involve a combination of traditional organic synthesis, computational chemistry and robotic synthesis/screening, and we believe that our established expertise in these areas will ensure a high degree of success.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064295/1","grantId":"EP/D064295/1","fundValue":"342037","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Barry  Lygo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
