This proposal will provide essential core facilities that will allow scientific discoveries to be more rapidly realized in clinical treatments. One of the problems in drug development is the amount of time to bring a scientific idea to the clinic. By centralizing resources across the cardiff/Bristol Alliance this should allow researches in both universities to engage in more collaboration and thereby more rapidly take ideas and realize them as novel treatments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801676","grantId":"G0801676","fundValue":"416908","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Topley","coPersons":["Timothy James  Peters"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
