The conventional method of cement production is to heat limestone and clay together in kilns at temoeratures equal to or greater than 1450 degC and then to grind the material to the required particle size. For each tonne of product a similar amount of CO2 is produced, leading to global emissions of 1,800 Mt CO2 per annum. Cement therefore has a high embodied energy (up to 6 GJ/tonne) in terms of heating and grinding. In addition, cement is a globally important product. It is used to produce 6000 Mm3 of concrete annually at a global sales value of 450,000M and concrete is the principal material used by the construction industry, a sector that accounts for 11% of global GDP (10% of UK GDP) and employs more than 100 million people worldwide (1.5M in the UK). Hence, there is no doubt of the global importance of cement, which comes at the price of significant environmental impacts.Since the market for cement is of very high volume but the value of the product itself is relatively low (50/tonne), the cement industry is slow to incorporate significant process changes to reduce its emissions. However, if we are serious about meeting the challenges of climate change, new methods of manufacturing such products must be developed to reduce the energy demand and, hence, the subsequent CO2 emission levels. This proposal seeks to do just that, by massively reducing the emissions of CO2 from cement production through the novel synthesis of anhydrous cement phases using a molten salt route, reducing the total energy required and the temperatures involved, thereby allowing renewable energy sources to be integrated with the process (i.e. lower temperatures can be provided by electric heating, rather than by fossil fuel firing). The work will apply equilibrium thermodynamic modelling of molten salt systems to guide experimental synthesis of the main tri-calcium silicate product and will also investigate the possibility of using similar routes to produce other principal cement clinker minerals (bespoke cements that are attractive to industry and are, hence, of higher value, up to 250/tonne). The energy requirements of each synthetic route will be determined alongside the chemical kinetics of formation of the compounds in the melts, whilst the crucial high-temperature separation stage will be investigated experimentally. The results of the research will go a long way to optimising the new process with respect to commercial exploitation.This proposal represents an innovative, radical approach to the development of green and sustainable technologies through the development of novel, complex chemistry and high-temperature (up to 800 degC) process engineering. The proposed work programme is multidisciplinary in nature, involving chemical engineers, material scientists, chemists and geochemists and incorporating a high level of expertise in the manufacture of cement, its chemical and physical properties and in molten salt systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F014449/1","grantId":"EP/F014449/1","fundValue":"620431","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2011-07-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stefaan Jan Rogier Simons","coPersons":["Paul  Barnes","Jeremy Karl Cockcroft"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" We have shown that a major component of cement, Belite or dicalcium silicate, can be synthesised in molten sodium chloride (NaCl) (common table salt) using calcium carbonate and silicon dioxide. We have managed to produce belite at the lowest temperatures ever reported (908 deg.C), which is significantly lower than the reaction temperature required in a kiln during the production of ordinary portland cement (OPC, 1450 deg C) and even belite cements (typically 1300 deg C). What is more, the belite so produced has been stabilised under ambient conditons without using any kind of doping, usually required to stop it converting to its orthorhombic form.\n\n \n\nThe interdependencies of the reactions behind each of the process routes in NaCl were represented in the form of predominance diagrams and the solubility products, heats of mixing and phase diagram measurements were used for material and energy balance and thermodynamic modelling calculations. These helped make a decision on the best economical route to belite manufacture. The synthesis of belite in a molten salt negates the need for a kiln in which cement clinkers are conventionally formed. This means that heat losses will be significantly reduced. The net energy balance for OPC manufacture has been calculated as being 1674-1799 kJ/kg. In practice, this value is considerably larger (3100-3600 kJ/kg) due to heat losses in the flue gases, from the kiln and from the hot clinker discharged to the cooler.
