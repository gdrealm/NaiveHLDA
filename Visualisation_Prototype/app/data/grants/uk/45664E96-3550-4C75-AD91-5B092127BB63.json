{"id":"45664E96-3550-4C75-AD91-5B092127BB63","title":"Punishing Protest","abstractText":"Do people who live in liberal democracies have a right to protest against the policies and practices of their society? If so, what are the legal and moral limits of this right to protest? And, how defensible are the various ways in which liberal societies typically respond to people who engage in private or public protest? \\n\\nIn my work Punishing Protest, I consider what it means to be a responsible member of a liberal society. Following philosophers like Socrates and John Stuart Mill, I argue that participating responsibly in a liberal democracy does not mean simply following the established norms and policies of that society. Participating responsibly means acting in a way that honours the genuine values that underpin this kind of society. And this can require that one protest against policies that contravene those values. \\n\\nThe term 'protest' picks out a certain attitude or intention toward an action. The action in question need not be public. One need not aim to communicate one's attitude through one's action. An action qualifies as protest when it is undertaken with an attitude of sincere and serious disagreement. \\n\\nA full discussion of defensible protest requires that we consider a wide range of state sanctioned and unsanctioned activities. Examples include: 1) a judge's decision not to convict an obviously guilty person, 2) a doctor's refusal to perform an authorised procedure or her decision to perform an unauthorised procedure, 3) a military officer's conscientious refusal to follow an order, 4) a patient's refusal of a medical service such as a blood transfusion or inoculation, 5) employees' engagement in a legal or illegal strike, 6) collective boycotts, as well as various other activities such as lobbying, resignation in protest, emigration, protest voting, refusal to vote, public advocacy of illegal protest, radical public expression, incitement, organised violent protest, and rioting. \\n\\nAlthough several philosophical books critically examine specific types of protest, there is no philosophical monograph that I am aware of that analyses the moral and legal defensibility of the myriad of ways in which we protest in liberal regimes. I shall argue, amongst other things, that certain legal defences should be available to persons who engage in suitably constrained forms of illegal protest. Two defences I shall support are a necessity defence (which public protesters rarely have used successfully) and a demands-of-conscience defence. \\n\\nIn addition, I question the justifiability of typical legal and political responses to protest including censorship, obstruction, stigmatisation, forced compliance, penalisation, state punishment, and military action. \\n\\nThis work seeks to offer both a fuller understanding of the many ways in which we do, and should, protest in liberal societies and an account of why protest should be tolerated and protected in liberal regimes. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G006040/1","grantId":"AH/G006040/1","fundValue":"25437","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Kimberley Lauren Brownlee","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
