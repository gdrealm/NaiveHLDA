Recently there have been several fundamental developments which have been used to solve a number of longstanding problems. The new strategically important developments are related to the names of V. Voevodsky (Fields Medal 2002), M. Rost, A. Suslin, I. Panin, M. Levine, F. Morel.\n\nThe principal aim of this project is to investigate enriched motivic homotopy theory. It is hoped that its study will shed light on some classical problems in A^1-topology. We propose to use its methods to construct various triangulated categories of motives, one of the central objects of study in modern A^1-topology. We believe that these constructions will have important computational advantages. The homotopy-theoretic outlook that we develop is likely to be useful in other areas of mathematics such as algebraic topology and non-commutative geometry.\n\nThe research will be undertaken in the Department of Mathematics, Swansea University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J013064/1","grantId":"EP/J013064/1","fundValue":"22213","fundStart":"2012-04-15","fundEnd":"2012-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Grigory  Garkusha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
