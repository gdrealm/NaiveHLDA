Previous research has suggested that estimation is affected by the way we mentally represent numbers along a 'number line'.&nbsp; If our mental representations correspond with actual mathematical representations then our estimations stand a better chance of being accurate. Importantly, non-linear representations might hold back the development of mathematical skills and concepts. The experimental research project will involve small teams of psychologists collecting data from children in the UK as well as from China. This will allow cross-cultural comparisons of number skills and help to understand reasons behind current differences in numerical confidence and competence between these countries.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F028326/1","grantId":"ES/F028326/1","fundValue":"124820","fundStart":"2008-08-18","fundEnd":"2009-10-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We anticipated that the research grant would have more immediate impact in the academic sector (i.e., developmental psychology) than the educational sector, where theories of number estimation are played out. A key finding of the project is that estimation linearity is not a critical driver of early mathematical ability, and thus does not offer an immediate, tangible educational tool. Nonetheless, the research clearly speaks to the general question of children's mathematical development, which is of direct applied interest. Our ouputs have been cited by others working in this area, but we will try and exploit the research findings for their educational impact as additional analyses continue and opportunities arise for applying the work.  ","person":"Kevin Peter Muldoon","coPersons":["John Nicholas Towse"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":" A key finding of the project wa that nuemrical estimation linearity - contrary to extant literature elsewhere - was not a critical driver of early mathematical ability. Our interpretation is that the quality of children’s representations of number might be important for some early numeracy targets but are unlikely to be crucial for others. Particularly striking – again, with respect to previous literature which finds Chinese children far in advance of North American children – our cross-cultural comparisons revealed that the numerical ability of Chinese children is comparable to children from the UK in the early years of School. There are many potential directions for developing the research work in the future. For example, there is still little known about the causal agents responsible for changes in children’s estimation accuracy. If it was possible to experimentally isolate these factors, then researchers might usefully attempt early intervention to enhance estimation skill. A different issue arises from conducting further work to integrate number estimation skills into mathematical cognition, to consider how representations of magnitude affect (if at all) number processing. In sum, we believe that further work pursuing the ambition of the current project will yield additional insight for researchers. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
