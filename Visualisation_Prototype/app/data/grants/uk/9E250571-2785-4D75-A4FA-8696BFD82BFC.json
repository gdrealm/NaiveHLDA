The display is primarily aimed at non-specialist users, and constitutes a valuable educational resource for schools and universities, not least in providing information about the castle and its role in urban life. As part of a more comprehensive website of Norwich’s heritage sites, it assists HEART in its mission to promote and preserve Norwich’s remarkable cultural assets and to provide other civic bodies with materials that will assist in their own conservation projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H500316/1","grantId":"AH/H500316/1","fundValue":"23225","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Steve  Cherry","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
