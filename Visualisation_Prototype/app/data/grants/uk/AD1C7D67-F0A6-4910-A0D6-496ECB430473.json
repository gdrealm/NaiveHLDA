Corporate governance has a central role to play in helping to increase the flow and lower the cost of the financial capital that firms need to finance their investment activity. The importance of this role has grown considerably in recent years, and the findings of this book emphasize that the standard of corporate governance matters significantly for developing countries. The event highlighted the key message that improved corporate governance can contribute to sustained productivity growth and stability of institutions. This has generated an interest in understanding the multi-dimensional and interdisciplinary aspects of corporate governance among the research community.
