{"id":"A8EED31D-1FBF-4C4C-A5AC-BD7F91FAF34F","title":"Plasticity of neurone to glial signalling in the cerebellum","abstractText":"The brain is composed of billions of neurones, which conduct electrical signals and are connected by specialized junctions known as synapses. At the synapse, an incoming electrical signal causes the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter, which crosses the synapse and binds to specific receptor proteins, thereby initiating an electrical impulse in the cell on the other side of the synapse. An important property of synapses is that the strength of synaptic transmission can be modified, depending on the frequency with which electrical excitation occurs. This principle is known as 'synaptic plasticity' and is thought to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. Neurones are outnumbered in the brain ten-fold by a second class of cells known as astrocytes, which provide support to the neurones, and are electrically non-excitable. However, in recent years it has been discovered that astrocytes also have receptor molecules similar to those found at neuronal synapses. Astrocytes form a sheath around synapses, and can respond to release of neurotransmitter by initiating biochemical signalling pathways - in particular, by accumulating calcium ions - and can release other transmitters to modulate synaptic strength. In this way, astrocytes and neurones can communicate information with one another. We have been investigating neurone to astrocyte signalling in a region of the brain responsible for muscle coordination called the cerebellum. We discovered that the strength of neurone to astrocyte signalling could also be changed by the frequency of activity at the synapse: astrocytes also express plasticity. Interestingly, the pattern of plasticity of astrocyte receptors was very different from the plasticity at the synapse that the astrocyte ensheathed. The aim of this project is to investigate the plasticity of neurone to astrocyte signalling in more detail. The biochemical mechanism by which astrocyte signalling is altered will be explored, and the impact of the plasticity on the strength and timing of synaptic transmission will be determined. We will then investigate another type of synapse, to see if the plasticity we have observed is a general mechanism for modifying cell to cell communication in the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018501/1","grantId":"BB/D018501/1","fundValue":"302493","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2009-10-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  To date, there are no direct impacts beyond the academic community that can be attributed specifically to the work carried out under this grant. However, the work has contributed to outreach activities carried out by the group at both the Babraham Institute and University of Nottingham. In these cases school children (primary and secondary), members of the local community and work experience candidates have been shown how the laboratory operates, and had some of our research activities explained in a broad neuroscience context. As such, the research has contributed to engagement with the wider community, resulting in a societal impact in communicating our research and the role of and culture of the institution to non-specialist audiences.

The mechanism, locus, specificity and time course of plasticity were determined, and some potential physiological roles identified. It is possible that this knowledge may lead to new targets for drug development in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.
