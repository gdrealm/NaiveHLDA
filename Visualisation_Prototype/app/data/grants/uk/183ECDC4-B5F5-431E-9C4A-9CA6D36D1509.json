{"id":"183ECDC4-B5F5-431E-9C4A-9CA6D36D1509","title":"Responsible Innovation Framework: Scoping Study and Science - Policy Seminar","abstractText":"<p>An outline framework for responsible innovation was developed, grounded in a prospective model of responsibility. Within this four ‘dimensions of responsible innovation’ were developed which emphasise that innovation should be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>anticipatory - describing and analysing intended and potentially unintended impacts that might arise from the innovation, economic, social, environmental or otherwise</li>\n\n <li>reflective - ethically reflecting on the purposes of, motivations for and potential impacts of the innovation, and the associated uncertainties, areas of ignorance, assumptions, questions and dilemmas</li>\n\n <li>deliberative - inclusively opening up such visions, impacts and questioning to broad, collective&nbsp; deliberation through processes of dialogue, engagement and debate</li>\n\n <li>responsive - using this collective process of reflexivity to influence the direction and pace of the innovation process through effective processes of governance. This should be iterative, inclusive, open and flexible.&nbsp;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We applied these dimensions around an emerging area of controversial science, climate engineering as a case study, embedding them within a stage gate model of innovation governance that materially influenced the trajectory of this research at RCUK. The findings were discussed at a science - policy workshop at RCUK, RCUK Public Engagement Advisory Panel and specific recommendations will be considered at EPSRC Council and ESRC Research Committee later this year.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-077-26-0001","grantId":"RES-077-26-0001","fundValue":"57964","fundStart":"2011-03-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The research undertaken under this grant was used by EPSRC as a framework for responsible innovation, and formally published as an EPSRC policy in the Autumn of 2013 (http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/framework/) The framework has been used within the synthetic biology domain in EPSRC joint investments with Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board) and within the EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training. The work was also used to guide decision making within the RCUK geoengineering area.

This was used in a case study in the geoengineering area ('SPICE' project) as a testbed for its refinement and implementation. The research was evaluated as 'outstanding' by ESRC The research culminated in an EPSRC policy for responsible innovation, has been a key input into deliberations by the European Commission and has been used by Innovate UK in the synthetic biology area.
