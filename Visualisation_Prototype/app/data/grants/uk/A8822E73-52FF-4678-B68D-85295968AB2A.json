Until recently, only a few of them had been identified. But now it has been discovered that they exist in huge abundance. The goal of this project is to classify all Small Wild Factors by using groups to measure them. Groups are fundamental algebraic entities arising from considerations of symmetry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D075122/1","grantId":"EP/D075122/1","fundValue":"55457","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2007-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"JDMaitland  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
