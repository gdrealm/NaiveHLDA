We will examine how an important part of the outside of the bacterium, a molecule called peptidoglycan (PG), affects the ability of this bug to cause blood stream infection. We will find out how PG is made by bacteria and how the human body recognises PG and responds to it. Humans have receptors called Nods that bind to PG and this leads to the inflammatory response to infection which can be harmful to us when we have infections. Remarkably PG is present in all bacteria and Nods are found in plants as well as animals. So the way they interact is of fundamental importance in understanding how infections are dealt with and removed by the body. Neisseria meningitidis is a dangerous bacterium and finding out how it causes disease will help us come up with ways of blocking infection, either by killing the bacterium or stopping the damage it causes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601195","grantId":"G0601195","fundValue":"361902","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christoph Marcel Tang","coPersons":["Stephen E Girardin","Ivo Gomperts Boneca"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
