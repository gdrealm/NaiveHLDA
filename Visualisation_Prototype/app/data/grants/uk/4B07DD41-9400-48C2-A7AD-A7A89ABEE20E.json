{"id":"4B07DD41-9400-48C2-A7AD-A7A89ABEE20E","title":"Understanding Nuclear RNA Quality Control in Mammalian Nervous System","abstractText":"Expression of our genes proceeds through several carefully orchestrated steps including transcription and processing of primary transcripts into mature messenger molecules, export of the messengers from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and their translation into corresponding protein products. This elaborate process is required for precise regulation of cell- and tissue-specific gene expression programmes, which, in turn, is indispensable for proper development and function of the organism. Conversely, defects in gene expression processes have been linked to several human diseases including neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions such as myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and possibly Alzheimer's disease. These devastating disorders are associated with considerable patient suffering and mortality as well as a serious burden for the national health system.\n\nNotably, cells employ quality control (QC) mechanisms that can minimise deleterious effects of erroneous gene expression by identifying and eliminating defective messenger molecules. An important but poorly understood branch of the cellular QC prevents export of incompletely processed gene transcripts containing intervening intron sequences from the nucleus to the cytoplasm thus preventing their translation into aberrant proteins. Transcripts retained by this mechanism in the nucleus are eventually eliminated. Previous studies by our group and others have suggested that, in addition to its error surveillance role, this nuclear retention and elimination (NRE) pathway may function in the context of developing nervous system (NS) as a regulatory mechanism enabling deterministic control of important neuronal genes. However, molecular mechanisms underlying NRE in human and animal cells in general and NS cells in particular are poorly understood.\n\nTo this end, we propose to investigate mammalian NRE machinery using a combination of candidate and unbiased discovery approaches. We additionally propose to examine developmental changes in the NRE apparatus and their biological consequences in the NS context. To advance these lines of research, we will use a combination of established molecular, cellular and developmental biology techniques and will additionally develop innovative experimental approaches. We are convinced that the proposed work will shed light on molecular mechanisms ensuring accuracy of our gene expression programme and begin uncovering novel gene regulation mechanisms contributing to NS development and function. By elucidating these important aspects the proposed work should also improve our understanding of molecular causes leading to NS diseases and ultimately pave the way to new knowledge-based therapies and diagnostic tools.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M001199/1","grantId":"BB/M001199/1","fundValue":"601716","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2017-12-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eugene  Makeyev","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
