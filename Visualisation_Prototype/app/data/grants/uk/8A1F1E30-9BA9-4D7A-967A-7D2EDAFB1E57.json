This diversity arises in part from asymmetric cell divisions in which cell fate determinants are segregated unequally between the two sister cells. Accordingly, they differ in their intended fate and will perform different tasks. Of particular importance is the asymmetric nature of stem-cell divisions: one daughter cell commits to differentiate, while the other remains undifferentiated, thus preserving its stem-cell potential to generate diverse cell types. We study the mechanisms underlying differential fate in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (baker's yeast), a unicellular organism dividing asymmetrically into a larger mother cell and a bud. In yeast, asymmetric segregation (mother vs. bud-bound) of the spindle poles effectively orients the mitotic spindle, a cellular machinery that drives the accurate distribution of the genetic material. This process is partly directed by Bud6, a protein marking the bud cell inner surface to attract interactions from the spindle pole destined to the bud by a process known as cortical capture. Bud6 has the remarkable property of accumulating at two distinct locations in a temporally regulated manner: first to the surface of the emerging bud and later to the bud neck, a constriction at the boundary between the bud and the mother cell that ultimately constitutes the site for cell division. The spindle poles can respond to these changes in the intracellular landscape and become positioned within the right compartment -one pole is directed to the bud while the remaining pole is retained within the mother cell. Here we propose to identify cellular components working along with Bud6 to elucidate the mechanism for these asymmetric interactions and the basis for cortical capture. The project will entail the following steps that take advantage of the ease of genetic manipulation possible in budding yeast. First, we will exploit the use of mutations to further dissect the function of Bud6 by defining a minimal part of this protein sufficient for cortical capture. Second, we will employ mutations to disable cellular components suspected of working together with Bud6. The impact of these manipulations on processes normally driven by Bud6 will be assessed by visualising the resulting behaviour in the mutant cells by microscopy methods. Third, we will determine if these components truly interact with Bud6. We will purify Bud6 from cells under conditions that may allow the isolation of a complex containing Bud6 bound to other proteins. The composition of these complexes can be determined by established methods and tools available as a result of the elucidation of the sequence of the yeast DNA genome. Studies in model systems like yeast have proven invaluable in understanding principles of embryonic development and are likely to advance our knowledge of fundamental aspects of stem cell biology with concomitant impact in human disease and therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E006272/1","grantId":"BB/E006272/1","fundValue":"325086","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been reported in a number of publications. The latest was in Current Biology 2012. We are trying to continue this work (the role of Bud6 in cortical capture) conditioned to grant funding. We have supplied the crucial constructs for protein expression in bacteria to colleagues in the US. We also received other requests for yeast strains and deletion plasmids, also from the US. We are attempting to continue work on the mechanism of Kar9 polarisation. Again, the prospects for this work are seriously tied with our ability to obtain grant funding.

These findings provide important missing links for understanding how spindle orientation, cell polarity and cell division patterning are coupled in yeast. A detailed mechanism should be demonstrated by setting up a reconstitution system. The fact that we succeeded in purifying recombinant Bud6 is a critical milestone to this longer term goal. This work would have been possible in our lab conditioned to funding. I have supplied all our constructs to a colleague in the US who can realize this potential.
