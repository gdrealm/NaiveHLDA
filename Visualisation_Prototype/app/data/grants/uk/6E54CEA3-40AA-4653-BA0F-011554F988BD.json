The disease occurs in tropical and subtropical countries where it is becoming a rapidly increasing threat to health, currently affecting around 50 million people per year. In its more severe forms Dengue can cause haemorrhagic fever which is life threatening. There is a great need for an effective Dengue vaccine. These studies to understand the immune response to Dengue virus are designed to aid in this effort.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600000","grantId":"G0600000","fundValue":"335239","fundStart":"2007-08-28","fundEnd":"2010-08-27","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Juthathip  Mongkolsapaya","coPersons":["Gavin Robert Screaton"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
