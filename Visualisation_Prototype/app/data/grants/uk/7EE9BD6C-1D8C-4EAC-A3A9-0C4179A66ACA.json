Light signals are perceived by specialised photoreceptors, which include the red and far-red light-absorbing phytochromes and the blue light-absorbing cryptochromes. Although a minor component of sunlight, UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) is a major regulator of plant metabolism and development. The much sought-after UV-B photoreceptor has recently been identified as the 7-bladed propeller protein, UVR8. Although plants perceive the full sunlight spectrum, UV-B signalling has traditionally been studied in isolation from other photoreceptor networks. The dwarf phenotype of UV-B-treated plants is well-established but the molecular mechanisms underpinning this striking developmental adaptation are unknown. Our recent work has identified a novel molecular mechanism through which UV-B regulates plant architecture, via direct crosstalk with phytochrome and cryptochrome signalling pathways. The proposed research programme will build on these exciting findings to gain deeper molecular understanding of sunlight signalling in plants. More specifically, we aim to understand how UV-B perceived by UVR8 controls the agriculturally-important shade avoidance response.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M008711/1","grantId":"BB/M008711/1","fundValue":"415275","fundStart":"2015-05-31","fundEnd":"2018-05-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Keara Ann  Franklin","coPersons":["Gareth Islwyn  Jenkins"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
