{"id":"2DC4C08A-E398-4216-849A-BB157E20CC28","title":"Vegetarianism as Spiritual Choice in Historical and Contemporary Theology","abstractText":"What are the links between people's beliefs and the foods they choose to eat? In the modern Western world, dietary choices are a topic of ethical and political debate, but how can centuries of Christian thought and practice also inform them? And how do reasons for abstaining from particular foods in the modern world compare with earlier ones? This project seeks to shed new light on vegetarianism and related forms of dietary choice by situating them in the context of historic Christian practice. \nChristianity is conspicuous among the modern world's religions in having few dietary rules or customs. This has not, however, been the case throughout Christian history. Medieval monasticism was, for instance, ordered by a complex polyphony of dietary rules and customs. It is true that modern vegetarianism cannot be equated with medieval practice\nBecause of very different attitudes to religion and the body, above all a highly developed ascetic tradition. Asceticism and the theology surrounding it can, however, illuminate many aspects of vegetarianism and related issues of diet and health in the modern world. Contemporary questions about sustainability, the social implications of food choices, and the treatment of nonhuman animals, for instance, all find their analogues in Christian tradition. \nThe project aims to retrieve and reconceive the theological significance of embodied practice by focusing on food and diet as a neglected area of Christian theology. We contribute to current understanding of vegetarian and other dietary choices by developing a constructive theology of food and eating, which draws on a rich Christian tradition of feasting and fasting and is relevant to modern life. We show that everyday activities and decisions affecting the body possess profound spiritual significance. By beginning with practices rather than doctrine, we develop conclusions of interest to people with a wide variety of religious commitments and none.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119101/2","grantId":"119101/2","fundValue":"79079","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel Ellen Muers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
