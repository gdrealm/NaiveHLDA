{"id":"FEF00D4B-CED2-4F68-8EF5-147C25F81E8A","title":"Assessing the Feasibility of Using a Novel Sub-Micron, Magnetic Sorbent Material for the Removal of Dissolved Organic Carbon from Blue Water","abstractText":"Stopford Energy &amp; Environment Ltd in partnership with Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University is seeking to\ndevelop and trial a novel process ('Magimix') for the highly efficient removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from water,\nenabling abstraction of water from water bodies that would have otherwise been deemed uneconomic using existing\ntreatment technologies.\n\n'Magimix' is a newly invented group of composite magnetic materials, which combine ultrafine grain size with strong\nmagnetic properties &amp; pH-dependent surface charge, to provide unprecedented potential for removal of contaminants from\nwater supplies.\n\n'Magimix' is completely novel for four reasons:\n1. It is ultrafine-grained (sub-micrometre), creating extremely high surface area, thus enabling highly efficient adsorption of\nions from solution.\n\n2. Because of its pH-dependent surface charge, &amp; selected core compound composition, it is 'tuneable'. It will adsorb\nanions at low pHs (i.e. below pH 6.5), cations at high pHs (i.e. above pH 6.5). An example specific to this project is the\nremoval of contaminating dissolved organic carbon (DOC) anions which occur in naturally acid, upland-sourced drinking\nwater supplies. The core compound is selected for target ion affinity.\n3. Because of its strongly magnetic nature, it &amp; its surface-adsorbed ions can be magnetically collected &amp; removed from\nsolution.\n\n4. It can be readily reactivated (via pH-manipulated desorption) to enable product re-use.\nOur consortium will: develop &amp; trial the 'Magimix' process; benchmark it against existing rival technologies; conduct\npreliminary scale-up design; develop marketing materials &amp; an investment prospectus; &amp; engage industry end-users in\ndemonstrations of the new technology.\n\nOur specific research aims are:\n\n1. To synthesise various grades of 'Magimix' (i.e. a novel, patented magnetic sorbent, with different selected core\ncompounds) specifically for DOC removal from blue-water, &amp; test their adsorption capacity for a range of industry-supplied\nDOC-contaminated waters;\n\n2. To design &amp; develop a laboratory-scale trial rig to enable the viability of 'Magimix' for the removal of DOC from bluewater\nto be assessed. The rig will be designed to enable flexibility in operational parameters whereby flow-rate, contact\ntime &amp; regeneration regimes can be modified to enhance ion removal. Industrially-viable flow rates will also be sought, to\nenable the generation of datasets reflective of end-user requirements;\n\n3. To benchmark the performance of 'Magimix' against existing processes (through combination of desk-based research &amp;\ndialogue with industrial end-users). Examined parameters will include removal efficiency, absorption capacity, process\nsafety &amp; cost, in order to assess the applicability of the 'Magimix' technology to the target sector;\n\n4. To conduct preliminary designs for both the 'Magimix' synthesis &amp; the water treatment processes. The study will consider\nmaterials of construction &amp; also enable costs estimates relating to plant CAPEX &amp; production/process costs to be obtained.\nThe design phase will take into consideration results from all three previous work aims to enable suitability to both process\n&amp; site operating conditions;\n\n5. Upon evaluation of the performance parameters, to develop marketing material and an investment prospectus for the\nnovel DOC blue-water treatment technology. In parallel, industrial end-users &amp; technology investors will be invited to attend\ntechnology demonstrations.\n\nThe potential application of 'Magimix' for the removal of ions from water has already been patented. As such this\ntechnology presents the water sector with a novel approach for effectively removing DOC from blue-water sources that are\npresently unviable to secure using currently available processes.\nGiven the increasing global pressure on water resources and the associated costs for use and treatment, innovation in this area is \nextremely timely","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K504026/1","grantId":"EP/K504026/1","fundValue":"42725","fundStart":"2012-09-16","fundEnd":"2013-03-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Ongoing development: new PhD project planned for Dec 2015 start; further EPSRC funding application in progress.
