{"id":"2F293099-2860-4422-A224-C1193B9CE969","title":"Dynamic studies of ferroelectric domains","abstractText":"The key objectives of this proposal focus on investigating different configurations of domain bundles, or hierarchies found in ferroelectrics; as well as their evolution at the micro and nanoscale, under the application of different external stimuli such as heating and electric bias. The data obtained will be contrasted with classical theories in order to get an insight into their formation mechanisms and dynamics.\n\nQueen's University Belfast (QUB) has a strong group investigating a wide range of functional materials, especially ferroelectrics and this project seeks to build upon this experience. However, the principal component of this research relies on performing in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, heating and electrical biasing, which are not available at QUB. The samples for this project are already being characterized at a basic level at QUB using the existing electron microscopy facilities. The intention of this project is to take these samples to advanced electron microscopy centres, specialising in in-situ TEM experiments for the central part of the project. \n\nFour experiments in two different international laboratories are being designed as part of this proposal. The intention is for them to be carried out in summer (July-Sept) 2014. The international visits will provide experience and the opportunity to obtain new expertise in a new and exciting technique for studying dynamics of functional materials.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M004945/1","grantId":"EP/M004945/1","fundValue":"11757","fundStart":"2014-07-27","fundEnd":"2015-02-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Miryam  Arredondo-Arechavala","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
