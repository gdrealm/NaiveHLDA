{"id":"4BB40C59-F6B7-4281-9E84-BBF3A6BACB94","title":"AHRC/ESRC Conflict Theme Leader Fellowship","abstractText":"We understand bounded war. There are enemies. There are starts and finishes. There are ideologies. We know them as we know our own identities. As Chris Hedges states, we know them because 'war gives us meaning'. Yet, imagine a war where the enemy becomes obtuse, hidden or dispersed. Imagine a war that appears to have no beginning, an incursion, an attack, a death or no end, no ceasefire, no peace treaty, no troop withdrawal. The bounds of contemporary warfare are, in other words, no longer there. \n\nWar then becomes something else. We can imagine that politics still matters. That power is still projected. Perhaps, there is even still lethality. This would be a true return to nature in the Hobbesian sense. Nasty. Brutish. Short. Why would such a form of warfare arise? Surely there are collective interests in maintaining bounded warfare as we know it. Nation-states are bounded. Militaries are built to fight bounded wars. Even Clausewitz's trinity of relations between the military, the state and the society are bounded.\n\nWe can understand technology as applied, as used, as passive. I have agency. The technology does not have agency. Many scholars are looking at the impact of technology on defence in this fashion such as UAVs and airpower, processing speeds and big data, networked enabled forces and command and control. At the same time, we can understand technology as a system, a way of doing things. This is a pervasive understanding of technology. Another way to say it is that technologies provide governmentalities. Ways of understanding, of knowing, of seeing, of governing.\n\nRelying on a collection of authors, most prominently Ruth Miller and her book Snarl, we look to see how technology, networks, systems are themselves constitutional elements that change the user-tool notions of warfare and blur the lines between agent and subject. \n\nThe fellowship asks three questions concerning the rise of boundless warfare:\n\nWhat role for states?\nWhat future for power and security?\nWhat future for security and defence?\n\nEach of these questions have serious policy implications for understanding how technology is changing both the character AND nature of conflict.\n\nThe fellowship takes a humanities approach to emerging warfare, relying on philosophy and history to examine how technology reorders spaces in which human behaviour occurs. The fellowship engages with the Global Uncertainties partnership through its focus on emerging threats, disruptive technology and new understandings of conflict.\n\nAs a result, the fellowship will produce a series of articles on situating emergent warfare in the philosophical and historical traditions briefly discussed here. Furthermore, the fellowship will produce a research monograph entitled Forever Vigilant? Technology and the Rise of Boundless Warfare.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504270/1","grantId":"AH/N504270/1","fundValue":"627955","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Galbreath","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
