This compartmentalisation provides the basis for intracellular specialisation. For example, in order to dispose of unwanted components cells have developed degradative enzymes; it is essential that these are sequestered away from other cellular components to avoid destruction of valuable molecules. In addition, the cell has developed a complex assembly line of modifications that are added to proteins in a specific order as they travel to their final destination within the cell. This necessitates the accurate passage of molecules between compartments: a process known as membrane trafficking. Small portions of membrane bud off from one compartment to form transport vesicles that carry molecules to another compartment. Fusion of the two membranes results in the delivery of the contents of the vesicle to the target compartment. It is essential that these transport vesicles fuse with the appropriate target membrane. This specificity is controlled by the formation of specific SNARE complexes between proteins in the donor (vesicle) and target membranes. SNARE complex formation also provides the energy required for the fusion of the two lipid bilayers. This proposal is directed towards understanding how the formation of these SNARE complexes is regulated, concentrating on the role of a family of proteins known as SM proteins. I hypothesise that SM proteins are carried by the v(esicle)-SNARE on the transport vesicle to the target membrane where they activate the t(arget)-SNARE, ready to form SNARE complexes and drive membrane fusion. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis and elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which SM proteins control SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E024904/1","grantId":"BB/E024904/1","fundValue":"332276","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nia  Bryant","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
