These changes have significant implications in terms of the types of roles that public servants undertake and their career trajectories. The existing knowledge and practice around career development of public servants is yet to catch up with these developments.There is no common and shared route through which public servants (broadly defined as all those working in public services) are developed or through which they can gain access to information about the types of roles available and the skills and competencies they may need to develop.</p>\n\n<p>This project is a Knowledge Exchange between the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City Council and aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>critically appraise the existing knowledge base on this topic</li>\n\n <li>undertake new research into public service roles, through interviews with 30 people working in Birmingham or in national career development roles</li>\n\n <li>establish a knowledge portal which will support public servants and public service organisations in acquiring the skills and knowledge they need.</li>\n\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K007572/1","grantId":"ES/K007572/1","fundValue":"35649","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Catherine Elizabeth Needham","coPersons":["Catherine  Mangan"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
