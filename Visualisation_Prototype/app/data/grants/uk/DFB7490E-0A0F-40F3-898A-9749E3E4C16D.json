{"id":"DFB7490E-0A0F-40F3-898A-9749E3E4C16D","title":"Philosophy and Religious Practices","abstractText":"This research network is aimed at strengthening the ties between philosophers of religion, other researchers on religion (such as practical theologians) and stakeholders in religious communities. It consists in a four-way collaboration between the Department of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Chester, the Department of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies at Liverpool Hope University and faith communities in the North-West of England. Its remit is to open up ways in which each group can benefit from the others and it will achieve this through three initial theoretical workshops, a series of impact events and a final international conference. At stake therefore is the influence faith communities can have on religious research and the impact religious research can have on faith communities, as well as the academy's ability to measure this impact. What is distinctive about this network is the central role philosophy of religion will play. Its aim is to model ways philosophy of religion, theology and the social sciences can interact fruitfully with religious practitioners, so as to promote an inclusive conception of research on religion.\n\nThe purpose of this network is therefore a more intimate interrelation between theory and practice in the study of religions and, what is more, an interrelation that does not marginalise the distinctive contribution of philosophy of religion. The renewal of religious reflection in twenty-first century Britain demands a joined-up response from the academy - and philosophy of religion needs to be part of this.\n\nThis network draws on preliminary research in the Connected Communities theme: an AHRC Scoping Study, 'Philosophy of Religion and Religious Communities: Defining Beliefs and Symbols' at the University of Liverpool. It also emerges out of events already held in collaboration between the Universities of Liverpool, Chester and Liverpool Hope on the relation between philosophy and religious practice.\n\nThe network begins with three academic workshops. Their task is to set in place a general framework for facilitating discussions between practitioners and academics by providing models for impact and its measurement when it comes to research on religion in the humanities. There follows a series of impact workshops which put such models into practice and ensure a voice to religious practitioners in reflecting on the role theory could play in their communities. A final, international conference will be an opportunity to present the conclusions arising out of these workshops.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003283/1","grantId":"AH/K003283/1","fundValue":"22088","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel  Whistler","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
