{"id":"9578E109-36FD-480C-A4FE-63CAB88E44CF","title":"'Remembering': Victims, Survivors and Commemoration in Post-conflict Northern Ireland","abstractText":"The CAIN (Conflict Archive on the INternet - cain.ulster.ac.uk) Web site has been enhanced with a new extensive on-line digital Archive of source materials and information on the topic of victims, survivors, and the commemoration of victims of the Northern Ireland conflict. \n\nThe AHRC-funded project involved compiling a comprehensive selection of relevant material in digital format. The Archive documents the developments that have occurred in Northern Ireland in the area of victims, survivors, and commemoration since 1997. In particular it closely monitored the daily reporting of the subject in a wide range of media outlets and obtained permission for digital copies of this output to reside in the Archive. Relevant political and policy developments during the lifetime of the project were also followed. The project team also generated new information and new resources, and wrote a number of background papers for the Web site. \nThe Archive comprises, for example, copies of reports, booklets, pamphlets, leaflets, media reports, policy documents, press releases, statements, text of speeches, chapters from books, and photographs. These materials were produced by a range of organisations and individuals including British and Irish government departments and agencies, academic researchers, victims groups, other non-governmental organisations, and a large number of print and broadcast media. Addition information was generated by CAIN researchers during the lifetime of the project including a database of information and photographs on physical memorials to the conflict, and an initial selection of photographs of victims of the conflict. As part of the project two series of seminars were hosted. Recordings of these seminars are also available online. \n\nSome of the material in the Archive was 'born digital' and was catalogued and stored. However, some had been produced in paper form and needed to be scanned and converted to digital format, mainly PDF. Alt the information is freely available at the CAIN site. Users are able to locate information by a number of means including a searchable bibliography, a selectable list of key words and phrases, and a calendar of items that appeared in the media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D502837/1","grantId":"AH/D502837/1","fundValue":"239397","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Fraser","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
