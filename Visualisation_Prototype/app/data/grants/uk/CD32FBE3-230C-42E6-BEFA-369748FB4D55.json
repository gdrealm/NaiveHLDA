For example, you might learn at school that the symmetric polynomials can all be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.We want to understand better the symmetries of geometric spaces defined by the solutions of algebraic equations in the Cartesian coordinates. We propose to do this by analysing the symmetries of the functions on the space.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E061885/1","grantId":"EP/E061885/1","fundValue":"16424","fundStart":"2007-04-27","fundEnd":"2007-09-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Symonds","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
