{"id":"7F463A2E-E5D2-477C-8EA0-DF4BC98607A5","title":"Property Reforms and Forest Rights in Vietnam: Engaging policy makers, forestry experts and the public","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to strengthen the impact of the PIâ€™s long-term research on forest governance and livelihoods in Vietnam. Vietnam's central government has enacted sweeping property reforms in forestry over the past two decades. The high expectations have not materialised, however, causing policy makers to reconsider their support for the transfer of forest rights to local people, leaving forestry experts in need for new policy options and generating public scepticism about granting rights to villagers. </p>\n\n<p>The project will allow the PI to transfer knowledge to policy makers, forestry experts and the public in collaboration with RECOFTC&nbsp;- The Center for People and Forests. Together they will demonstrate why policy makers should support further transfers of forest rights to villagers. They will develop practical recommendations for forestry experts on how the government can strengthen villagers' forest rights in order to alleviate poverty, improve state capacity, and conserve forests. They will also work with Vietnamese media to raise public awareness for the significance of forest rights. They will employ an innovative mix of instruments, including a strategy paper, policy briefs, a policy seminar, a write workshop, a video and news items for dissemination to Vietnamese internet and print media. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H035427/1","grantId":"ES/H035427/1","fundValue":"30059","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Sikor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" The project has contributed to sustainable forest management and poverty alleviation in Vietnam by demonstrating the benefits of transferring forest rights to local communities. The research has achieved the contributions through three pathways: (1) strengthening capacity to design policy on forest rights; (2) influence on the formulation of forest policy; and (3) a change in public awareness on communities' role in forest management. Involving extensive engagement with governmental and other stakeholders, the project has helped to promote the transfer forest rights for local communities and thereby generated positive effects on forests and the livelihoods of 24 million people living near forests in Vietnam.
