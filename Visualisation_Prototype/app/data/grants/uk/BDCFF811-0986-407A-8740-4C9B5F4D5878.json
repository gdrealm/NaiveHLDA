The project examines how a message which is ‘tuned’ to the audience can change or bias the way in which the original event is remembered and evaluated by the communicator. </p> \n<p>The project focuses on how eyewitnesses produce their own memory biases during the process of communication with others. A key factor to be varied is ‘shared reality,’ which captures how communicators experience the communication with the person they are tuning to (eg, whether they feel they achieve a joint view with their audience). The likelihood of shared reality creation (high vs. low uncertainty about the event; shared-reality vs. instrumental goals for audience tuning; positive vs. negative audience feedback; appropriate vs. inappropriate audience) will be manipulated in a series of studies. </p> \n<p>Standard memory measures and source-memory tests will determine whether eyewitnesses exhibiting a greater memory bias are less likely to discriminate correctly between information from the witnessed event and communicated information. The novel insights from this project will be useful from both a basic and an applied perspective, for example, by providing a better understanding</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2199","grantId":"RES-000-22-2199","fundValue":"39533","fundStart":"2007-04-02","fundEnd":"2009-04-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They are used by other researchers to disseminate information in cases of eyewitness identification error.
