Bumblebees are key pollinators of wildflowers and crops but their populations are declining worldwide. Although bumblebees have been well-studied in some respects, fundamental aspects of their ecology remain unknown. In this proposal we plan to fill some of these gaps so that we can implement the most effective measures to reverse declines. We have four specific objectives. First, little is known about the dispersal of nest-founding queens in spring, so we will determine the fine-scale spatial genetic structure and behaviour of nest-founding queens and relate this to the distribution of nesting and foraging habitats across an agricultural landscape. Second, although new genetic methods have permitted estimates of the foraging ranges of worker bees, we do not know how workers and colonies use space in relation to the fine-scale structure of their habitat; we will therefore quantify both workers' spatial distribution and habitat structure to determine this relationship. Third, some bumblebee species have long tongues and so are the most effective pollinators of wildflowers and crops in which the floral tube (corolla) is deep. The UK's longest-tongued bumblebee species, Bombus hortorum, remains common but the closely related B. ruderatus is scarce. We will compare the spatial genetic structure of these two species directly in the same landscape in order to elucidate the biological reasons for this difference. Fourth, because our study will take place at a site where targeted measures to provide forage for bumblebees (agri-environment schemes) have already been established, we will be able to use our results to model the impacts of these measures on bumblebee foraging range and nest density. To meet our objectives, we will study the five species B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, B. terrestris B. hortorum and B. ruderatus, chosen to represent an appropriate range of ecological and behavioural differences. We will use a novel combination of genetic, ecological and modelling methods in a unique field setting: an agricultural landscape (2100ha) in England in which blocks of standardised agri-environment options targeted at insect pollinators have been established as part of an ongoing landscape-scale experiment. Our methods will consist of systematic nonlethal sampling of queens and workers for DNA, followed by microsatellite genotyping coupled with sibship reconstruction (grouping of individuals into families) to determine the spatial genetic distribution of queens and workers. We will also use advanced marking techniques (e.g. radio-frequency identification (RFID), pit-tags) to supplement our genetic investigations of queens and specifically to relate queen space use to the distribution of small mammals (whose nests queens are believed to exploit for nesting and which are already being monitored as part of ongoing studies). Finally, we have already characterized the study landscape using both high-resolution multi-spectral scanners and field surveys. The resulting detailed information on habitat composition and structure, when integrated with our data on bumblebee space use, will allow us accurately to model the impact of habitat structure on the bees. Overall, therefore, this project matches the requirements of the Insect Pollinators Initiative very well. First, because the study is taking place at a site where we have already characterized habitat structure and in which an experimental agri-environment scheme is established, it will serve to advance our understanding of the effects of agriculture and land-use change on bumblebee behaviour and colony dynamics. Second, it will use new tools and data analysis to discover fundamental aspects of bumblebee ecology relevant to pollinator declines from molecular to population levels.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I001069/1","grantId":"BB/I001069/1","fundValue":"13138","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Frederick George  Bourke","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" Effective pollination is essential for both wildflowers and crops, but insect pollinators are increasingly threatened. Bumble bees represent major insect pollinators in temperate ecosystems. Some species are declining, and much remains to be established regarding the foraging ecology of even the common and widespread species. A key aspect of foraging ecology is bees' use of space, since this determines how pollination services are distributed across landscapes. In this project, we used a combination of field ecology, remote sensing, microsatellite genotyping and landscape modelling to understand how space use by bumble bee workers and queens is affected by fine-scale features of their habitat.\n\nOne of the project goals has been to investigate the genetic structure of bumble bee populations at fine spatial scales. It was previously unknown, even for the common species, whether queens tend to found nests near their natal nest or not. As part of our study, we captured workers of five species (Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus) and sampled them non-lethally for DNA (before releasing them again in the study landscape). We genotyped the DNA samples at a panel of marker genes (microsatellite loci). Aided by sib-reconstruction software, we used the genetic data to group workers into full sisterhoods, which represent workers all produced by one queen. Such workers must have come from the same nest. We estimated the position of each nest from the positions of the workers within the sisterhood, which we had mapped when the workers were collected. We also reconstructed the genotype of each colony queen from the workers' genotypes.\n\nWe were then able to calculate, across all pairs of colony queens, the association between the genetic relatedness of queens and the physical distance between them in the landscape. We found that, for all five species, there was either no association between queen-queen relatedness and physical distance, or only a very weak one. This showed that queens do not tend to found nests near their natal nest. If this had occurred, it would have led to a strong negative association of queen-queen relatedness and physical distance. Instead, on average, young queens from the same nest must disperse quite far, in different directions, before founding their own nests, leading to populations that are genetically well mixed at fine spatial scales. These findings have been published in Dreier et al. (2014. Molecular Ecology 23: 3384-3395). \n\nOngoing work aims to refine our picture of queen and worker movement and link it to known features of the landscape. For example, research results from the project now in press have linked colony-specific worker foraging distances to the resource richness of the surrounding landscape, showing that shorter foraging distances were found in colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of semi-natural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins (Redhead JW, Dreier S, Bourke AFG, Heard MS, Jordan WC, Sumner S, Wang J, Carvell C. 2015. Effects of habitat composition and landscape structure on worker foraging distances of five bumblebee species. Ecological Applications In press). The findings should be relevant to conservation managers, farmers and policy-makers because of their relevance to the design of agri-environment schemes for bumble bees.
