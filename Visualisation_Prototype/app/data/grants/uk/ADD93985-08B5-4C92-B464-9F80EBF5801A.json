{"id":"ADD93985-08B5-4C92-B464-9F80EBF5801A","title":"Erasmus Darwin in the Romantic Late Enlightenment","abstractText":"The literature of the 'Romantic' period (roughly 1780-1820) is often seen as moving sharply away from the rationalist concerns of the eighteenth-century 'Enlightenment', but for much important work of the time, 'late Enlightenment' is a more useful label than 'Romanticism'. This book explores a wide range of the period's concerns in these terms, in special connection with the work of the scientist-poet Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802). Described by the late Roy Porter as providing 'the British Enlightenment's most sublime theory of boundless improvement' and one of the most successful poets of the 1790s, Darwin touches base with an enormous range of issues central to the period, including poetic and visual aesthetics, mythology, education, progressive politics, industrial technology, medical and psychological theory, physics, chemistry, geology and biology, where he strikingly anticipated his grandson Charles's theory of evolution. This book will relate Darwin's work to that of many Enlightenment and/or Romantic writers from Pope and Anna Seward to Wordsworth and the Shelleys. Particular attention is given to another polymathic writer, Richard Payne Knight, whose Discourse on the Worship of Priapus and poems on progress and the picturesque offer striking parallels and instructive contrasts with Darwin's work. \\nAfter a brief introduction the book will consist of four chapters, with a substantial appendix publishing for the first time in print the text of Darwin's unfinished historical poem 'The Progress of Society', edited from manuscripts recently donated to Cambridge University Library. The first chapter will introduce many of the book's concerns by way of Darwin's decision to abandon this poem for the defiantly evolutionary The Temple of Nature (1803). The grounds for this shift will be explored in relation to Freemasonry, to closely-linked texts by Richard Payne Knight and the Roman poet Lucretius, and to political attacks by the reactionary Anti-Jacobin magazine. \\n The next chapter will consider the botanical/horticultural parts of Darwin's highly acclaimed The Botanic Garden. It will reposition The Loves of the Plants (Part 2, though published first in 1789) in the context of controversies about Linnaeus's 'sexual system' of botany, and plant-literature by and for women. The horticultural portions of The Economy of Vegetation (Part 1, 1792) will be related to the garden poetry of a range of other poets including Seward and Knight, the latter of whose psychologized approach to the picturesque will be further linked to the aesthetic discussions of The Temple of Nature and Darwin's medical/psychological writings. \\n The third chapter will consider the bulk of The Economy of Vegetation, which uses the traditional division of matter into four elements to present the period's most advanced discoveries in physics, chemistry and geology: many of them made by Darwin's own radically-minded friends including James Watt, Benjamin Franklin and Joseph Priestley. In a discussion also including the evolutionism of The Temple of Nature, Darwin's materialism will be related to the period's developing critique of religion; and Darwin's striking use of mythical figures, both as metaphors and as encodements of scientific truth, will be compared to other handlings of myth by Knight, Shelley and a range of other writers. \\n In the final chapter, closer readings across the range of Darwin's poetry will explore such issues as the scene of quasi-masonic initiation into special knowledge, the role of visual metaphor, the appeal to Egyptian hieroglyphics, the emphasis on mapped space rather than lived time, and the valuing of plenitude of content over a poetics of absence. These issues will be further related to the work of Knight and Romantic writers such as Wordsworth, to changing attitudes to race and empire, and to the growing split between science and imagination which still inhabits an adequate appreciation of Darwin's kind of poetry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G004382/1","grantId":"AH/G004382/1","fundValue":"32626","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Priestman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Roehampton University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
