{"id":"17A20E3E-D91B-4EDE-A2EF-DD050538FB9C","title":"Newton001 Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance Mutations in Tuberculosis: Towards Personalised Treatment to Combat Multi-drug Resistance","abstractText":"Tuberculosis is recognised as one of Brazil's leading infectious diseases, with over 70,000 cases notified each year. There has been a significant increase in the number of diagnosed Multidrug resistant TB cases, with 10% of those also resistant to the two most important second---line class drugs (XDR-TB). This project aims to build upon existing collaborative programs on understanding effects of mutations, and on combating multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant (MDR and XDR respectively) tuberculosis (TB). The two nodes, Brazil and UK, have complementary skills that encompass epidemiology, human and pathogen genetics, bioinformatics, structural biology and drug discovery. This multidisciplinary combination will facilitate the development of a novel platform to rapidly identify resistant TB from genomic sequencing. Novel mechanisms of drug resistance in TB will be explored using cutting edge techniques and correlated with clinical outcomes. This will help guide more suitable patient treatment, public health policies and future drug discovery efforts, with potential to bring benefit to individuals and public health in Brazil and UK, providing solutions to a problem that affects a third of the world's population.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026302/1","grantId":"MR/M026302/1","fundValue":"49396","fundStart":"2015-01-30","fundEnd":"2016-01-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharon  Peacock","coPersons":["David Benjamin Ascher","Tom  Blundell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
