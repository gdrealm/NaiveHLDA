It explores tensions between traditional, indigenous and local conceptions of human/nature relationships, on the one hand, and new conceptions underlying modern market-based methods for creating 'green' futures, on the other. We will do this through in-depth field research in western Namibia - where three of our team members have long-term research experience - and in collaboration with our local institutional partner, the National Museum of Namibia.\n\nProblems such as 'environmental change' and 'sustainability' are complex and require analysis that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Our research, therefore, applies methods and theory from Cultural Geography, Ethnomusicology, Environmental History, Philosophy and Social Anthropology. Our field location encapsulates tensions present in many contemporary circumstances. Here, old and new conceptions of human/nature relationships are colliding spectacularly as resources such as uranium are extracted from land which is home to some of the oldest cultures on earth, as well as to highly valued (and endangered) animal and plant species. \n\nThrough engaging with diverse actors in corporate, state, NGO and local contexts, we will explore the environmental change understandings informing a range of new 'green' entities that are being created, marketed and exchanged so as to generate sustainability. We will juxtapose these 'sustainability objects' with ways that landscape and other species are conceived and remembered in local indigenous culture, as encoded in stories, song, dance and healing rituals. Our selected, interconnected and commodified 'green things' are, i) 'green uranium' (so-called because of its alleged contribution to low-carbon generation but also because the impacts of its extraction are to be 'offset'), ii) biodiversity offsets (in which environmental harm arising from development in one location is offset by conservation activity elsewhere), iii) natural products derived from indigenous plant knowledge, iv) animal hunting trophies, and v) KhoeSan rock art heritage. \n\nThis research will enhance humanities understandings of how new 'green' objects act, and are perceived to act, to 'perform sustainability', and thereby to transfer past social and environmental health forwards into the future. We will complement this by in-depth analysis of perceptions regarding environmental change, assisted by the collation and exhibiting of repeat landscape photographs. In these, contemporary photographs reveal how landscapes have changed (or not) since early archival images, dating back to the late 1800s, were made. \n\nA key and iterative component of our project is the exhibiting of images, audio and video material from our research, both at the Museum in Windhoek and as mobile exhibitions in varied field contexts within Namibia. We intend this to stimulate open discussion regarding ideas of environmental change and sustainable futures, and thereby generate further research data. We will also foster public engagement through a project website with the URL www.futurepasts.net.\n\nResults from these interconnected research strands will be synthesised and theorised in a further strand. This will examine the philosophical and ethical issues arising at the interfaces between different culturally-bound understandings of human/nature relations. Our work here will flesh-out a new cross-disciplinary domain of 'ecocultural ethics' that considers sustainability imaginaries as entwined with the cultural production of particular pasts, presents and futures. This juxtaposition of competing ethical principles underlying different sustainability perspectives will draw together the empirical material analysed in the rest of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K005871/2","grantId":"AH/K005871/2","fundValue":"766260","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As listed in our portfolio, in the first year of our project we have contributed several peer-reviewed academic publications, a range of conference presentations including several keynotes and plenary talks, and a number of public engagement activities, including talks in Namibia by three of our team. We are in the process of developing our project website (to be launched in 2015) and we are in discussion regarding establishing both an academic Future Pasts Working Paper series and a public and educational outreach series (e.g. Future Pasts Outreach) that can be downloaded from our website. \n\nWe have already worked closely with the National Museum of Namibia in order to align our research firmly with national and regional concerns regarding the conservation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage in west Namibia, particularly in a context of multiple new pressures on the west Namibian landscape. We intend aspects of our research to contribute to the recognition by the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage of ICH elements from west Namibia, but this is as yet in development. Nonetheless, much of our research, particularly for research objectives 1 and 2 (see key findings), will contribute outputs and findings relevant to these concerns. To some extent, this is already happening. For example, by request Sullivan has contributed information on specific harvesting practices in the northern part of our study area for the indigenous and endemic !nara plant (Acanthiosicyos horridus Welw. ex Hook.f.) for a new policy-oriented publication on natural products of Namibia (The Commercialisation of Indigenous Natural Plant products in Namibia, 2014). Based on ethnographic research for the project, this material has extended current knowledge of the geographical range and extent of indigenous knowledge and extant harvesting practices regarding this plant.\n\nThe outputs and collaborations detailed in the section on 'key findings' illustrate the considerable potential for our work to have impact both within and beyond academia, especially within Namibia. In general we are seeking for our multiple outputs to contribute to nuanced discussion and awareness building regarding the cultural complexities informing understandings of environmental change and sustainability, as well as different approaches to these. We are still in the early stages of our project, and our intention is to continue to work closely with our local partners so as to contribute research that is both policy-relevant and engaged with broader publics.

In this first year of the award we have focused on consolidating the logistical foundations and Namibian institutional affiliations supporting our field research, as well as refining our collaborative emphases for the ongoing field research elements of the project. We have embarked on initial field research for the project (Feb-April 2014), as well as generating academic outputs and non-academic engagement activities (as listed under the appropriate portfolio headings and noted below). Two of our research team (Sullivan and Low) also responded to an invitation to visit and present papers the Basler Afrika Bibliographien (BAB), Basel, Switzerland, where we were able to begin a process of engaging with and acquiring recorded and textual historical archive material from west Namibia. All of this has been accomplished at the same time as transferring the award from Birkbeck to Bath Spa University (BSU) due to the relocation of the PI. New administrative arrangements at BSU are now firmly in place. \n\nIn the narrative below we detail our achievements through disaggregating these under the following headings: \n1. the logistical and institutional set-up of the project within the case-study country Namibia, southern Africa; \n2. how we have so far met our stated research objectives - refined through negotiation with our main local institutional partner the National Museum of Namibia (see below) - and including dissemination activities; \nand 3. an initial indication of how our key findings might be taken up and by whom. \n\n1. Logistical and institutional set-up of the project within the case-study country Namibia\n\nLogistical set-up:\nIn this first year of our research we have worked to construct and develop a supportive logistical container for our field research in Namibia. In this regard we have achieved the following:\n\n- full research visa applications have been submitted to and approved until 2016 by the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs. In 2016 we will be able to renew these visas; \n\n- formal research affiliation contracts have been finalised between the UK academics and the National Museum of Namibia (of the Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sports and Culture). In response to dialogue with this organisation and requests to orient our research firmly within Namibian national realities, we have made more explicit in our programme of research a framing of indigenous cultural realities in terms of indigenous tangible and intangible cultural heritage (as per UNESCO categorisations of elements in the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage). This will assist us with teasing out and communicating the varied impacts on elements of indigenous cultural heritage of conservation and development activities framed within market-based 'green economy' and sustainability discourses. Working this out and negotiating this aspect of our research such that it is sensitive to national institutional framings and concerns has been a major piece of work and we thus include under 'other outputs' our formal proposal for research affiliation with the National Museum of Namibia. Sullivan is also discussing with the Deputy Director of the Museum ways in which aspects of former and project research might contribute in a practical way towards the preparation of nominations to the UNESCO Convention on ICH; \n\n- formal institutional endorsements have been worked out with and confirmed by several organisations, including the Dept. of Geography, History and Environmental Studies, University of Namibia, and Gobabeb Research and Training Centre, Namibia. Low has an official role in !khwa ttu San Cultural and Educational Centre, a not for profit organization in South Africa, through which he is developing skills, resources and networks that will be of direct benefit to Future Pasts. Rohde has a long-standing formal affiliation with the Department of Biological Science at the University of Cape Town (UCT), as well as informal collaborations with the Namibian Arts Association Heritage Trust and the Centre for Curating the Archive at the Michaelis Art School, UCT; \n\n- formal arrangements made to second a key local field assistant / translator / informant (Welhelmina Suro Ganuses) from her employees (the Namibian NGO Save the Rhino Trust) so as to support ethnographic field research. Sullivan and Hannis worked with Suro for periods of ethnographic field research in March and April 2014, and Sullivan will work again with her from Oct-Dec 2014. Similar contacts were made by Rohde with Mate Petersen, Eteb Haseb and Christine Maletski who will act as field assistants in future.\n\n- contractual arrangements have been finalised with the Namibian Film and Production company Mamokobo, who are already scripting and shooting film material to be used for beyond academia outputs. The Director of Mamokobo will join Sullivan for a short period of field research in November 2014 so as to generate filmed material from specific key informant interviews; \n\n- discussion is underway with IT staff at BSU for establishing and developing the Future Pasts website and data archive in the academic year 2014-15.\n\nProject meetings:\nIn the first year of the project the full UK academic research team met twice to discuss and organise aspects of our research. The first meeting was for four days in the UK at the start of the project in October 2013. The second meeting was intended as a fuller orientation week that took place in west Namibia in March 2014. This meeting included field visits to Twyfelfontein UNESCO World Heritage Site, Twyfelfontein Damara Living Museum, and Brandberg provisional UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nField research:\nInitial ethnographic and other elements of field research were conducted in Namibia by the UK academics between February and April 2014. This included: \n\n- initial finding and reconnections with previous informants in west Namibia (SS, RR, CL);\n\n- re-establishing contact with a number of former participants in an Okombahe participatory photography project of 1995, with a view to instigating a new community photo project as part of Future Pasts (RR);\n\n- ethnographic documentation of specific former harvesting practices and cultural landscapes in the northern Namib (SS); \n\n- audio and film documentation of 'living museums' and other sites and commodifications of KhoeSan cultural heritage in southern Kunene (Twyfelfontein) and Bushmanland - to be developed with regard to our research emphasis on constructions, reenactments and commodifications of cultural heritage (SS, CL, MH);\n\n- interviews and observation re: 'accumulation by conservation' in specific tourism lodges, including commodifications of indigenous culture through touristic packaging of cultural heritage (SS, MH);\n\n- preliminary interviews and field visits regarding growing uranium extraction in the Namib and nascent biodiversity offsetting policies/practices (SS, RR, MH, AI), plus discourse analysis of key elements of globally-relevant biodiversity offsetting policy (SS, MH); \n\n- initial enquiries ongoing as to possible collaboration with the FogLife project run in the Namib by Gobabeb Research and Training Centre and partners (RR, AI); \n\n- analysis of data and imagery from 20 repeat photo sites in the study area (RR);\n\n- preliminary soundscape recordings were made (AI) in coordination with repeat photography (RR). Recordings were aimed at assessing opportunities and challenges for more concerted soundscape ecology input during the next 4-years of research (AI, RR). \n\nArchival research:\n- Impey liaised with several ethnomusicologists who have extensive libraries of audio and video recordings of Namibian music that date back to the late 1980s. Plans are in action to deposit these collections into one archive (British Library Sound Archive, in partnership with a suitable Namibian repository - t.b.c.), where they will be digitized, catalogued and made available online, along with all relevant metadata. The collection will provide invaluable historical depth to our own research, but is aimed also to encourage further research on Namibian music, which has been very fragmentary to date. \n\n- Sullivan and Low visited Basler Afrika Bibliographien (BAB), Basel, Switzerland, in June-July 2014. Here we found recordings and texts from an archive of linguistic research (the Damman archive, recorded in 1953-4) relevant to our study area as well as to framings of people-landscape relationships. We are intending to mobilise these texts and recordings both as contextual material regarding historical and ethnographic research, and as stimulus material regarding contemporary perceptions of past research artefacts. Sullivan will begin working with this material during fieldwork in Oct-Dec 2014. \n\n2. Meeting of research objectives and associated dissemination activities\nAs stated in 1. above, we have been focusing in 2013-14 on creating a firm logistical foundation for our field research as well as beginning the process of establishing a public face and working paper series for our project - to be launched in 2014-15. We have also conducted some initial field research in our study area and in 2014-15 will be conducting longer in-depth field research activities, starting with the PI's return to Namibia for two months in Oct-Dec 2014. We have refined our original research objectives in conjunction with negotiations this year with our main local institutional partner (the National Museum of Namibia) so as to both retain our research emphases in the submitted Case for Support whilst attuning these to national institutional and policy concerns. \n\nOur primary research objectives are listed below, accompanied by related outputs and findings from our research, as well as indications of how we are developing our research into the future so as to meet our objectives and address our research questions. Where appropriate we also indicate connections with the four research questions (Q1, Q2, etc.) and six work packages (wp1, wp2, etc.) proposed in our original Case for Support. \n\nThe refined objectives guiding our project, together with key research achievements and dissemination activities to date, are as follows: \n\nResearch objective 1. \nTo revisit and interview individuals, families and communities known in west Namibia through earlier in-depth ethnographic and ethnoecological study by scholars involved with this programme of research, so as to better understand sociocultural, economic and environmental changes since the 1990s. (Q1, Q2. wp2, wp3, wp6)\n\nAs noted above, Sullivan, Rohde and Low have begun the process of reconnecting with former informants in the study area so as to explore perceptions of a range of changes since prior fieldwork in the 1990s, as well as to consider hopes, desires and concerns regarding the future. For example, based on field research early in 2014 with informants known since 1995, Sullivan is currently developing an article entitled '!Nara harvesters of the northern Namib: tracing the historical cultural landscapes of !Narenin and //Ubun KhoeSan' that in part reinscribes the environmental histories and cultural landscapes of inhabitants of the northern Namib in a context of historical and contemporary marginalisation of these histories (to be submitted to the Journal of Namibian Studies). In general, we are beginning the process of documenting how circumstances have changed for people since the 1990s, as well as using material collected previously in conjunction with archival material (cf. research objective 2 below) to elicit memories and perspectives regarding environmental and social change. \n\n\nResearch objective 2. \nTo apply in-depth qualitative ethnographic and ethnomusicology research techniques to the collection and analysis of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), including songs, dances, stories and ethnoecological knowledge; so as to better document and promote cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge associated with the cultural landscapes of west Namibia, and with understandings of sustainability more broadly. (Q1, Q2. wp2, wp3, wp6)\n\nWith our affiliation partner, we are currently pursuing a route towards achieving this objective (which also connects with research objectives 1 and 7) that involves investigation into a core element of KhoeSan 'environmentality', (i.e. the shared conduct of relationships vis ? vis landscapes and 'nonhuman natures'). This is the ethos associated with the suite of beliefs and practices attached to the ancestor-hero and deity known in the region variously as Haitsi or Haiseb, which some of our team are currently exploring as a 'hook' through which we might engage with indigenous conceptions and productions of landscape in our case area. The Haitsi / Haiseb 'complex' appears both tangibly in the landscape through cairns or Haitsi 'graves' (Haitsi-Aibebs / Heitsi-Eibebs) positioned in key localities, as well as intangibly through practices of reciprocity that honour Haitsi / Haiseb as the supporter of life, and through a host of stories, songs and other idioms. This focus permits us to explore the ethical practices and values associated with Haitsi / Haiseb as a way into KhoeSan environmentality, as well as to contrast and 'offset' these 'ecocultural' values and practices with those associated with different cultural and economic engagements in our study area (cf. research objectives 4 and 6 below).\n\nIn connection with this theme, Sullivan and Low's journal article 'Shades of the rainbow serpent..' deals with questions of how contemporary ethnographic representations can intersect with and contribute to constructions of KhoeSan pasts and presents as these are framed in scholarly analyses of rock art in the region (wp2). Through focusing on representations of natural history and mythical aspects of snakes in both KhoeSan ethnography and southern African rock art, the article finds a KhoeSan approach to environmental realities that emphasises diverse practices of attunement with unpredictable environmental dynamics and rich symbolic landscapes representing these. \n\nIn addition, Low and Sullivan visited the Basler Afrika Bibliographien (BAB), in Basel, Switzerland, where we were able to begin a process of engaging with and acquiring recorded and textual historical archive material from west Namibia, specifically from the Damman archive of recordings and transcribed texts from 1953-54. Our intention is to both translate and analyse this material in conjunction with local people (Sullivan to start in Oct-Dec 2014) as well as drawing on some of this material to generate contemporary responses and memories regarding the past (also ?1 above). \n\nIn preparation for soundscape ecology research in Namibia (years 2-5), Impey attended a conference in Paris entitled Ecology and Acoustics: Emerging properties from community to landscape (16-18 June). She has also been liaising with leading UK soundscape recordists, Peter Cusack and Chris Watson (BBC), in preparation for the recording and analysis of soundscapes in signature localities in the research area. This work aims to achieve four objectives: 1) in parallel with repeat photographs (Rohde), it aims to use the 4-year research period to establish an acoustical complexity base line in order to monitor habitat change; 2) to use playback methodologies of soundscape recordings to elicit responses to sounds by local people in an attempt to better understand local intersections between ecological and cultural knowledge; 3) conduct a series of soundwalk studies with local inhabitants, which entails the in situ participatory recording of targeted sites aimed at complementing the study on human-environment dialogue; and 4) to prepare an archive of recordings that can be utilized in creative products (CDs, film soundtrack, exhibition, etc.).\n \nIn addition, more conventional ethnomusicological research will include the in-depth analysis of cultural-environmental discourses by one or two groups in the study area (to be decided) as they are manifest in songs, dances and historical narratives. \n\nResearch objective 3. \nTo enhance analysis and understanding of the historical ecologies of the Namib, through a comparative analysis of archival and repeat landscape photographs in relation to understanding recent regional environmental change, constructions of environmental pasts, and projections of environmental futures. (Q3. wp4)\n\nAn overview of the repeat photos based on the 1876 Palgrave photo collection was presented by Rohde to staff, visiting scientists and university students at the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre in March 2014. This has resulted in the establishment of collaborative projects that interface the AHRC focus of the Future Pasts project with natural science based research, thereby enriching both humanities and natural science research perspectives through interdisciplinarity.\n \nTwenty repeat photo sites, based on archival photographs dating between 1921 and 1992 were identified and sampled during March 2014 (RR). These were subsequently matched and analysed for vegetation change and cover. All data sheets and images have been digitized and posted on a shared Future Pasts dropbox site. Across all sites (including climatic, biogeographical and agirculrual regions), an increase in both perennial and annual species was observed, indicating increased precipitation over all time frames as well as land-use changes related to fire and grazing regimes in the more mesic areas leading to bush thickening. The findings of this workpackage will be deposited in the National Herbarium of Namibia, the National Archives, rePhotoSA database and the Future Past archive. \n\nResearch objective 4. \nTo clarify and juxtapose proposals by different actors associated with the west Namibia landscape for generating 'sustainability' into the future, focusing in particular on:\n1. enhancing understanding regarding the ways in which different new 'green' commodities and the institutional contexts guiding their production are projected to produce sustainability into the future; \nand 2. exploring the ways these 'green economy' responses intersect with understandings of 'sustainability' and of culturenature relationships expressed in the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of indigenous and local ecological knowledges.\n(Q1, Q2. wp1, wp2, wp3, wp6)\n\nThis objective overlaps with research objectives 1 and 2 above. In addition, Sullivan and Hannis have begun the work of systematically analysing key contemporary environmental policy discourses influencing the Namibian context, starting with their co-authored working paper 'Nets and frames, losses and gains', which provides a structured qualitative discourse analysis of a key emerging policy debate regarding biodiversity offsetting (BDO) in England. We include this here since the development of BDO offsetting internationally is setting the scene institutionally, discursively and technically for the creation and materialisation of BDO policy, locations and units in the Namibian context. The paper focuses on disaggregating key issues, interests and concerns regarding the development of BDO policy, and finds significant, and possible intractable, 'value struggles' are arising between identifiable groups embracing and contesting this new conservation technology. \n\nIn relation to this, Sullivan and Hannis gave a presentation entitled ''Offsetting nature? Notes on the development of biodiversity offsetting policy in the UK and beyond...' to students and environmental consultants at the Namibian organisation Gobabeb Research and Training. Sullivan will be focusing further on emerging policy and thinking in this area, coupled with sustainability framings regarding uranium production in west Namibia, in fieldwork from Jan-Mar 2015. We are also developing field research on trophy hunting, plant products, rock art and tangible and intangible aspects of cultural heritage, as well as engaging with the discourses that support commodifications of these and the effects of such discourses and practices.\n\nResearch objective 5. \nIn association with the Museum and/or other arts and heritage organisations in Namibia, to generate a series of events and non-textual outputs that foster public discussion of environmental change perceptions and concerns. (wp5)\n\nThis impact-related aspect of our project is in development. We are generating image, audio and video material in a range of ways so as to meet this objective. \n\nFor example, Rohde and Impey will use existing climate stations in the FogNet grid to make repeat photographic and acoustic recordings of desert land/soundscapes over four years creating a baseline for long-term monitoring. They will identify a network of repeat photo sites from archival images of combining repeat aural recordings to document population changes in desert biota. These separate and combined methodologies will enable a statistical analysis of biological change in relation to climatic conditions, as well as generating an image and sound archive that may be utilised in public engagement activities. \n\nAudio recordings and videos constitute a key element of our ethnographic data collection in all aspects of our research and will be used to support both academic and non-academic engagement activities. For example, Sullivan has contributed an abstract for the conference 'Landscape, Wilderness and the Wild' (Newcastle University, March 2015) for a presentation that will be based in part on montage of images and video taken at Erindi Game Lodge in west Namibia, visited during field research in April 2014. The paper will use these images to critically explore constructions and commodifications of wild life and the heritage of 'wild people' - in this case Ju'|hoan Bushmen relocated from Bushmanland in the east of the country and presented as reenacting indigenous San culture in west Namibia - in a context of significant financial 'accumulation by conservation' by private lodge owners (wps 1 and 2, research objectives 4 and 7). Such outputs will be added to our website for public viewing. \n\nIn addition, we have commissioned Namibian Film and Production company Mamokobo who are scripting and scoping film possibilities to assist with generating new professional quality film as well archived material that will support our public engagement activities and website.\n\nResearch objective 6. \nTo contribute digitised material from our previous and current research regarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) for archiving in Namibia (in association with the National Museum of Namibia and/or the National Heritage Council), as well as for possible use in ICH UNESCO list and safeguarding nominations. We will also seek to do whatever we can to support in-country capacity in the documentation, investigation and archiving of 'intangible cultural heritage' relating to environmental knowledge. (wp5)\n\nThis is in development. Sullivan has been in initial discussion with the Deputy Director of the National Museum of Namibia who, on the basis of both past research and the current Future Pasts project, has requested contributions to the development of Intangible Cultural Heritage elements for recognition by the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of IHC. These discussions are ongoing, but should such contributions arise they will consitute significant beyond-academia impact of our research. \n\nResearch objective 7. \nTo conduct a more formal philosophical/theoretical enquiry into the ethical assumptions and framings underlying contemporary 'green economy' policies and practices, in juxtaposition with the ethical assumptions that might be seen to be embodied in the ICH knowledges and practices highlighted in other components of our research. (Q1, Q2, Q4. wp1, wp2, wp3, wp6)\n\nIn relation to this research objective we are working to deepen both our ethnographic research engagement in west Namibia and our theoretical engagement with environmental philosophy framings and contributions so as to assist us with theorising 'sustainability imaginaries' in our case-area context, as well as with consolidating our proposed field of 'ecocultural ethics'.\n\nHannis has an article in press entitled 'The virtues of acknowledged ecological dependence: sustainability, autonomy and human flourishing', which seeks to develop an organising principle for a eudaimonist environmental virtue ethics, by situating ecological virtue among more traditional virtues of inter-human relationship. The theoretical framework developed herein will subsequently be integrated with, and illustrated by, findings from our field research into Damara and broader KhoeSan ethical perspectives on human/nonhuman relations, and on the nature of (and relationships between) human and non-human flourishing. It will also be brought into dialogue with existing literature on African environmental ethics. Academic outputs in development include Hannis and Sullivan, 'Reciprocity and flourishing in an African landscape' for which we have an abstract accepted for Flourishing: Comparative Religious Environmental Ethics, Hartman, L.M. (ed.). Please see responses to RCUK narrative impact below.
