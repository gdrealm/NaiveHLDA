The physics of the central star is studied by reference to the sun where spectroscopic observations tell us about the physics of the gases and magnetic fields in the atmosphere. The same physical processes are relevant to and studied in the context of the maintainance of magnetic fields in diverse environments ranging from planets to stars to galaxy clusters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D001072/1","grantId":"PP/D001072/1","fundValue":"971015","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Advancs in knowledge in the areas\nof observational and theoretical astrophysics.\nUnderstanding the sun and the formation and dynamics of planetary systems Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal","person":"John Christopher Papaloizou","coPersons":["Alexander  Schekochihin","Helen Elizabeth Mason","Gordon Ian Ogilvie","Nigel Oscar  Weiss","Michael Richard Proctor"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" Advances in the unserstanding of accretion disks in astrophysics, solar physics and observations of the solar atmosphere The advances we achieve feed directly into lecture courses and the training of graduste students Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
