{"id":"269B05DC-15A8-4DD6-BC27-4653BBC257E0","title":"An integrated structural approach to a panel of pathogen-derived peroxidases with potential therapeutic targeting","abstractText":"When microbial organisms invade the human (or other animal) host in which they live and breed, these intracellular pathogens become exposed to deleterious molecules such as hydrogen peroxide produced by the host organism. These small molecules oxidize and disable other larger biological molecules, much in the way that household bleach is able to attack ?germs?. As a response to this defence mechanism various enzymes have evolved in the microbes that provide a secondary pathogenic defence mechanism against these hydrogen peroxide-like molecules. This project will look at the three-dimensional atomic structure of three novel enzymes (AhpD, GPXI and APX) that are components of the defence mechanisms of the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a slow growing bacterium that give rises to tuberculosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (a parasitic flagellate bacterium). Knowing the structures of these enzymes will enable us to better understand the way in which they operate and carry out their function. This knowledge will be an important milestone for the future development of small molecule specific inhibitors with potential for development as therapeutic agents (drugs). About 8-10 million people a year become newly infected with tuberculosis and an increasing percentage of patients display resistance to the main drugs used for treatment. World-wide around 2-3 million people per year fatally succumb to the disease, with disportionate consequence for less highly developed countries. Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas? disease that, in Latin America, kills 50,000 people a year. Currently there is no effective treatment for Chagas?. This programme of research is focused upon rationally selected enzyme targets in these pathogenic organisms, giving the prospect that new approaches can be found to combat these debilitating and economically disastrous diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401079","grantId":"G0401079","fundValue":"218849","fundStart":"2005-09-19","fundEnd":"2008-09-18","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Snezana  Djordjevic","coPersons":["Paul  Driscoll"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
