The innovative material offers architects and designers a cladding and surface product imbued with a unique aesthetic, possessing significant sustainable properties. \nThe kiln casting process converts 'low value' waste into a 'high value' product, made from 97-100% recycled waste, without any cementatious or synthetic polymers, used in many existing 'green' composite products. The process utilizes locally sourced waste, thus avoiding excessive transportation of raw materials. All manufacturing waste can be re-introduced into the input stream (Zero Waste, Closed Loop Manufacturing) and can be recycled at end of life (Cradle to Cradle Design Paradigm, End of Life Manufacturing). \nWhilst the Research Team developed a number of prototype samples, demonstrating a wide range of aesthetic qualities, the resources available within the existing research facility limited the creative scope of the research.\nThis project involves establishing a pilot-manufacturing unit, which would enhance creative development of the new material and facilitate increased scales of production (size and volume). Through increasing the creative and commercial potential of the material, the project will expand the aesthetic vocabulary for architects, designers and craft-makers - offering a broader range of design solutions.\nThe research team intend developing 'design led' products, aimed at architects and designers who are particularly focused on the use of innovative and sustainable building products. A priority of the research team is to exploit how increased scales of manufacture, in turn increases the creative possibilities, through previously unforeseen artistic output, including the possibility for engagement in public art projects and engendering a sense of place through utilizing locally sourced raw materials.\nThe project entails the Research Team working in collaboration with a project partner, Recycling Lives (RL), a 'Queens Award for Sustainable Enterprise' winning company, based in Preston, UK. RL are a perfect fit as partner as they are a major UK recycling company with over forty years experience in the recycling and waste management industry. It is proposed that the pilot plant would be established on their premises. They will provide, in kind, manufacturing, business administration, sales and marketing support, through their company infrastructure. \nAn unforeseen pathway to impact, emerging from the above-completed research, addresses the recycling of CRT lead-bearing glass - currently presenting a major environmental problem to both the UK and global recycling industry, due to the high lead content of the glass. With 1.9 billion screens still in use globally, there is an urgent need to develop novel, environmentally acceptable solutions. \nThe research team has undertaken preliminary empirical research, which suggests that the incorporation of CRT glass in the new Eco-material can result in the lead content being safely encapsulated. Proving the safe encapsulation of lead within the new Eco-material, would be a crucial step towards realising the commercial potential of CRT lead glass, whilst also offering a novel solution to the CRT recycling problem. \n\nThe project will demonstrate how research, originating within creative art practice, can lead to the delivery of significant creative, economic, social and environmental impacts.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L00738X/1","grantId":"AH/L00738X/1","fundValue":"78527","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This section will be completed at end of project - 28th Feb 2015 Construction,Creative Economy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail Cultural,Economic","person":"David  Binns","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":" This project is still ongoing - due to complete 28th Feb 2015 \n\nA number of objectives have however been realised:\n\nDevelopment of a product range in readiness for full production. \nThe the Investigators have undertaken a process of creative development and prototype production of a range of new products, in order to begin exploiting the artistic/creative possibilities of the new material. In particular they identified an existing product commonly known as a 'slip'. This product is essentially a decorative tile, designed to embellish existing wall surfaces. This product is increasingly popular with architects and interior designers, evidenced in numerous new architecture projects and high street stores. Existing products are either made in either brick clay or thin sections of imported stone - relying entirely on unreplenishable sources of raw material.\nUsing this basic idea, the investigators have designed a range of decorative facing slips made entirely from 100% waste material. The original, simple tessellating shape has been expanded to become more three dimensional, offering a far wider range of aesthetic possibilities. A variety of dimensions, configurations, textures and colours have been developed, offering a range of creative possibilities. This product and its associated making processes is now in a state of readiness awaiting larger scale production. \n\nImbuing a sense of place within the new material and products we create, is a central part of the aesthetic aims of the project. The Investigators have used the period to develop two projects, which explore introducing a 'Sense of Place' within the material. The first project involved investigating how Welsh slate waste may be utilised within the process. Slate waste is in abundance across many areas of North Wales and Cumbria. Furthermore, this material defines the architectural vernacular of many towns and villages in these regions. As such, the Investigators saw this material providing an ideal opportunity to develop a new material, with the aim being to both capitalise on the huge volumes of waste slate, whilst echoing the natural aesthetic of the region. The Investigators have undertaken a significant number tests introducing varying percentages of crushed slate waste. The team are continuing to develop tests with this material, believing it broadens the overall aesthetic scope of the new material. \n\nThe second Place-based project has been an evolving collaboration with Clayground Collective, a London Based arts group that work with various artists and designers using ceramics. Their project 'Clay Cargo 2014', seeks to renew the connection between ceramics and the waterways, examining sites along the canals between London, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. \nThe investigators were invited to respond to two sites: Middleport Pottery in Stoke and the Thames foreshore. The project makes use of the material's ability to encapsulate ceramic and industrial fragments within the glass/ceramic matrix to create contemporary objects. The aim being to create material samples that convey a clear locational identity whilst evoking a strong sense of the history of both places. \nAt Middleport pottery fragments of broken pottery were dredged up from the canal and dug from local spoil heaps, before being encapsulated within the forming process in ways that retain the identity of each fragment. \nAlong the Thames foreshore the tide reveals a huge range of ceramic fragments from broken medieval pottery to turn of the century tobacco pipes; the variety of objects reflecting the rich social history along the Thames. Similar to the Middleport work, these shard fragments were encapsulated within the glass ceramic matrix, changing the meaning of the found objects through a process of metamorphosis. The discarded fragments of pottery are transformed into a piece of art that is both contemporary in it's appearance and intent, yet is imbued with a strong resonance of both history and place. \n\nThe Investigators see this objective of the project as increasingly important, providing many opportunities for the creation of products that convey site-specific messages about social history and industrial archeology. In turn, the Investigators believe this can be capitalised on commercially, providing many opportunities to collaborate with architects and designers, developing unique, bespoke products for inclusion in their design schemes.\n\nOne of the more commercially beneficial processes that the Follow-on Grant has allowed us to explore is the use of CRT glass to replace the glass recovered from post-consumer containers. One of the major challenges in using this lead glass is the toxic nature of the glass for production and ultimately its use in the environment. We have successfully tested a number of CRT glass products and have identified temperatures at which we are seeing very small amounts of lead leaching post finishing. We have had samples tested internally and have had some samples forwarded to the National Labs Service for testing to see any potential hazards that might be present from leaching in service and at end of life.
