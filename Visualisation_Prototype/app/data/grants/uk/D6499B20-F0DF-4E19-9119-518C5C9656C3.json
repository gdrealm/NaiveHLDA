{"id":"D6499B20-F0DF-4E19-9119-518C5C9656C3","title":"Microfluidic Microdroplet Reactors","abstractText":"We plan to generate a novel platform technology for experimental science, and demonstrate its utility by applying it to the identification of novel biological catalysts for chemical reactions. The key features of the technology will be its speed, scale and general utility. Individual reactions will take place inside microdroplets of water carried in a fluorocarbon continuous phase within microfluidic channels. These microreactors will be load up with the components for a reaction. Additional compounds can then be added by fusing a droplet with a second droplet. Once a reaction has occurred in a droplet the presence of product will be determined either spectroscopically or by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry has the advantage that it can provide high resolution structural information. However interfacing it with microdroplets is an unexplored and very challenging part of the proposal. In this way new catalysts will be identified which can then be improved by taking them through several rounds of selection.A modular device will be assembled that load, fuse, incubate sort and split droplets and present then to either a spectroscopic or mass spectrometric screen. The fabrication of this device, and especially the integration of the various components is a significant challenge, and will be the main focus of the first part of the project.We plan to use this modular device for the discovery of novel biological catalysts. These will either be enzymes that incorporate new functionality, or enzymes from unusual organisms. This is an example of an important project that will become more accessible using the system we develop than using than with existing approaches. We expect to get an efficiency enhancement of over 104. The project is multidisciplinary and at the forefront of several areas: the use of microdroplets, the use of microfluidics for lab-on-a-chip applications, the use of mass spectrometry, and the directed evolution of enzymes. It will be possible to customise the devices we generate to tackle a broad range of problems in biological, chemical and materials science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D048664/1","grantId":"EP/D048664/1","fundValue":"4847470","fundStart":"2006-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  They stimulated further research which subsequently led to several spinouts Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Economic","person":"Chris  Abell","coPersons":["Wilhelm  Huck","Florian  Hollfelder","Carol V Robinson","Andrew James De Mello"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" The Basic Technology funded complementary research into microdroplets technology at Cambridge and Imperial. At Imperial a focus was to create and define sophisticated optical techniques for droplet interrogation, create functional components for droplet manipulation and to integrate these activities with a range of biological programmes at Cambridge. At Cambridge there was additionally a major effort to integrate microfluidics with mass spectrometry.\n\nWe have successfully fabricated microfluidic devices to manipulate individual droplets on-chip. Devices have been fabricated that create droplets with frequencies up to 20 kHz, with volumes ranging from 20 fL to several nL. These droplets can be fused passively using surface chemistry, or actively with strong electric fields generated by microfabricated electrodes. Fluorescence intensity detection is used to study the contents of droplets at high frequencies, allow droplet-based enzyme assays and high-throughput screening. Sub-nM sensitivity is achieved routinely, and single molecule sensitivity has been demonstrated. Electric fields have also been used to sort droplets at kHz rates, where the\n\nfields are triggered by fluorescence signals generated via laser-induced fluorescence.\n\nWe have demonstrated DNA amplification, in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) followed by a fluorescent assay of the expressed enzyme, developing all the components required for protein evolution experiments. However our achievements in biology have gone much further as we have become increasingly aware of the potential of microdroplets for cell-based studies. The key achievements (by area) include:\n\nFABRICATION We have pioneered numerous innovations in microdroplet device design including: novel methods to controllably merge droplets based on device architecture (pillar arrays) or surface modification; and the development of a sorter/de-emulsifier that feeds droplets contents into any analytical device. We have devised novel approaches for droplet-based dilution for high-throughput screening applications that are now being implemented into an automated instrument. We have also developed emulsion formulations that stop (99%) leaking from droplets.\n\nDETECTION We were the first to demonstrate direct mass spectrometry of individual droplets. Other firsts include: demonstration of fluorescence lifetime imaging, enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR of microdroplet flows; demonstration of refractive index variation, and single molecule detection in picolitre-volume droplets. We have combined the analytical capability with sorting to develop droplet-based microfluidics as a high efficiency tool in 2D proteomics.\n\nSCREENING We have defined multiple formats for cell-based and enzymatic assays in droplet arrays and in movingdroplets analysed in flow. We showed that continuous microdroplet flows can be used to perform high-throughput DNA binding assays and to probe protein-protein interactions. We were the first to demonstrate that picolitre-volume droplets can be used for single cell experiments, and developed a method for rapid compartmentalisation of eukaryotic cells. We developed a device to follow up to 4000 cell based assays simultaneously over several days, constantly monitoring\n\nseveral different parameters.\n\nBIOLOGY We demonstrated droplet-based continuous flow PCR with an efficiency similar to benchtop PCR, and droplet IVTT from a single copy of a gene. Subsequently we carried out DNA amplification followed by IVTT in the same droplet. A protocol for directed evolution of a hydrolase that consisted of cell lysis at droplet formation, incubation with a substrate and sorting after optical interrogation for product appearance was developed and its utility shown by determination of the enrichment in a full evolution cycle. We have initiated studies to use microdroplets to study quorum sensing in bacteria, and for algal strain selection for biofuel development. The research has applications in all aspects of experimental science, most clearly those relating to molecular and cell biology. The will be of interest to companies involved in biopharmaceuticals, antibody production, assay development, and diagnostics. This research provides the basis for a new platform technology for experimental science with applications across biology, cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, into chemistry and material science.
