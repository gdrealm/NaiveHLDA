{"id":"2A582AC7-86EC-4634-9BF2-2FDA6C84B01D","title":"Accounting for Gender in the Modern Apprenticeship Programme in Scotland","abstractText":"<p>Current resource allocation processes are built on the assumption of rational, self-interested economic actors with little or no reference to gender. However, evidence shows that women and men, and girls and boys, often have differing experiences of policy interventions across a broad range of areas including healthcare, transport and criminal justice.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption of gender-neutrality can lead to policies that impact unequally on men and women. The budget process can therefore sustain and reinforce gender inequalities by not recognising, and subsequently accounting for, the different needs of women and men. As a result, resources are allocated inefficiently and unequally between men and women.</p>\n\n<p>A key example of where a gender-neutral approach to policy formulation and resourcing has led to the replication and reinforcement of gender inequalities can be found in the Scottish Modern Apprenticeship (MA) programme.</p>\n\n<p>This research and knowledge exchange programme has two main aims:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to design a tailored Gender Impact Analysis (GIA) tool for public sector bodies/government departments linked to spending allocations that can be applied to any social/economic policy</li>\n\n <li>to develop a case study of Scottish Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) as a worked example that would assist public bodies/government departments in implementing the GIA tool.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005685/1","grantId":"ES/K005685/1","fundValue":"17031","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ailsa  McKay","coPersons":["Emily  Thomson"],"organisation":"Glasgow Caledonian University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
