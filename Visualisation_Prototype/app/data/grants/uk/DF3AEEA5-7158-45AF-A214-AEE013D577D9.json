However, this has placed undue emphasis on the home as a place of sickness and care, ignoring the more holistic concept of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO 1946). In that context, what then does it mean to have a ‘healthy’ home?</p>\n\n<p>The ‘Designing Healthy Homes’ project will investigate this by gathering a rich suite of qualitative data on daily routines and thoughts about healthiness at home from ten households. Combining the resulting photographs, diaries and interviews with participant-designed 3D architectural models will produce a series of personal interpretations of a healthy home. The whole design package will be presented to industry professionals and healthcare practitioners, including the opportunity for them to experience the 3D designs and to discuss issues and ideas with the designers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The results will highlight the synergies and tensions between house design and use, but will also provide the basis for a re-thinking of the role of the home in the wider healthcare system.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009435/1","grantId":"ES/K009435/1","fundValue":"181792","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian James  Ewart","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
