{"id":"CBB982F1-0EAA-4FD5-B181-A53E3A0502C3","title":"Estimation of Parametric Linear Factor Models: Theory and Applications","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to develop independent methodologies for linear dynamic factor models. The main objectives are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To&nbsp;develop suitable parametric estimation techniques for the general class of parametric dynamic factor models able to capture the joint dynamic behaviour of a large set of variables observed across time.</li>\n\n <li>To&nbsp;establish the asymptotic distributional theory of these estimators, i.e. consistency and asymptotic distribution.</li>\n\n <li>To develop extensive applications with empirical data. In particular we aim to verify the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the models, using the estimation techniques described in (1) and (2) above, for various macroeconomic time series of interest such as inflation or the level of economic activity as well as for financial data such as asset returns.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This research will be of interest to several different constituencies. Academics, in particular those who focus on the specification and estimation issues of factor models, will find both the methodologies developed and the results obtained of great interest. The results will also be of interest to a wide group of economists working in Central Banks and Treasury Departments, whose main interest is in forecasting macroeconomic variables such as inflation and the level of economic activity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G024243/1","grantId":"ES/G024243/1","fundValue":"78392","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paolo  Zaffaroni","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
