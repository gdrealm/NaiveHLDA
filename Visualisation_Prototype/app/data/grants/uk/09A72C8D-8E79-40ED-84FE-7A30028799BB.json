{"id":"09A72C8D-8E79-40ED-84FE-7A30028799BB","title":"Aspects of nonlinear evolution PDEs","abstractText":"During the three-month research visit of Professor Himonas to Cambridge we will investigate two problems:(a) The Cauchy problem for a certain integrable generalisation of the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS)equation. This equation is actually related with the NLS in the same way that the Camassa-Holmequation is related to the Korteweg-de Vries equation. We will use both the inverse scattering transform method and PDE techniques for the analysis of the Cauchy problem. (b) Initial-boundary value problems on the half-line for a large class of nonlinear evolution PDEs whose linear part is dispersive. We will consider the nonlinearity as forcing and we will use a general formula obtained recently for the solution of linear dispersive equations at the half-line to formulate an integral equation. This latter equation will be analysed using PDE techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F034911/1","grantId":"EP/F034911/1","fundValue":"16407","fundStart":"2008-03-12","fundEnd":"2008-06-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Athanassios  Fokas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
