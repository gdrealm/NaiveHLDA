{"id":"B37EF85E-C42F-40BE-B51D-5EBD3ABF5DF0","title":"The effects of distracting stimuli on binding in working memory","abstractText":"<p>An issue of importance in visual cognition and working memory research concerns the question of how features are bound together to form integrated representations of objects that can subsequently be retained in memory. When a visual display consists of a number of coloured shapes in various locations, how are these features stored in terms of integrated objects rather than disparate colours, shapes, and occupied locations? Recent research with simple abstract displays has indicated that features are bound into objects in working memory relatively automatically, without the need for focused attention. However, it is important to examine how binding processes may operate when stimuli and context are more analogous to the real-world visual environment. Objects are rarely encountered in absolute or even relative isolation. </p> \n<p>It is therefore intended to examine how the presence of to-be-ignored distractor stimuli may impact on memory for combinations of visual features such as shape and colour. Focused attention may be particularly required for feature binding in these circumstances. In addition, potential contributions to temporary storage from long-term memory will be investigated by moving from using abstract stimuli to photographs of real-world objects, presented both in neutral contexts and within compatible background scenes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2184","grantId":"RES-000-22-2184","fundValue":"80664","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John Allen","coPersons":["Alan  Baddeley","Graham James Hitch"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
