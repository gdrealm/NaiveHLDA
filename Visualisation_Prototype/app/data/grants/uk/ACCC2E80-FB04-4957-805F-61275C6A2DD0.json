The interpretation of these signals requires a deep understanding of the physical processes involved in generating them. This can only be achieved through systematic study of the underlying process in the laboratory. Laboratory data is therefore an essential component in any successful astronomical campaign. Recently a European initiative, the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre (VAMDC), has attempted to link all they key databases in the atomic and molecular physics area, and to make the fully interoperable through the development of dedicated software. The VAMDC portal now provides access to about 30 distinct databases, including UK based one such as UDfA and Chianti, which cover the key atomic and molecular processes required for astrophysics. The present project will improve the quality and accessibility of these data both by direct improvement tof VAMDC protocols and services, and by improving the services provided by UK-based databases which link to VAMDC.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007782/1","grantId":"ST/M007782/1","fundValue":"22490","fundStart":"2014-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel John Mason","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
