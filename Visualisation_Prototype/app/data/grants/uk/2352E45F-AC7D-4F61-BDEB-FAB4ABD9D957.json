Anatomically, synapses consists of the membranes of two neurones which are separated by a microscopic fluid-filled space. The mechanism which allows communication across this space is called synaptic transmission. This process consists of release of a chemical from one neurone (the presynaptic neurone) which crosses the space where it activates very specific receptors on a second neurone (the postsynaptic neurone). This may produce an excitatory effect in the second neurone increasing its activity, or it may inhibit its activity. The balance between these excitatory and inhibitory inputs determines whether or not the message is successfully transmitted across the synapse. This complex process is not static and the sensitivity of synapses can be altered by a wide range of mechanisms. Changes in the sensitivity of a synaptic transmission are known as synaptic plasticity. One form of synaptic plasticity is known as use-dependent synaptic plasticity. This occurs as a consequence of prolonged activity in the presynaptic neurone and it leads to increased sensitivity of the synapse, such that incoming messages are more likely to be relayed to the postsynaptic neurone. This process is fundamental to many neurological functions, including memory and pain. This study will examine the mechanisms which lead to synaptic plasticity following the type of stimulation of sensory nerves that would cause pain, such as repetition of a painful stimulus, a nerve injury or tissue injury and inflammation. Under these conditions, synapses become hyperexcitable, and this may lead to spontaneous pain, exaggerated pain, or pain in response to stimuli that would not normally cause pain. The mechanisms causing this are known to be complex and diverse, but they involve increased activity in chemical pathways inside the neuronal cells that initiate change in these cells. These changes are believed to be significant in the development of chronic pain. The aim of this study is to identify signalling molecules within neuronal cells that are important in increasing excitability under conditions of inflammation. We will also identify which specific neuronal receptors are involved in this process. The results from this work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the development of chronic pain. Information from this type of study is vital in developing new pain-relieving drugs for conditions that currently have no reliable treatment, and many of the therapies that are available have unacceptable or life-threatening side effects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010527/1","grantId":"BB/D010527/1","fundValue":"303466","fundStart":"2006-04-03","fundEnd":"2010-02-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"F  Boissonade","coPersons":["Anne  King"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
