{"id":"E94BCA73-BD68-48BA-8FA8-727FFBC1333D","title":"ClearfLo: Clean Air for London","abstractText":"Poor air quality, particularly in urban areas, has a demonstrable effect on human health, but the processes responsible for producing the main pollutants, namely particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and heat are not well understood and are poorly predicted. The ambition of ClearfLo is to provide integrated measurements of the meteorology, composition and particulate loading of London's urban atmosphere, made at street level and at elevated sites, complemented by modelling, to improve predictive capability for air quality. This ambition will be addressed by establishing new measurement capabilities in London, which will be used for long-term measurements and intensive observation periods, and by analysis and modelling of the measurements to establish key processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H003231/1","grantId":"NE/H003231/1","fundValue":"878568","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  1) Initiation of collaboration with the Met Office to evaluate their new higher resolution models (100 m, 330 m, 1.5 km) with our data in close to real time (i.e. past 24 h)\n\n2) Data collected have been used by City of London residents to consider energy use\n\n3) London Climate Change Partnership have started to consider how London weather and climate should be observed\n\n4) Informed Shanghai Institute of Meteorological Science - in their development of urban focused flux measurements\n\n5) Assessment of Urban CO2/ greenhouse gas inventories at a range of scales\n\n6) Informed: Establishing Integrated Weather, Climate, Water And Related Environmental Services For Megacities And Large Urban Complexes - Initial Guidance (World Meteorological Organisation) - Global Framework for Climate Services Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Transport Societal,Economic,Policy & public services","person":"Christine Susan Grimmond","coPersons":["Frank  Kelly"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" 1) Importance of building scale vents to local scale - heat, water and carbon dioxide exchanges\n2) The nature of the stability (mixing) of the atmosphere in central London\n3) The impact of human activities on carbon dioxide exchanges\n4) The effect of spatial scale on anthropogenic heat and carbon dioxide fluxes and the size of variability (from building to city scales)\n5) The nature of tree cover in London (3-d characteristics) and that the tallest trees in London are in the centre of London\n 6) The influence of sea breezes on boundary layer development and aerosol movement\n7) A small increase in vegetation cover has a bigger influence on evaporation rates at low fractions of vegetation cover than when there is a large amount of vegetation present. \n8) The implications of atmospheric stability on the use of scintillometry in urban areas. There are times when there is insufficient mixing for the instruments to provide turbulent heat fluxes. \n8) The manufacturers of scintillometers still need to undertake considerable development of these instruments but are reasonably responsive to being informed of issues.\n9) Ceilometers can provide detailed insights into differences in processes across the central city to track individual events (e.g. sea breeze type events). However, there is need for a lot more analysis to tease out these signals. \n10) Getting permission to locate instruments can be very time consuming and often is not successful.
