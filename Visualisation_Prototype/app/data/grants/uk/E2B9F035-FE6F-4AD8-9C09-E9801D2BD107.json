{"id":"E2B9F035-FE6F-4AD8-9C09-E9801D2BD107","title":"Intensified Heat Transfer for Energy Saving in Process Industries","abstractText":"The project addresses the technical breakthrough in energy management urgently needed in the process industries. An integrated and multidisciplinary research will be made to achieve maximum potential for heat recovery and to allow a step change improvement in heat recovery through the application of process intensification method and associated heat transfer equipment. New design concepts and in-depth knowledge will be gained from various studies proposed in this project, especially investigation of fouling kinetics, analysis of intensified heat transfer, exploitation of enhanced heat transfer techniques, gaining of strategic guidance for the implementation of intensified heat exchanger networks, and development of automated design methodology for intensified heat recovery systems. The successful completion of the project will radically improve energy and capital efficiency for process industries, and significantly accelerate the implementation of intensified heat transfer design in industrial practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G060274/1","grantId":"EP/G060274/1","fundValue":"236487","fundStart":"2009-11-09","fundEnd":"2011-11-08","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin  Smith","coPersons":["Jin-Kuk  Kim"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
