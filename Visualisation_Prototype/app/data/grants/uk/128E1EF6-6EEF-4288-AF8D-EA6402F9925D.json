{"id":"128E1EF6-6EEF-4288-AF8D-EA6402F9925D","title":"Soft Regulation?: Conforming with the Principle of 'Comply or Explain'","abstractText":"Governments advocate flexible regulation wherever possible, to encourage innovation and economic growth, but success depends crucially on regulatees’ attitudes to compliance. This project seeks to improve understanding of the bases on which compliance decisions are made in a corporate context, as well their positive and negative impacts, by examining conformance with the principle of ‘comply or explain’ in corporate governance codes of best practice in the UK and Germany. Both countries have similar codes but very different political and legal traditions and corporate structures. Since investors treat code compliance as a proxy for board effectiveness there are strong reasons for companies to be seen to comply with code provisions. However, non-compliance does occur in some companies around some issues. The project will use statistical data and qualitative research interviews with directors, company secretaries, and investors to explore differences in attitudes to compliance and compliance practice both between companies and between countries. It will also explore perceptions of the impact of different compliance decisions, both positive and negative, on board conduct, culture and effectiveness, and investor sentiment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1501","grantId":"RES-000-23-1501","fundValue":"177826","fundStart":"2006-05-22","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"J  Roberts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
