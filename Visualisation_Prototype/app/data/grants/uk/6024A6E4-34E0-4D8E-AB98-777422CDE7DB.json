{"id":"6024A6E4-34E0-4D8E-AB98-777422CDE7DB","title":"Sustainable Consumption and Production - Forecasts and Scenarios for a More Sustainable Society","abstractText":"<p>The issues surrounding the way individuals and society as a whole produce and consume materials, goods and services are seen to be increasingly important and requiring ever more sustainable solutions. Policymakers, manufacturers, consumers and other stakeholders face the daunting challenge of finding effective and sustainable solutions, often in a relatively short time period. Changing the way individuals and societies behave, act and think about consumption and production is a formidable task. A better understanding is needed of what will happen if behaviours don’t change, what change options are available and how these might have different scenario implications for the future.</p> \n<p>The BRASS Centre (Cardiff University) in conjunction with Dr Tim Cooper (Sheffield Hallam) and Dr Jane Probert (Swansea University) seek to provide some insight into future options and impacts in sustainable consumption and production (SCP) using a set of carefully crafted ‘What if?’ scenarios. New ways of doing business, making and selling products and services, and&nbsp;consuming and using such products is vital if the move towards sustainability is to be achieved. The seminar series aims to widen the SCP debate to include not only food, transport and energy, but also aspects of health and well being, tourism and leisure and relationships.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4331","grantId":"RES-451-25-4331","fundValue":"14222","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ken  Peattie","coPersons":["Tim  Cooper","Jane  Probert"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
