{"id":"BC59ACE0-B11E-4D6E-A7D9-64B7F2836FAC","title":"Marketplace Exclusion: Representations, Resistances and Responses","abstractText":"<p>This seminar series tackles the important societal issue of marketplace exclusion: the mechanisms through which individuals and communities are barred from the resources and opportunities provided by the marketplace to the average citizen. It explores how marketplace exclusion operates within UK society and what measures we might take to help counter it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The series brings together leading scholars, early career researchers, and relevant user groups that are interested in the intersections between marketplace participation and other social categories, in particular community cohesion.</p>\n\n<p>The final seminar in the series will take the form of a theatre production with ten unemployed (NEETS) young people. Using findings from the previous five seminars the production will be designed to explore individuals' everyday experiences of alienation from the marketplace and create a response through theatre. The performance will be followed by a practitioner workshop involving the cast, local organisations and academics/practitioners from earlier seminars. The performance and workshop will uphold or challenge the issues discussed in earlier seminars. It will also allow excluded consumers to find a voice and find new and positive ways to understand themselves and their communities. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001101/1","grantId":"ES/L001101/1","fundValue":"23089","fundStart":"2013-11-30","fundEnd":"2016-03-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Parsons","coPersons":["James Alister Fitchett","Harris  Beider","Robert John Cluley","Michael Arthur Saren","Mihaela Ligia Kelemen","Gemma Lucy Burgess","Christina  Goulding"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
