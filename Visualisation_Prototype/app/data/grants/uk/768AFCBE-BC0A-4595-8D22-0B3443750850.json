It identifies existing governance constraints to such integration and explores how they can be overcome. The study is undertaken in two countries that contain among the most extensive remaining tropical forests in the world, Brazil and Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed research addresses the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>What is the evidence about the main synergies and trade-offs between forest mitigation and adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia?</li>\n\n <li>How can multi-level policy processes better exploit existing synergies between forest mitigation and adaptation (while recognising existing trade-offs)?</li>\n\n <li>How can existing political constraints to such integration be overcome and existing opportunities for integration be realised?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This research contributes to the knowledge on multi-level forest governance as well as on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In examining the governance constraints and opportunities for integration, it aims to inform ongoing global and national policy processes about how to improve effectiveness of policy formulation and implementation.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00879X/1","grantId":"ES/K00879X/1","fundValue":"249100","fundStart":"2013-12-31","fundEnd":"2016-12-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Monica  Di Gregorio","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
