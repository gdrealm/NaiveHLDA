We recently identified a conserved ubiquitylation pathway in trypanosomes that controls the surface copy number of important trans-membrane domain proteins, and which provides a means for the first time to manipulate trans-membrane domain protein abundance in these parasites in a rational manor, and to assess their importance to host cell invasion and virulence. \nThis application seeks to assess the significance of the surface protein ubiquitylation pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi for: \n1. Parasite viability, host cell invasion and life cycle progression,\n2. Maintenance of the surface coat, specificallycopy number of trans-membrane domain proteins and their impact on the global surface proteome, \n3. Possible value as a therapeutic target, by assessment of viability in vitro.\nThe work will combine state of the art genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, together with SILAC proteomics for unbiased analysis of the surface/cellular proteome.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M026248/1","grantId":"MR/M026248/1","fundValue":"21170","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark C Field","coPersons":["David  Horn"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
