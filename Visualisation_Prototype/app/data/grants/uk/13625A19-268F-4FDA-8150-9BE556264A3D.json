This has clear implications for operational policing and currently informs crime reduction strategy. More recent academic research demonstrates that other regularities in crime patterns exist and that their identification can inform police decision-making and resource allocation strategies. For example, our research shows that when a burglary occurs at one location, others are more likely at the same location or nearby in the near future. Put another way, the risk of burglary spreads in much the same ways as a communicable disease. The use of such intelligence is particularly important at a time when police budgets are being cut. However, because the types of analysis discussed are at the cutting edge of academic research, they cannot be conducted using available software.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the project is to work with our project partners (West Midlands police) to bridge this knowledge-practice gap, identifying the most promising types of analysis and developing software packages for use by our project partners that would make a real difference to police practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000721/1","grantId":"ES/K000721/1","fundValue":"23792","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2014-09-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Shane Douglas Johnson","coPersons":["Lisa  Wainer"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
