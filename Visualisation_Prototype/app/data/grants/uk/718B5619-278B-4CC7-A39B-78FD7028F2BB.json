It will print, in parallel, critical editions of the so-called 'Lumen anime C' and of Ulrich Putsch's 'Das liecht der sel' (both translate as 'The Light of the Soul'). Given that both works well make extensive use of examples drawn from natural history, the book potentially provides a valuable basis for the future research by historians of science, as well as by theologians, philologist, and literary historians.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112766/1","grantId":"112766/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-01-15","fundEnd":"2006-05-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Harris","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
