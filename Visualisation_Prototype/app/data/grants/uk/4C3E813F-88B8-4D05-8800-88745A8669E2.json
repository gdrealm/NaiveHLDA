John Wallis (1616-1703) on grammar, logic and music theory","abstractText":"John Wallis (1616-1703) was renowned first and foremost in his day as an outstanding mathematician, whose many original contributions to the field were widely acknowledged in spite of frequent quarrels with colleagues over issues of precedence. Furthermore, he was regarded as perhaps the most skilful cryptanalyst in the world, a reputation which rested on his achievements in deciphering a large number of letters written in code that were intercepted during the Civil Wars. His appointment in 1649 as Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford / a post he kept for over fifty years until his death / was a reward for the services he had rendered the Parliamentary side as a decipherer. \\n\\nEven among the many virtuosi and polymaths of the mid-seventeenth century, Wallis stands out for the range of his interests and the significance of his work. He was prominent as a linguist, as he was the author of an influential grammar of the English language. He also wrote a textbook on logic, and published various theological works. He was a founder member of the Royal Society, and contributed frequently to its journal, the Philosophical Transactions, carrying out observations on the tides and collecting reports of unusual events and phenomena. In addition to pursuing his wide-ranging scholarly and scientific interests, Wallis was occupied with various duties connected with his position as Keeper of the Archives of the University of Oxford, and in this capacity he was often called upon to assist in university affairs.\\n \\nGiven the range and importance of these activities it is curious there has been no recent intellectual biography of Wallis, of the sort which have been produced for contemporaries of his such as Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke (in the case of the last-named, five biographies in the last four years). One reason for this gap is doubtless that scholars are awaiting the completion of the OUP edition of Wallis's correspondence, which forms the heart of the present project. A second reason is that, while Wallis's mathematical work has been the subject of regular academic scrutiny in its own right, little attention has been paid to his non-mathematical works. \\n\\nBesides supporting the ongoing publication of Wallis's correspondence, the present project will produce an intellectual biography of John Wallis and critical editions of his three major non-mathematical works: the English grammar, the tract on ancient and modern music theory, and the logic textbook. These editions will provide translations of Latin originals (in the case of the Logic, Wallis's own) and have interdisciplinary introductions which make the contents accessible to the non-specialist. We also plan to organise two symposia, to engage a larger range of academic expertise to analyse and explore the documentary evidence which the core team of investigators has produced. For the symposium in the final year we will commission a coordinated set of research papers which will form the basis for a book on Wallis aimed at a general academic readership.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E009123/1","grantId":"AH/E009123/1","fundValue":"324215","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The one aspect of the project which attracted most public attention outside academic circles was the work we did on the history of teaching language to the deaf in the seventeenth century. There is clearly a keen appetite on the part of the Deaf community for scholarly work on the earlier history of sign language and the education of the Deaf, which is felt to be an undervalued and understudied part of their heritage.\n\nWe established active working relations with the British Society for Deaf History, and have exchanged visits and information. David Cram and Jaap Maat were invited to attend a meeting of the Society at which a book by Peter Jackson on Alexander Popham's Notebook was launched, an event which was recorded and broadcast by the BBC for their series See Hear.\n\nWhen it was announced that a talk was to be given by David Cram in the Royal Society lunchtime lecture series, entitled &quot;Teaching language to the deaf in the 17th century: the dispute between John Wallis and William Holder&quot; (12 November 2012) a strong enough interest was registered by members of the Deaf community that arrangements were made to have the talk simultaneously interpreted in sign language.

But even among the many virtuosi and polymaths of the mid-seventeenth century, Wallis stands out for the enormous range and depth of his interests. He was prominent as a linguist, as he was the author of an influential grammar of the English language. He also wrote a textbook on logic, and published various theological works. He was a founder member of the Royal Society, and contributed frequently to its journal, the Philosophical Transactions, carrying out observations on the tides and collecting reports of unusual events and phenomena. The present project was designed to investigate Wallis's work on grammar, logic and music theory, and to explore the interconnections between these disciplines\n\nTwo conferences were organized to bring the activities of the project to public attention and draw a wider range of scholarly expertise into play. The first of these, held at the University of Amsterdam in 2009, explored the wider context of John Wallis's writings on logic, both institutionally and intellectually. A volume of the commissioned papers from this meeting, edited by Jaap Maat under the title Logic in the Seventeenth Century: John Wallis's Contribution is due to be published by Brill. A second Symposium, held in Oxford in 2010, focused on the role of Wallis as correspondent and controversialist. This drew together researchers from a wide variety of perspectives, and added further appreciation of the inter-relatedness of Wallis's apparently distinct intellectual interests. A further volume arising from the project is David Cram and Benjamin Wardhaugh's edition John Wallis: writings on music (Ashgate, 2014). \n\nDuring the period of the project, a previously unknown manuscript by John Wallis unexpectedly came to light. This is a small notebook, in Wallis's own hand, comprising sets of exercises designed to facilitate Wallis's successful attempt to teach language to Alexander Popham, the son of a wealthy and influential family who had been profoundly deaf from birth. This manuscript is of great historical interest, since it is material evidence relating to an acrimonious and public exchange between Wallis and William Holder as to who has priority for having taught Alexander Popham to speak. A critical edition of this notebook, prepared by Jaap Maat and David Cram, is due to be published by Oxford University Press in 2015.\n\nA central purpose of the project was to provide support for the publication of Wallis's correspondence. Four volumes of The Correspondence of John Wallis 1616-1703, edited by Philip Beeley on the basis of work by the late Christoph Scriba, have appeared under the imprint of Oxford University Press. The project has connected fruitfully with other projects in the same area, in particular with the University of Oxford's Cultures of Knowledge programme, under whose umbrella publication of the Wallis correspondence is now continuing. As our project approached its conclusion, it became increasingly apparent that what is really needed is a full-blooded intellectual biography of John Wallis. It is surprising that there has been no such recent study, when seventeenth-century figures of a comparable stature, such as Hooke, Boyle and Wren, have each received multiple book-length treatments in the last ten years. \n\nAmong other work which promises to make a substantial contribution towards this longer-term goal, mention should be made of a study currently being undertaken by Dr Louisiane Ferlier, under the auspices of the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters (University College London), aiming to explore Wallis's use of his various libraries: his personal collection, the Savilean collection, and the general Bodleian collection.
