This will be an open access facility, equipped with a wide range of test and measurement equipment, allowing mechanical, chemical, electrical and optical characterisation of materials and devices. The laboratory will provide an environment in which early career researchers can meet, develop ideas, test concepts and carry out initial research studies. The work of the laboratory will link to the portfolio of EPSRC funded projects at Swansea in Advanced Manufacturing, bringing forward new concepts, created through the interaction of researchers working on fundamental science and basic technology with engineers developing innovative manufacturing systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031619/1","grantId":"EP/K031619/1","fundValue":"490082","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As this grant funded equipment rather than a research programme, there are no specific findings  ","person":"Huw  Summers","coPersons":["Owen James Guy","Paul Michael Holland","James Henley Sullivan"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":" this was an equipment grant funding the purchase of small equipment items &lt; ?10k This grant allowed us to set up multidisciplinary characterisation and measurement facilities.
