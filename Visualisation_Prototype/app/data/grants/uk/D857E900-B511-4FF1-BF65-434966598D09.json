{"id":"D857E900-B511-4FF1-BF65-434966598D09","title":"Development of autogenous vaccines for the control of amoebic gill disease in farmed Atlantic salmon","abstractText":"This project brings together fish health and vaccinology expertise from the University of Stirling's Institute of Aquaculture, Ridgeway Biologicals Ltd., an SME specialising in the production of autogenous vaccines, and aquaculture production knowledge from Marine Harvest, Scotland's biggest salmon producer, to develop and field test vaccines for the control of Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD) in farmed salmon. The objective is to develop farm-specific vaccines for AGD, a disease for which there is no vaccine despite an urgent need. This disease first caused major problems for the UK salmon aquaculture industry in 2011, costing UK and Irish industries &pound;50 million to date. Autogenous vaccines, based on farm-specific seed isolates, can be produced under specific regulations, controlled by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. Such vaccines can be manufactured and supplied in the absence of any fully licensed vaccine being available for a specific pathogen. Such products have the potential to be developed and deployed rapidly in the face of emerging disease threats such as AGD.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028224/1","grantId":"BB/M028224/1","fundValue":"170642","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2018-04-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandra  Adams","coPersons":["James Emmanuel Bron","Kimberly  Thompson"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
