The site offers updates of ongoing research, classroom activities for schools, a members forum, conference listings and translation of published research to lay summaries for public/non-specialist reading.\n\nBeneficiaries: Public, industry and academics\n\nContribution Method: The society is a forum for skilled and untrained people to engage with UK nanomedicine research. The launch event involved researchers from the UK, US and EU and patient groups. Trustees are drawn from clinical, chemical, toxicological and pharmacological research backgrounds.

For the three antiretrovirals that were studied, nanoparticle dispersions were considerably less cytotoxic, a significant population of the nanodispersions accumulated higher in target cell types and a large population were shown to transport through the gut higher than conventional formulations. The implications are that lower doses are potentially possible, with reduced toxicity profiles and a higher potential for patients to maintain adherence to their prescriptions. Penetration into target tissues and cells were also enhanced and so was antiretroviral activity. The materials also showed no specific immunological issues. In summary, the world's first potential oral nanomedicines for HIV sufferers was created during the programme, leading to considerable potential for global impact. The exploitation is being directed through charitable end-users who are targeting patients in resource-poor countries where HIV is highly prevalent (in some cases as high as 30% of the adult population). Commercial partners are also keen to launch new HIV/AIDS therapies using current drugs but with benefits such as reduced dose, reduced toxicity and enhanced patient compliance. The outcomes of the project have been patented to enable industrial translation and progression through to actual patient benefits. Considerable interest has been generated within the clinical research arena and charitable organisations (Medecins Sans Frontiere, Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative) for nanomedicine development in both the developed and developing world. Considerable additional funding has been awarded to progress to human trials that will hopefully demonstrate the value in early stage bioavailability studies. Success here will see rapid take-up both charitably and commercially through current partners. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
