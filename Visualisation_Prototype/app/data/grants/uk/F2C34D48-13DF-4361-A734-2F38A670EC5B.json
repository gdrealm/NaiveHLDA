The increasing diversity and interventions meant to promote and/or protect it are despite evidence of widespread discrimination at workplaces in Britain. If discrimination is as widespread as the existing evidence suggests, the growing diversity (especially if driven by labour cost considerations, rather than by active equality policies supplementing anti-discrimination legislations) could well have adverse impacts on employees' well-being. This research investigates whether diversity has an adverse impact on well-being and, if so, the role policy may play to mitigate such effects. The project uses the 2004 British Workplace Employment Relations Survey data, a nationally representative linked employer-employee dataset of workplaces with at least five employees, and controls for a range of measurable employee, workplace and HRM practice related influences as well as employing alternative econometric techniques that account for unmeasured workplace influences. Comprehensively establishing the impact of diversity on employee well-being serves the purpose of informing future workplace policy making, thereby helping curb adverse effects of diversity and creating a healthy workplace dynamic. This study aims to attain this objective.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2465","grantId":"RES-000-22-2465","fundValue":"50471","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Getinet Astatike Haile","coPersons":["Helen Victoria Bewley","Alexander John Bryson","Michael  White"],"organisation":"Policy Studies Institute","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
