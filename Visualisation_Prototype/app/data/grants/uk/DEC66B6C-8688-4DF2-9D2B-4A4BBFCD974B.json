This discovery raised the profile of prion diseases both in the UK and internationally due to the associated public health and economic concerns. Rather than bacteria or viruses, prion diseases are caused by a rogue form of one our own proteins (prion protein), which accumulates in the central nervous system, leading to progressive brain cell malfunction and ultimately brain cell death. In patients, these changes appear as a rapidly advancing dementia, where memory, movement, balance and personality are all affected. In the absence of any effective treatment for prion disease sufferers, there is a clear need to study how the rogue prion protein leads to irreversible brain damage. It is becoming increasingly clear that the mechanisms underlying prion diseases are also observed in more common dementias such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our research therefore aims to investigate these similar pathways with the goal of identifying new drug targets for the treatment of all neurodegenerative conditions. \n\nPrevious work in our laboratory has identified that the rogue prion protein is able to block the cell's waste-processing centre (a structure known as the proteasome). Under normal conditions, the proteasome removes old or abnormally folded proteins from nerve cells to ensure they do not accumulate to toxic levels. By monitoring mice infected with prions we have observed that this disruption in cellular waste-processing occurs very early in disease progression. This suggests that drugs aimed at preserving this function in nerve cells could be candidates for future prion disease therapy. Our research therefore aims to answer two important questions: firstly, how do rogue prion proteins enter and move round inside the brain cells to disrupt normal waste-processing and secondly, what are the downstream consequences which lead to brain cell damage? The team uses a wide range of methods to answer these questions, including the detailed study of isolated cells and prion-infected laboratory mice. By furthering our understanding of how rogue prion proteins move around inside and damage the brain cells they infect, we hope to design treatments which aim to slow or prevent the onset of clinical symptoms in patients with prion disease and related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease where similar pathways to nerve cell death exist.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J003832/1","grantId":"MR/J003832/1","fundValue":"490801","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Joanna Tabrizi","coPersons":["Giampietro  Schiavo"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
