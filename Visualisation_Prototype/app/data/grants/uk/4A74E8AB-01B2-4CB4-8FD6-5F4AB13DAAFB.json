{"id":"4A74E8AB-01B2-4CB4-8FD6-5F4AB13DAAFB","title":"Enhancing the authenticity and sustainability of the visitor heritage experiences through 3D printing technology","abstractText":"Gift shops are a common part in most museums and galleries that provide visitors with shopping experiences (Swanson and Timothy, 2012) as well as the opportunity to transform their intangible experience (gallery/museum) visit to a tangible memory through the purchase of a souvenir (Collins-Kreiner and Zins, 2011). It can also often be shown that the 'souvenirs' stocked within these gift shops are 'inauthentic' and 'homogenized' (Boorstin, 1961), 'commodified products', 'imitations', 'deceptions' (Greenwood, 1997), 'staged' (MacCannell, 1973), 'socially constructed interpretation of the genuineness of observable things' or 'mass standardisations oriented towards the export market' (MacCannell, 1989). Errington (1998) claims that making souvenir objects solely for the mass market undermines authenticity and promotes decadence. This can have the effect of detaching the viewer from engagement with the actual heritage experience and the overproduction of globalized, unsustainable, muddled, interpretive, disposable 'cultural' mementos.\n\nHowever, technological innovations in design and personalization of tourist souvenirs, through 3D printing offer opportunities to escape the serial reproduction of culture through creative processes that engage the visitor in the creation of meaning. By becoming involved in the design of souvenirs, a new supply chain is created which transforms the visitor from a consumer to a co-designer and co-producer. Through this personal and emotional engagement in the production of the souvenir, visitors may assign more emotional value and attachment to the customized souvenirs. \n\nThis project proposes to offer an alternative approach to the contemporary heritage souvenir experience through the utilization of 3D scanning and printing and online, remote interfaces between the museums, galleries and heritage sites and local 3D printing facilities, without an in-between 'gift shop' provision. It proposes to provide a desirable, customizable, co-created range of products, based on scanned in versions of artifacts within the museums, galleries and heritage sites, produced remotely in the tourists nearest local 3D printing facility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L01386X/1","grantId":"AH/L01386X/1","fundValue":"33250","fundStart":"2014-03-03","fundEnd":"2014-09-02","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As this was a short pilot study, the findings are being developed for use rather than being directly used now. They will be developed into products, publications, further funding bids and exhibitions and workshops that will become research methods to gauge and act on public engagement and reaction. It is hoped that this approach and design technology's relationship with tourism will be developed towards policy within heritage retail and public engagement strategies.

From a heritage and experiential retail perspective, the prototypes were acceptable and financially viable, in addition their being innovative in their visual aesthetic. The commercial nature of the proposed souvenirs will be further explored through collaborative funding bids and projects with Historic Scotland and other heritage partners. However, what was evident through our study through qualitative and quantitative observational research, was how the public engaged differently with their heritage surroundings through in-situ 3D printing and the customisable objects. The impact of this on the engagement with heritage is intended to be developed into wider reaching, more involved studies. It is intended that all our findings from this initial stage of the project will be presented and published through international conferences and peer reviewed publications in Design, Tourism and Heritage. In addition to this, some ideas have been taken forward and used in research-led teaching projects with 1st year design students at Edinburgh Napier University. This project received funding from Edinburgh Napier University's 50th Anniversary Fund. As the project progresses, further opportunities for engagement will be sought out including exhibitions, workshops and presentations.
