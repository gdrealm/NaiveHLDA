{"id":"42BBDD3B-F3D0-4E82-B35F-9506F4505D00","title":"Floating Tidal Turbine Fences","abstractText":"Large scale power generation from tidal currents will require the deployment of large numbers of tidal turbines arrayed in close proximity to one another. This presents significant challenges; turbine-in-wake interactions, as well as significant opportunities; arraying turbines side-by-side in closely spaced fences can significantly enhance their performance. Extreme weather survivability and the ability to maintain offshore systems are key to delivering economic and durable tidal energy systems.\n\nA potential solution to these challenges is floating systems supporting multiple closely spaced turbines. Such systems will provide rapidly deployable, retrievable and maintainable multi-turbine systems that deliver high performance.\n\nThis project will conduct a preliminary assessment and feasibility study of floating closely spaced tidal turbine arrays. Specifically the project will seek to optimize the hydrodynamic performance of multiple closely spaced turbines supported from a single platform and determine their load and response when subjected to combined wave and tidal flows. The project will also seek to determine the suitability and stability of mooring systems under such loads and the platform's static and dynamic response leading to definition of permissible operating regimes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M020452/1","grantId":"EP/M020452/1","fundValue":"97426","fundStart":"2014-10-06","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Henry Willden","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
