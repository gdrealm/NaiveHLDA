However, so far, this literature has failed to give satisfactory answers to two fundamental questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do repeated elections under authoritarian rule facilitate democratisation or do elections help dictators cling to power?</li>\n\n <li>Under what circumstances do mechanisms of democracy promotion affect the consequences of authoritarian elections?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This Research Seminar series aims to contribute to the answering of these questions by providing, for the first time, a platform to discuss the role and impact of elections under authoritarianism from four different perspectives: regional studies, democratisation studies, authoritarianism studies, and the point of view of organisations working in the area of democracy promotion.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00061X/1","grantId":"ES/L00061X/1","fundValue":"30340","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Olli  Hellmann","coPersons":["Christian  Goebel","Marcus  Mietzner"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
