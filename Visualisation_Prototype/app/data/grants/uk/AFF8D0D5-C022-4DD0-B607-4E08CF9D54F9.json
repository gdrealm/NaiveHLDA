The 'exclusive role' of the parent on the developmental outcome of their young infants is now being shifted towards a sensitively co-regulated dyad. Parents and professionals learn that the newborn infant sensitively monitors and adaptively utilizes parental caretaking according to her needs. Maternal mental health is being put into a new light as we learn the aspects of maternal behaviours and sensitivity that the newborn infant is seeking out. \n\nThese studies, using the still face paradigm and its modifications, demonstrated that human neonates sensitively perceive and adjust their behaviour according to the social responsiveness of their interaction partner. When the interaction partner became unresponsive, newborns also changed their behaviour, decreased eye contact, and displayed signs of distress. Even after the interaction partner resumed responsiveness, the effects of the communication disturbance persisted, in the form of prolonged behavioural stress and crying, and also on psychophysiological level, indexed by elevated heart rate. \nThe results showed that all types of communication disturbance caused such prolonged distress and the results were not due to situational factors or chance. \nWhether this social responsivity in the newborn infant is affected by their previous interpersonal experience was explored in Study 2. The results showed that babies found the interpersonal violation stressful each time it was administered, thus they did not 'learn' to ignore it. What they 'learnt' with experience was to speed up their recovery, to notice the available caregiver sooner, and 'let them help' in the restoration. \nPsychotherapists and psychoanalysts found the results of the ability of the neonate particularly important after the PI gave an invited talk. The outputs have been cited in the textbook of Video Interactive Guidance (Kennedy, Landor, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Todd, 2011). \nThe PI has been involved in disseminating the results to user groups. She has been invited to talk to a large group of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists at the Joint Meeting of the Brazilian and French Psychoanalytic Societies; she gave a key-note talk at the International Video Interaction Guidance Conference that brought together researchers and practitioners across a wide range of fields. \nAlso, she talked about the research and the results to nurses, midwifes, obstetricians and neonatologists at the site of research, as well as to over 330 parents of newborn infants while working on the research project. \nAdditionally, colleagues with a focus on disseminating research on early years have been talking about the PI's results from the project. Such mutual dissemination of research data by colleagues in the field is common and serves the benefit of all parties involved. For example, Dr. Suzanne Zeedyk talked about the PI's research to approximately 3000 people across the UK and Europe. She talked to groups of parents, childminders, teachers, mental health professionals, midwives, and addressed policy makers at the Scottish Parliament on the importance of early years, and cited empirical data from the research project. \nThe following user groups benefit from the research and related expertise: medical professionals, paediatricians, obstetricians, neonatologists, general practitioners, psychiatrists; mental health and infant mental health professionals; psychotherapists working in early prevention and intervention; early-years educators; midwives, social workers and professionals working with perinatal mothers and babies, and most importantly parents and families of newborns. \nThe notion of the social newborn and the ability of neonates to engage in social interactions with their parents will need to be communicated to all user groups, and will lead to short- and long-term changes in attitudes and services. Hopefully, the importance of the neonatal period in life will soon be acknowledged by mental health and social service programmes, and prevention efforts will start as early as the birth of a child.\n\nGiven the scarce knowledge on the behaviour of the newborn infant, the expected outcome for Study 2 has intentionally been left open-ended in the original proposal. While either habituation or the stability of the responses to the procedure were possible outcomes, the emerging pattern was much richer than expected. The data not only showed that babies experienced the still face manipulation very stressful even after the second administration, and with a comparable spill-over effect of distress and crying well beyond the still face phase was over and the experimenter resumed communication, but an important evidence for the impact of their earlier social experience was revealed. Babies, by the second administration, recovered their eye-contact earlier, and despite being distressed and crying, they looked at the experimenter as soon as she stopped posing the still face. It is plausible to assume that such a change in their behaviour reflects an efficient self-other regulatory process that could be described as increasing resilience with experience, while utilizing the bests of the caretaking environment. This result is expected to make the most significant impact on a wide range of fields as described above. \nThe results are expected to have broader, long-term societal impacts in the area of infant and maternal mental health. \nFinally, an important part of the impact is expected to be intergenerational. It is known from both human and animal studies that attachment patterns in the infants are likely to be 'repeated' over the next generations, via behavioural and epigenetic factors. Transforming only one generation with informed, sensitive parenting from the neonatal age is expected to have long-term benefit not only in the development and the mental health of the infant, child, adolescent, and adult, but the effects to extend well beyond into the next generation(s). \nThe research is a basic research and basic research takes a longer time than applied research to be translated to measurable societal and economic impact. Part of the impact is expected to be longitudinal, long-term, and intergenerational. Informed, sensitive parenting of the neonate is expected to have a long-term benefit not only in the development and the mental health of the future child, adolescent, and adult, but the effects to extend well beyond into the next generations.

The results led to a new field in psychology, both methodologically and conceptually. The research project enabled the PI to facilitate the emergence of ‘neonatal psychology’ with a sound empirical foundation. New models supported by the wealth of these data will transform our understanding of the neonate and the neonatal stage of development. Such a transformed view of the newborn will lead to a change in the way perinatal period is treated. \nThe results highlight an unexpected and efficient adaptive response that enables newborn babies to notice and utilize the availability of a responsive caretaker and to facilitate their own psychophysiological recovery. Psychotherapists found these results particularly important that would challenge and overturn the widely held traditional view of a ‘helpless’, dependent infant who is the outcome of the caretaking process and the mother. Instead, the results call for a view of the socially competent and resilient newborn within a dynamic interactive process, where the neonate, based on her previous experiences, actively initiates increasingly efficient self-other regulatory processes. \n\nIn detail: \nSeven studies, involving 322 newborn infants measured their reactions to communication disturbances. Given that the field is under-researched and the continuing debate over neonatal intentionality, the collected data are unique, and represent probably the largest neonatal behavioural database to date. \nThe results showed that all types of communication disturbance caused prolonged distress to the newborn infants and the outcome results cannot be attributable to situational, chance factors. \nWhether human neonates’ social responsivity can be affected by their previous interpersonal experience was also examined. The results showed that what babies ‘learnt’ with experience was not to ignore the communication violations but to regulate their own recovery by involving the available interaction partner into the repair process. \nThe importance of the period following the disturbance was confirmed by physiological data. Babies subjected to the communication violation, but not controls, increased their heart rate after the still face phase, concurrently with the behavioural spill-over effects. a) Further empirical work on the importance of neonatal period and to describe the psychology of the neonate\nb) New research projects in applied areas: such as the use of the still face situation as a paradigm in psychotherapies and applied areas. \nc) Psychotherapies – the results transform the role and responsibilities of the parent, both healthy and with mental health problems; \nd) The views of mental health professionals, physicians, midwives, nurses and early years educators on the earliest stage of development and the newborn period\ne) Intervention methods \nf) Transform our views on parenting. \ng) Colleagues with a focus on disseminating research on early years have been talking about the PI’s results from the project.
