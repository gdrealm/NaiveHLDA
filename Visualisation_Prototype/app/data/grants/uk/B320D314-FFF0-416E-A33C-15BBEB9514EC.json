But the large scale of this output comes at an environmental cost. The efficient design and lifetime extension of structures is therefore a social, environmental and economic priority. \nThe focus of this proposal is reinforced concrete where a major complication in delivering efficient, sustainable, low-maintenance solutions is that the performance of these structures reflects numerous factors including the initial design, the in-service conditions, the load history and any interventions during the service life. In service, one of the challenges is that there is an interaction between the concrete and the internal reinforcement and this behaviour is not currently well understood. This problem is exacerbated when considering how shear forces are transferred since questions still remain about how even a basic reinforced concrete structure carries these forces under static load conditions. Indeed, the 2006 collapse of the de la Concorde Overpass in Quebec is a tragic reminder of the impact of the initial design, in-service repairs and bridge management all contributed to the eventual collapse. It is therefore clear, considering the potential environmental and public safety issues, that a fundamental investigation to ascertain the types of structures and loadings which may be susceptible to time dependant changes in load sharing mechanisms that could be detrimental to the structural performance is overdue. \nThe situation becomes even more complex when interventions to increase or re-establish the strength of an existing structure are required. For example, the application of additional external fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement has been found to be an effective means to achieve the capacity increases required to keep existing structures in service. FRPs have a high strength to weight ratio and are lighter and more durable than equivalent steel strengthening systems. However, this additional reinforcement changes the load-sharing behaviour of the structure. Furthermore, in many cases, the provision of the additional reinforcement addresses an immediate strengthening need where speed and ease of installation are primary considerations. However while the initial motivation may be for a short-term intervention, it is likely that, due to the disruption and costs associated with demolition and reconstruction, many of these FRP strengthening systems will be in service for a considerable period of time. To date, the longer term in-service performance of strengthened RC structures has not been adequately addressed. Cost-effective approaches for extending the life of existing infrastructure are becoming increasingly important in the current era of financial constraints.\nThis project seeks to address these identified gaps through the establishment of a high-level, enduring, international collaboration between the University of Toronto (U of T), Canada, Queen's University, Canada and the University of Cambridge, UK. The particular strength of this collaboration is that it brings together the necessary expertise to re-evaluate the time- and load-dependent baseline conditions in an existing reinforced concrete structure and to then assess and predict the long-term performance of both unstrengthened and FRP-strengthened structures. This enhanced understanding will inform asset owners and managers and lead to improved design and maintenance strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J002887/1","grantId":"EP/J002887/1","fundValue":"45840","fundStart":"2012-04-28","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The Overseas Travel Award was successful in acting as a springboard for collaborative research activity from which exciting research findings are now emerging.

This EPSRC Overseas Travel Award (EP/J002887/1) was successful in establishing a high-level, enduring, inter-disciplinary collaboration between the University of Toronto, Canada, (Professors Collins and Bentz), Queen's University, Canada (Professor Hoult), and the University of Cambridge (Dr Lees) to understand the impact of initial design choices, and subsequent interventions, on the long-term performance of vital reinforced concrete infrastructure. Advances in these areas have extensive societal repercussions in the context of environmental impact mitigation, public safety, the avoidance of disruption, and economic prosperity by allowing for the more accurate assessment and efficient management of structures.\nDr Lees' research visits to North America have acted as a catalyst for engagement in a wide range of collaborative international research activity. A successful EPSRC research proposal - Reinforced concrete half-joint structures: Structural integrity implications of reinforcement detailing and deterioration (EP/K016148/1) - is a direct example of the benefit of this interaction. Professors Collins, Hoult and Bentz are international collaborators on the project and Professor Mitchell from McGill University, Canada has further expanded and strengthened the collaborative academic team. The opportunity to compare and reflect upon different design practices and experience in Canada and the UK has been incredibly valuable in the formulation of the project scope and direction. In addition, Professor Hoult successfully applied for funding for a student to work with Professor Hoult and Dr Lees to conduct experiments to validate theory developed at Cambridge as part of an ongoing research investigation. Dr Lees sat on the International Steering Committee for a NSERC Canada Strategic Grant - Protecting Canada's Concrete Bridges - led by Professor Hoult with colleagues from Queen's University in collaboration with the University of Toronto and University of Ottawa.\nKnowledge transfer has been at the heart of the collaboration and our multi-institution collaboration has developed into an enduring two-way exchange of ideas and personnel. In 2014, Professor Hoult has visited Cambridge on two occasions and Professor Bentz spent three months here during a period of sabbatical leave. These visits, coupled with Dr Lees' stays in Canada, have enabled wider knowledge transfer amongst members of academic staff, research associates and graduate and undergraduate researchers at our respective Universities leading to an enhanced research capability.\nResearch projects relating to the time-dependent behaviour of reinforced concrete, the shear strength assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures, the measurement and analysis of crack propagation in concrete and the CFRP strengthening of reinforced concrete structures are underway at the University of Cambridge. These projects are taking advantage of the latest modelling developments emerging from the University of Toronto and also monitoring and measurement advances from Queen's University. The emerging research outcomes have the potential to make a real impact to the assessment and management of reinforced concrete infrastructure.\nThe remit of the Overseas Travel Grant Scheme is 'to visit recognised non-UK centres to study new techniques and to travel from the UK to start or develop international collaborations'. The securing of additional research funding for collaborative research projects, the undertaking of reciprocal exchange visits and the delivery of research to provide technical solutions for infrastructure challenges are evidence of the success of the scheme in meeting its aims. 1. Emerging publications and new research findings are leading to world-wide academic advancement\n2. Benefits to the training of highly skilled researchers have already been realised and will continue through our enduring collaborative activity\n3. Research leading to the lifetime extension of existing reinforced concrete infrastructure will result in more environmentally sustainable outcomes\n4. Knowledge dissemination and interactions between the academic researchers and Industry and Governmental partners in the UK and Canada is enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of the wider Construction sector.
