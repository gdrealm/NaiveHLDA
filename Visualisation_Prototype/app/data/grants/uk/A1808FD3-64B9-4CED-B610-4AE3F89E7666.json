{"id":"A1808FD3-64B9-4CED-B610-4AE3F89E7666","title":"Technologies for SiC electronics and sensors in extreme environments","abstractText":"Silicon Carbide (SiC) electronics and sensor technologies will play an important role in the energy and transport technologies of the 21st Century. Environmental pressures to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions coupled with diminishing fossil fuel resources will drive a continuing increase in the use of electricity as the preferred point-of-use energy delivery mechanism. The efficient and flexible conversion of electrical energy is increasingly accomplished through the use of power electronics, a technology and business area that is set to expand rapidly over the next decades. SiC, in common with other wide band-gap semiconductors, offers the potential for dramatic improvements in the efficiency and range of applications for power electronics. It is thus seen as an enabler for many innovative energy and transport developments, such as power-dense electronics for the more electric aircraft, hybrid/all-electric road vehicles and rail traction or for application to the electricity generation and distribution network, where high-speed high-voltage switches are needed.The principal aim of this Platform Grant is to facilitate long-term, innovative, generic research into technologies that will deliver SiC electronics and sensor technology to extreme environment applications. This aim will be achieved through three specific objectives. First and foremost the Platform Grant will facilitate the retention of a core of expert research staff and provide for their career development within a secure and stable employment environment. Secondly, it will complement current and planned research activities by allowing the Team to address speculative but strategically important issues associated with SiC electronics and sensors. Thirdly, it will address the wider development needs of the Team by providing funds for a range of international exchanges. We foresee an increasing international effort towards realising the benefits of SiC devices in real-life applications and systems and much of the proposed research is orientated in that direction. We plan major new investigations into applying advanced SiC devices coupled with new material fabrication methods to significant systems applications / in particular energy conversion (of crucial importance in all forms of renewable power) and new types of sensors for emerging areas such as real-time pollution monitoring in automobiles. Such developments will provide real benefit to society whilst opening up significant new commercial markets to those companies that can adopt these genuinely disruptive technologies. Alongside this system level perspective will be crucial developments in materials technologies (such as the application of new types of dielectric technology) and novel devices (SiC transistors fabricated using such dielectrics) that will underpin the dramatic improvements in system level performance that will arise from the application of such technologies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D068827/1","grantId":"EP/D068827/1","fundValue":"510385","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas George Wright","coPersons":["Alton Barrett Horsfall","Anthony  O'Neill"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":" The Program grant encompassed a wide range of work into the use of a novel semiconductors, silicon carbide, that has excellent potential for use in aerospace, energy and other applications.\n\n\n\nSilicon Carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum, has been around for more than 150 years and has found use in many forms from abrasives to bullet proof vests depending on treatment of the particles. Although SiC was used in electronics as early as 1900 (in detectors for the first radios), its application to high-temperature/high-voltage semiconductor electronics has only recently been realised. \n\n\n\nSiC, in common with other wide band-gap semiconductors, offers the potential for dramatic improvements in the efficiency and range of applications for power electronics. It is thus seen as an enabler for many innovative energy and transport developments, such as power-dense electronics for aircraft, hybrid/all-electric road vehicles and rail traction, or for application to the electricity generation and distribution network, where high-speed high-voltage switches are needed. \n\n\n\nResearch in this grant concentrated on new investigations into applying advanced SiC devices coupled with new material fabrication methods to significant systems applications, in particular energy conversion (of crucial importance in all forms of renewable power) and new types of sensors for emerging areas such as real-time pollution monitoring in automobiles. This is in addition to developments in materials technologies (such as the application of new types of dielectric technology) and novel devices (SiC transistors fabricated using such dielectrics).\n\n\n\nThe research has also been extended into using silicon carbide as the basis for growing graphene - a newly realized material that has exceptional properties. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms in which electrons flow very easily - opening up the opportunity of making very high speed electronics. Our research has concentrated on seeking a method of growing graphene that is compatible with large scale manufacture.\n\n\n\nA constant theme throughout the project has been working closely with industry to help them adopt and develop new technologies. In this project, we have collaborated with Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and Denso in particular to develop technologies for aerospace, defence and automotive industries. The primary route for exploitation is through our industrial partners - the project has been collaborating with major UK companies such as Rolls Royce and BAE Systems for many years. We have also held open days for SMEs so that they can also understand and benefit from the research results in the project. Aerospace/ Defence and Marine,Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
