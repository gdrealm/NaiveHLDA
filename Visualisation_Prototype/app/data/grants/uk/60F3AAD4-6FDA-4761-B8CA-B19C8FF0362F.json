{"id":"60F3AAD4-6FDA-4761-B8CA-B19C8FF0362F","title":"The Discourse of Organic Food Promotion: language, intentions, and effects","abstractText":"<p>The project investigates discourse promoting organic food and agriculture in the UK. It seeks insight into a) the language of contemporary promotional discourse and its effects; b) matters of public concern implicated in organic production, eg health, nutrition, quality of life, the environmental impact of agriculture, relation of humans to other species, and continuity of tradition. </p>\n\n<p>Data will be: i) a corpus of promotional and campaigning texts; ii) transcriptions of interviews with promotional-text writers and other relevant experts; iii) transcriptions of focus groups reacting to selected texts. Analysis will combine linguistic and sociological techniques.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>The aim is to uncover: recurrent wordings, images, and themes; text writersâ€™ communication strategies; public perceptions of promotional language about organic food and agriculture. Findings will be of interest to discourse analysts, sociologists, policy makers, NGOs, and retailers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1626","grantId":"RES-000-22-1626","fundValue":"46222","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Guy  Cook","coPersons":["Peter Thayer Robbins"],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
