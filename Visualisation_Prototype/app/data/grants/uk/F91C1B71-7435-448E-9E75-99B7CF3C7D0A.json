In particular, we will address the role of a specific protein, cyclin B1, that has been implicated as the most important regulator in cell division from work in other systems such as yeast. Thus far we know that mammals cannot develop without cyclin B1, but we don t know why the embryos fail.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701184","grantId":"G0701184","fundValue":"345537","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathon  Pines","coPersons":["Magdalena  Zernicka-Goetz"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
