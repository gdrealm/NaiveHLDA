{"id":"A492627C-724F-4671-8EE9-FE166B503A26","title":"Evidence Symposia - exploring the evidence base on key policy themes","abstractText":"<p>This award supports the organisation of four evidence symposia by the Wales Institute for Social and Economic Research, Data&nbsp; and Methods (WISERD), in partnership with the Welsh Government. The symposia will bring together leading experts and senior policy makers/practitioners to review and challenge the evidence on important cross cutting policy questions and to discuss policy implications.</p>\n\n<p>Provisional themes for the 12 month symposia programme are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Understanding civic participation: citizen centred participation or competition for scarce resources?</li>\n\n <li>The best start in life: what do we know about the impact of early interventions on children's life chances?</li>\n\n <li>Planning to meet the needs of frail, elderly people in Wales.</li>\n\n <li>Well-being in Wales.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The number of attendees at each symposium will be kept relatively small to encourage open, interactive discussion. An evidence briefing paper will be commissioned and circulated prior to each symposium as an evidence building block for the expert presentations and discussion. A brief report will be produced following each symposium, summarising the discussion and highlighting any evidence gaps identified and recommendations for follow-up action. Outputs will be disseminated widely amongst academic, public and third sector audiences.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020648/1","grantId":"ES/J020648/1","fundValue":"15361","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Rees","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
