Owing to the dearth of individuals who can take advantage of large biological data sets, we have decided to focus the UK's ELIXIR node on training.\n\nThis is the century of biology, and genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics ('omics and bioinformatics) lie at its heart. The computer is an essential tool and now drives many critical aspects of the scientific process hence scientists need to know how to gain most advantage from it. Despite the central role of computing in science today:\n\n- Most research scientists are ill-equipped to take advantage of the data 'bonanza' that is emanating from new technologies. Critical training needs across the community are, broadly, in the analysis and the interpretation of genome-scale data of many types, including next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Genomics is the area of greatest training need as it lies at the intersection of many fast-moving research disciplines.\n\n- Many infrastructure technologists (career bioinformaticians) are ill-equipped to offer scalable, sustainable solutions for managing and interpreting data arising from this flood of technological advances. Critical training needs are in techniques and practices for data management, integration, compute and software, tools, services and standards.\n\nThe ELIXIR-UK Core Organisations are: the Universities of Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Edinburgh; the NERC Environmental Omics Synthesis Centre; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; the Genome Analysis Centre; and, University College London. Additional participating organisations are: the Software Sustainability Institute UK; the Hartree Centre; and the University of Dundee. Other organisations (UK and ELIXIR-wide) will be incorporated to provision training.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L005069/1","grantId":"BB/L005069/1","fundValue":"1031380","fundStart":"2014-06-02","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  When the aims of ELIXIR UK are realised - in terms of developing a comprehensive training provision and infrastructure in the UK, linked to the wider community in Europe - significant benefits be seen through the facilitation of better data access, use and research impact in the life science field.\n\nAlthough we are a not at a point in the project to see this yet - we are already beginning to see benefits arising from our collaborative and community-focussed approach. Many different institutes, funding bodies, professional societies, companies and industry bodies are reviewing training and skills gaps. As we work with those different groups we are finding areas of mutual interest/benefit, opportunities for collaboration - and also opportunities to reduce duplication of effort - and this sharing approach is leveraging greater value from the different investments (both financial and time) each of these groups represents.\n\nOpenness and sharing of training and skills-related data, knowledge and expertise is beginning to change the post-doctoral training landscape, particularly with the industry we engage with starting to view training as part of the pre-competitive workspace. As we foster community and bring these traditionally separate groups together in thinking and planning for future development in training provision, we begin to have the opportunity to impact on earlier skills development, influencing higher education curricula at pre and post-graduate - to doctoral level. This will have much further reach and impact on training gaps in the future and bring sustainability to the efforts of producing a more skilled life science base in modern (and future) data-driven biology.

To do this, we have set up working parties to look at several different fields of life science research - with the purpose of surveying current training availability, gaps and training needs; and to develop a strategy to address the training needs of life scientists across academia and industry - both in the UK and wider into Europe.\n\nTo date, our sector-specific working groups have undertaken surveys and consultations - delivering comment, review and opinion on training provision and need. We have seen that there are training requirements due to emerging technical or funding priority areas, some arising due to novel opportunities across the boundaries of traditional scientific disciplines, or where there is a systematic gap in basic education/training which is becoming acute due to modern data-analysis requirements (specifically training in statistics).\n\nELIXIR UK is making results of this process available to the wider community, whilst developing a training development strategy focussed on 5 strategically important, priority training areas, in: Structural Bioinformatics, Clinical Genomics, Advanced Scientific Skills, Metabolomics, and Applied Genomics. \n\nThe next stages of the project will build on this ground work - supporting activities of our sector working groups and building capability and training specifically in our strategic priority areas. Continual liaison with Industry is key as well as with other stakeholders, both at national level and across the wider pan-European ELIXIR community. By making our survey and consultation results publically-available, and in making our processes, aims, objectives and working practices transparent; the wider community - both within the UK and across the pan-European ELIXIR partners - will be able to reflect on their own training needs and provision. \n\nELIXIR UK will be focussed on transitioning from identified gaps in training towards a comprehensive and current training portfolio available to the UK life science community, by using our network of subject experts to plug training gaps.\n\nAs we engage with local academic and industry partners, national stakeholders and European collaborators, we will be developing not only training materials to address the needs/gaps we have highlighted - but also metrics and guidelines, examples of best practice, and providing frameworks for working together that will enable widespread development and adoption of related training and approaches wherever needed. \n\nBy providing technical platforms and infrastructure to support the training effort, along with advice, expertise and resources to develop and support trainers we will build a wider community participating in training for the future - based on the principles and ethos of that developed by ELIXIR and ELIXIR UK.
