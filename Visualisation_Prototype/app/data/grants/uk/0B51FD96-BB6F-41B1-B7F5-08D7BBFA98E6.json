{"id":"0B51FD96-BB6F-41B1-B7F5-08D7BBFA98E6","title":"Wilde and the Woman's World: Oxford English Texts Edition of the Complete Wilde","abstractText":"In the 1880s Wilde was a prolific Journalist, writing about and reviewing divers' topics in the popular press. The material, which has never been collected in its entirety and fully annotated, will occupy two volumes in the new Oxford English Text Edition of the complete works. The writings published will be based on the original periodical text along with substantial introductory/critical material outlining Wilde's journalistic career in relation to contemporary print culture and to his own development. I am editing the volume containing Wilde's extensive reviews for The Woman's World, an under-studied title edited by Wilde from 1887-89.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112960/1","grantId":"112960/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research from this project has found outlet in public talks and fora, enhancing the general public's knowledge, enjoyment, experience of Oscar Wilde, in particular. The publication of Wilde's journalism in two volumes (OUP, 2013) was the primary output, and it has been well received critically not only in strictly academic journals but in more general-reader journals such as the TLS. The key impact will be in terms of expanding cultural knowledge/history (of Wilde, of the late 19th century, of the history of journalism) widely.

The research -- which significantly informed the lengthy Introduction and the extensive Commentary to the scholarly edition of Wilde's journalism which I co-edited also provides significant new information and understandings of the field of late 19th century journalism, literary markets, etc. The research will likely be taken forward by those interested in Wilde's career as a writer, in the broad field of 19th century journalism, and in literary journalism more generally. Those interested in how to 'edit' journalism will also find much to take in new directions. Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
