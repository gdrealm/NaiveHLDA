{"id":"844575DE-57FE-47B8-9DA7-399145C1B050","title":"A Theory of Religion: Linking Individual Beliefs, Rituals, and Group Cohesion","abstractText":"<p>In this research program we offer a theory of religion, linking its individual and social aspects. According to our theory, an organised religion is a group of individuals who share similar beliefs about punishments inflicted by the supernatural when they behave selfishly, and who, by participating in certain costly and observable actions (such as joint rituals) can identify one another. This allows them to both behave more cooperatively towards group members while guarding themselves from non-members who may wish to exploit them. Thus, religion provides a link between individual beliefs, social rituals and group cohesion.</p> \n<p>Our aim is to examine the properties of such religious organisations, using a theoretical model. Since a market for religion is created, as individuals need to identify one another, we can determine the characteristics of the different religious groups which coexist in equilibrium. For example, to guarantee membership in the group, some groups may demand a higher level of participation in rituals then others and thus may include fewer members. We can also determine how different religious groups or sects behave towards one another, that is, whether members of one group who cooperate with one another also cooperate with members of other organised groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E003486/1","grantId":"ES/E003486/1","fundValue":"79334","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gilat  Levy","coPersons":["Ronny  Razin"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
