On the other hand, very little is known about what happens when these three elements come together. Specifically, the research is concerned to identify how knowledge is constructed, generated, critiqued and exchanged through the use of ICTs in social movements, and to clarify how this sustains and develops the identities of ICT users as movement-activists and influences their actions. There is also an interest in the role of ICTs in attracting participation in movement activity, and in assessing its influence on the degree and quality of people’s engagement. </p> \n<p>The study focuses on the development of an environmental justice movement in Scotland which provides an opportunity to examine the process of learning in, from and for social action. The research involves two local case studies, urban and rural, and one national case study of Friends of the Earth Scotland. Qualitative research methods are used with a sample of active participants in the case studies. Additional data is generated through an online survey using Friends of the Earth Scotland’s website.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E025099/1","grantId":"ES/E025099/1","fundValue":"77704","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Crowther","coPersons":["Ian  Martin","Eurig  Scandrett"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
