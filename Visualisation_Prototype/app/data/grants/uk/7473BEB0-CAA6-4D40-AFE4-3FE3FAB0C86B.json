Open I-sections are the most common and efficient horizontal members to support the flooring system. The vertical members can either be open H-sections or tubular (structural hollow) sections. The latter has shown an increasing popularity due to its structural efficiency including high strength to weight ratio, high torisonal stiffness and pleasant appearance. In particular, circular and elliptical hollow sections possess inherent curvatures which allow architects to express the steel-framed buildings in a creative and exciting architecture in the built-environment. However, these advantages are often under-exploited due to the perceived difficulties on cost effective connections between I-beams and tubular columns. There is also a relative lack of design guidance in particular the reliability of semi-rigid connections under cyclic loading which will provide essential scientific information including energy dissipative behaviour for seismic design. New test and numerical results from this research for both monotonic and cyclic loadings will be used to prepare design rules for steel structures with sustainable credentials to be executed anywhere in the world. It will also help the UK to meet its strategy for sustainable construction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I020489/1","grantId":"EP/I020489/1","fundValue":"102798","fundStart":"2011-07-27","fundEnd":"2013-07-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tak Ming  Chan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
