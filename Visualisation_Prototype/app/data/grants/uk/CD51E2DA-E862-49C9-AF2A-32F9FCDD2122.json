{"id":"CD51E2DA-E862-49C9-AF2A-32F9FCDD2122","title":"Microstructural characterisation of complex materials using advanced Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) techniques","abstractText":"The aim of this project is the characterisation of micro-structurally complex materials such as soft solids/liquids, biological materials, composite materials and polymeric and metallic materials. This characterisation is essential in many diverse areas of engineering research. Some of our current projects which need this capability include:1) Derivation of predictive models for deformation and fracture of adhesives, composites, metals, foods, etc. 2) Development of porous load-bearing constructs to replace lost bone segments following trauma,3) Studies of crack formation in hard deposits in order to identify the pressure and shear that cleaning liquids in Cleaning-In-Place methods must generate, and4) Determining which is the optimal consolidation material for integrity of lacquers in various objects of art.The micro-structural characterisation mentioned above will be performed using advanced Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) modules. The SEM has become an indispensable tool in virtually all fields of research. In an SEM, a beam of electrons is focussed and scanned across the specimen under investigation. The signal from the detected scattered and emitted electrons is used to form a magnified image with dramatically better resolution and depth of view than an optical microscope. In order to study soft solids and liquids under the SEM, it is necessary to use the cryo-SEM technique where the sample is rapidly cooled and transferred to the cold stage of a preparation chamber which is mounted onto the SEM. This procedure is necessary with all soft and other hydrated materials which are sensitive to the vacuum condition and/or the high electron beam energy of an SEM. Another technique that will be used to investigate the micromechanisms during deformation and fracture in complex materials involves the use of a Microtest SEM module. This module essentially allows a mechanical test to be performed within the chamber of an SEM and therefore enables investigation of micro-structural changes as a function of the externally applied load. Lastly, a Heating stage SEM module will also be used in our studies to raise the temperature while the sample is inside the chamber of the SEM and hence observe changes in microstructure as a function of temperature.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E064841/1","grantId":"EP/E064841/1","fundValue":"83940","fundStart":"2007-06-19","fundEnd":"2010-12-18","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings highlighted routes for better design of materials in various industries such as the Food Manufacturing, Chemicals and Defence industries.

This investigation was made possible through the use of advanced Scanning Electron Microscope Microscope ( SEM) equipment modules, namely i) the Cryotranfer system, ii) the Microtest stage module (with the Digital Image Correlation software) and iii) the heating stage module. The first of these modules enabled examination of biological and other hydrated materials and substances which were sensitive to the vacuum conditions and/or the high electron beam energy in the SEM. The second module enabled mechanical tests to be performed within the microscope and the third module enabled dynamic observations of micro-structural changes with respect to temperature. The findings highlight how microstructure affects the global mechanical response of materials. Many materials (including consumer products, structural components etc) have an inherent microstructure. Understanding how this affects the end product's behaviour, can lead to designing and optimising such microstructures to yield a stronger and better component.
