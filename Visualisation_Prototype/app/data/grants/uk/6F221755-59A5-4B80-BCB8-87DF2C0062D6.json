The research involves two overlapping parts: stage one will draw on existing large-scale survey data to develop a macro-level account of (non-) participation in the general population and a critique of the extant literature on educational decision-making. </p> \n<p>The implications of the emerging issues will be explored in the qualitative study (stage two).This will involve case studies of sixteen networks of intimacy. We will identify non-participating adults at different stages in the life-course and who may, or may not be economically active, to provide 'entry points' to each network. Each case study will involve an initial structured interview with each 'entry point' individual to determine educational and employment histories, household and family composition, and details of their self-defined network of intimacy, followed by semi-structured interviews with each of these individuals plus five ‘network members’ who are identified as sources of influence in the decision-making process. </p> \n<p>Focusing on non-participants, at various stages in the life-course, make this research distinctive.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0232","grantId":"RES-139-25-0232","fundValue":"312470","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Fuller","coPersons":["Nick  Foskett","Martin  Dyke","Rosalind  Foskett"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
