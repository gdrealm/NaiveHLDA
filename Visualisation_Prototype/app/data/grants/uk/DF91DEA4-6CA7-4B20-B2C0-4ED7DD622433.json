{"id":"DF91DEA4-6CA7-4B20-B2C0-4ED7DD622433","title":"Single-Molecule Vibrational Spectroscopy on Metal Oxides","abstractText":"The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) now has the power not just to image single molecules, but to study the vibrations of their chemical bonds on surfaces of a wide variety of materials. This proposal will extend this technique into new areas, by studying the vibrations of individual molecules on metal oxide films, hence opening up a quite new and challenging field for the technique and enabling it to be applied to many surface reactions of catalytic and environmental importance. At the same time the project will put the technique onto a secure theoretical footing, by developing a theoretical treatment of the inelastic electron tunnelling process that properly includes both sides of the tunnel junction. The associated code will be made available to the community through CCP3.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C54188X/1","grantId":"EP/C54188X/1","fundValue":"405137","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Thornton","coPersons":["Andrew  Fisher"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" Direct evidence for polarons was observed using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. This means that the electrons associated with oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric distribution. These findings have led to more experiments investigating polarons including experiments that engineer them. Chemicals,Electronics,Energy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
