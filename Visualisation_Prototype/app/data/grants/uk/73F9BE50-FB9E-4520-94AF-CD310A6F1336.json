{"id":"73F9BE50-FB9E-4520-94AF-CD310A6F1336","title":"Internet Activism; Anti-war Movements in the Information Age","abstractText":"<p>This project aims to identify distinguishing features of anti-war movements in Britain while paying special attention to their use of information and communications technologies (ICTs). Not so much interested in particular techniques of protest such as ‘hacktivism’, this study asks how and with what consequence anti-war movements integrate ICTs in their operations.&nbsp; </p> \n<p><br />New forms of expression have emerged where people organise on bases that allow coalitions of different types of people without a need for agreement on a political programme, summarised by the slogan ‘one no, many yeses’. Quite different groups may coalesce. The anti-war movement is a prominent example.&nbsp; This project is interested in how different groups come together in campaigns around contentious issues. Using recent and broad coalitions mobilised against the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, four foci are explored: representation, organisation, mobilisation and coalition building. </p> \n<p><br />ICTs provide opportunities for more effective organisation and mobilisation of protest, while offering opportunities for more participative organisation. New technologies are also embraced because activists tend to be drawn from the young, from students, and from professional groups. The study will examine several case studies of groups involved in anti-War protest.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-228-25-0060","grantId":"RES-228-25-0060","fundValue":"125384","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Webster","coPersons":["Jenny  Pickerill"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
