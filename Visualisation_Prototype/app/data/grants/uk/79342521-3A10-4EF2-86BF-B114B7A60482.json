{"id":"79342521-3A10-4EF2-86BF-B114B7A60482","title":"GEM (Grown, Edible, Meaningful): Herbal Probes for Community-Driven Environmental Change","abstractText":"The proposal seeks to develop and assess a way to gather accounts from different faith communities about culture, environmental values and food traditions. The tool builds on the concept of cultural probes, which can be used to research people's lifestyle choices and values, and, innovatively, using them as a means to share learning between community members rather than purely feeding back to designer/researchers. The project uses communally grown food as the probe activity through which participants embed, articulate and share cultural values and sustainable life choices, drawing on the success of community growing projects to connect people with each other, with their environment and with issues of sustainable and healthy living.\n\nParticipants will be invited through community and faith groups to choose and grow edible plants as 'herbal probes' to inspire discussion about provenance, sharing, sustainability and culture in a group context. Residents in two distinct culturally-diverse urban areas of Leeds will start the growing season by preparing recycled containers at a launch workshop, then planting and nurturing a seed for an edible plant chosen to have symbolic meaning to them. By harvest time, they reunite to share the produce and stories of what the plants represent to them, thereby also giving insight into values and life choices. Excess herbs and vegetables can be swapped. The process will develop aspects of environmentally-friendly living in a way that integrates with ordinary life yet inspires reflection, while eliciting accounts that reveal different attitudes to environmental living across communities, cultures and faiths.\n\nAccounts will be analyzed to inform on two aspects of the project - what are the different traditions with food that relate to how people regard environmental messages? And how does the presence of a herbal probe in the life of a household impact on interest and engagement in environmentally sustainable practices?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K003976/1","grantId":"AH/K003976/1","fundValue":"31939","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Material from the project has been circulated back to the people of Leeds and social care and environmental practitioners but there are no specific impacts recorded yet.

Our team of researchers and community organisations wanted to know what different meanings growing food holds and to learn if this affects feelings towards the environment, ecological issues and other people. We worked across communities, leading workshops over the growing season of 2013, running a food growing festival and following up with interviews. We noted considerable diversity of participation in the festival, across age, gender, cultures and faiths.\n\n\nOur results indicate that growing food inspires responses from the practical to the deeply spiritual and that we have hit upon a rich means to enquire in this area.\n\nWe were able to demonstrate how diverse cultures can meet in community growing to embed, articulate and share cultural values and sustainable life choices. \n\nAn additional finding was the enthusiasm with which people talked about land and plants left behind in other countries, pointing to the value of reflection on growing food in areas with much immigration. There is considerable potential for fighting stereotypical representation of minorities here. At the other end, the research into the relationship between faith and environmental behaviour with food is only beginning and a short project such as this one points the way to individual faith studies and more exploration of the impact of diaspora.
