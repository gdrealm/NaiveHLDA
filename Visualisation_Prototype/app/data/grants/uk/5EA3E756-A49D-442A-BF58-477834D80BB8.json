In particular new methods that can produce molecules with dense functionality in just a few steps is a shared goal. We are proposing combining two well know reactions (the Claisen rearrangement and Sakurai allylation) to create a new domino reaction that can produce molecules with complex functionalilty embedded within it in a single transformation. These densly functionalised small molecules could be of use in both the total synthesis of natural products and in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products. With this grant a new way of making complex molecules rapidly will be developed. We hope to apply this to the rapid synthesis of compounds that exhibit potent biological properties, both natural and unnatural. We will embark on a synthesis of echinopinine A and B two complex natural products with novel architectures. Although their biological properties have not been fully elucidated they were isolated from plants known to exhibit many medicinal properties including anti-cancer activity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I006605/1","grantId":"EP/I006605/1","fundValue":"100847","fundStart":"2010-09-07","fundEnd":"2012-09-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew John Cook","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
