The Leydig cells of the testis produce androgens that determine the development of most male secondary characteristics and support sperm production in the adult. Little is known about the factors that regulate Leydig cell differentiation and function. The nuclear hormone receptor SF1 has been implicated in the development of reproductive tissues including the gonad in both mouse and man. Here we aim to study the role of SF1 in Leydig cell differentiation and hormone production in the embryo and adult mouse. As this factor has various roles in the different cell types of the testis, we have devised a strategy to inactivate SF1 specifically within Leydig cells and to identify its tissue specific partner in these cells. These studies will allow us to understand how the cell types of the gonad differentiate and form an organ and how hormone production is regulated in the embryo and adult. In addition, we will uncover molecular pathways that might be implicated in deficiencies of sexual development and reproductive function in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D005043/1","grantId":"BB/D005043/1","fundValue":"254540","fundStart":"2006-02-15","fundEnd":"2009-02-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this project will inform the analysis of clinical patients with Disorders of Sex Development syndrome.

We identified a novel role for the transcription co-factor CITED2 in the regulation of mammalian sex determination and in the development of the gonad. We found that CITED2 is required during embryogenesis to establish high enough levels of the nuclear hormone receptor SF1, the master regulator of gonad development, to ensure that testis development is initiated within the gonad. \n\n\n\n2. We generated transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in st The data can be used by clinicians when analysing disorders of sexual development patients.
