Excessive fibroblast (a cell type) growth and scar formation are the most important features of the disease and require new blood vessel formation to accommodate the nutritional need. In normal lung the new blood vessel formation is inhibited by an inhibitor protein called IP-10. However, in IPF lung, IP-10 production is reduced, leading to new blood vessel formation and unopposed fibroblast growth and scar formation. Why IP-10 expression is faulty in IPF lung is unclear and is an important area to study. We believe that key processes in IP-10 expression are defective in IPF. In the studies proposed here we will compare fibroblasts from IPF patients with normal cells to examine the molecular mechanisms regulating the IP-10 expression and identify the defective processes in IPF. This will help us to understand the disease better and may lead to the development of approaches to restore IP-10 expression as a new treatment for IPF.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600890","grantId":"G0600890","fundValue":"280948","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Linhua  Pang","coPersons":["Alan John  Knox","Gisli  Jenkins"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
