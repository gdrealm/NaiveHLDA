However, conventional MRI does not provide information on the pressure that the heart muscle must generate in order to pump blood through the body. This pressure is a fundamental parameter of cardiac function and can currently only be determined by inserting a catheter directly into the heart. Particularly in mice and rats, which are the predominant animal species used in cardiovascular research, this is an invasive and technically very challenging procedure that can be performed only once. We therefore propose to investigate whether or not a novel MR technique can overcome this limitation, and can be used to measure the pressure in the heart of mice and rats without inserting a catheter into the animal. If successful, this method will represent a valuable tool for scientists studying progression and treatment of heart disease, but most importantly it will reduce the numbers of animals required for this type of research by obviating the need to kill animals simply to obtain basic cardiac pressure measurements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/K000144/1","grantId":"NC/K000144/1","fundValue":"73961","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Jurgen E.
