{"id":"6263B4A1-D273-42FB-8245-6A682791557F","title":"PPGP Capital Equipment Call","abstractText":"This proposal aims to improve the capacity of the Birmingham particle physics group to produce new detector components as part of the upgrades to Large Hadron Collider and other experiments, enabling them to cope with future increased collision rates. Specifically, it enhances our capacity to build detectors made from semiconductor devices, fast timing devices and the electronics which are used to trigger the most interesting events. It also contains a request to increase our computer disk capacity to allow more efficient analysis of the expected large future data sets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003112/1","grantId":"ST/L003112/1","fundValue":"49414","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Newman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
