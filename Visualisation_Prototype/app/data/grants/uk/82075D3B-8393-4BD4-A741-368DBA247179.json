Despite much progress in mechanistic reaction models assisted by careful batch experimentation, the effect of reagent mixing and flow has never been considered and may have a major impact on reaction population outcomes. The advent of microfluidic reactors and novel homogenization strategies provides a unique opportunity to study such effects in details with unprecedented reproducibility and exquisite flow control. We therefore seek to investigate symmetry breaking in the autocatalytic Soai reaction in solvent-resistant microdevices assisted by detailed numerical modelling of spatiotemporal reaction evolution under flow. We expect our high-throughput microfluidic approach, combined with conventional batch experimentation and detailed modelling to help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the evolution of homochirality in the Soai reaction carried out without a chiral symmetry-breaking source.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E027393/1","grantId":"EP/E027393/1","fundValue":"381863","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Donna G Blackmond","coPersons":["Omar Kamal Matar","Joao  Cabral"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
