Scientists and engineers from thirty-eight countries have come together to build, operate and analyse the data from the ATLAS apparatus. In total the Collaboration numbers some 2900 scientific authors. The first collisions of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, were produced in late 2009, but these were just the start of a twenty-year long programme of measurements and - we anticipate - discoveries. Already the ATLAS experiment is probing physics on smaller scales than ever before, equivalent to probing back to the physics processes that happened a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang. It is entirely possible, with the collision data being collected now and in the next year or two, that new physical phenomena will be discovered, bringing revolutionary changes to our understanding of the physics of the most fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces between them. The ATLAS Collaboration is led by a spokesperson with two deputies: this funding is to support one of the two deputies, Prof David Charlton from the University of Birmingham, during 2011-2013.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I003525/1","grantId":"ST/I003525/1","fundValue":"295799","fundStart":"2011-07-21","fundEnd":"2013-07-20","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David  Charlton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Large number of physics papers from ATLAS during this period while I was Deputy Spokesperson of the Collaboration.

The physics yield from ATLAS, especially the Higgs boson discovery, has made a big impact both on popular appreciation of big science, and also on the scientific understanding of the nature of space-time.
