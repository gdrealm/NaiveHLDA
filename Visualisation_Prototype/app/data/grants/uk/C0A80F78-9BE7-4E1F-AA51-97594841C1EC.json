The term 'biorefinery' is routinely articulated in IB circles, but the concept has, as yet, never been fully realised. The objective of this project is to generate robust process economics for a fully-fledged biorefinery that will not just break even but, moreover, prove highly profitable. If successful, the project will generate &pound;24.5m investment from the Malaysian Govt. to realise the technology at scale. The project will involve functionalising microalgae to produce a range of products that can be separated using a low-cost, continuous flow, downstream processing system. It is innovative in that it will marry the best aspects of the conventional oil refinery (100% feedstock utilisation &amp; high throughputs) with the best aspects of IB (functional complexity and environmentally benign processing).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010396/1","grantId":"BB/N010396/1","fundValue":"270657","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael James Allen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Plymouth Marine Laboratory","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
