{"id":"F5682484-AB79-4E11-B3E1-A596137FE5AC","title":"Being in the Zone: the Importance of Culture to Peak Performance in Sport, Arts and Work","abstractText":"'Being-in-the-zone' (bitz) is an expression for moments when someone who normally and routinely undertakes a certain creative action experiences a sudden, and often unexpected, increase in their competence in performance, often experiencing themselves as performing not only at their best ever but in a way they better than they had thought possible. Bitz is experienced in work practices like software coding, musical practices like playing an instrument or in sporting events. Such moments are recounted by musicians, sportspeople and creative workers, when reflecting on their activity and often because these moments clearly engender a deep sense of commitment to their particular creative practice and a positive sense of their body and psyche for being able to 'get in the zone'. Being-in-the-zone is an experience that helps many to sustain and continue in their routine and repetitive practices and provides an experience that inarguably offers a positive sense of psyche and body.\n\nBeing-in-the-zone has largely been analysed as an internal psychic state, drawing primarily if not wholly on psychology. Even when being-in-the-zone occurrs as part of team events, such as in football, it has largely been interpreted as an event internal to the participants. One now widely known example of this is the well-known sports psychology practice of asking players to 'visualise' their best moments in sport. In such an understanding, peak or unusually good performance comes from within the individual and is therefore dealt with as a psychological phenomenon.\n\nYet being-in-the-zone is also a cultural phenomenon. For example, there are within the accounts of software coding given by computer programmers often stories of sudden intense bouts of coding, but whether such bouts were of high competence (and so were 'in the zone') is also usually judged by the complexity of the problem addressed and by the quality of software code produced. Both the complexity of a problem and the quality of code are cultural judgements, for example the latter often draws on the so-called Unix Philosophy that values simplicity of code. Similar examples in music and sport can be given, where a high level of competence does not just inhere in 'getting the notes in the right order' or in winning, but in how these are done. Such judgements are cultural ones that exist beyond the individuals who experience being-in-the-zone. Only with the integration of cultural insights about the nature of being-in-the-zone will there be the potential for fully understanding being-in-the-zone.\n\nThis project seeks to open up a new cultural approach to being-in-the-zone that will be able to contribute to well-being, by developing practices that promote being-in-the-zone, and develops important academic debates about the relation between psychology and society. \n\nSuch an understanding can have important impacts on participation in cultural activities and on positive appreciations of both psyche and body. Understanding being-in-the-zone offers ways of understanding compelling and strongly positive appreciations of participation in various creative activities. This understanding can be translated into advice and practices about how to create a positive appreciation of doing such activities, like music and sport, and how to structure advice and practices that produce positive attitudes to psyche and body. \n\nIt is these latter lessons that will form a key part of dissemination of this research in our proposal to enter the London Olympics 2012 Cultural Olympiad with early results from discussion. It also informs our desire to develop a large grant submission from this network which will provide detailed empirical work and action-research converting that empirical work into policy results in the form of practical advice about how to promote better appreciation of cultural and creative activities and their positive effects on bodies and psyches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J012920/1","grantId":"AH/J012920/1","fundValue":"26415","fundStart":"2012-09-10","fundEnd":"2014-03-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Primarily the impact of the research beyond academia is in enhancing personal experience although it also has significant policy implications for example within sport, the arts, in particular music and the use of the arts in communities and specifically within cultural work, such as media production, gaming and IT. Specifically, within the field of sport, Woodward's work links sport and the arts through temporality and psychosocial understandings of being in the 'real time' of the zone and has been used by the Olympic Museum to inform it's exhibition, Chasing Time. Our research into cultural work also has economic implications and applications in the development of apps and staff development within other market sectors.

For example, in cultural work the idea is invoked both to reflect peak experience for participants and the use of the zone as a means of enhancing productivity by employers. Being in the zone is both positive and negative, productive and constraining. Our work in this area has contributed to a deeper understanding of the experience and suggests new possibilities, for example in the development of apps aimed at producing peak experience. In music the experience of the zone is both collective and individual and our work suggests applications of the zone which extend beyond elite achievement, for example as adopted by organisations which work with vulnerable people including those with dementia, such as Lost Chord. The zone has a long history in sport, but our study of sport suggests new approaches to accessing the experience, for example through innovative methodologies. There has been considerable interest in Woodward's work on the temporal aspects of the zone in sport, for example by the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. The project offers new interdisciplinary approaches and ways of understanding the psychosocial aspects of being in the zone. The project has significant intellectual, methodological and practical, policy based implications and applications. In cultural work the project's outputs can be used for developing applications which provide new understandings of enhanced productivity and creativity. In music, improved understanding of being in the zone, can be applied to the experiences of those who, whilst not achieving elite levels of performance, can benefit enormously from the elquilibrium and harmony of zone experiences as listeners and spectators as well as being performers. Much of our work has been on jazz a study of which offers particularly productive ideas for exploring collective practices and applying the idea of 'the groove' in other genres. Developments in the field of sport are multifaceted and range across personal and collective endeavours, transcending boundaries between psychological and psychic spaces and group and policy based practices.
