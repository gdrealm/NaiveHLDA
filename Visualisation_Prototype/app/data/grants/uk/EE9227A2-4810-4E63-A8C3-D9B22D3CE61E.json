{"id":"EE9227A2-4810-4E63-A8C3-D9B22D3CE61E","title":"Helioseismology and Asteroseismology","abstractText":"The project is aimed principally at addressing the issues encountered when analysing helioseismic and asteroseismic data from ground-based and space-borne observations. Unlike most astronomical data, seismic information is not immediately readily interpretable, even after the data have been 'reduced'. It is first necessary to understand how to assess the different physical contributions to the mode frequencies, and then to design procedures for isolating different properties of the underlying structure of the star under study. This demands first a thorough understanding of the manner in which diferent physical processes influence oscillation mode structure, even if the degree of that influence is not known - the so-called forward problem - and second, the design of analysis procedures from which the structure and internal motion of the star can be inferred - the so-called inverse problem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/C000242/1","grantId":"PP/C000242/1","fundValue":"465803","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Douglas  Gough","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
