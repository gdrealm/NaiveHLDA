{"id":"E360B529-EAA5-43EA-8B61-B8CEF64DA9DA","title":"The Coalition of the Willing and the Construction of Security","abstractText":"<p>Prior to the international invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, both of which were defined as part of the global 'war on terror', governments of states involved in these operations spent a significant amount of time and effort defining why they thought it was important to contribute to these military campaigns. This project points to similarities and differences in the way these interventions were justified to domestic audiences by political leaders and government representatives in three active participant states in the 'war on terror' - The USA, UK, and Australia. </p>\n\n<p>Employing a critical discourse analytical approach and building on critical theoretical approaches to security, this project is concerned with the role of political leaders and government representatives in both constructing intervention as necessary and marginalising opposition to intervention domestically. It is expected that the threat and the response to it were represented in such a way as to maximise the chances that intervention was seen as legitimate by relevant domestic audiences. This project therefore hopes to not simply provide a comparative analysis of the language used in justifying intervention, but to enhance our understanding of the contexts and processes through which particular policy options (even military intervention) become possible.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E016677/1","grantId":"ES/E016677/1","fundValue":"72307","fundStart":"2007-05-24","fundEnd":"2009-02-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matt  McDonald","coPersons":["Richard  Jackson"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
