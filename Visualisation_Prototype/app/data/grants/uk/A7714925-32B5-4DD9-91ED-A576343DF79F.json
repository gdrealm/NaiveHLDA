It will use video cameras, audio microphones and RF/microwave sensors to detect threats as they enter buses or trains. ISIS will use template matching to use the video and audio streams to identify known criminals or terrorists and alert security and transport staff. In cases were the passenger is unknown it will use advanced RF scanning techniques to check for external intrusion into the vehicle space such as an explosive device placed under a bus or train and will also check to unknown electronics used as detonation mechanisms for explosives concealed insit a laptop or mobile phone.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E028640/1","grantId":"EP/E028640/1","fundValue":"1379610","fundStart":"2007-09-10","fundEnd":"2010-09-09","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results were used to help a local bus manufacturer and Transport for London suppliers realise the importance of security and crime prevention on bus public transport Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Transport Economic","person":"David  Linton","coPersons":["Ian  O'Neill","Darryl William Stewart","Sakir  Sezer","Paul  Miller","Vincent  Fusco"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":" 1.
