Data has been analysed and several publications are currently under preparation. Project symposia to disseminate findings have been held/ will be held at the Alzheimer's Disease International annual conference (Puerto Rico, May 2014), International Federation on Ageing (Hyderabad, June 2014), World Federation for Mental Health/ Mental Health for All (Lille, April 2015), International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (Dublin, April 2015). An edited version of the project film shot in Peru was used by the Department of Health at the UK G7 Dementia Legacy Event to raise awareness of the global impact of the condition.\n\nMethodology developed for the project\nThe study protocol has been published in an open access online journal (Mayston et al 2014, Springer Online PMC 25105086)\nThe project questionnaires developed to assess household economic functioning seemed to perform well. Equivalised household income and expenditure/ consumption indicators were highest in China sites, followed by Peru and Mexico. In Latin America, income and expenditure were higher in urban than rural sites, but the opposite was true in China. All distributions were positively skewed, most particularly in China, suggesting higher levels of income inequality. Patterns of correlation between income and expenditure/ consumption varied between sites consistent with expectations regarding rural and urban economies, and the high saving rates in China. The questionnaires will be used in adapted form in a European Union funded network consortium (EMERALD) to assess the impact of increasing coverage of community-based treatment of serious mental disorders in 5 low income countries. We shall also be incorporating these and other selected measures (older adult autonomy and met/ unmet needs) in the next wave of our 10/66 population-based surveys in Latin America and China (2015-19, funded by the European Research Council) to achieve a richer and more detailed assessment of economic status and social protection.\n\nTesting of hypotheses\nControlling for household assets, occupational social class of the index older person and household composition at 10/66 baseline survey, we tested for the possible impact of care dependence among older residents on household impoverishment. \n1. There was evidence for reduced household expenditure and food consumption linked to care needs of older adult residents, particularly when needs for care had been longstanding. There was also moderate evidence for increased economic strain regardless of the duration of care \n2. While there was a trend towards lower equivalised household incomes, particularly in chronic care households, this effect was not statistically significant. The absence of an association did not seem to be explained by higher levels of compensatory income from external sources (gifts from family, and charity). \n3. Household healthcare costs were significantly higher, and catastrophic healthcare spending more likely among care households in some sites (particularly Peru). This association was not apparent in all sites, likely explained by differences in social protection mediated through modes of healthcare financing. \n4. There was a trend towards not working because of the demands of caring for an older household member being considerably more common in incident and chronic care than control households. \n5. Care exit households were defined as those where all older adults needing care (in most cases, all of the older residents) had died. These households were characterised by much lower income from external sources than all other household types, and significantly lower household healthcare costs. This suggested an important impact of the presence of older household members on healthcare costs, and that households with older residents tended to benefit from income from external sources, regardless of needs for care.\n\nIn summary, we have identified a clear link between the development of needs for care in an older household member, and economic strain and relative impoverishment impacting adversely upon all household members. In most low and middle income countries, long-term care arrangements remain the sole responsibility of family members, with the requirement to provide for basic needs and financial support often enshrined in law. The implications of our findings are\n1. Population ageing, with the attendant rapid increases in dependent older people, is a development issue\n2. Social pensions, and targeted benefits (disability benefits, and compensatory caregiver allowances) would help to bolster and incentivise informal family care systems. The introduction of such policies would be pro-poor, and would promote equity by pooling risk across society\n3. There is a need to develop and evaluate community-based health and social care interventions for older people that might reduce the incidence of disability and dependence, and mitigate their impacts on the quality of life of the older person and wider household functioning. Such interventions are not routinely available in any of the countries studied. All of our data, qualitative and quantitative, will be made available in anonymised form to the wider scientific community, for secondary data analysis.\n\nAs far as our findings relate to the specific issues around dementia care, we are working with several stakeholders linked to the G7 Dementia Legacy process. Specifically we are seeking to ensure that project findings are included in an OECD/ WHO report on long term care systems currently being prepared for the World Dementia Council. Alzheimer's Disease International is considering making 'Women and Dementia' the focus for its 2016 World Alzheimer Report, by which time we will be able to contribute rich and fully analysed data from the INDEP study relating to gendered aspects of care (both informal and paid) across three continents.\n\nWe are currently working with the WHO Ageing and Lifecourse Department to develop a new evidence-based health and social care intervention for frail and dependent older people (WHO-COPE). The cross-cutting theme of caregiver support will be strongly informed by emerging INDEP evidence. We also anticipate that INDEP evidence will be constitute an important basis for WHO-led advocacy for governments to invest in scaling up of the package of care and its training procedures within their community health systems. \nWe currently have a grant under review with the EU Horizon 2020 program for the phase 2 and phase 3 evaluation of the WHO-COPE intervention in sites in Latin America, Romania and Ethiopia Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
