{"id":"B8214585-E7D5-4FF2-BEA7-217B21A89F04","title":"Foundations for the future: learning from the past","abstractText":"<p>The uplands are under pressure from agriculture, climate change, conservation, tourism and energy production. Most approaches to understanding how the upland environment responds to change rely on short-term information. This imposes a risk that standards will decline because many processes of environmental change exceed the lifespan of individual managers. It is only with the benefit of hindsight that diversity losses and the gradual pace of change can be traced. Environmental history provides this long-term perspective by combining written documents, maps, archaeology, and archives of past environmental change, such as pollen preserved in bogs, to understand the processes and causes of ecological and climatic change.</p> \n<p>This project will demonstrate that understanding people-landscape interactions over the past 300-500 years is vital to the creation of sustainable management plans. Because it is difficult to put monetary values on heritage, biodiversity or scenery, interview techniques developed by economists will be used to assess how information from the past (presented as scenarios for upland change) influences peopleâ€™s values regarding landscape change, particularly relative to current conservation strategies. The work will focus on heathland, which is the most extensive UK upland habitat, and will be conducted in the Peak District (England) and Sutherland (N Scotland).</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-229-27-0003","grantId":"RES-229-27-0003","fundValue":"260544","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Althea  Davies","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
