{"id":"2D2CD798-4F04-4399-B1AF-D810A233DD21","title":"Census 2022: Transforming Small Area Socio-Economic Indicators through 'Big Data'","abstractText":"<p>The potentially imminent demise of the decennial UK Census presents social, policy and commercial researchers with both a challenge and an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge is to transform ‘census-taking’ by finding robust alternative methods for creating traditional (‘census-like’) small area socio-economic indicators over time. The opportunity is to transform the very nature of the socio-economic indicators themselves (‘census-plus’ indicators) using new analytic methods applied to new geo-coded datasets and to radically accelerate the temporal cycle from decennial to annual or sub-annual production. If we are no longer to be restricted to what can be asked in a Census, then what kinds of social indicators might we want or be able to produce, how regularly and what forms of novel social, policy and commercial analysis might this then underpin?</p>\n\n<p>The project will address these questions using existing large-scale geo-coded transactional datasets, including household level energy monitoring data, held at the University of Southampton. It will test the utility of a range of analytic techniques for deriving traditional and novel small area socio-economic indicators including relatively simple ratios and distribution measures as well as more experimental temporal sequence and profile analysis.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L00318X/1","grantId":"ES/L00318X/1","fundValue":"197779","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ben  Anderson","coPersons":["A.
