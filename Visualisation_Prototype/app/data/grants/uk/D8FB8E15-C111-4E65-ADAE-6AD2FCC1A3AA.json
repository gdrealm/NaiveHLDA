Professional musical life in the capital at the time was dominated by Jews; female singers, in particular, were almost invariably Jewish. Referred to in post-independence Tunisia as 'l'age de decadence', this period saw the establishment of the commercial record industry in Tunis and the emergence of the ughniyya as its favoured genre. Sung in the colloquial Tunisian dialect, often interspersed with French, the early aghani are characterised by earthy themes reflecting real life situations, often with an overlay of social commentary.\n\nIn the 1940s, on the rising tide of the nationalist movement, Muslim composers and performers made a concerted effort to capture the commercial song market with a more elevated style of Tunisian song, also called ughniyya. With the mass emigration of Jews following Tunisian independence in 1956, the aghani of the earlier decades dropped out of circulation in mainstream musical life; officially denigrated as decadent and corrupt, they were considered unworthy remnants of the colonial past. When I visited the Tunisian island of Djerba in 1978, however, I discovered the Jewish community there was singing these songs at weddings and other celebrations, describing them as 'traditional Jewish songs'. On my return visits to Djerba in 1996 and 2001, the songs were no less current.\n\nMy research will examine for the first time in Tunisian music the musical and textual characteristics of the aghani promoted by Jewish musicians and singers in the early twentieth century under the influence of the commercial record industry. Through a critical study of selected examples sung by Jewish musicians on the island of Djerba, I will consider the role of the predominantly Jewish pioneers of the ughniyya in laying the foundations for subsequent developments in Tunisian popular song. I will then consider the circumstances surrounding the adoption of this repertory into the traditional wedding celebrations of both men and women in the Jewish community on the island of Djerba, and the community's continuing identification with the songs as a distinctive aspect of their 'traditional' musical culture, long after they fell out of favor in mainstream Tunisian musical life. Finally, based on interviews carried out in Tunisia since the early 1980s, I will revisit attitudes towards the early ughniyya in mainstream Tunisian society, including the negative attitudes promoted by Asian nationalist and post-independence ideologies, and the nostalgic revival and rehabilitation of the repertory since the 1990s.\n\nMy research is intended to contribute to a more informed understanding of the contribution of Jewish musicians and singers to the genesis of Tunisian popular song in the early years of commercial recording, thus potentially leading to a reappraisal of established narratives of Tunisian music history in the twentieth century. In so doing, it may also shed light on parallel developments in other Arab countries relating to the impact of commercial recording on popular musical culture and the Jewish contribution to professional musical life. In broader terms, my study will shed light on the construction of music histories under the influence of nationalist and postcolonial ideologies, and on the dynamics of musical revivals. Moreover, by investigating the distinctive musical culture of one of the last remaining Jewish communities of the Arab world, my research will shed light on broader issues of music and identity, particularly in relation to minority cultures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505597/1","grantId":"AH/E505597/1","fundValue":"20323","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ruth  Davis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
