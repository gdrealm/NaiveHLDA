Our main aim is to test the hypothesis that many aspects of autism can be ameliorated through participation in drama based activities, specifically live, interactive performance. Our contention is that the embodied qualities of participatory, immersive performance create an opening into the autistic child's world. If successful, the project will provide the basis for a large-scale efficacy trial, and more generally, will raise the possibility that other forms of developmental disorder might also benefit from drama-based interventions. As a consequence, we will disseminate our findings across a wide audience that reaches beyond academia to Health, Education and Social Services. \\n\\nAutism affects as many as 1 in 100 people in the UK and is characterised by a pervasive spectrum of impairments in social interaction, social communication and imagination. There is no cure for autism and there is no single effective intervention. The search continues for an intervention approach which produces demonstrable and generalisable gains for at least the majority of children with autism. There is a lack of research into many interventions that claim to be effective, including drama. Simon Baron-Cohen whose research has transformed our understanding of autism states that ' for severe autism, it may be that no one single method is effective for all children. But researching such methods may enable us to develop a range of methods that teachers, therapists and parents can turn to, to help children connect with the social world.' (Baron Cohen, 2007). This project aims to develop these methods. \\n \\nOur hypothesis is predicated on a close relationship between the triad of impairments which are the diagnostic criteria for autism and the constituent elements of drama:\\nImagination through the construction of a fictional or alternative reality\\nInteraction in the physical engagement between performer(s) and audience\\nCommunication through the dialogue between performer(s) and audience \\n\\nGiven this relation, the project uses drama techniques as an intervention for autism to facilitate language and communication, sociability and empathy and imagination and creativity. The proposed intervention is designed to help autistic children to compensate for their difficulties through participation in fictional structures in visual and sensory environments using, for example, puppetry, light, sound and multimedia. These help the participants develop 'felt' understanding through experiential, physical and immersive media. Since the highly visual, kinetic and aural qualities of the autistic imagination are also the qualities of contemporary performance, the project also investigates how drama might help us to understand the imagination in relation to autism.\\n\\nThe project uses psychological approaches to evaluate the impact of the intervention on three groups of six children, exploring the effect of the intervention on their social interaction, communication and imagination. It will employ a wide range of measures, most of which will be measures which have been used before in studies of intervention in autism. As in other recent intervention evaluations, the main outcome variable will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2001). In addition to the ADOS, the evaluation will use measures of theory of mind, imitation, emotion recognition as well as observations of spontaneous social activity and play and ratings by parents and staff of attention, social engagement, communication and play based activities.\\n \\nIn keeping with the aims of the AHRC scheme, the proposed project promises to further understanding of contemporary human culture through drama and performance practices and our encounter with the autistic consciousness.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I004394/1","grantId":"AH/I004394/1","fundValue":"344187","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  1.

It also identified the measures that seemed to work best for evaluating the impact of the intervention. \n\nSecondly, this study also provided preliminary evidence that the intervention makes a difference to many of the children who took part. Almost half the children improved significantly on at least one measure of social interaction, six of them on the core measure, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS). Those who increased most in reciprocal social interaction were those who were less severely affected by their autism, in particular in terms of communication. It is likely that these children show more accelerated change whereas those with lower levels of functioning need longer to start to show changes. The 10 weeks of the intervention might not have been enough to see significant changes for this group. \n\nThirteen children increased substantially (more than would have been predicted by increase in chronological age) on some aspect of communication as rated by the parents and three improved significantly on the Communication domain of the ADOS. \n\nIn terms of play and imagination, there were few significant changes in these domains. However, 2 children showed noteworthy changes in their imaginative play on the ADOS and four children also showed substantial increases in observed joint functional play with objects during unstructured (play time observations) observations. \n\nOne of the most noteworthy findings was a significant increase across all children in the accuracy with which children in the study recognized facial expressions. This was particular pronounced for the children with lower levels of social and adaptive functioning. \n\nFinally, teacher ratings of severity of autism declined significantly post intervention across the whole sample. In two schools the reduction in severity of was significant as rated by teachers; eight children showed significant changes individually. Parent ratings of severity of autism also decreased for the whole sample and almost three quarters of the children showed at least some positive change in terms of the severity of autism as rated by their parents. Interviews with parents and teachers highlighted the enjoyment the children had experienced and how easily they had gone to the sessions with the drama practitioners. 19 parents were interviewed following the intervention :\no All reported that they wanted their child to access more sessions. \no 16 said their child had gained as a result of the intervention in some way. \no For some the gain was enjoyment and increased confidence, for others the gain was related to communication and language, for others play, imagination and socialisation. \no A number of families in particular were very clear that the gain was due to the intervention.\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary research team, we are now in a better position to apply for funding for a larger, better controlled study that will establish proof of concept for the Imagining Autism intervention. This study established the feasibility of both conducting the Imagining Autism sessions in schools as well as preliminary evidence that the intervention has a positive effect on a number of different measures for a substantial proportion of the children involved. The next step in terms of research will be to seek funding for a larger, better controlled trial study that will provide proof of concept for the intervention. Exploring the impact in other settings and using different measures is already planned through a collaboration with Stony Brook University, New York. However the project illustrated that the children at the very least enjoyed the intervention and were very keen to take part. Making the intervention available to more children in a wider range of settings will be possible and will be necessary as part of the larger trial study. Discussions on how to develop the capacity of the IA team are already underway. Collaborations with other groups working in related areas are currently being established in order to achieve this greater capacity to deliver Imagining Autism to more children. At this stage, the particular group who will take forward the findings will be the research team and collaborators as well as the practitioners working in the field. Teachers in some of the specialist autism schools have already received some training inspired by the intervention which they can take forward to their day to day practice of working with the children. In the future this area of impact should be increased. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
