{"id":"EEAF6AFE-D50F-4168-82AD-F6F514F0D449","title":"Imperial College London Mathematics Platform Grant","abstractText":"The Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London is an outstanding centre for mathematical research and has a strong record of attracting funding from a wide array of sources. Nevertheless we face a crucial lack of baseline research support: our researchers, particularly those at career transitions or at cross-disciplinary interfaces, need easy access to flexible, small-scale funding to support essential research activities. Building on a successful departmental pilot scheme in 2010, where 5,000 Pounds of university seed money was allocated to 13 projects. The proposed Platform Grant implements this model on a much broader scale, whilst retaining the flexibility and responsiveness that were at the core of the pilot program. Specifically, we propose the following three funding schemes, which together form a solid base of support for our research environment:- Research Impulse: a fast-response micro grant scheme.- Research Support: a small grant scheme for research projects and workshops.- Public Engagement Impulse: seed funding for public engagement projects.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I019111/1","grantId":"EP/I019111/1","fundValue":"526820","fundStart":"2011-02-18","fundEnd":"2016-02-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeroen Steven Willibrord Lamb","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
