Russia is a paradigm case: by far the world’s largest country, a nuclear power and UN Security Council permanent member, and one of the world’s most important energy suppliers.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the elections of 2011-2012 as a case study, the project will provide the closest possible analysis of the entire process using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques. A large part of the funding will be devoted to two national representative surveys, to be conducted immediately following each election. In addition, there will be a series of focus groups designed to provide a perspective ‘from below’, framed in the words of the actors themselves and complementary to the aggregate evidence that is available through the surveys. Full use will in addition be made of printed and electronic sources (including those of the Central Electoral Commission itself), and of field visits.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J004731/1","grantId":"ES/J004731/1","fundValue":"80109","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The project's scholarly impact was communicated to a large extent through seminar and conference presentations. The PI spoke for instance at the American Slavic studies conferences in 2012 and 2013, at the annual BASEES conference in 2012 and 2013, and (with Professor McAllister) at the PSA conference in 2012 on 'Were Russia's 2011-12 elections &quot;free and fair&quot;? (And does it matter?)'. Professor McAllister presented a paper with the PI at a conference on 'Electoral integrity and support for democracy in postcommunist Europe' at the Australian National University in 2012. The PI also acted as discussant at a panel on electoral observation missions at the ECPR in 2013, and presented papers to the Politics Departments at Newcastle and Essex universities and to a 'mid-election roundtable' at Edinburgh University in 2012. \n\nThe scholarly impact of the project was extended more widely through a (still continuing) series of publications, including the papers in the Journal of Elections, Parties and Public Opinion and Politics; two contributions to the Russian Analytical Digest in March 2012 on the Russian elections; and a contribution on 'public opinion and voting behaviour' to the Routledge Handbook of Russian Politics and Society (2012). Two much more substantial publications are in progress: a study of Russia and authoritarian elections in which Cambridge have expressed an interest, and a major study (also with Ian McAllister) of The Russian Voter. \n\nEconomic and societal impacts included for instance contributions to pedagogy in UK and international higher education, particularly a chapter on 'The electoral process' in Developments in Russian Politics 8 (Palgrave and Duke, just published) that drew on project findings, and talks to student Politics societies. They also included contributions to the UK and international media, including two BBC radio interviews directly from Moscow; and presentations to practitioners, including the EU External Action Service in Brussels and Australian intelligence officials at Canberra, both in 2012. \n\nThe PI made a series of other contributions to public audiences, including chairing and contributing to a panel on 'UK-Russian relations today' at the Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament; speaking to the GB-Russia Association (an audience that included many practitioners) at Pushkin House in London; and addressing a very large audience at Keele World Affairs, all in 2012.

In the first instance, the project has generated a series of findings relating to the ‘fairness’ of both the December 2011 and March 2012 presidential elections. The fact that the PI and colleagues have been engaged in this work for twenty years or more across the entire postcommunist region allowed these findings to be set in a wider crossnational and over-time perspective. Our results show a steady increase, especially marked in 2011, in the proportion who regarded the elections as ‘unfair’ (25 per cent in 2007, but 39 per cent in 2011). A separate multivariate analysis established that (for instance) a belief that the elections had been fair was little associated with gender, age, education or residential location, but much more closely with self-reported income (those who thought they had a ‘good’ income were much more likely to believe the elections had been fair than those who thought they had a ‘poor’ income). \n2. A second body of findings related beliefs about electoral integrity (a measure that combined the counting of the vote, access to the media and the conduct of the local campaign) to democratic values. The analysis extended across Belarus and Ukraine as well as Russia, controlling for independent variables such as beliefs about corruption among public officials, support for the current regime and television consumption. There were powerful effects for incumbency (government supporters were more likely to see the election as fair, net of other circumstances), and for perceptions of corruption among state officials (which had the opposite effect); electoral integrity itself was a significant predictor of satisfaction with democracy in all three countries. A full version of these findings is available in McAllister and White, Journal of Elections, Parties and Public Opinion (in press).\n3. A third set of findings related to the perception that the Duma election of 2011 had been potentially a ‘Twitter revolution’, based on the increasing use that Russians have been making of new social media and the precedent of the ‘Arab Spring’. Our findings confirm that the media did indeed play a major role in shaping the public’s views about the fairness of the election, but in unexpected ways. Net of other circumstances, the greater the frequency of watching television, the more likely the person was to view the elections as having been fairly conducted; by contrast, more frequent use of the internet was associated with seeing the election as unfair. Social networking, in turn, had a major impact on beliefs about the demonstrations, but only Facebook; its effect was statistically significant at the .01 level and was the second largest in the entire model after beliefs about the fairness of the election itself. A full version of these findings is available in another paper, White and McAllister, ‘Did Russia (Nearly) have a Facebook Revolution in 2011?’, Politics, February 2014. The project will find its most natural extension in the book-length studies that have been mentioned in the previous section, and in the active discussion that is currently developing around ‘authoritarian elections’. The PI will be contributing in this connection to the BASEES conference and to a panel on electoral integrity at the Political Studies Association in April 2014, to the British International Studies Association in Dublin in June, to the European Consortium for Political Research in September and to the American Slavists in November. The PI expects to contribute at the same time to scholarly discussion in Russia itself, in journals such as the Higher School of Economics’ Mir Rossii, of whose editorial board he has recently become a member. The PI and his long-standing collaborators are in an exceptionally strong position to contribute to these ongoing discussions on the basis of the substantial body of research resources that they have accumulated through this and previous projects, including focus groups as well as surveys, and extending across the two other Slavic post-Soviet republics as well as Russia. These discussions are in turn of continuing interest to public audiences, and to various sets of practitioners (including diplomats and election officials).
