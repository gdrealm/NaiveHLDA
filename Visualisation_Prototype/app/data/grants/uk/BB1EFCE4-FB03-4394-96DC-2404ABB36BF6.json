To make inhaled medicines work more efficiently, exhibit fewer side effects and cost less, inhalation researchers are developing ways to prevent drugs from escaping the lung too quickly, which can weaken their therapeutic effect. One of the most promising ways to keep the drug in the lung longer is to load it into very tiny capsules, which are inhaled and then able to release the drug in a slow and controlled manner. When the carrier is emptied, it will dissolve and disappear from the lung without producing any harmful side effects itself. It is thought that drug carriers in the nanometer size range (this is about 1000 times thinner than a human hair) remain in the lung longer than larger carriers and are therefore best suited for inhaled medicines. Due to their size, these drug carriers belong to a larger group of small particles known in general as nanoparticles. \n\nInhaling some types of nanoparticles, especially those that are a product of combustion and are a component of air pollution, can be dangerous. Environmental toxicologists have been studying the health effects of inhaling industrial or environmental nanoparticles for many years now. They have found that many nanoparticles are particularly harmful to lungs, causing short-term inflammation and long-term an increase in the risk of lung cancer.\n\nNanoparticle drug carriers have little to do with toxic industrial or environmental nanoparticles. They are made from materials that are considered to be ?safe? for human consumption and most importantly, will dissolve and disappear from the lung. However, many things are still unknown about the effects of these drugs carriers after inhalation. Therefore, the aim of our study is 1) to investigate how long medicinal nanoparticles will remain in the lung after inhalation and 2) whether inhalation of these particles causes any measurable reaction in the lung, which may be a potential safety concern. \n\nIt is our view that these basic questions need to be addressed before such nanoparticle carriers can be considered safe and useful components of inhaled medicines. Answers to these questions would provide extremely useful guidelines for drug delivery scientists designing innovative nanomedicines and could greatly enhance the speed with which important new medicines may reach the patient.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900953","grantId":"G0900953","fundValue":"545098","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Clive  Page","coPersons":["Stuart Allen Jones","Domenico  Spina","Lea Ann Dailey","B  Forbes"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
