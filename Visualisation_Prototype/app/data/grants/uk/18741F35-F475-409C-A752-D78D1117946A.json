{"id":"18741F35-F475-409C-A752-D78D1117946A","title":"South of England Analytical Electron Microscope [ATEM]","abstractText":"The UK has for many years held a leading position and pioneered the use of transmission electron microscopy in the study of every class of engineering material. This proposal is to install a state-of-the-art fast acquisition and high-throughput analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM) as a regional research facility for a group of universities in the South of England: Oxford, Bristol, Southampton, Exeter, Surrey, and Bath. Southampton and Bath Universities are founder members of the EPSRC-funded UK HE Facilities and Equipment Sharing Network Uniquip, and this application embraces the network aims to increase the visibility of and access to research equipment within and between institutions.\n\nSupported by a strong local infrastructure in Oxford, the instrument will allow us to address key analytical problems and generate greater impact in projects of strategic importance in the research groups of 23 academic staff in the 6 partner universities, working on projects with &gt;20 industrial partners. The specific theme areas we have selected to work on will use the ATEM to contribute to the development of novel materials across a wide range of engineering themes, including power generation, semiconductor materials, nanotechnology and catalysis, and to assist UK industry to maintain competitiveness and grow market share.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K040375/1","grantId":"EP/K040375/1","fundValue":"174558","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Grovenor","coPersons":["Ian Alexander Walmsley","Monica  Ratoi","Nicole  Grobert","Tomas  Polcar","Michael Benjamin Johnston","David  Cherns","Peter  Flewitt","Dan  Hewak","SCE  Tsang","Angus  Kirkland","Peter David Nellist","Sergio  Lozano-Perez"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
