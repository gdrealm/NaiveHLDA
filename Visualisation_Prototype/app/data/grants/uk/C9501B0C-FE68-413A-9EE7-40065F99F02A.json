I will aim this addition at scholars and the general public, with notes on the link with a second key area, pharmacology; on Gelen's intellectual world; on the position of the treatise within a vast output; and on the social commentary on food and class which he provides.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112932/1","grantId":"112932/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Wilkins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
