This disease is a major barrier to transplantation in that it leads to a high death rate. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) can suppress this attack on the patient and reduce the incidence/severity of GVHD but there are problems with using these cells. We have identified within the mouth a novel population of progenitor (stem-like) cells (oral PCs) which are powerful suppressors of immune responses and are more effective than BMSCs, possibly due to something they secrete. This research will investigate in depth how these cells are able to exert their superior suppression on immune cells and how they are different to BMSCs. We will also utilise cutting edge technologies to identify what the soluble factors are so that these cells/factors can ultimately be utilised to help patients. Importantly, oral PCs have distinct advantages for therapeutic applications in that they come from an area of the mouth that is easily accessible and which will heal rapidly with no/minimal resultant scar formation for the patient. We believe that the increased potential of these oral PCs will make them a favoured source of cells for transplantation with blood stem cells in the treatment of GVHD and potentially a number of other diseases where the immune response is dysfunctional.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901562","grantId":"G0901562","fundValue":"387951","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Phil  Stephens","coPersons":["Katarina  Le Blanc","Lindsay Catrina  Davies"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
