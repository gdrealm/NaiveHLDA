It can distinguish between small infections at the site of for example a bite, from a viral infection like influenza that calls for all the power of the immune system to be mobilised. This control is effected by white blood cells patrolling the body waiting to react. As mentioned the nature of the responses is highly controlled and this is mediated by interactions of proteins at the surface of the blood cells with other cells. \nThis proposal looks at one class of proteins called ?paired receptors? that have been implicated in virus defence and have the intriguing property that they can give very different signals although the bit that recognises other cells is quite similar. The study focuses on a protein called CD200R that is currently being evaluated as a possible therapeutic target. The aim is to understand the mechanisms involved at a molecular level for this interaction where the detailed information may be applicable to this class of proteins. The importance of understanding the subtleties of these types of interactions was made abundantly obvious in the recent clinical trials of a leukocyte therapeutic target CD28. Here it appears that differences in interactions between two closely related species were sufficient to cause a dramatic life threatening and unexpected response. \nThe type of quantitative molecular analysis in this study will identify parameters involved in determining the signal produced with relevance for therapies involving this type of target and for the general understanding of the immune system. Thus it will have implications in understanding and treating diseases like cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disease such as arthritis, diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601169","grantId":"G0601169","fundValue":"342731","fundStart":"2007-07-23","fundEnd":"2010-07-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"A Neil Barclay","coPersons":["Marion Hanbury Brown"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
