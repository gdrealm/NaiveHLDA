The project is to turn the technology into acommercial tool.Structures with slender members are widely used in marine engineering, and include jack-ups andjacket platforms for oil-gas production and offshore wind energy platforms. Current methodsused to model the effects of wave and current kinematics on these structures are too simplistic andnot adequate for extreme conditions in harsh weather. The proposed tool will overcome theseproblems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I502033/1","grantId":"EP/I502033/1","fundValue":"104421","fundStart":"2011-08-04","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Qingwei  Ma","coPersons":["Shiqiang  Yan"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
