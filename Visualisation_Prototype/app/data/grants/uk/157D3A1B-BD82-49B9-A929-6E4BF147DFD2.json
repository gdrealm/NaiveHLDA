Current measures for controlling Salmonella infections are far from ideal. Antibiotics are widely used, but an increasing number of Salmonella isolates are resistant to these drugs. Vaccines can potentially be an effective method to prevent some forms of Salmonella disease. Unfortunately, most of the currently used vaccines are only moderately effective and are based on old technology. There are currently no vaccines against septicaemic salmonellosis that is an emerging form of the disease especially in Africa in young children and immunocompromised individuals. The use of live vaccines can be potentially dangerous, especially in those areas where immunodeficiencies are prevalent. People who may have a latent (as yet undiscovered) immunodeficiency syndrome (e.g. HIV infected individuals or people with subclinical malaria) may be at serious risk if they receive a live vaccine that can potentially revert to virulence when the host immune system is not fully competent.\nHere we propose to use a cost effective, global and modern approach to identify bacterial genes that are responsible for the increased virulence of Salmonella in individuals with common forms of immunodeficiencies that can be encountered in the geographical areas where Salmonella is endemic. Deletion of appropriate combinations of such genes, would make live vaccines safe also in those individuals with an impaired immune system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100102","grantId":"G1100102","fundValue":"248146","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Pietro  Mastroeni","coPersons":["Duncan  Maskell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
