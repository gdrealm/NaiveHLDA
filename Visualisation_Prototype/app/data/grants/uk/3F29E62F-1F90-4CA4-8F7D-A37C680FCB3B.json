{"id":"3F29E62F-1F90-4CA4-8F7D-A37C680FCB3B","title":"G8-2012 Structural Bamboo Products","abstractText":"This project develops green construction materials and building codes for bamboo. China, India and Brazil have\nrapidly expanding economies with increasing demand for building materials. The production of conventional\nconstruction materials such as steel and concrete is energy intensive and unsustainable: concrete alone accounts for\n5% of global CO2 emissions. Bamboo is a fast growing, renewable building material widely cultivated in these\ncountries but not utilized to its full potential in modern construction. Its mechanical properties are similar to wood\nbut it produces up to six times as much mass per hectare as conventional timber plantations. Structural bamboo\nproducts (SBP), similar to plywood, oriented strand board, or glue-laminated wood products, therefore have\nenormous potential to partially replace the use of more energy intensive materials in rapidly developing countries.\nWidespread use of SBP is hampered by limited knowledge of their manufacture, structural and thermal behavior,\nand lack of appropriate building codes. The goal of this project is to develop modern structural building materials\nfrom renewable bamboo in order to place growth in rapidly developing countries onto a more sustainable path.\nLow-carbon solutions can also help to meet developed countries' own obligations under schemes like the UK's\nCarbon Reduction Commitment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K023403/1","grantId":"EP/K023403/1","fundValue":"422752","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Hector Ramage","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
