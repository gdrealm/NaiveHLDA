{"id":"DAB7C0BE-F5E3-4CBE-A2A4-CF6ED9B1918A","title":"Evaluation of the technical and commercial feasibility of the manufacture of bio-based polyester from cellulose derived hydroxymethyl furfural","abstractText":"Aromatic chemicals are a crucial constituent of plastics and bioplastics, conveying functionality such as strength and flexibility. At present, these chemicals can only be sourced economically from fossil-oil. However, lignocellulose is a low-cost and renewable material available from plants from which aromatics can be obtained, both from lignin and indirectly from the cellulose portion. This project evaluates the commercial potential of novel work that has demonstrated high yielding and efficient conversion of a cellulose-derived chemical called HMF into a key novel building block (FDCA) for the synthesis of a biomass-derived bioplastic PBAF. The two- step enzyme process uses enzyme biocatalysts called oxidases which work at 37degC where water is the only by product. Hence the process has extremely green credentials. The project will evaluate sensitivity to the source and type of crude HMF used, improve reaction conditions and will be scaled up to produce gram quantities of FDCA. These will be converted into novel polymers and the properties of these materials tested. A techno-economic assessment of the holistic process will be carried out to evaluate the commercial potential in both the bioplastic and broader polyester markets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M028631/1","grantId":"BB/M028631/1","fundValue":"123485","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Carnell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
