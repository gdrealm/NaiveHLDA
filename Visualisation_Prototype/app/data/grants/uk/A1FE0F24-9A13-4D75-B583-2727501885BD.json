It will do this by developing new methods to anonymise, link and analyse healthcare\nand similar data, to answer a wide range of important research questions. We will often work with researchers who have\nestablished large cohort studies, helping them make their cohorts more powerful, longer lasting, and cheaper to operate. Ehealth\nresearch is a new field and so CIPHER will be focussing on training researchers in how to use these data and\nmethods.\nCIPHER has four core research programmes: The first focuses on developing robust new methods to allow health and\nother information to be anonymised and analysed. For example, developing ways in which researchers accessing data\ncannot possibly identify the individuals involved, thereby ensuring that privacy is protected. CIPHER's other threeresearch programmes focus on the impact on people's lives of (1) injury and the built environment; (2) mental health and\nsubstance use; and (3) infection. CIPHER researchers will undertake a range of studies to provide better insight into the\ncauses of disease and injury, the consequences of these conditions on individuals and the population, and evaluations of\ntreatments and policies which are designed to improve health. Knowledge of the longer term individual and societal impact\nof many conditions and treatments is currently very limited, as long term studies are very expensive. CIPHER's work will\nenable the long term follow up of outcomes using anonymised data, answering these questions effectively but at far less\ncost. Within its research programmes CIPHER will address many scientific questions, including: How effective are fallprevention\ninitiatives for older people? What is the impact of giving Vitamin D supplements to people in care homes in\nreducing hip fractures? Can linked data be used to help Fire and Rescue services prevent more home fires? Have\ninterventions to make homes warmer reduced the number of deaths in winter? How much does substance use in young\nadults contribute to mental health problems? Does opiate substitution therapy in prison reduce the risk of death following\nprison release? Can linked routine data be used to identify opportunities to intervene in pathways to harm for people who\nself-harm or die by suicide? How can information be better used to reduce antibiotic resistant infections? Are the different\nmicro-organisms we carry in our bowels involved in the development of serious health conditions?\nCIPHER will work with the NHS to develop better ways to measure patients' experiences and treatment outcomes. CIPHER\nwill also develop methods to enable linkage of anonymised treatment data to important social outcomes such as staying in\nwork, continuing in education, or being able to live independently at home. Such information will help the NHS design its\nservices to meet a broader range of patients' needs. CIPHER's believes it is important to communicate effectively with\npatients, patient groups and the public at large about its research. A significant part of our work therefore will be setting up\nways to aid this communication. We will have public representatives involved in our research throughout and they will help\nguide us and help us communicate effectively with wider groups.\nCIPHER will be one of a small number of similar Centres that is being set up in the UK and we will be working together to\ntrain researchers in these new methods and making sure universities have suitable jobs for them. CIPHER aims to be an\ninternationally recognised centre of expertise in the use of electronic health and associated records for research and, along\nwith other network members, position the UK as the world leader in the field, improving the population's health, increasing\nUK research income, and improving the economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MC_PC_13043","grantId":"MC_PC_13043","fundValue":"0","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
