{"id":"A5A3580D-7FC6-4559-B475-A6727DAFF898","title":"MINOS+ Co-Spokesperson RA","abstractText":"MINOS+ will take data in the upgraded NuMI beam from April 2013 for three years in the first instance. I have been elected as the Co-Spokesperson of this new phase of the experiment, for a period of 3 years starting in January 2013. In the position of Co-Spokesperson, much of my time will be spent at FNAL on the business of running the collaboration. My personal research interests are focused in the continuation of the high precision measurement of the mixing parameters Dm2 and sin22q23, the resolution of the theta23 octant, and the new analysis of the MINOS/MINOS+ and Atmospheric MINOS/MINOS+ data using the full three flavor mixing equations. The main goal of the MINOS+ physics program is to search for any physics effects which are not described by the &quot;standard&quot; 3x3 mixing model of neutrino oscillations, and UCL personnel will be particularly involved with asserting limits on non standard processes.\n\nIn addition, I am trying to start a new initiative to build a large Chenerkov detector in Minnesota to measure delta-CP using the neutrinos in the NuMI beam. R&amp;D into the technical issues is starting up at UCL and this effort would also be augmented by the spokesperson's RA.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K00655X/1","grantId":"ST/K00655X/1","fundValue":"239618","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Anne Thomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
