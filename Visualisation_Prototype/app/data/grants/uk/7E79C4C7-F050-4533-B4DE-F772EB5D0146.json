These great earthquakes commonly generate tsunami waves that impact coastal regions both local to the earthquake as well as distant communities. The 2011 Tohoku Oki and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquakes and corresponding tsunamis provide recent dramatic examples of the impact of these hazards.\n\nUnderstanding of both the earthquake process and tsunami generation has significantly advanced in the last few decades with improvements in the technology for recording earthquake waves and remote study of the subsurface. However, opportunities to directly sample and measure the physical properties within the fault zones where these large earthquakes are generated are rare and require substantial resources.\n\nThe Nankai subduction zone of Japan has a long record of past earthquakes and tsunamis and is the most widely studied, and probably the best understood, subduction zone in the world. However, the challenge of directly sampling and monitoring the earthquake-generating fault system is yet to be achieved and the process of earthquake initiation and rupture is still relatively poorly understood.\n\nThe NanTroSEIZE experiment has been launched within the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) specifically to sample, measure and monitor all parts of the subduction zone fault system, including the deeper parts (~6-7 km below the seafloor) of the system where the earthquake rupture takes place. The experiment is a long-term project staged over a period of years. The previous stages have targeted 10 different sites, each exploring a different part of the subduction system to build up a 2-D profile of the incoming rock formations and the deformation they undergo during subduction.\n\nIODP Expedition 338, the expedition that this proposal relates to, is the second expedition of Stage 3 and will employ riser drilling to extend and case an existing borehole to a target depth of 3600 m below the seafloor in preparation for the final leg that will target the earthquake-generating fault.\n\nA variety of methods will be used to measure sediment, rock and fault properties during Expedition 338 at a site located above the earthquake-generating part of the subduction zone:\n- Samples of borehole sediments and rocks;\n- Measurements of sediment-rock properties from tools in the borehole;\n- In situ measurements of properties, such as pressure of fluids within the sediments and the magnitude of the strain that the rocks-sediments are under as the two tectonic plates converge;\n- Preparation of the borehole for future drilling to greater depths.\n\nThe requested funds would enable the proponent to join the Core Log Seismic Integration team. Daily watchkeeping and research duties will include quality control of newly acquired data, making preliminary observations and interpretations, discussing results with other participants and contribution to the writing of the initial results.\n\nResearch interests of the proponent focus on investigating the physical properties (e.g. density, porosity) of fault structures within the prism interior. By comparing the properties of the faults located on further from the subduction zone to those within the zone of active deformation it will be possible to establish how these systems evolve through time. Determining whether the properties of these faults change gradually or abruptly will provide insights into the evolution of these systems. The data collected on this cruise will also be incorporated into the proponent's ongoing research to investigate methods of tying direct observations made at boreholes to more laterally extensive subsurface imaging data. This will provide a greater understanding about the whole subduction zone system (as well as other global subduction zones) in areas that do not benefit from direct observations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K008420/1","grantId":"NE/K008420/1","fundValue":"4660","fundStart":"2012-11-25","fundEnd":"2013-01-24","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Dean James Wilson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
