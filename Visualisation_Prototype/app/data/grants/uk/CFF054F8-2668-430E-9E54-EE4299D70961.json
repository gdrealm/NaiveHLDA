{"id":"CFF054F8-2668-430E-9E54-EE4299D70961","title":"Structure factors in warm dense matter","abstractText":"In this research we intend to explore the properties of matter under conditions of high density at temperatures of about 5,000-100,000K. These conditions are relevant to the interiors of planets and understanding more about the microscopic structure and other properties of such matter will help in understanding the structure and formation of planets.\n\nWe will conduct the research, principally, by using high power lasers to create such &quot;warm dense matter&quot; conditions by driving shock waves of millions of atmospheres pressure into sample foils. We will probe the material using intense short pulses of X-rays. By observing the distribution of scattered X-rays we will be able to infer the short range arrangements of the ions in the sample and thus infer information about the ion-ion potential. By extracting this information, we would, in principle, be able to extract further information about the bulk properties such as electrical and thermal conductivities and compressibility.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K009591/1","grantId":"EP/K009591/1","fundValue":"467214","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To further undertsanding of matter in extreme conditions.

This cannot as yet be ascribed to a particular model of the structure as the data does not have the required temporal resolution but it does place a limits. Further data is being taken. In undertsanding Fe structure we may be on the way to undertsanding mor about Fe in the Earth's core. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
