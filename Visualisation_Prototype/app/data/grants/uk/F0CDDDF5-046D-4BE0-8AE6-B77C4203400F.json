{"id":"F0CDDDF5-046D-4BE0-8AE6-B77C4203400F","title":"Sacred communities:connected practices across time and place. A joint review and scoping study.","abstractText":"The project's purpose was to jointly review existing qualitative and quantitative data from two separate projects, providing new insights on grounded and embodied community practices in the context of everyday religion and belonging. Researchers engaged in knowledge exchange and dialogue with new and former research participants, other researchers involved in similar research and wider academic networks beyond the core disciplines represented here, principally anthropology and geography.\n\nKey concluding themes related to the ambivalent nature of 'faith'; connections over place and time and the contested nature of community. The collaboration was useful to allow mutual engagements and important insights about religion, place, space, and faith. Implicit in terms like faith, community and life course are larger interwoven narratives of space, time, place, corporeality and emotion. In conclusion, we found that understanding how places, 'communities' and 'faiths' differ and intersect requires an understanding of social 'relatedness', including the social boundaries through which relationships are formed, experienced, mediated and transmitted. Further research is necessary, potentially cross-culturally, on the sometimes invisible roles of community volunteers and activists, particularly older women and young people.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I507698/1","grantId":"AH/I507698/1","fundValue":"32033","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Mainly through teaching, research, writing.

Substantively we set out to\n\ncompare our original studies based on a total of 143 interviews in the\n\nmid-2000s with children, teenagers, and adult men and women in two separate\n\nprojects in two English counties: North Yorkshire and East Anglia. Rogaly's\n\nwork in Norwich, East Anglia, was already a collaborative interdisciplinary\n\nstudy with historian Becky Taylor. Day's work continued through an ESRC\n\ngrant, allowing her to re-visit participants first studied between 2002 and 2005.\n\nWhile Day's work made central issues of belief and belonging and the relation\n\nbetween them and thus provided deep insights into faith and religion (see e.g.\n\nDay, Believing), these were only bi-products of Rogaly and Taylor's work, the\n\ncentral concern of which was a critical analysis of the construction of the\n\nstudy's location in a 'deprived white community' (Rogaly and Taylor, Moving).\n\nAs part of our joint study, we reviewed our separate projects and contrasted\n\ntheir findings on the themes of community and faith. We then tested our\n\nemerging findings among former and new research participants through\n\ninformal interviews and group discussions in our 'home' county of East\n\nSussex. Restrictions of time and funding allowed only a small number of new\n\ninterviews and we therefore sought a range of gender, religiosity, and age: one\n\nmiddle-aged female rabbi known for her community engagement; one\n\nmiddle-aged Muslim male medical doctor actively engaged in environmental\n\nactivism and in a spiritual community; one elderly retired policeman\n\nnominally attached to a Christian church; one young agnostic female\n\nuniversity student and one young atheist male student, both involved in\n\nacademic and voluntary work concerning international development.\n\nFollowing the interviews, we discussed and reflected on our impressions.\n\n Key concluding themes related to the ambivalent nature of 'faith', connections over place and time, and\n\nthe contested nature of community. Implicit in terms like 'faith', 'community',\n\nand 'life course' are larger interwoven narratives of space, time, place, corporeality,\n\nand emotion.
