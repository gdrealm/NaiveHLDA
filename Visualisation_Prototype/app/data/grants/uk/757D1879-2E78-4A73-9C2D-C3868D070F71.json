Many of these remitters find themselves in increasingly tenuous circumstances, due to a cocktail of uncertain and changing asylum provisions, increased competition for unskilled and semi-skilled job opportunities, and exploitation in some unregulated sectors of the economy.&nbsp; The research – the first to be based in West Yorkshire – explores the nature and significance of remitting by Zimbabweans. Using a combination of mixed methods, including a community survey and in depth interviews, the study focuses on three main areas:\n<br />\n<br />First, the range of remitting strategies, including who remits, what and how they remit, and what might be expected in return;\n<br />\n<br />Second, the sources of vulnerability and opportunity that constrain and enable remitting.&nbsp; These may be related to various laws and patterns of community organisation, including the roles that individuals are expected to fulfil;\n<br />\n<br />Third, the implications for Zimbabweans in the UK, for post-crisis Zimbabwe, and for the development of policies that use remittances as a means to accomplish development targets.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F037732/1","grantId":"ES/F037732/1","fundValue":"81091","fundStart":"2008-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Bailey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
