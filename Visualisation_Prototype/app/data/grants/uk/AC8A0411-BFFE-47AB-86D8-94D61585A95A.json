Agentic teachers are motivated, resistant to stress and have beneficial effects on their students' learning. The aim of teacher education is to nurture in student teachers those characteristics that will contribute to their future pupilsâ€™ learning and well-being. However, we know little about how student teachers' sense of agency evolves, is maintained and translated into observable classroom practice. Based on a theoretical framework encompassing concepts from mainstream theories in educational psychology, the aims of the present study are to establish:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>whether, and to what extent, student teachers' agency beliefs change across one Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) year, and which individual and contextual factors influence change or stability;</li>\n\n <li>how student teachers' day-to-day experiences during intense periods in partnership schools relate to short-term and long-term changes in agency beliefs; </li>\n\n <li>the relationships between student teacher's agency beliefs, their day-to-day experiences and their teaching behaviours.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The present study employs a multimethod follow-up design (using questionnaires, participant diaries and observations) and state-of-the art statistical methods.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1870","grantId":"RES-000-22-1870","fundValue":"75820","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lars-Erik Joakim Malmberg","coPersons":["Hazel Rosina Hagger"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
