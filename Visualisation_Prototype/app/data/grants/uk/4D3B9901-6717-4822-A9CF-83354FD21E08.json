{"id":"4D3B9901-6717-4822-A9CF-83354FD21E08","title":"BigBOSS-UK development","abstractText":"BigBOSS is a ground-based dark energy experiment to study the cosmological expansion rate and the growth of structure with a wide-angle spectroscopic galaxy and quasar redshift survey. A wide range of additional science is possible using the 5000 fibre multi-object spectrograph required for this experiment, including studying galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy cluster surveys, the structure of the Milky-Way galaxy and Galactic archeology.\n\nIn order to undertake the proposed survey, a US-Europe-China collaboration has come together with the aim of constructing a 5000-fiber spectrograph that will initially deploy on the Mayall 4m-telescope. The key science goals represent a field in which the UK has world leadership and strong scientific interest, built up through STFC support for participation in the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Dark Energy Survey.\n\nThis grant provides development funding for two key areas of hardware development where the UK has internationally regarded expertise - the optical corrector, and the fibre system, and will retain UK involvement in this ground-breaking project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J004596/1","grantId":"ST/J004596/1","fundValue":"15030","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"William James  Percival","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Portsmouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
