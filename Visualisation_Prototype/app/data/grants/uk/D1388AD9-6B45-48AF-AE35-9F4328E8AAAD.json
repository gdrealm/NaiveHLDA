But these simple plants are incredibly diverse and are found in all aquatic habitats including lakes, rivers and oceans, even the soil. They are of immense importance to global CO2 fixation, since it is estimated that marine species of algae account for about half of the worldâ€™s photosynthesis. There is currently considerable interest in exploiting these organisms for biofuel production: they grow much faster than land-based plants, some species can accumulate very high amounts (&gt;50% dry weight) of oil, and they do not compete with food crops.&nbsp;However, there are many different hurdles that must be overcome before algal biofuels can be commercially viable, not least that our understanding of algal biology lags behind that of higher plants.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0125","grantId":"RES-168-26-0125","fundValue":"1971","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Gail Smith","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
