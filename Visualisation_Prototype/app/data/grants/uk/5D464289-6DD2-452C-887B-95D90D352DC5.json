These phenomena range from the charge density waves observed with the scanning tunnelling microscope on artificially fabricated nano-scale atomic structures, to the more recent observations of magnetic ordering of molecules. Understanding the fundamental physics of surface quantum phenomena and their effects on important processes such as adsorption, diffusion and self-organisation is a key issue to be addressed en route to new thin-film-based quantum devices. Recent experiments performed by QK Xue and his group at Tsinghua University, Beijing, have demonstrated quantum effects in surface growth, in modulation of surface superconductivity as well as in surface reactivity. Funding is requested from the EPSRC to support a scientific visit by Prof QK Xue of Tsinghua University to a number of UK laboratories including the host institution, the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, with a view to establishing formal collaborations in the area of surface nanostructure and associated quantum processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G069115/1","grantId":"EP/G069115/1","fundValue":"6189","fundStart":"2009-04-20","fundEnd":"2009-07-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Quanmin  Guo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
