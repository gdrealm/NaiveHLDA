{"id":"F4B5B766-29CD-476C-988E-CAEE40426269","title":"Homological algebra of Feynman graphs","abstractText":"The area of the proposed research is at the junction of several branches of pure mathematics and mathematical physics. It follows the pattern of applying the physical intuition and ideas to solving mathematical problems which has been a characteristic feature of many groundbreaking developments in algebra in geometry in the last two decades.\n\nThe project has two closely related themes. One purports to link two deep algebraic constructions which have been extensively studied in their own right. The first is the calculation of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of infinite matrices with values in an algebra and the second is the calculation of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of the infinite-dimensional algebra of noncommutative hamiltonians. One conjectural application is the construction of an algebraic version of chain level Gromov-Witten invariants.\n\nThe second theme derives its motivation from the general problem of quantizing field theories defined classically, i.e. in terms of an action functional. More precisely, a classical field theory is modelled as a certain algebraic structure, called L-infinity algebra which is determined by a certain polynomial or power series function, and one studies other algebraic structures derived by integrating this function. The application will include topological theories of Chern-Simons type and Poisson sigma-models.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J008451/1","grantId":"EP/J008451/1","fundValue":"209509","fundStart":"2012-10-29","fundEnd":"2015-10-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The main construction of my joint paper with Markl `Disconnected rational homotopy theory' was used by Dolgushev and Rogers in their proof of a version of the Goldman-Millson theorem.

Markl `Disconnected rational homotopy theory' we construct two algebraic versions of homotopy theory of rational disconnected topological spaces, one based on differential graded commutative associative algebras and the other one on complete differential graded Lie algebras. As an application of the developed technology we obtain results on the structure of Maurer-Cartan spaces of complete differential graded Lie algebras.\n\n\n\nIn my paper with C. Braun `Homotopy BV algebras in Poisson geometry' we define and study the degeneration property for BV-infinity algebras and show that it implies that the underlying L-infinity algebras are homotopy abelian. The proof is based on a generalisation of the well-known identity \\Delta(e^x)=e^x(\\Delta(x)+[x,x]/2) which holds in all BV algebras. As an application we show that the higher Koszul brackets on the cohomology of a manifold supplied with a generalised Poisson structure all vanish. \n\n\n\nIn my other paper with C. Braun `Unimodular homotopy algebras and Chern-Simons theory' quantum Chern-Simons invariants of differentiable manifolds are analyzed from the point of view of homological algebra. Given a manifold M and a Lie (or, more generally, an L-infinity) algebra g, the vector space H^*(M) \\otimes g has the structure of an L-infinity algebra whose homotopy type is a homotopy invariant of M. We formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for this L-infinity algebra to have a quantum lift. We also obtain structural results on unimodular L-infinity algebras and introduce a doubling construction which links unimodular and cyclic L-infinity algebras. One of the papers above `Homotopy BV algebras in Poisson geometry' has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, the other two are being refereed. The papers have been put on arXiv and my co-authors and myself have given numerous talks on the subject of these works. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
