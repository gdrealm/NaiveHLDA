The elucidation of biochemical pathways is a challenging area that is often complicated by low levels of inherently unstable metabolic intermediates. We have developed a method that allows for the isolation of enzyme-bound metabolites, permitting their characterisation and thereby providing an opportunity to gain atomic resolution of a number of fascinating enzyme-mediated transformations. The application is based on the finding that in some biochemical pathways the product of one reaction is passed directly onto the next in a process known as substrate channelling. Key to this is a tight association between an enzyme and its product, which allows for the isolation of highly stable enzyme-product complexes. We will exploit these properties to unravel the mysteries surrounding the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). By using His-tagged enzymes of the pathway it is now possible to isolate many of the hitherto ephemeral intermediates, trapped and stabilised on the tagged enzymes as tightly bound enzyme-product complexes. Characterisation of these intermediates will allow the complete elucidation of the corrin pathway. Moreover, a combination of enzymology and X-ray crystallography will permit a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the enzymes that mediate the synthesis of the corrin framework, including the ring contraction process that involves the extrusion of an integral carbon atom in a reaction that has no parallel in nature. Our preliminary data is consistent with the B12 pathway operating by direct metabolite channelling. We outline experiments to investigate this further and to determine whether enzyme rather than substrate concentration controls this metabolic process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I013334/1","grantId":"BB/I013334/1","fundValue":"404551","fundStart":"2012-01-03","fundEnd":"2016-01-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  On-going development of cobalamin surrogates for cancer and disease  ","person":"Richard William Pickersgill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" The biosynthesis of many vitamins and coenzymes has often proven difficult to elucidate owing to a combination of low abundance and kinetic lability of the pathway intermediates. Through a serial reconstruction of the cobalamin (vitamin B12) pathway in Escherichia coli and by His tagging the terminal enzyme in the reaction sequence, we have observed that many unstable intermediates can be isolated as tightly bound enzyme-product complexes.
