The welfare costs of recessions in classical economics arise solely from lost output.&nbsp;The project is about trying to measure all of the costs to society of inflation and unemployment - both 'classical' and ‘behavourial’ - through the use of “contentment data”.</p>\n\n<p>The project investigates how much people adapt to higher rates of inflation compared to higher rates of unemployment, what is the “best” measure of well-being to use and whether different measures capture different time horizons. We also test for whether the impacts of inflation, unemployment and higher levels of GDP differ according to sex, age, education level and personal income of individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The topic has the potential to impact the way Central Banks set interest rates to influence the economy by helping them better understand the trade-offs that the public is willing to accept in terms of unemployment for inflation (at least in terms of keeping contentment constant).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2092","grantId":"RES-062-23-2092","fundValue":"129035","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  MacCulloch","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
