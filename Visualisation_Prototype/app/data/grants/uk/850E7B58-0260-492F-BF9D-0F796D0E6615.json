Many of these topicscould be developed into separate projects with their own agenda. In the framework of thecurrent project new mathematical results related to branching diffusions on Riemannian manifolds and Large Deviations will be obtained. Also we plan preliminary numerical studies/simulation of epidemiology models on HPC facility. This project will lead to the systematic studyof spatial epidemic models and includes some statistical topics from nuclear physics andinsurance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F014015/1","grantId":"EP/F014015/1","fundValue":"15709","fundStart":"2007-10-16","fundEnd":"2008-10-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Kelbert","coPersons":["Michael  Gravenor","Igor  Sazonov","Ian Malcolm Davies","Aubrey  Truman"],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
