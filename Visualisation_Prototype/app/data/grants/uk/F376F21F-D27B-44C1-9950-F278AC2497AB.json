{"id":"F376F21F-D27B-44C1-9950-F278AC2497AB","title":"Perseverometry: a novel performance marker in dementia","abstractText":"Patients with Alzheimer s disease are frequently noted by their relatives or carers to repeat themselves in conversation. In the early stages such behaviour might be regarded with no more than mild annoyance, but worsening of the tendency often motivates seeking a medical opinion, and leads eventually to the diagnosis of AD. With worsening of the disease, repetitions become more frequent, so if there were a means of measuring their occurence, this could be used as a diagnostic aid and a tool for monitoring the condition. Disease monitoring in particular is critical to the evaluation of novel drug treatments for Alzheimer s. Recording of patients conversations with their family members would be intrusive, and analysis of any such tape recorded record to look for repetitions would be a very laborious process. The solution we propose here is to make a continuous recording of energy fluctuations from the vocal apparatus. Such information would not be interpretable as language (thus safeguarding privacy) but could be rapidly and automatically processed to reveal segments that represented a previously repeated statement or phrase (solving the practical problems of interpretation). The aim of the present study is to determine the best methods for acquiring and analysing the data, and to establish the feasibility of such a recording method from AD patients as they go about their day to day lives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902237","grantId":"G0902237","fundValue":"89083","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Garrard","coPersons":["Anna  Barney"],"organisation":"St George's University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
