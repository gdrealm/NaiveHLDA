Many young women now appreciate that they can be infected without having any symptoms and that untreated infection can prejudice their fertility in later life. There is also evidence that this infection is becoming more common due to increasing high risk behaviour among the young. However we have no reliable way of knowing this. In response to the problem, the Department of Health are currently putting in place a nationwide programme to screen women for chlamydial infection. \n\nHowever, there are still many aspects of chlamydial biology that we do not understand. Critically, although we know that chlamydial infection can cause damage to the womb (pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)) and subsequent infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain, we do not know how often this occurs. This is because it can be difficult to sometimes tell sometimes whether a woman has PID as some do not have symptoms ? so called ?silent PID?.\n\nInfection with chlamydia stimulates the production of antibodies, often detectable in the blood, to help protect us. Examination of women with high antibody levels has shown that the majority have damage to their womb and antibody levels are linked to the degree of damage. The measuring of chlamydial antibodies in the blood could thus give us a way to measure how many women have been infected with chlamydia and what proportion have developed upper genital tract infection. However, there are a number of problems to overcome. The best tests for chlamydial antibody used at present are unsuitable for testing large numbers of blood samples and many also detect antibodies to a similar infection - Chlamydia pneumoniae which is a common respiratory infection. We propose to develop two new test that will utilise established technology for automation. The application of these tests to large numbers of blood samples will have three important outcomes:\n\n1. When used over time, it will allow us to assess the effectiveness of the chlamydial screening programme in reducing not only the number of people infected but also in preventing chlamydial PID.\n2. It will identify women who have had chlamydial PID at an early stage, who may need subsequent assistance to conceive.\n3. It will identify some women who may have ongoing chlamydial infection with ?silent? PID and who might benefit from treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500044","grantId":"G0500044","fundValue":"130178","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Myra O McClure","coPersons":["Anne Mandall Johnson","Paddy  Horner","David  Cahill"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
