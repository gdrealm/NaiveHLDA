It can distinguish between small infections at the site of, for example a bite, from a viral infection like influenza that calls for all the power of the immune system to be mobilised. This control is mediated by white blood cells patrolling the body waiting to react. The nature of the responses is highly controlled and this involves interactions of proteins at the surface of the blood cells with other cells. This proposal looks at one class of proteins called paired receptors that have been implicated in virus defence and have the intriguing property that they can give very different signals although the bit that recognises other cells is quite similar. These paired receptors are evolving very fast and the hypothesis is that bacteria and viruses might bind them directly and therefore affect responses to them and also the immune system in general. The aim is to understand the mechanisms involved at a molecular level for this interaction. The use of quantitative molecular analysis in this study will identify parameters involved in determining the signal produced with relevance for therapies involving this type of target and for the general understanding of the immune system. Thus it will have implications in understanding and treating diseases like cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disease such as arthritis, diabetes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9826026","grantId":"G9826026","fundValue":"4591280","fundStart":"1999-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"A Neil Barclay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
