It is therefore imperative that the data collected by these, and other publicly-funded, surveys are of the highest possible quality. In an environment of increased awareness of quality issues and concern for declining response in some surveys there is a need to build up the evidence base around the techniques which may be employed to enhance data quality.</p>\n\n<p>The ESRC has responded to this need for research into the area of survey design and measurement by funding six projects under the Survey Design and Measurement initiative (SDM). These six projects tackle the issues of response bias minimisation, the use of mixed modes, the application of new technologies and the accuracy of survey measurement.</p>\n\n<p>As well as funding the research in these areas, it is vital to disseminate the results so that research organisations can improve their techniques and maximise the quality of the data they collect. Therefore, there is a role for a co-ordinator to build a strategy for the dissemination of the research outputs from the six projects.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-175-31-0001","grantId":"RES-175-31-0001","fundValue":"2854","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Burton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" not applicable this year not applicable this year Other","dataset":"gtr"}
