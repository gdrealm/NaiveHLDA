Sarcopenia occurs mostly in people &gt;80yrs (and rodents &gt;2 years old) and its consequences include inactivity, increased susceptibility to falls and eventually to loss of independence. As the number of people over 80yrs in the United Kingdom is expected to double in the next 20 years, from 2.7 million in 2006 to 5.4 million by 2031, the percentage of the population suffering from sarcopenia and the demands this imposes on the NHS and society in general is expected to rise accordingly. Despite its physical and socioeconomic importance, little is known about the causes of sarcopenia. In this study we propose that it occurs because of a decrease in the ability of skeletal muscle cells to transport amino acids (the building blocks of proteins ) into and out of the cells. We also suggest that this decline is due to a reduction in the number of the transporters/pumps that move amino acids into and out of the cells or is due to a decrease in the concentration of hormones such as the male sex hormones that normally stimulate these pumps.\nTo test these suggestions we plan to investigate; (1) the effects of age on the number of amino acid transporters and their ability to move amino acids into and out of mouse skeletal muscle cells. (2) Whether treating muscle cells with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the active metabolite of testosterone, can reverse these age-dependent changes. (3) Finally we will test whether treating mice &gt;560 days old with DHT for 4 weeks reverses/slows down sarcopenia. We will also investigate whether DHT treatment increases the transport amino acids and the synthesis of new proteins.\nThree types of experiments will be used in the study. The first type will use mice of different ages (range 60-730 days) kept under normal laboratory conditions. Small muscle fibre bundles isolated from the edl and soleus muscles of each age group will then be used to investigate the effects of age on the expression and physiological function of various amino acid transporters and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these changes.\nMost previous studies have investigated the effects of testosterone treatment on skeletal muscle mass and strength and no studies have investigated those of DHT treatment. Therefore, the second experiment will investigate the effects of treating young, old and senescent mice with DHT for at least 4 weeks. Small muscle fibre bundles isolated from the edl and soleus of treated and untreated mice will then be used to investigate the effects of DHT treatment on skeletal muscle mass, strength, the expression and function of various amino acid transporters, the uptake of isoleucine (Ile) and MeAIB and the incorporation of Ile into proteins.\nIn the third experiment, the acute effects of DHT treatment on force production, amino acid transport and incorporation into proteins in muscle fibre bundles isolated from the edl and soleus of senescent mice will be investigated. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects will also be investigated.\nMost of these experiments will be performed using CD1 mice because they are inexpensive, have similar genetic variations as normal mouse and human populations and suffer from severe sarcopenia from 24 months onwards.\nThe results from these experiments will provide important information on the role a decline in amino acid transport and reduced bioavailability of anabolic steroids, play in sarcopenia. They will also increase our understanding of the changes that occur in skeletal muscle with ageing and the mechanisms underlying these changes. They will also provide information on whether DHT treatment can delay/slow the development of sarcopenia as well as the mechanisms underlying its effects. These findings will be important in the development of new ways of managing sarcopenia in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J01754X/1","grantId":"BB/J01754X/1","fundValue":"379253","fundStart":"2013-03-15","fundEnd":"2016-07-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gabriel  MutungiPenny  Powell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East Anglia","findingsText":" We have spent the first year of this award investigating the effects of age and stress on skeletal muscle strength, protein synthesis and amino acid transport.\nEffects of age on amino acid transporters and protein synthesis\nThe primary aim of our research is to understand why human beings and other animals lose skeletal muscle mass as they get old. This muscle wasting due to old age is called sarcopenia and is a debilitating condition that is characterised by the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. It leads to reduced activity, increased susceptibility to falls and eventually to loss of independence. However, despite its physical and socioeconomic importance, the causes and mechanisms underlying sarcopenia are still poorly understood.\nSkeletal muscle is the main store of proteins in the body. In this study we tested hypothesis that sarcopenia arises from an age-dependent decline in protein synthesis resulting from a failure in the transport of amino acids into and out of skeletal muscle cells. \nTo investigate this, we used small muscle fibre bundles isolated a fast-twitch and a slow-twitch muscle from young (~100 day old) and old (&gt;700 day old) mice. The results from this experiment show that age reduces the rate of protein synthesis in both fast and slow-twitch muscle. However, its effects are greater in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch muscle.\nTo understand the mechanism underlying this age-dependent reduction in protein synthesis, we investigated the effects of age on the concentrations of the two main amino acid transporters in skeletal muscle - sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT) 2 that moves small amino acids into muscles and the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) 2 that takes these small amino acids and exchanges them for the large amino acids used for building muscle proteins. The results from this study revealed that the decrease in protein synthesis with age is accompanied by a corresponding decline in the concentration of these amino acid transporters muscles and again the effects were greater in the fast-twitch than in the slow-twitch muscle.\nCan treating muscle with dihydrotestosterone reverse the effects of age on amino acid transporters and protein synthesis?\nIt is well known that sex steroids are important regulators of body structure, skeletal muscle mass and composition. Recent findings from my laboratory showed that treating small skeletal muscle fibre bundles isolated from young mice with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) but not testosterone increases force production and the uptake of amino acids in the fast-twitch fibres only. These are the fibres lost due to age. Therefore, we hypothesised that DHT may reverse the effects of age on protein synthesis described above. Therefore, in another experiments we treated small muscle fibres isolated from a fast-twitch and a slow-twitch muscle of young and old female mice with physiological concentrations of DHT.\nThe results from this study, some which were recently communicated to The Physiological Society and The European Muscle congress, show that treating the muscle fibre bundles with DHT completely reverses the age-dependent decline in protein synthesis. It is also able to partially reverse the age-dependent decline in the concentration of amino acid transporters found in the muscle cells.\nIn summary, the results we have collected, so far, support our hypothesis that the progressive muscle wasting due to age (sarcopenia) arises from an age-dependent decline in protein synthesis and that this may be due to a decrease in the number of the transporters that move amino acids into muscle cells. They also suggest that dihydrotestosterone is able to reverse the decline in protein synthesis and therefore, may be useful in the management of sarcopenia.\nEffects of stress on skeletal muscle function\nHumans and animals are constantly subjected to stress. To combat stress they release hormones known as glucocortiocoids (GCs). GCs are synthesised from cholesterol and released by cell found in a small gland located just above the kidneys known as adrenal gland. Healthy humans and animals also release small amounts of these hormones in short irregular bursts that peak ~2hrs before the start of the day. GCs are essential for life and affect most tissues in the body including skeletal muscle. Indeed, skeletal muscle is a key player in the stress response as it enables organisms/individuals to evade or to fight the stressor. Despite this, it is surprising how little is known about the physiological functions of GCs in mammalian skeletal muscles. Instead what has been extensively studied and reported are the effects of treating isolated muscles or animals, for long periods, with high doses of GCs (especially dexamethasone) on skeletal muscle function and protein metabolism and their physiological functions have been largely ignored.\nTherefore, in another study we have started to investigate the physiological functions of these hormones in skeletal muscles. To do this, we treated small skeletal muscle fibres isolated from young mice with doses of the synthetic stress hormone, beclomethatsone dipropionate, similar to those found in healthy individuals. The results from this study show that both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle express the receptor mediating the effects of stress hormones (the glucocorticoid receptor, GR). However, its concentration was higher in slow-twitch muscle than in fast twitch muscle. They also show that treating muscle cells with concentrations of stress hormones similar to those found in healthy individuals increases the amount of force developed (strength) by slow-twitch muscle without significantly affecting that developed by the fast-twitch muscle. From these findings we suggest that a little stress may be beneficial to skeletal muscle function especially in slow-twitch muscle cells. The results we have collected, so far, show that suggest that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is able to reverse the age-dependent decline in protein synthesis skeletal muscle and that it may be useful in the management of sarcopenia. Therefore, the next phase of the study is to investigate whether DHT treatment can reverse sarcopenia in a mouse model. Briefly, mice showing mild signs of sarcopenia will be will be assigned, at random, to two groups each consisting of 6 animals. Group 1 will be treated intramuscularly with 1.5-2mgKg 1 DHT dissolved in glycerol once every week for 4 weeks. Group 2 will be treated with the same volume of the vehicle for the same period of time. Blood samples will be collected weekly and assayed for the plasma levels of free DHT. The mice will also be weighed and their grip strength determined weekly. At the end of the experiments, the animals will be sacrificed and the edl and soleus muscles will be isolated and weighed. Small muscle fibre bundles will then be isolated from control and treated muscles. Their force production, amino acid uptake and levels of SNAT2 and LAT2 will be investigated. However, to perform these experiments we need a Home Office licence. We have applied for one and we are currently waiting for the outcome of our application.
