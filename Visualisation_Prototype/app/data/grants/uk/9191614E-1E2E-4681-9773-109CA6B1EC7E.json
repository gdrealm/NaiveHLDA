Speech production is highly variable both across and within speakers. This is partly due to differences in the vocal tract anatomy and partly under the control of the speaker. This project examines whether clearer speakers are more extreme in their articulations (as measured from the acoustic properties of their speech) or whether they are more consistent in their production of speech sounds. In order to better model natural communication, the speech to be analysed is recorded using a new task aimed at eliciting spontaneous dialogue with specific keywords. The first study investigates whether 'inherent' speaker clarity is consistent across different types of discourse and whether speaker clarity is more closely correlated with cross-category differences or within-category consistency in production. The second study investigates whether clearer speakers show a greater degree of adaptation to the needs of listeners. This study has implications for models of speech perception. Understanding what makes a 'clear speaker' will also be informative for applications requiring clear communication, such as teaching, speech and language therapy, and the selection of voices for clinical testing and for speech technology applications.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F002262/1","grantId":"ES/F002262/1","fundValue":"311970","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Access to the LUCID corpus via the OSCAAR archive has been granted to researchers working on speaker-listener interfaces [EU-funded LISTA project, partners from Spain, UK, Sweden, Greece], on the development of automatic speech enhancement algorithms (Styliannou, Crete), on the development of a new HMM-based speech synthesiser [Moore &amp; Nicolao, Sheffield], on research on laughter and nonvocal vocalizations [Truong, Twente University and Trouvain, Saarland University], on the development of an automatic rhythm analyzer [Dellwo, Zurich University], on phonetic accommodation [York Univ.], dysfluencies [University of Malta], amongst others. We are also making heavy use of the LUCID corpus at UCL in MSc and BSc projects to investigate further aspects of the speech interactions [e.g. projects on dysfluencies, repair strategies, gender effects in back-channelling, linguistic simplifications]. \n\nA project on 'active speech modifications' (CI: Styliannou &amp; Hazan), heavily based on our work, was included in a month-long Summer School for PhD students at the Enterface Summer School 2012. This Summer School led to much increased interaction between PhD students working in related fields in many European countries.\n\nAccess to the DiapixUK picture materials has been granted to researchers in automatic speech recognition [e.g., MITRE corporation], in speech sciences [e.g., Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language], in Audiology [e.g. Walter Reed Medical Center] and for adaptation for other languages [e.g. Chung-Ang University, Korea]. \n\nThis project has led to a new project on audiovisual aspects of clear speech, in collaboration with Kim and Davies at University of Western Sydney, Australia (work funded by two 'visiting researcher' grants from UWS), which itself has led to a successful ESRC-funded project grant, which started in August 2014.\n\nBroader academic groups include speech scientists (with interests in production-perception interface, spontaneous speech, speaking styles, speech in adverse conditions, phonetic accommodation), speech technologists, clinical speech researchers (with interests in dysfluencies, speaker-listener interactions).

More specifically, it examined the strategies that adults use to clarify their speech when interacting with interlocutors hearing them in difficult listening conditions. A large set of recordings of spontaneous and read speech was collected for 40 monolingual English speakers. The spontaneous speech was produced while the participant completed 'spot the difference' picture tasks with another participant who was either hearing them normally or via a 'communication barrier' (a simulated cochlear implant, babble noise, or non-native speaker). Acoustic-phonetic measurements were made to investigate what aspects of the speech were enhanced in the different conditions. We found that the strategies used by the speakers were well tailored to counteracting the specific impact of the different communication barriers; this shows that speakers are guided in their speech production by the communicative needs of their interlocutors. Individual speakers did vary both in the inherent clarity of their speech and in the speech enhancement strategies that they used, and the clarity of their speech was correlated across speaking styles. Finally, contrary to expectations, it was not the case that speakers who were more consistent or more extreme in the way in which they produce individual sounds were judged as being particularly clear. Overall, these results support Lindblom's Hyper-Hypo model of speech production, which claims that speech production is guided by listeners' needs, and provide of better understanding of how speakers use the control they have over their speech production to maximise communication effectiveness. The diapixUK materials that we developed for this project could be further developed for clinical use by speech and language therapists. They are appropriate for use with children as well as adults, and a simple measure of transaction time provides a general measure of communication efficiency. The speech that is recorded can be analysed to investigate aspects of communication such as clarification requests, repair strategies, lexical diversity.
