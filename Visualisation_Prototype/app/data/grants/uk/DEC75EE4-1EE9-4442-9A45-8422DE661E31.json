{"id":"DEC75EE4-1EE9-4442-9A45-8422DE661E31","title":"Is perceived colour altered when we move our eyes?","abstractText":"<p>The project investigates the role of eye movements in how colour signals are perceptually experienced. The broad question is why human perceptual experience is so reliable, even though the information sent from the eye to the brain is not. Specifically, why do we normally not perceive the spatial and temporal distortions our visual system introduces (eg inhomogeneity due to macular pigment or colour adaptation), even though their perceptual consequences can be easily demonstrated in the laboratory or lecture theatre?</p>\n\n<p>The hypothesis is that human vision solves this problem by relying not only on sensory inputs to produce perceived colour, but also on the expected consequences of eye movements on sensory inputs. This hypothesis will be investigated using psychophysical methods on human observers while monitoring their eye movements, and also by modelling whether the degree of colour compensation observed is predicted by a compensation mechanism based on life-long perceptual experience for natural objects.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3373","grantId":"RES-000-22-3373","fundValue":"87234","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-09","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They have been used to promote further research and also to inform philosophical debate.
