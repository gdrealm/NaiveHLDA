In substance misuse treatment, one in six males have perpetrated IPV and one in four females are IPV victims, resulting in higher involvement with criminal justice, child protection and mental health services. Few interventions address IPV among this group and those that have been developed are from the US. There is great division over the importance and appropriateness of individual, situational, cultural and societal factors in explaining IPV.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar series will advance our cross-cultural, multidisciplinary understanding about the causes of IPV among substance misusers. Six seminars (three to be held in the UK, one in the US, one in China and one in Australia) will explore the relationship between IPV and substance misuse, the consequences and causes of IPV, and sociological considerations of IPV and substance misuse, including gender and culture. How best to address IPV among substance misusers will be debated by discussing risk and assessment criteria, treatment approaches, novel technologies and public policy. Early career researchers and PhD students will be encouraged and supported to present their work and collaborate on dissemination and research proposal development.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000644/1","grantId":"ES/L000644/1","fundValue":"30365","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The pod/vodcasts are available free to download. It is not yet possible to determine how the findings have been/will be used but the reach has targeted key stakeholders, policy makers, commissioners, practitioners, academics, educators and service users. Therefore we anticipate that the impact will be on policy and public services and that from the attendance and use of pod/vodcasts that the sectors the research has been used in will include healthcare, education and policy.

Six seminars have to be conducted within a 24 month period. To date 3 seminars have been held. The first, Consequences of Substance Misuse and intimate partner violence: An International Epidemiological Perspective was held in London (UK) on Friday 28 March 2014. The second, The role of Substance Misuse in intimate partner violence: Understanding aetiologies, theories and mechanisms, was held in Rochester (USA) on Monday 21 July 2014 and the third was held in Glasgow (UK) on Friday 10 October 2014. Three additional seminars are planned for 2015 in Nottingham (UK), Melbourne (Australia) and Hong Kong (China). Details of the presentations and vod/podcasts can be found here http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/addictions/events/ESRC-Seminar/index.aspx . \nThe following objectives have been met to date as the seminar series has\n1) produced a website to publicise the seminar series to host the live-streaming of all six seminars and disseminate the recorded seminars widely and free of charge\n2)brought together leading national &amp; international addiction &amp; IPV academics &amp; non academics, early career researchers, students, educator practitioners, charities, service users &amp; policy makers to learn from each other in order to identify &amp; address gaps in knowledge, &amp; develop evidence based treatment &amp; policy responses to addressing IPV among substance misusers;\n3) built capacity &amp; capability for ECRs and PhD students by providing opportunities for them to contribute to the presentation of research findings, participate in research seminars, develop collaborative &amp; cross-cultural research proposals \n4) developed &amp; fostered an international cross-cultural community of IPV &amp; substance misuse academics, practitioners &amp; non-academics to identify further research needs &amp; develop research proposals for competitive funding;\n5) which has lead to the development of five collaborative research grant applications (2 successful): \n\nEuropean Research Council-2014-CoG &quot;Project ADVANCE&quot;648485 (internal reference number: SEP-210162502) - unsuccessful\n\nESRC: Research Grant &quot;Alcohol Misuse: Identifying and quantifying the harms to children from different patterns of parental drinking&quot; ES/L015501/1 - unsuccessful\n\nNuffield Foundation &quot;Bridging the evidence gap in family proceedings: Predicting which mothers who drink excessively will achieve and maintain the abstinence required to retain care of their children&quot; ?233,169\n\nKing's-ESRC Studentship &quot;Trauma interventions to support women with experiences of domestic and sexual violence, problematic substance use and psychological distress&quot; - successful\n\nNational Institute for Health Research Programme Grant &quot;REPROVIDE (Reaching Everyone Programme of Research On Violence in diverse Domestic Environments)&quot; RP-PG-0614-10016 - pending. By the end of the seminar series we will have met all of the original objectives (12 months still remaining) including\ndisseminating the outputs from the seminar series via the website, in peer reviewed publications &amp; in briefing reports for\nacademics, practitioners &amp; policy makers;develop &amp; disseminate guidelines for good practice in addressing IPV perpetration &amp; victimisation among substance misusers; and inform policy developments in addressing IPV perpetration &amp; victimisation among substance misusers.
