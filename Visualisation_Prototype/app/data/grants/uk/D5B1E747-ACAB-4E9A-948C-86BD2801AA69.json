{"id":"D5B1E747-ACAB-4E9A-948C-86BD2801AA69","title":"The development of novel and well defined visible-light photocatalytic materials as a vehicle for the transfer of expertise","abstractText":"This project brings together three university based academics with different research expertise. Two of these academics are chemists based in chemistry departments at two different universities, whilst the third is a chemical engineer based in a chemical engineering department at a separate university. The idea is for all the applicants to learn new approaches to their research from the others. To do this, they will work on a project which will develop new catalysts which are able to utilise sunlight to effect chemical changes. This area of research is of potential importance for the clean-up of contaminated water supplies. Some of these catalysts may also be able to directly split the water, producing hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water. As well as increasing the expertise of the researchers, the combination of people with such different backgrounds/approaches may identify new areas of research, or new approaches to be taken to tackle existing problems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E012450/1","grantId":"EP/E012450/1","fundValue":"53987","fundStart":"2006-10-06","fundEnd":"2010-01-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to inform future research directions by the team involved.
