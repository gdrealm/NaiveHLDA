{"id":"57ECB36D-E8C9-4A53-81A3-603F3B2AA044","title":"IDEAS Factory Uncertainty Network","abstractText":"The assessment and decision making processes within environmental, health, and food sectors pose numerous challenges. They require a wide range of sophisticated techniques such as elicitation of expert opinions, scenario development, data collection and analysis, mathematical and physical process modelling, representations of spatial and temporal variability, parameter estimation, and probabilistic inference and forecasting. They also need to communicate effectively to a wide range of stakeholders in an inclusive and transparent manner.The goal of this proposed network is to build on the initial success of the ideas factory and promote continuing collaboration and exchange of research ideas. In particular, we seek to foster the excitement and challenge of being in close proximity to people from other disciplines and realising that skills from one area can help to provide part of the solution to a challenging problem in another field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E017363/1","grantId":"EP/E017363/1","fundValue":"62368","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Christie","coPersons":["Emma Charlotte Soane"],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
