Through collaboration between industry and academia this project will create the dynamic development tools needed by system designers in order to realise their products competitively using such complex System-on-Chips, whilst achieving the levels of integrity and reliability needed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500952/1","grantId":"EP/I500952/1","fundValue":"100748","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Klaus D  McDonald-Maier","coPersons":["Andrew Brian Hopkins"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" The ADS-SoC EPSRC Collaboration Fund project has, as originally planned, expedited both the technical and commercial programme, and created a dedicated prototype for adaptive application systems development tools for use in high integrity and reliability environments. The specific focus of the project was to utilize the previously researched adaptive development support technology for sensor networks, and based on the interactive collaboration with the project partners Rolls-Royce and Delphi, create a dedicated prototype suited for automotive and aerospace applications. This novel technology platform has combined the highly novel innovations made by the preceding research project (resource efficient monitoring, dynamic adaptation and synchronous tracing) and tailored these to the specific needs of automotive and aerospace applications and markets. The commercial programme has, as anticipated, been effectively facilitated through the collaboration with Rolls-Royce and Delphi, who have introduced us to their supply chain, so that they can benefit from the technology. Consequently, the team was able to establish relationships with several key automotive suppliers and a further major automotive control systems integrator (all under NDA) and showcase the technology. This was generally very well received and we are currently identifying mechanisms to allow a closer in house evaluation of the technology as a precursor before adoption with several of these suppliers. The team is continuing to expedite exploitation moving forwards. The primary objective of this project was to assist in commercialising the technology created by our past EPSRC funded research on wireless sensor network architectures at Essex by directing it towards automotive and aerospace markets. Our adaptive development support facilitates have shown to speed up development of applications in advanced and complex systems while achieving a higher degree of integrity, which is especially important for automotive and aerospace industries. The collaboration with Rolls-Royce and Delphi has clearly been focused to create a development support solution that properly meets their needs and therefore those of the wider industry. The core exploitation route for the technology is through licensing to automotive semiconductor vendors. The market for advanced development support has a value-chain where the systems design houses (end-users such as Delphi and Rolls-Royce) are the source of revenues and mandate their requirements for development support to the SoC vendors that supply them. The SoC vendors then design or license IP in order to fulfill the end-user's requirements. Particularly high-volume manufacturers like Delphi are extremely influential as they sell hundreds of millions of units, and this has greatly assisted in establishing the relationships with the automotive silicon suppliers, and will continue to aid the licensing process moving forward.
