Using the Mouse as a model system in combination with cellular and biochemical techniques, we wish to capitalise on our findings that have highlighted the ivolvement of a protein called dynein in this disease to determine how impairment of this protein delays the onset and progression of ALS. We will publish our data in scientific journals for other scientist, and present our results in national and international meetings as well as in the symposia and seminars held at regular basis at the Life Sciences and Medical Schools in The University of Sussex. The university has several strategies in place for the engagement of the general public in its research activities. These range from the publication of research findings on publicly available websites and newsletters as well as mechanisms for the release of information to the local and national press. In addition there are opportunities for the discussion of science policy and research with teachers and the general public during University open days and during visits to and from local schools. I appreciate the importance of the wider engagement of the public in science as a whole and will provide all support for the University?s efforts in these activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500865","grantId":"G0500865","fundValue":"366447","fundStart":"2006-09-06","fundEnd":"2009-09-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Majid  Hafezparast","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
