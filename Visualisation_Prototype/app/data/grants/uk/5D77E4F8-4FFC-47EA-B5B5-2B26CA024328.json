The question I am addressing is whether the early Christians expected the end of the world (in the sense of the dissolution of the cosmos), and if so, what impact this expectation had on their world-views and social ethics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112573/1","grantId":"112573/1","fundValue":"11476","fundStart":"2006-01-02","fundEnd":"2006-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Edward  Adams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
