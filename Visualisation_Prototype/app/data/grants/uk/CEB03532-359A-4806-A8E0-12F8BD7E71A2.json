{"id":"CEB03532-359A-4806-A8E0-12F8BD7E71A2","title":"Biographical and source studies of Olivier Messiaen and Claire Delbos","abstractText":"During research for our biography of Messiaen (now delivered) we identified many documents which it was impossible to include, and the whereabouts of further important sources. Our proposal has three strands which emerge from work on the biography: 1) a source book of documents and letters; 2) a study of Messiaen and his first wife Claire Delbos including the first serious evaluation of Delbos's music; 3) Messiaen's birdsong cahiers and their relationship to Oiseaux exotiaues. All three have outcomes (books) which we would expect to deliver by the end of the period for which we are applying for funding.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119156/1","grantId":"119156/1","fundValue":"40715","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"P  Hill","coPersons":["Nigel  Simeone"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
