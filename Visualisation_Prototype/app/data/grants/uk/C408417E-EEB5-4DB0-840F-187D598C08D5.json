It will make use of the fact that a single dipole (a single atom...) emits only one photon pair per excitation cycle. The emitter under study will be a single quantum dot. The which path information contained in the energy of the emitted photons usually observed in quantum dots, will be erased by control of the nanostructure growth, application of a magnetic or electric field, or use of cavity effect. Quantum dots will be inserted in appropriate microresonators in order to efficiently collect the emitted photon pairs. High collection efficiencies together with the deterministic nature of the emission will result in a highly useful source for quantum communications. The project brings together partners with unique experience who have already achieved major breakthroughs in this field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E058019/1","grantId":"EP/E058019/1","fundValue":"140808","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Ritchie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" We have developed entangled-photon sources for quantum coimmunications.
