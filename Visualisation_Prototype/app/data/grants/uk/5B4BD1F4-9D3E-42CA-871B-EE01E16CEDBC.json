{"id":"5B4BD1F4-9D3E-42CA-871B-EE01E16CEDBC","title":"The emergence of Hausa identity: religion and history","abstractText":"Today the Hausa number 24 million people living in Niger and Nigeria, with a further 15 million throughout West Africa speaking Hausa as a second language. Despite the historical and cultural prominence of the group, there is little agreement on the development of Hausa social and political organisation. The proposed workshops are based on two premises:\\n\\n1.Religion is key to understanding the evolution of Hausa ethnicity in West Africa.\\n\\n2.Due to the scarcity of written records on the early history of the Hausa, new work must rely on an interdisciplinary approach. \\n\\nOur workshops will advance current knowledge of Hausa history and explore changes in the notion of Hausa ethnic identity by bringing together the contributions of scholars from different disciplines. Together we shall consider historical texts, archaeological remains, social customs, and language change, focusing on the central themes of religion and identity. \\n\\nHistorically, the Hausa heartland of northern Nigeria and southern Niger was divided into separate 'city-states,' which exhibited distinct social and cultural traits. Outside this area, the Hausa became known and influential in the entire sub-region due to their traditional association with manufacture and trade. The recent history of the Hausa has been characterised by a great degree of change, especially in terms of religious identity. It is known that the first Hausa people were pagan, but Islam played an increasing role in society over time. A local historical text, the Kano Chronicle, suggests that traders and missionaries from the West brought Islam to some of the Hausa cities in the fourteenth century, but influences from the east, where some elites had converted to Islam in the eleventh century, must have also been important. The number of individuals who accepted Islam was probably small at first, and traditional religious beliefs and practices continued to exist. But by the fifteenth century Hausa cities were linked to the Islamic world system, and in the nineteenth century Hausaland became integrated, through conquest in the course of a holy war (jihad), within an Islamic government known as the Sokoto Caliphate. Written records shed some light on the last 200 years, documenting changes brought on by movements of Islamic reform and conversion, and certainly in the past century being Hausa has been seen as synonymous with being Muslim. However, many Hausa groups still engage in Animist rituals and beliefs, and some minorities have recently embraced Christianity. Syncretism, the merging of religions, has in fact probably been a characteristic feature of Hausa society for centuries. It has recurrently been challenged by waves of reformism, and the recent radicalisation of certain interpretations of Islam is threatening the capacity of Hausa people to retain different religious practices in a climate of tolerance and respect for religious diversity.\\n\\nThe workshops will advance knowledge of an important West African society by assessing how people's sense of identity ('being Hausa') has changed over time, and what the impact of Islam has been. We will publish our findings in a volume which will not only contribute to Hausa studies, but will also put forward hypotheses applicable to other parts of West Africa and the world. Today, religion plays a major role in defining, and often dividing, communities. Our workshops will challenge increasing religious intolerance by focusing on the historical roots of religious pluralism, syncretism, and the peaceful integration of creeds in West African society. We aim in this way to advance existing understandings of African history and society, and thereby benefit both specialists and the wider public.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F007019/1","grantId":"AH/F007019/1","fundValue":"12198","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The network has led to a landmark publication in Hausa studies featuring papers by participants entitled Being and Becoming Hausa published by Brill in 2010, which has become the fourth bestselling volume in their African Social Studies series.\nThe project was reported in the African Studies Association UK newsletter \nhttp://www.asauk.net/downloads/newsletters/08/asauknews_oct08.pdf and on the Religion and Society website http://www.religionandsociety.org.uk/research_findings/featured_findings/being_and_becoming_hausa_is_not_straightforward\nIt also generated follow-on funding from the AHRC/ESRC as part of the 'Youth impact' scheme. It followed up with schoolchildren in Norwich, UK, and Zinder, Niger, West Africa, the problem of negative media representations of West Africa, and the problems of stereotyping generally. This generated resource materials for teachers on https://sites.google.com/site/depictingafrica/. The site's aim is to bring to a wider audience the activities of our project. Through its cross-curricular slant linked into Key Stage 3 of the recently revised National Curriculum, the resource can support UK schools in implementing an integrated project which will enable students to make links between different subject areas. The site was discussed in the Times Educational Supplement and by the London School of Economics Public Policy Group. \nAs this project gained momentum, it brought in unplanned participants. The UEA languages department sent an observer in relation with their ongoing project 'Norwich - City of Interculture', while the UEA Outreach office became involved in the sessions held on campus, deploying student ambassadors to talk to the City Academy pupils and to encourage them to consider university application in due course.

From the fifteenth century onwards, the vast town walls, the network of trade links and the manufacturing activities of the Hausa cities was a source of wonder to external observers. But despite the historical and cultural prominence of the group, there is little agreement on the development of Hausa social and political organisation. We therefore organised two workshops aimed at advancing these questions. They took as a basic premise that religion is key to understanding the evolution of Hausa identity, and used an interdisciplinary approach to unlock new insights on the subject. \n\nHistorically, the Hausa heartland of northern Nigeria and southern Niger was split into separate 'city-states,' which exhibited distinct social and cultural traits. Outside this area, the Hausa became known and influential in all of West Africa and beyond for their manufacture and trade. The recent history of the Hausa has been characterised by a great degree of change, especially in terms of religious identity. It is known that the first Hausa people were pagan, but Islam (perhaps filtering through traders) played an increasing role in society over time. The number of individuals who accepted Islam was probably small at first, and traditional religious beliefs and practices continued to exist. But by the fifteenth century Hausa cities were linked to the Islamic world system, and in the nineteenth century Hausaland became integrated, through conquest in the course of a holy war (jihad), within an Islamic government known as the Sokoto Caliphate. Written records shed some light on the last 200 years, documenting changes brought on by movements of Islamic reform and conversion, and certainly in the past century being Hausa has been seen as synonymous with being Muslim. However, many Hausa groups still engage in Animist rituals and beliefs, and some minorities have recently converted to Christianity. The merging of religions has probably been characteristic of Hausa society for centuries - as has, apparently, a climate of tolerance and respect for religious diversity.\n\nWith the above issues in mind, our workshops brought together scholars from different disciplines for two meetings (July 2008, Norwich; November 2008, Liverpool). In the course of these workshops, we considered historical, anthropological, archaeological, museological, economic and linguistic evidence to assess how people's sense 'being Hausa' has changed over time, and what has been the impact of Islam. \n\nThe substantially edited and peer-reviewed papers generated a book, 'Being and becoming Hausa: interdisciplinary perspectives' (Brill 2010). The book inscribes itself in a wider critical engagement with the changing relevance of ethnicity in Africa, taking the bold move of addressing this question from a multidisciplinary and diachronic perspective. It thus confronts long unanswered dilemmas of Hausa history, and enables contributors to think reflexively about the role of disciplinary conceptual frameworks in shaping research. This project led to a follow-on Impact project (funded by the Religion and Society Programme). The PI led a session in a local secondary school, in collaboration with a Year 7 teacher there, aiming to challenge pupils' stereotypes of Africa. We organised a skype exchange with a school in Niger. A resulting website was launched, now reported by Times Educational Supplement and the London School of Economics Public Policy Group.
