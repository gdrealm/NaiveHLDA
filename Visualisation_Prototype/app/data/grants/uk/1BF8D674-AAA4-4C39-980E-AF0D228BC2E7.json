{"id":"1BF8D674-AAA4-4C39-980E-AF0D228BC2E7","title":"Republic of the Moon","abstractText":"1. To organise the Arts Catalyst exhibition Republic of the Moon in London, which had a highly successful showing in Liverpool in 2011, together with a dynamic new art/science events programme, aimed at exciting interest in contemporary lunar science and provoking discussion around future exploration of the Moon. The programme will reach a wide public audience who may not generally connect with science communication.\n\n2. The Republic of the Moon exhibition features works by international established artists from the UK, Russia, USA, Spain and Germany. It aims to re-position lunar exploration as a cultural fascination. It will create a conversation about our personal relationship with the Moon in the era of advanced science and a new space age, in which robotic landers on the Moon are being planned both by private companies and emerging space nations, such as China and India. The search for lunar ice in the dark craters of the Southern hemisphere leads to speculation about future human missions to the Moon.\n\n3. The exhibition will be accompanied by a dynamic events programme, which will include art/science talks, films, performances and workshops. The programme is being developed in collaboration with Dr Lucie Green (Mullard Space Sciences Lab, UCL) and Dr Ian Crawford (Birkbeck College and the Centre for Planetary Sciences), and will also feature contributions from Dr Kevin Fong (UCL and the Centre for Planetary Sciences) and Dr Bernard Foing (International Lunar Exploration Working Group, European Space Agency, tbc).\n\n4. The ideas and issues raised by Republic of the Moon will be documented on video (livestreamed and embedded in a website) and through an illustrated publication, which will featured commissioned essays by science, space and arts writers, which will be available in both print form and a variety of e-formats, as well as on the website.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001659/1","grantId":"ST/L001659/1","fundValue":"9660","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Nicola  Triscott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Arts Catalyst","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
