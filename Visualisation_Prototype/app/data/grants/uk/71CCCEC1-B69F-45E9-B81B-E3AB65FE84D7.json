{"id":"71CCCEC1-B69F-45E9-B81B-E3AB65FE84D7","title":"Globalisation, the 'academy' system and the migration of football labour in Ghana and baseball labour in the Dominican Republic","abstractText":"<p>The broad aim of this study is to undertake an empirically rich, theoretically sophisticated and comparative analysis of sports labour migration in professional football (soccer) and baseball. More specifically, the study seeks to analyse and compare the mechanics of labour migration in these sports with a particular focus on the role of academies in facilitating the transit of athletic talent from Ghana and the Dominican Republic to Europe and the USA respectively. The study will adopt a novel theoretical framework rooted within wider debates on globalisation and global development. The two primary sites for this project are the Red Sox Academy in El Toro in the Dominican Republic, run by the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise the Boston Red Sox and the Fetteh Feyenoord football academy in Ghana, managed by the Dutch professional football club Feyenoord. The methodology for this study is ethnographic in nature and will involve a combination of observations, structured and semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews in each research setting. The project also employs a longitudinal approach which assesses the development of the academy and the progress of a sample of athletes through each academy over a 2 year period. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F030185/1","grantId":"ES/F030185/1","fundValue":"71940","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Darby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Ulster","findingsText":" The findings of the project are both empirical and theoretical. The outputs to date have focused on addressing a series of predominantly empirical questions. Historical trends in the migration of Ghanaian football labour have been charted. The geographical patterning of these migrations have been accounted for. The push/pull dynamics underpinning these patterns have been uncovered with a focus on explaining the ways in which local conditions (social, economic, cultural, football related) have given rise to a pervasive desire on the part of aspiring professional football players to leave Ghana. The experiences of recruits to academies have also been outlined. The published outputs have also analysed the emergence of a ‘system’ of football academies in Ghana and this reveals considerable diversity in the types of academies that exist in the country. These range from foreign (European) owned; Ghanaian owned; philanthropic/charitable foundations; ad hoc, improvised academies that operate in Ghanaian football’s ‘informal economy’. The impact of academies on Ghanaian football and society has also been explored, revealing heterogeneous impacts. \n\n\n\nThis empirical work has laid the foundations for a series of more theoretically oriented publications that are in preparation and planned. The empirical findings emerging from the project have been placed in an interdisciplinary theoretical framework (sociology of development/economic geography) that fuses Global Value Chain and Global Production Network (GPN) analyses of globalisation. The value of such an approach is both heuristic and analytical. It allows the structural features of football labour production in Ghana to be detailed, outlines the local, national and international contexts within which these features are embedded and maps the geography of the trade and how labour is distributed within the global football industry. Analytically, this approach avoids monolithic conceptualisations of power seen in many approaches to globalisation and offers significant promise in accounting for the ways in which the trade is both extractive, serving the interests of entities based in the developed world and at the same time, allows value to be accrued to a range of actors and stakeholders located in the developing world. The GPN approach to governance is particularly important in this latter regard and applied to the trade in Ghanaian football labour, it helps to demonstrate that power relations between local Ghanaian interests and global or at least European, sports entities are complex, multi-directional and manifest themselves in heterogeneous ways. This is not to suggest that Ghanaian football actors compete on an equal footing with their European counterparts and indeed, the power calculus within the trade in football labour remains skewed in favour of the latter. However, the insertion of Ghanaian’s into key labour producing nodes in the trade and the emergence of ethical approaches to producing prospective football exports is evidence of less asymmetrical globalisation.\n\n\n\nThe project findings also reveal similarities in the functioning of academies in Dominican baseball and Ghanaian football and in the transit of sports labour to the United States and Europe more generally. In our separate work on Dominican baseball and Ghanaian football academies, Klein and I are both employing the theoretical framework outlined above. The project will elicit comparative co-authored output in the near future. It is anticipated that the findings of the project will continue to be publicly disseminated via the media and will continue to inform the development goals of the Right to Dream Academy and the Tamale Utrecht Football Academy. It is possible that the research may also contribute to or inform policy in terms of the regulation of football academies and/or sports labour igration more generally. The project has been useful in deepening public awareness and understanding of the migration of Ghanaian (and African) football labour to Europe. Selected findings of the project have been publicly disseminated through a number of media channels including Der Spiegel International (Germany), 6 April 2010: BBC World Service (UK), January 2010; NBC Sports (US), 2 December 2009; Radio 2000 (South Africa), 18 November 2009; Africa Past and Present podcast (US), 11 March 2009; Radio 4 (UK), 13 January 2008.\n\n\n\nThis project was not aimed at making policy based interventions/impacts on sports labour migration. However, it has the capacity to influence and impact upon the production and distribution of football labour in the Ghanaian context. For example, in January 2011 I was invited to join the European Growth Forum of a prominent Ghanaian football academy (Right to Dream). This academy is a registered charity (No. 1108821) and seeks to use football to empower underprivileged children. The growth forum (and my contribution) is oriented around building on the developmental impact and reach of the academy in Ghana. Aspects of my published work and discussions with staff have also informed the philosophy of a recently established academy in Northern Ghana (Tamale Utrecht Football Academy).
