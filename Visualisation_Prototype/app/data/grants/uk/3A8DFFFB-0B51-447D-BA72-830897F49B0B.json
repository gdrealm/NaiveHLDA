{"id":"3A8DFFFB-0B51-447D-BA72-830897F49B0B","title":"Footwork - The Walking Artists Network as Mobile Community","abstractText":"This network will bring together researchers from a range of disciplines to explore the social and cultural function(s) of walking as a dialogic, investigative and performative mode of art practice. It will extend discussion of walking art as a medium with potential to interact with and inform a range of disciplinary perspectives in relation to notions of site, place, participation, mobility, communities, environment and histories. It seeks to build a community of practice - from peers within the realms of art and academe with an interest in walking as an artistic and interrogatory practice, to those communities who utilise walking in social and cultural forms (ramblers, strollers) as research (environmentalists, naturalists, archaeologists) and sport (mountaineers, speed-walkers) and merely as a mode of getting from A-B (commuters). \n\nIn the last five to ten years walking has emerged and evolved as an art practice and medium that is used across the visual and performing arts. Conferences, symposia and other events that touch upon walking as a mode of art practice have brought walking artists and researchers together and continued to highlight the diverse practices, forms and methodologies that might be defined as walking art. New publications too have appeared that work to develop and extend this discourse. However it is still a very new field, and the research questions that the network seeks to ask, alongside the aim to connect practitioners and researchers across disciplines, will serve to develop further understanding and exchange.\n\nBy engaging participants from a range of disciplines the network seeks to rapidly progress knowledge and understanding of the range and nature of practices using walking, and the theoretical standpoints that inform them. Cross fertilisation of ideas, and transfer of knowledge in this area is envisaged on a number of levels - through the sharing of research methods, approaches and forms of working.\n\nIn practical terms the network will encompass academia and practice, from a broad range of visual and performing arts areas. A series of meetings (4) over a period of 24 months will be held. A core research group of 12-15 participants will be formed by invitation. An additional open call for participants will be made, using academic and practice-focused channels, for walking art 'laboratories' to be held alongside the 'Sideways' festival of walking in Belgium in August 2012, and alongside the Lincolnshire Wolds Walking Festival in June 2013. An online presence for the network will act as a repository for documentation of the workshop series as well as providing for remote participation both nationally and internationally.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J013765/1","grantId":"AH/J013765/1","fundValue":"35227","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare  QualmannMark  Hunter","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of East London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
