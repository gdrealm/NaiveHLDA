{"id":"48F60889-3F64-42CC-B3A0-1ED4BF95A538","title":"Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Edinburgh","abstractText":"Our proposed programme is based upon two complementary threads: - Studies of the physics of the b quark carried out with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II electron-positron collider, and with the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurements of CP violating matter-antimatter asymmetries in b decays determine parameters of the Standard Model in the quark flavour sector. Measurements of rare b to s quark decay modes may be sensitive to couplings to new physics beyond the Standard Model. - Future precision measurements of electroweak symmetry breaking at an International Linear Collider. This will include measurements of the couplings of the Higgs boson, and of any new particles that may be produced at this energy scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E00038X/1","grantId":"PP/E00038X/1","fundValue":"1840250","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Playfer","coPersons":["Peter  Clarke","Victoria Jane Martin","Franz  Muheim","Philip  Clark","Alan  Walker"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
