Visitors are essential to our expanding programme. New ideas, new models and computer simulations, and new data analysis techniques are being developed in studies of our Sun, the Solar System, the birth of stars and the behaviour of stars. A stream of visitors generates extra vitality to the astrophysical discussions, accelerates the output and quality of publications, improves the numerical, analytical and data analysis techniques we use and increases the number of national and international collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E002242/1","grantId":"PP/E002242/1","fundValue":"12654","fundStart":"2007-07-03","fundEnd":"2010-07-02","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  The results of the research carried out as part of this project has enhanced the UK creative output, raised the profile of UK cutting-edge science and maximised the return of the country's \ninvestment into basic research and in particular research into astronomy and related sciences.

The research output, as measured by our journal publications, reflects the high number of quality projects being undertaken within several fields.\nInvitations to our many collaborators have helped us maintain our success in established areas which include solar system studies, interpretation of our Sun and other cool stars, star formation, stellar evolution, numerical astrophysics and galactic astronomy. \nThe recruitment of additional senior staff during 2006-07 (Vink, Ramsay, Bagnulo) resulted in more efficient use of this grant, in terms of number or visits (39 vs 28 in 2004-07 as well as refereed journal publications (40 vs 23 in 2004-07; see Section 6). The recruitment of Dr Ramsay, in particular, opened the door to collaborations in Galactic Astronomy. The Obser- vatory's attractiveness to research visitors benefitted further from the residence of a Leverhume Visiting Fellow, Prof John Landstreet (U. Western Ontario, Canada), for 7 months in 2009 \nIt is important to note that some of the publications reported in Section 6 partly resulted from visits by the same individuals during the period of the previous visitor grant which had not been published or in press by the time that the report for that grant was due. This emphasises the strategic nature of many of our collaborations, which are now bearing fruit due to continuing funding support from STFC. Due to the Observatory's relative geographical isolation\nand the multidisciplinary nature of its research, a continuing flow of visitors is an important factor in maintaining the high quality of our research output.\nTherefore we aim for a continuation of our visitor\nprogramme by means of a new STFC grant application.
