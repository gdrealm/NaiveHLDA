{"id":"EEA23B0A-D948-46FF-B7A3-17B6DC9B98E9","title":"Enhancing Powder Technology Research Cooperation Between De Montfort University and Scandinavian Institutions","abstractText":"Powder caking, where particles stick together to form lumps, is an unwelcome phenomenon which reduces the quality of powdered products and makes handling, storage and processing problematic. This is particularly a problem in tropical climates where many emerging markets are based. The main method of combating this is to use anti-caking agents, small particles of chemicals which reduce moisture mobility or provide a barrier between the larger particles, as is often the case in food processing. However, this remedy is not always suitable and there is a trend away from this towards using ingredients that are designed to be caking resistant. This can be done by examining how the surface properties change in warm and humid conditions. Dr Leaper has already examined how this method can be used with an EPSRC First grant &quot;Novel Analysis of Particulate Materials&quot; EP/GO/16442/1. This proposal will fund visits to academic and industrial partners in Scandinavia to construct a consortium to apply for European Funding to continue this work.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J00667X/1","grantId":"EP/J00667X/1","fundValue":"9119","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The exchange of ideas has led to a joint proposal submission to the Norwegian Funding Council.
