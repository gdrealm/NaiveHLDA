These advances will only be realised if concentrated international effort is made and the 'best' minds, facilities and equipment are brought together to tackle this global challenge. In order to tackle global greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary and important to develop collaborations between developed countries and developing/emerging economic countries, such as China, to help them control and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and their rapidly increasing energy consumption. In 2010, China became the 2nd largest global economy and also overtook the US in terms of energy use and greenhouse gas emitter (approx. 20% global final energy consumption). The projection is for this to continue to grow and this is a concern not only China but to the UK and the rest of the world. Over the last few decades China has acknowledge that this situation is not sustainable and they have invested heavily to make a step change in their capability in clean energy related research and taking significant measures to address security of supply. Large investment has been made in their research intensive universities and national institutes resulting in the development of internationally leading research groups with some of the best facilities and equipment now in place. \nCollaboration and research engagement between the China and the UK is strategically important and mutually beneficial.\n\nThe Sustainable Energy through China-UK Research Engagement (SECURE) project will research innovative sustainable energy solutions to address these challenges and will bring together collaborating teams of international researchers with significant experience and expertise in a wide range of complimentary disciplines spanning engineering, physical science and social science. This will be achieved by strengthening existing research collaborations and also building new engagement activities between the Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research (SWAN) and a number of leading researchers and centres of excellence in China. In engagement terms, the objective is to foster long-term collaboration between outstanding research teams in the UK and China and to ensure there is a two way transfer of knowledge during the project. The aim is to coordinate targeted research and engagement addressing a number of important challenge themes building on exceptional capability. The specific objectives of the project will be to coordinate 10 research teams, brought together from the best research groups in SWAN with those from a limited number of outstanding research groups in China.\n\nEnhanced research engagement between SWAN and the collaborating Institutions in China will be achieved through a series of research activities supported by workshops, and networking activities such as staff, postdoctoral and student exchanges. This engagement will be managed thematically and involve activities formulated to address specific research challenges facing secure, clean and efficient energy conversion and use.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K004689/1","grantId":"EP/K004689/1","fundValue":"483547","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The GLOBAL SECURE project has significantly strengthened existing collaborations and built new engagement activities between the Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research (SWAN) and a number of leading researchers in China.

The international engagement brought together collaborating teams of researchers with significant experience and expertise in a wide range of complimentary disciplines spanning engineering, physical science and social science through the strengthening of existing collaborations and the building of new engagement activities between the Sir Joseph Swan Centre for Energy Research (SWAN) and a number of leading researchers and centres of excellence in China. This engagement has enhanced existing UK-China research relationships, built new links and strengthened the competitiveness of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the UK and China. \n\n\n\nResearch was conducted around 12 technical themes:\n\n\n\nTrigeneration with integrated energy storage and biofuel use\n\nCO2 capture and H2 production\n\nLow grade heat driven cogeneration of power and cooling\n\nIntegration of renewable energy systems and power optimisation for ships\n\nAdvanced aero and hydrodynamics for sail assisted ship propulsion\n\nThermal energy management in processing industries\n\nEnergy reduction in waste treatment\n\nEnergy reduction in road transport \n\nAdvanced hydrodynamics, simulation and operation for improved marine transport efficiency\n\nSustainable Retrofitting\n\nEnergy reduction through promoting sustainable living\n\nOptimal management of water resources and flood risk for hydropower generation\n\n\n\n\n\nNew knowledge was produced and disseminated through the following: \n\n\n\n- Publication of ten (10) journal papers (1 published, 4 submitted under review, 5 under preparation)\n\n- Final project dissemination seminar, held in Beijing, attended by all theme leaders (UK and China) to audience including academics, industrialists, researchers and policymakers\n\n- Number of visits by Chinese and UK academics/researchers to partner organisations\n\n- Significant number of dissemination/communication events (seminars, conferences, workshops, posters, presentations, press/radio/television interviews) by UK and Chinese researchers to a variety of audiences including general public, researchers, industry and policymakers\n\n- Funding award for a joint project between Newcastle and Shanghai Jiaotong University from the Shanghai Government\n\n- Preparation of further funding proposals to both UK, European and Chinese funders\n\n- Establishment of a joint UK/China PhD programme \n\n- Patent application\n\n- Testing of the prototype for the EPSRC funded project LH Cogen (EP/I027904/1) The focus of the project has been to disseminate high quality research and support knowledge transfer to all interested stakeholders. This has been achieved through the routes outlined above and there has been significant engagement with a range of organisations including industry and government bodies (local and national) particularly through seminars, workshops, press/radio/television interviews, training programmes and the project website. The project focuses on supporting the exploitation of research to other researchers, industry and stakeholders through the wide variety of pathways as described above. The substantial collaboration in this project has maximised the exploitation opportunities in both the UK and China. In one specific Theme, the work has resulted in a patent application. A number of themes have produced joint journal papers and developed new proposals for funding (several already awarded). Several themes have also engaged closely with industry in order to disseminate their research findings and testing of an equipment prototype has also been undertaken. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
