At present pharmacological approaches show only a limited success in the treatment of most neurological conditions. The use of stem cells (an immature type of cell with the potential to differentiate into all types of cells in a human body) for transplantation into the damaged brain hold immense potential to restore behaviour and reduced quality of life following neurodegeneration. However, no satisfactory objective method currently exists to directly monitor stem cell therapy. Therefore, monitoring of stem cell therapy is of utmost importance in our evaluation of the survival of these transplanted cells and to foster our understanding of how these cells actually promote recovery. Our laboratory has described a new, non-invasive method involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to repeatedly follow the survival and migration of stem cells in the living brain. We propose to further develop and use such methods to study how stem cells integrate into the damaged brain and to examine if these transplants differentiate into the appropriate types of cells necessary to facilitate recontruction and recovery. The development of these methods is vital to promote a safe and rational application of stem cell therapy in a clinical setting.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802552","grantId":"G0802552","fundValue":"268384","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michel  Modo","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
