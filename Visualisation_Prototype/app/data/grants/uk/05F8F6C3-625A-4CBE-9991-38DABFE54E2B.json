This protein is a molecular motor involved in a range of cellular processes including chromosome segregation during cell division and transport of organelles and trophic factors. Recently we identified a mutation in the heavy chain subunit of cytoplasmic dynein in a mouse mutant called legs at odd angles (Loa). This mutation causes death of a group of neurones called motor neurones, which control muscle movement [Hafezparast et al 2003, Science, 300:808]. The molecular mechanisms of motor neurone death caused by the mutation in dynein is not known. We hypothesise that the Loa mutation interrupts protein-protein interactions within the dynein complex. In order to test this hypothesis, we wish to utilise the Loa mouse as a model system and use a set of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological tools to determine these mechanisms. The data generated in this study will further our understanding of some aspects of axonal transport and its role in motor neuron maintenance and survival.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D012309/1","grantId":"BB/D012309/1","fundValue":"211117","fundStart":"2006-06-12","fundEnd":"2009-06-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Majid  Hafezparast","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":" Our research established that the Legs at angles (Loa) mutation impairs the assembly of cytoplasmic dynein motor protein and its interaction with dynactin, leading to neurodegeneration. Moreover, we showed that in heterozygous state this mutation ameliorates toxic effects of mutant SOD1 protein in a transgenic mouse model for motor neuron disease. These data could contribute towards understanding and treating of neurodegenerative diseases in which retrograde axonal transport has a role in their pathogenesis.
