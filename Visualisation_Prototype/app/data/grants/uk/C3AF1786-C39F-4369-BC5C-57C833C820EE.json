NMR spectroscopy is a technique that underpins nearly all apects of modern chemical analysis - from biological through materials to synthetic studies. It allows the elucidation of composition, structure and motion in chemical samples, leading to a fundamental understanding of molecular characteristics in these nano-scale systems. For example the School of Chemistry applies this technique to analysis of complex biologically active compounds isolated from natural sources, products of interest to the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries, new materials relevant to nanoscience, biotechnology, monitoring complex chemical reactions, elucidation of novel structures produced in chemical synthesis and complex chemical catalysis. To these ends, NMR spectroscopy underpins the work of over 250 research workers, with national and international links to a range of academic and industrial applications. The NMR Facility within the School of Chemistry at Bristol University currently employs 5 instruments ranging from 7-23 years old with resolutions of 270-400MHz to conduct such chemical analysis. The increasing requirements of the high-level research undertaken in the School demand access to resolutions and sensitivity from fields &gt;400MHz.The new instrument requested in the proposal will facilitate new and cutting edge developments in a number of areas as well as ensuring support for current levels of research in the School.The new 500 MHz machine will enable the study of of metabolic products, catalyst mechanisms, natural product structures, functional polymers, protein dynamics, ion-sensors and an array of other materials at down to microgram levels which hitherto have been inaccessible to the researchers in the School.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F013515/1","grantId":"EP/F013515/1","fundValue":"555530","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas James Simpson","coPersons":["Matthew  Crump","Kevin Iain Booker-Milburn","Craig Philip Butts"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
