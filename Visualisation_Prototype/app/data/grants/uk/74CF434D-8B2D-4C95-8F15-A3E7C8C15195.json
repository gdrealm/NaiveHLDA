Ideally, such tools should be non-invasive with a capacity for separation several orders of magnitude beyond current methods. Industrial systems for the purification of therapeutic proteins provide precedents for large scale bioprocessing. To date, the vast majority of these have focused on column chromatography to achieve desired levels of purity. However, the size, sensitivity and complexity of cells present particular challenges to the downstream engineer which are unlikely to be solved by any further evolution or modification of traditional column chromatographic techniques. Consequently, novel techniques are needed. This proposal intends to develop a novel, simple, scalable and commercially useful technique for the separation/purification of human stem cells irrespective of their tissue of origin. This will be achieved by using Atomic Force Microscopy to define the topography and electrical charge distribution on the surfaces of human embryonic and adult haematopoietic stem cells followed by the use of this information in computational models to design complimentary surfaces. Surface prototypes will then be used in small-scale experimental work with living cells to demonstrate their ability to reversibly bind and separate cells and their subsequent viability. By focusing on both charge and topography of stem cell-surfaces the project will produce an adsorption-based separation technology more specifically suited for cell purification than current chromatographic techniques. The use of both adult and embryonic stem cell populations will exemplify the utility of this technology to both current and future clinical and research applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G010374/1","grantId":"BB/G010374/1","fundValue":"309914","fundStart":"2009-06-11","fundEnd":"2012-09-10","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The emergence of therapies derived from stem cells requires a new direction in separation techniques to assist scale-up and fully realise societal impact.

In the first instance this is based on the greater elasticity of the former. This was discovered following mapping of cell surfaces by atomic force microscopy (AFM). This also revealed that hES cells have a more positive surface charge, providing a second modality for separation.\n \nWe have created transparent femtosecond laser-etched multichannel devices for proof-of-principle demonstration. This method offers extremely high levels of control over channel size and flow characteristics and clear imaging of cell separation behaviour. Specific channel sizes permit deformable (pluripotent hES) cells to pass through while more stiff (differentiated) cells are excluded. \n\nWe have developed scalable membrane separation devices from this proof of principle and demonstrated their capability to process 10^7 cells at a rate in excess of 10^6 cells/min by separating pluripotent hES cells from differentiated cell types (osteogenic progenitors and fibroblasts) Identification of key physical property variation in cell types during differentiation and development will allow other researchers to develop scalable separation processes based on cell physical property. Results will also be critical in understanding how physical properties of cells vary with biological changes.
