Analysing the experimental evidence","abstractText":"<p>Common sense and scientific research share the assumption that risk appraisals&nbsp;- such as perceptions of risk or fear&nbsp;- are key determinants of people's actions. Consequently, to ensure people recycle more, drive less, or maintain a healthy weight (for instance), it is assumed that they should first recognise that global warming or obesity are serious threats that place them at personal risk.&nbsp; Although the idea that risk appraisals have an important impact on behaviour is plausible, the evidence supporting it is weak, because most studies only compute correlations between appraisals and behaviour. Thus, we cannot say for certain that making people think they are at risk or feel afraid leads them to change their behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>The researchers will conduct a quantitative review of intervention studies that have successfully changed key risk appraisal variables to determine </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>how often these changes alter intentions and behaviour;</li>\n\n <li>how big an effect these changes have;</li>\n\n <li>whether other variables, such as people's beliefs about their ability to change behaviour, affect the process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This will permit firmer conclusions to be drawn about how effective it is to try to change behaviour by making people think and feel that they are at risk.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G032505/1","grantId":"ES/G032505/1","fundValue":"78644","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Richard Harris","coPersons":["Paschal  Sheeran"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
