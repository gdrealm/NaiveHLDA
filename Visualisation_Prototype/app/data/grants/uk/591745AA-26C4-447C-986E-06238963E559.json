Despite this most of this sequence remains with little or no biological annotation. In order to achieve this biological annotation it would require extensive animal experimentation, which is both expensive and ethically problematic. Indeed it is widely recognized that there is a need to reduce the amount of animal experimentation currently conducted. With this in mind we have developed a technology for whole-genome mapping of bacterial virulence factors using invertebrate hosts that negates the need for mammalian testing. Simply we challenge three different invertebrate animals (insect, neamtode and amoeba) with cosmid libraries from a fully sequenced pathogen. End sequencing of cosmids that adversly effect any of these hosts are aligned with the genome sequence thus identifying pathogenic genes as bounded by clusters of cosmids. This fundamentally new approach allows us to rapidly and inexpensively bridge the enormous knowledge gap that has arisen through intensive genome sequencing. The current grant does not propose to follow-up on each of the virulence factors identified in detail but to provide access to the results as a community wide resource for workers studying each of the three bacteria. Details of the screens will be posted on the web with open access and other researchers will be able to choose cosmids for further research. Alternatively, we will also enter into collaborations with such workers to investigate genes in specific cosmids using the mutants generated.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E021328/1","grantId":"BB/E021328/1","fundValue":"355795","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings of this RVA grant enabled us to secure a large EU FP7 consortium grant called GAMEXP funding several research groups in labs in UK, Germany, Thailand and Vietnam. We are continuing to analyse the small molecule library we defined as a result of this for future exploitation. Collaborators continue to study various toxins identified by this work including the &amp;quot;Toxin Complex&amp;quot;, the Mcf1 toxin, PirAB toxins and the PVC toxin delivery system and many small molecules products. Several publications were possible because of this funding and also outreach activities. Fo example we discussed this work on &amp;quot;Material World&amp;quot; a live Radio 4 broadcast.

This technique was well received and adopted a screening technique my several other labs. The technique uses insects and other invertebrates to screen so contributes to the replacement of mammalian testing for bacterial virulence studies. Furthermore the technique also identified may novel toxins for the insect pathogen Photorhabdus that could be used in crop-protection and insect vector control if required. This work also allowed us to access small molecule natural products from insect pathogens, facilitating further funding from the EU FP7 call in a large consortium award called GAMEXP. This allowed us to identify over 500 novel small molecules for drug discovery. Novel protein toxins and small molecules discovered could be adapted for use in crop protection and human/animal health applications. The use of insects as animal model hosts developed in this grant provides an alternative to mammalian innate immune studies. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
