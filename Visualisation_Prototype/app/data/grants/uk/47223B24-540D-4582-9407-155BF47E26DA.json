The overall goal of SUPRAMATES is to generate new knowledge by combining supramolecularly-engineered nanostructured materials (SENMs), mostly based on organic semiconductors, with tailor-made interfaces to solid substrates and electrodes, for fabricating prototypes of optoelectronic devices. We are particularly interested in developing multiscale SENMs for transistors, in-plane diodes single-photon emitters (useful for quantum cryptography), and especially photovoltaic cells and OLEDs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E04414X/1","grantId":"EP/E04414X/1","fundValue":"302729","fundStart":"2007-02-14","fundEnd":"2010-08-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Franco  Cacialli","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
