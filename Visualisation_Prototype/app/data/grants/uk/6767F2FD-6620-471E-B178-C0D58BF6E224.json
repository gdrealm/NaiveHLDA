Her ability to do this reliably depends on her years of training in interpreting such images and on her overall level of confidence that the target selection is correct. This example highlights two important phenomena underpinning human cognition. Firstly, training and experience can induce long-lasting improvements in our ability to detect, identify and make decisions based on ambiguous sensory information; a phenomenon commonly known as perceptual learning. Secondly, decision confidence - the degree of belief that one's choice is likely to be correct - can inform our decisions further by providing a graded assessment of expected outcome. Despite the prevalence and obvious utility of these phenomena in everyday life (e.g. learn about our surroundings to make better predictions and plan future actions), their neural substrates and how they can be used to build intelligent machines to improve human decision making when solving important socioeconomic problems remain elusive.\n\nModern neuroimaging methods made it possible to &quot;take a peak&quot; into the human brain. Human electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method whereby electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp measure the brain's electrical activity. This technique provides precise information on when the brain processes information in time. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures (non-invasively in an MRI scanner) changes in the local blood flow in the brain as we process information. This in turn allows one to identify where in the brain this processing takes place. Here we propose to combine these two methods to simultaneously obtain information on when and where the brain processes information relating to perceptual learning and decision confidence while human participants engage in various decision making tasks. \n\nCrucially, after deciphering the behavioural and neurobiological origins of learning and confidence during decision making we will develop a brain-computer interface system (computer program controlled in part by human brain signals) that exploits these decision correlates to optimise human performance when dealing with problems relying on inconclusive or partially ambiguous evidence in areas such as security (e.g. optimise systems for threat detection), global economy (e.g. optimise marketing and investment strategies) and health and wellbeing (e.g. identify prognostic precursors of cognitive ageing and disorders known to compromise ones decision-making faculties).\n\nThe main translational output of our work will be a prototype system for fast and intelligent image triaging of large image/video repositories (e.g. CCTV, satellite, advertising image databases). The sheer volume, diversity and sparsity of items of interest in these databases render a manual search for targets of interest very ineffective. Our system will improve human performance (i.e. targets detected per unit time) by presenting a large amount of images in rapid succession (i.e. increase throughput relative to manual search) and re-prioritise the image sequence, placing those that are more likely to contain a target of interest in the front of an image stack. Re-prioritising will be achieved in real-time, by intercepting (non-invasively) brain signals that are indicative of ones decision about a potential target of interest while exploiting signatures of learning and confidence as identified above.\n\nThis work will be performed collaboratively with our international partners at Columbia University in New York. Together, we started to use cutting-edge technology and analysis tools that allow us to characterise and exploit neural signatures associated with human decision making (this work was recently featured in a BBC Horizon documentary).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L012995/1","grantId":"ES/L012995/1","fundValue":"503724","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marios G  Philiastides","coPersons":["Paul  Sajda"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
