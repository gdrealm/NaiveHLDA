Indeed, the plumose antennae of males are sensitive to the flight tone of other mosquitoes and are used to detect and locate females. Mate detection through audition was, therefore, thought to be the prerogative of the male. The antennae of females are simpler in form, but they are more sensitive than any other insect, yet nothing was known about the auditory behaviour of females until Gibson &amp; Russell discovered that they also respond to mosquito flight tones. Sexual selection by flying mosquitoes is an acoustic dialogue which they enter into when they are within hearing range of each other (~ 10 cm); each responds to the sound of the other by altering their own flight tone, until the tones converge in the case of male-female couples, or dramatically diverge in the case of same-sex pairs. These acoustic interactions can, therefore, reveal to an individual whether its interaction is with a partner of the same or opposite sex, and may hold the key to understanding how mosquitoes identify mates of the right species. In our recent studies we established that mosquitoes communicate with each other in a way that appears to be unique amongst the invertebrates. Rather than emitting and receiving discreet calls, mosquitoes continuously send out a signal, in the form of their own wing beats, while continuously monitoring sound inputs. The information to which they are sensitive is encoded somehow in the way each mosquito in a duet alters its wing-beat frequency over time. To discover what this sex-specific behaviour is, we will investigate the biophysics and neurophysiology of sound detection in mosquitoes, using advanced techniques we have developed for vertebrate hearing, to characterise the way mosquito antennae detect and respond to sound and to discover how mosquitoes then use auditory information to interact with each other. The beating wings of mosquitoes produce complex sounds, made up of multiple harmonics, with the fundamental frequency randomly shifting by a few Hz over the course of a few milliseconds. We will map the sound field around a tethered flying mosquito to see if there are features that might facilitate acoustic interactive behaviour with nearby mosquitoes. When a tethered flying mosquito detects sound other than its own wing-beats, it reduces its random shifts in wing-beat frequency and tries to match its wing-beat frequency to the other sound. We will use this response to test the sensory acuity of mosquitoes to sound. This information will be used to determine which components of the flight tone trigger a response to other mosquitoes. So far, we have found that changes in ambient light intensity and wavelength alter wing-beat frequency and increases in temperature and sound levels increase the antennal resonance in tethered mosquitoes. We will explore how environmental changes influence sound reception and flight sounds, and the possible role of efferent neurones in controlling JO frequency tuning and sensitivity. Tethered mosquitoes will be used for our basic studies, and results will be verified with free-flying mosquitoes. Our data will be assimilated into simulation models, which will then be used to test against live mosquitoes. Our aims will be achieved when the model mosquito elicits natural responses in live mosquitoes. The results of our study will provide a wealth of new information about this remarkable form of communication in mosquitoes and will extend our understanding of the biophysical and neurophysiological properties of hearing in insects. The findings will be of significance to scientists interested in auditory systems throughout the animal kingdom and to those involved with the control of mosquitoes that transmit life-threatening pathogens to humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F003307/1","grantId":"BB/F003307/1","fundValue":"475158","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  They have been used in Art installations: \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24766729\nhttp://robinmeier.net/media/press/NatureQ&amp;A.pdf Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural","person":"Ian John Russell","coPersons":["Gabriella Irene Gibson"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":" Mosquitoes are more sensitive to sound than any other insect due to the remarkable properties of their antennae and Johnston's organ at the base of each antenna. Male mosquitoes detect and locate female mosquitoes by hearing the female's flight tone, but until recently we had no idea that females also respond to male flight tones. Our investigation of a novel mechanism of sex recognition in Toxorhynchites brevipalpis revealed that male and female mosquitoes actively respond to the flight tones of other flying mosquitoes by altering their own wing-beat frequencies. Male-female pairs converge on a shared harmonic of their respective fundamental flight tones, whereas same sex pairs diverge. Most frequency matching occurs at frequencies beyond the detection range of the Johnston's organ but within the range of mechanical responsiveness of the antennae. We have shown that this is possible because the Johnston's organ is tuned to, and able to detect difference tones in, the harmonics of antennal vibrations which are generated by the combined input of flight tones from both mosquitoes. Acoustic distortion in hearing organs exists usually as an interesting epiphenomenon. Mosquitoes, however, appear to use it as a sensory cue that enables male-female pairs to communicate through a signal that depends on auditory interactions between them. Frequency matching may also provide a means of species recognition. Morphologically identical but reproductively isolated molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae fly in the same mating swarms, but rarely hybridize. Extended frequency matching occurs almost exclusively between males and females of the same molecular form, suggesting that this behavior is associated with observed assortative mating.
