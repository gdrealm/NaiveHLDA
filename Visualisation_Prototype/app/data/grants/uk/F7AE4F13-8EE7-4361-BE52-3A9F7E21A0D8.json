{"id":"F7AE4F13-8EE7-4361-BE52-3A9F7E21A0D8","title":"Simplified Dual-Drainage Modelling for Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Areas","abstractText":"Flooding is a major problem in the UK as recent high profile events in the summers of 2006 and 2007 have shown. In these events the damage to property and belongings ran into billions of pounds and a number of people were injured or lost their lives in these events. Therefore, predicting the location and severity of flooding is extremely important in preventing these losses. Current computer models for predicting flooding are highly accurate, but take a very long time to run even on the fastest computers. This project intends to use a technique known as cellular automata, a model based on the localised interactions of small cells, to simulate flooding in such a way that it will be possible to run complicated scenarios on a standard PC. The new approach will gain efficiency by making use of the fact that each cell can only 'see' the cells closest to it and the project will investigate the best ways of allowing each cell to communicate with its neighbours. The approach will be tested over a number of different flooding scenarios and compared with existing methodologies to demonstrate its accuracy and increased efficiency over standard methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H015736/1","grantId":"EP/H015736/1","fundValue":"424862","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Munich RE, who is the largest re-insurer in the world, have commissioned a customised version of our software.

The developed model is an order of magnitude faster than existing models, maintaining accuracy.\n\n\n\n- Verieid the new methodologies on a number of case studies, ranging from literature problems with known solutions to real-world case studies. The 2D model has already been customised and delivered to a large re-assurance company that will use it for risk assessment on a continental scale, e.g., Australia and China.\n\n\n\nA further Knowledge Transfer project is being prepared with a water industry consultant ICS Consulting Ltd. who need the fast and accurate 2D flood model for their suite of asset management software. The model can be used for risk assessment when a large number of model runs are required to account for probability of events. It can also be used for near real-time flood management.
