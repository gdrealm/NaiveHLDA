It is widely acknowledged that devaluing nuclear weapons in the security policies of the nuclear weapon states is an essential process along the road to nuclear disarmament. But nuclear weapons remain highly valued by a number of states for variety of reasons and the concept of 'devaluing' nuclear weapons is contested.</p>\n\n<p>This project will develop a deeper understanding of the concept of devaluing nuclear weapons and critically assess the political and practical prospects and challenges of implementing significant devaluing steps. </p>\n\n<p>The research will focus on the UK as the nuclear power best placed and most inclined to adopt further devaluing steps in the context of the ongoing debate on Trident replacement and the concept of 'minimum deterrence' in UK nuclear policy discourse. It will examine devaluing measures advocated by non-nuclear weapon states, and two case studies exploring the effects on conceptions of the value of nuclear weapons of the negotiation of the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the threat and use of nuclear weapons.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I017070/1","grantId":"ES/I017070/1","fundValue":"71102","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-03","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas Edward Ritchie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bradford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
