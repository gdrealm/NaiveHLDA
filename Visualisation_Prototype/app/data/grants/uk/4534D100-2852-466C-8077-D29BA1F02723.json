This evolutionary process may start with adaptation to new environments but this rarely creates a complete reproductive barrier. If some interbreeding occurs, then genes which are not directly involved in adaptation to different habitats can still be shared. We still have little understanding of how evolution proceeds from this point to the point of complete prevention of interbreeding.\nIn this project, we propose to study the pea aphid because its genome has been sequenced and it is known to feed on several different host plant, which represent distinct environments. We know that aphids tend to reproduce with others that use the same plant. This tendency is stronger in some cases than others so we have several points on the progression towards new species that we can compare. \nAphids use chemical cues to choose the plant on which they feed and we now know the types of genes underlying recognition of these cues. We have already found some of these genes that are likely to be involved in the differences in behaviour between aphids that use different plants. In this new project we want to find out how these genes are influenced by natural selection and how they affect the sharing of other genes between host races of aphids. We also want to find out which chemicals in the plants are used in the recognition process.\nThis will help us to understand the origin of species and it may also help in control of aphids that are pests of crops. Understanding how aphids choose the plants they want to feed on can provide new tools to prevent aphid damage.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J021660/1","grantId":"NE/J021660/1","fundValue":"334462","fundStart":"2012-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Roger Kenneth Butlin","coPersons":["Gareth John Fraser","Duncan Drummond Cameron"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
