The goal of this bid is to develop this embryonic network and to use this research to contribute to public debate through the involvement of artists and NGO media practitioners.\\n\\nThe phenomenon we are exploring is best summed up by Harrison Ford's chest. This US actor and prominent environmentalist released a video of himself receiving a brutal chest wax to draw attention to the threat of deforestation to climate change on behalf of the NGO 'Conservation International'. His actions epitomise a growing prominence of media and celebrity in environmental affairs and the growth of particularly 'spectacular' environmental media. Thus, David Attenborough has been voted Britain's most trusted celebrity; organisations like Global Cool and Ecorazzi.com enlist celebrity supporters; and Steve Irwin's death was the most searched for news in Google in 2006. Academic work is beginning to investigate the increasingly powerful connections between celebrity and environment: newspaper articles linking celebrities and climate change have increased substantially with the period of 2005-2006 showing a 500% increase from the previous year alone.\\n\\nThe interaction of celebrity and the environment is not new. The Adamsons won fame for their relationship with lions and advocacy for conservation in East Africa in the 1960s. 'Grey Owl' spoke to packed audiences in the 1930s in the UK and Canada. John Muir was revered the early 1900s for his role in US conservation and his pilgrimage to Thoreau's grave. Before Irwin was wrestling crocodiles, Frank Buck jumped on a (dead) tiger for the cameras in the 1930s. Wildlife film has been producing celebrity conservationists for decades (e.g. Attenborough, Cousteau, Goodall, Durrell). \\n\\nYet, the longevity of the interactions makes recent developments all the more interesting, for it means we are better able to understand what is different about them. For example, we can see how celebrity involvement in climate change issues (e.g. DiCaprio, Madonna) reshapes previous interactions with the environment, how conservation NGOs have (re)formulate their interactions with celebrity, how wildlife film has restructured for contemporary audiences and how celebrity itself has expanded in its outlets and, especially, its power/impacts. Turning analytical lenses to today's relations between celebrity and environmentalism allows us to explore the cultural and political economies/ecologies of media events alongside the work of politicians, NGOs and 'green' corporate capital. \\n\\nThis proposed network of scholars from a variety of disciplines-in combination with environmental media/communications practitioners-is tied to the exploration of these phenomena and their implications. The research interests of this proposed network include the history of wildlife film, the activities of conservation NGOs, the climate change 'industry', the political economy of wildlife conservation, celebrity activism, sustainable consumption and interpretations of environmental discourse in film and text. Practitioners include members of NGOs working with celebrity-fronted campaigns, other 'spectacular' media/marketing forms and film-markers devoted to representing environmental concerns and the 'environment' more broadly. Their perspective is invaluable to enable the transference of insights to and from those engaged in the creation of these representations which have great impact on public perceptions of environmental issues and our political responses. We contend that only a cross- and inter-disciplinary grouping as proposed here-scholars from English, cultural/media studies, geography, sociology and development studies-in combination with those engaged in the dissemination of environmental media and marketing, will be able to prise open the complexities of the growing imbrications among celebrities, environmentalism and media power.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039279/1","grantId":"AH/H039279/1","fundValue":"23696","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Goodman","coPersons":["Jo  Littler","Daniel  Brockington"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
