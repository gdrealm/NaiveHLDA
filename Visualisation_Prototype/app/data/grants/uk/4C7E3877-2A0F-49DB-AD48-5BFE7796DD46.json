The introduction of sanitation and supply of clean drinking water has had and continues to have a huge impact on the transmission of many diseases caused by a range of microorganisms. Over the past two centuries, vaccination has also provided a very efficient cost effective protection against many pathogens. In the past century the discovery and development of antibiotic and anti-viral drugs has provided yet more protection. However over the past three decades we have witnessed the emergence of diseases that have crossed over from an animal reservoir and adapted to infect humans often with dire outcomes, notably, HIV, SAR's and a range of influenza viruses with avian or swine origins. These are natural emerging infectious diseases, each requiring considerable resources to manage, understand and to develop countermeasures. More recently another threat has emerged, the &quot;deliberate releases&quot; - the intentional spread of a biological or chemical agent, such as might occur in a biowarfare or bioterrorist incident. Microbes that can be weaponised to be dispersed and infect major metropolitan areas via a range of delivery mechanism, some are non-contagious, others are extremely contagious. Super-imposed on this deliberate use and release of microbes is the potential ability to genetically engineer and incorporate additional factors to make them more potent, such as resistance to known drugs, greater infectivity, the induction of debilitating host factors (cytokine storm). In some cases vaccinations is not an option, since though effective, the time required to achieve protection is too long (i.e., anthrax vaccination). An immediate fast acting molecule/intervention is required.\nWe are faced with two challenges, to create new drug countermeasures and decontamination procedures. In this proposal, we have devised a strategy for rapidly creating molecules that are highly specific for a target pathogen, and critically can deliver a knock-out punch to either kill the microbe or inactivate its toxins. The key essence is to create molecules that do not naturally exist in nature, but the components bits actually do and to figure out a way of putting them together so that each part still functions. \nAntibodies are unique highly specific molecules that can be generated by a number of approaches. Moreover accessing the genes that encode the antibodies is relatively simple. Antibodies have a modular structures, the binding site of an antibody is made up of two variable domains held together in the correct orientation by additional constant domains. It is this pairing that confers the ability to recognise targets. With current technology it is possible to make antibodies to almost any biological and many chemical targets. However, binding to a target confers specificity, but that may not be enough to kill or inactivate a target. \nHydrogen peroxide, is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is a potent bactericidal agent that is used in most homes as a general disinfectant at low levels, but it does not discriminate between good and bad microbes. What if we could harness the specificity of the antibody binding site and the ability of molecules that generate ROS to target high levels of ROS directly on the pathogen surface? \nA protein derived from jellyfish called KillerRed generates ROS in response to illumination with light of a certain wavelength. Secondly glucose oxidase (used in diabetic glucose sensors) generates ROS in the process of enzymatically degrading glucose. Both of these proteins are potent generators of ROS. We propose to create a hybrid molecule that is part antibody binding site and part ROS generator and to evaluate these as anti-microbial agents. This will be achieved by inserting the ROS generating proteins between the antibody binding domains to retain and stabilise the functions of the two proteins.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J019941/1","grantId":"BB/J019941/1","fundValue":"114721","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Angray  Kang","coPersons":["Michael Anthony Curtis"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
