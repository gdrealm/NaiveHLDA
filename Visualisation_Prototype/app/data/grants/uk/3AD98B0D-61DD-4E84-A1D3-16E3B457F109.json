All the information contained in DNA is not required for making proteins, therefore, unwanted information must be removed before a protein is made. The unwanted information is removed, or spliced, from pre-mRNA by a two step process similar to the editing of unwanted frames from a film. One end of the region to be removed is first cut then the other end is cut while the two remaining pieces are spliced together. This splicing of the pre-mRNA is very important because it must occur accurately in order for functional proteins to be produced. A mistake by even one nucleotide could have disastrous effects on the final protein produced.\n\nThe process of splicing is carried out by a large RNA/protein complex called the spliceosome. The spliceosome interacts with the pre-mRNA to identify and splice out the unwanted regions. An increasing amount of evidence points to the RNA components of the spliceosome as being critical for the actual cutting process of splicing. The work that was undertaken during the tenure of this research grant addressed how the RNA components of the spliceosome interact with each other and the pre-mRNA to identify, then &amp;quot;splice&amp;quot; out, the unwanted regions.\n\nWe have developed collections of mutations in the U5, U2 and U6 snRNAs that have been key for investigating the function of these RNAs in splicing. Mutations in the U5 snRNA were analysed for their effects on all the intron containing genes in yeast by using a special technique called microarray analysis. The U5 mutations were found to influence the splicing of only specific subsets of pre-mRNAs. This was unexpected as U5 is known to be essential for the splicing of all pre-mRNAs. This work has shown for the first time that mutation of a core snRNA of the spliceosome can exibit premRNA specific splicing. This work opens the door for investigating the influence of mutations in the other RNAs of the spliceosome. This work has revealed how one RNA of the spliceosome can contribute to the regulation of splicing.\n\nA number of mutations we have produced in the U2 and U6 snRNAs have been analyzed for their effects on pre-mRNA\nsplicing. As the U2 and U6 snRNAs are thought to contribute to the active site of the spliceosome analysis of their effects\non splicing when mutated will provide valuable information on their individual contibutions to the active site. We have now\ndefined the influence of these mutations on splicing and have shown that certain mutations influence the first step of splicing and others influence the second step. This is important information for defining the role of the U2 and U6 snRNAs in the catalysis of splicing. The next step is to determine the mechanisms by which these mutations perturb each step of splicing and this will allow us to figure out the exact mechanisms of splicing.\n\nFinally we have used a technique called crosslinking to investigate how the RNAs are oriented during pre-mRNA splicing. Crosslinking is a method where you can see whether certain RNAs are very close to each other and therefore interact\nduring splicing. This provides spatial information for constructing models of how the spliceosome looks inside. We have found that the U1, U2 and U5 snRNAs interact near the site in the mRNA which is cut first but only on the side that will\nremain in the pre-mRNA. The most interesting thing we found was the fact that the U2 snRNA interacted here. This was not know before. Now by knowing all these interactions we were able to produce a model of the RNA interactions required\nright before the first step of splicing.\n\nOverall this is basic research that has contributed to our knowledge of a critical cellular process. The research in this proposal is basic research. The knowledge obtained through this research will provide the fundamental theories and concepts underlying cell function and gene expression specifically. We can impart this new knowledge to our student beneficiaries through the numerous engagement activities we undertake. In addition, the fundamental theories and concepts we discover will provide information for more disease-oriented investigations by other researchers. Our research into the regulation of RNA splicing in yeast may also benefit commercial private sector researchers who are trying to use yeast as a system to produce protein and RNA products from yeast.
