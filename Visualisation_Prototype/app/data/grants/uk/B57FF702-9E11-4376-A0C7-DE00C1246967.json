{"id":"B57FF702-9E11-4376-A0C7-DE00C1246967","title":"Crossing Over: New Narratives of Death","abstractText":"'Crossing Over' seeks to establish a new interdisciplinary network of international experts from different fields of research on death and dying to work interactively and collaboratively on the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the changing face of contemporary death. Both death as a moment in time and dying as a process result in intersections of the theoretical and the social, the academic and the pragmatic, the arcane and the everyday - that is, intersections between spheres which might not usually interact. 'Crossing Over' exemplifies a belief that such complex matters can only be addressed by a wide and innovative exchange of ideas and practices.\n\nThe network will consist of scholars from the humanities and social sciences. It will be directed from the University of Hull's newly-established, multi-disciplinary Centre for End of Life Studies but also includes a significant contribution from the University of Sheffield's multi-disciplinary Death Group (est. 2004) convened from the Department of English. A conference in Sheffield in 2015 will share the fruits of the network's research and will be open to a wide range of professionals as well as members of the public.\n\n'Crossing Over' will function through a combination of face-to-face events and on-line communication tools. Individual outputs from a range of disciplines and innovative research collaborations between, for example, a literary scholar and someone working in the hospice sector will not only produce an enhanced understanding of the challenges of contemporary death but will move towards new narratives of death in which a range of theorists and non-academic professionals can have a stake.\n\nSuch a network is urgently needed in order to address changes in the cultural and social experience of death, in ideas about death, and in the management of death. The most obvious change is that sudden, early adult death is rare but long periods of frailty and disability prior to death are increasingly common. Where 'end of life' once referred to the moment of death, Age UK have recently suggested an expanded definition that means the last ten years of increased 80-plus lifespans. One can point to, for example, challenges to curative medicine materialised in the Hospice Movement; critiques of medicalised models of grief changing the way loss is understood; and the growth of virtual memorial sites. These shifts in 'ordinary' death have parallels in more radical activities such as the Right to Die movement. \n\nThere is also a need to produce theoretical and practical models that will assist in the understanding of bereavement in response to what Margaret Holloway (2007) has termed 'the new death'. Examples would include deaths caused by natural disasters; the increase in deaths caused by alcohol or substance abuse; teenage suicide; and teenage gang-related deaths. These experiences are widely reported but little understood and go hand-in-hand with the fact that, as Christine Valentine (2008) notes, 'the dead retain a significant social presence in the lives of the living'.\n\nAt the same time, our relationship with death has become increasingly paradoxical. Mourning is both a social process and something that is fundamentally private. As Meghan O'Rourke (2011) has observed, we live in 'a dysfunctional culture in which we avidly consume news of death on TV and duck away from it in real life.' The network will, therefore, focus on the following research areas: \n\nThe meaning of 'the good death' in the 21st century.\n\nChanging narratives of death - literary, media and social - and the continuing social presence of the dead.\n\nNew and emergent discourses of spirituality.\n\nThe impact of 'the new death' on how we story the dead.\n\nChanging funeral and burial practices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K00574X/1","grantId":"AH/K00574X/1","fundValue":"28330","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Louise HollowayDavid Gerard Kennedy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
