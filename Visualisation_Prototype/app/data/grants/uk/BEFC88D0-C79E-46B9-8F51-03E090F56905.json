It is on this imaginary that many Orientalist and colonialist imaginations would draw, and Britain, from colonial times up to the present, has played an important role in the definition and protection of its 'heritage'. Using qualitative data, including film, as tools of analysis, this research project will analyse how different imaginations of place and identity are contested and created within current projects of urban restoration in two very different Levantine cities: Damascus – at times presented as the city with the longest history in the world – and Amman – a city often seen to have no (significant) history at all. By adopting a postcolonial comparative analytical approach the relationship between 'local', 'regional', 'national' and 'Western' geographical imaginations of the 'Levant' and its people will be examined. A film and a series of academic and non academic papers will help in crafting and distributing its findings.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F04285X/1","grantId":"ES/F04285X/1","fundValue":"325862","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claudio  Minca","coPersons":["Jessica  Jacobs"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
