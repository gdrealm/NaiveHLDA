Recent geology explorer missions have identified features and minerals interpreted as due to water, making several locations on the martian surface prime candidates for seeking life. A European mission called ExoMars will visit a selected site on Mars to search for life or signs of extinct life from the wetter martian past. The mission will have several instruments designed to search for signs of life, and will have the ability to travel across the martian surface looking for interesting sites and to drill up to 2 m below the surface. The AEP+ meteorology package will measure the local surface conditions to determine the habitability of the martian surface for microbial life. Measurements of the exchange of water, dust and heat between the surface and the atmosphere will help explain atmospheric processes and climate evolution. Finally, a better understanding of turbulence and dust processes will help the safe landing of future Mars missions. ExoMars will launch in 2013 and start to return science data after a successful landing in 2015.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G008906/1","grantId":"ST/G008906/1","fundValue":"102370","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-10-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew John Coates","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
