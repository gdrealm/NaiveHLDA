The Artist's Studio is a non-commercial project space, dealing with issues of space, performance, and representation, located in a Victorian House in Knightsbridge, in a large apartment generously donated by a benefactor. The Artist's Studio aims to open up dialogues around the social economy of art production in London as site and to establish a performative research base within a critical and high profile visual arts environment. It is supervised by team of established advisers, including ICA curator Jens Hoffmann, curator Stuart Comer at TATE, or Pablo Fuente, managing director of critical art journal Afterall. Looking specifically at producing critically-informed and research-centered projects as part of a one-year programme the investigator has been invited to produce an individual project that undermines or interfaces with the space of the apartment I studio I gallery. A programme of talks and events will accompany the exhibition. A publication will be produced to document and critically evaluate the project. A comprehensive website will be established to provide further contextual audio&shy; visual content as a parallel container for the exhibition.\n\nThe aim of the proposed project is to address the questions of the social and economic situation of artists today through the medium of fine art performance for video and installation. The project seeks to find an audiovisual and performative representation to describe the role of artists today, their personnel dilemma and struggle to respond to the demands of a generally changing society and economy. The work aims to raise awareness on the issues involved and to indicate how this dilemma might impact on the cultural industries in general?\n\nA script of dialogues will be developed for video and performance from different voices and source. This will mainly involve evidence that has previously been gathered by Susanne Clausen through a series of interviews with different creative professionals. This source material will be written into the script, re-enacted and performed by a group of foreign language actors, who are asked to enact the roles of artists and related professionals.\n\nAn innovative way of performing is being developed as a tool to question the way we are used to seeing artists and their representation and to challenges the division between lived and represented reality, history and fiction, and the defined limits of performance?\n\nThe project contributes to a current debate about the economic and social conditions of art production, and should help to find a creative representation of concepts of work in a post-industrial society and economy, where the classical definitions of work and labour are being questioned. Providing representations and interpretations of those notions from the viewpoint and live experience of artists may help to further clarify and illustrate those problems and to recognise the multiple shifts that have happened in various fields of art and culture and a larger society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E510779/1","grantId":"AH/E510779/1","fundValue":"13022","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Susanne  Clausen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
