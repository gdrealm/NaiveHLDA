Transport often involves very precise selectivity for specific ions. Cell membranes present a serious energy barrier to an ion crossing it because ions are energetically more stable in water than in the membrane interior. Membrane proteins such as ion pumps, ion exchangers and ion channels are used by the cell to transport ions across membranes; in contrast, aquaporins are highly selective for water. Recently spectacular advances in the structural biology of membrane proteins have provided crystallographic snapshots of aquaporins, pumps and channels that are selective for sodium, potassium, calcium or chloride. This variety of structural motifs provides an excellent start point for the theoretical description of ion selectivity and water transport through these families of proteins. In order to fully understand the physico-chemical basis of membrane function insight into its dynamics is required.How does the protein control the movement of the ions and water molecules? How does the protein open and close the ion/water conduction path at a specific time? The main objective of this project is to perform high quality calculations to shed some light into the exact mechanism of selectivity and gating. Gating is not yet fully understood but is the reason why membrane proteins can play major roles in such diverse physiological processes. Changes in properties of specific membrane proteins cause diseases. Consequently, there is an immense interest of membrane proteins as pharmaceutical drug targets. Besides, these pore-forming proteins are also engineered for applications in biotechnology in areas including drug delivery and the construction of biosensors.Due to the inherent experimental difficulties in obtaining structural data for membrane proteins, it is essential that we maximise our understanding of the structure/function relationships of those membrane proteins for which we have experimental structures. Computational approaches have contributed to our current understanding of membrane proteins and have become a standard tool.The popular way to gain insight into the behaviour of biological systems is the use of the so-called atomistic simulations. Usually, the interactions between atoms are described by empirical potential functions, which are used to integrate the classical equations of motion. This process yields a trajectory of the system in time, from which structural and dynamical quantities can be calculated using the principles of statistical mechanics. However, despite the success of this technique, it suffers from limitations, such as the limited timescale they explore, which reduces the scope of its application. Novel methods will be implemented to overcome these limitations.This project will support multidisciplinary research encompassing collaborations between life scientist and physical scientists at Oxford University where there is a strong community of people working in all aspects of ion channels and membrane proteins among several departments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E004539/1","grantId":"EP/E004539/1","fundValue":"21116","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Carmen  Domene","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
