{"id":"7E340A50-1DCC-4048-8626-E475A20522DE","title":"Small Items of Research Equipment at Imperial College London","abstractText":"This proposal seeks investment in key items of small research equipment to support early career researchers from across the engineering and physical sciences domains. It is targeted specifically at key research strengths, focussing in particular on equipment supporting strategic priority areas of relevance to the Energy, Manufacturing the Future, Digital Economy and Healthcare Technology themes, and areas highlighted as 'grow' and 'maintain' in the EPSRC portfolio.\n\nAcross these priority areas we have identified three overarching requirements for small scale equipment - Measuring (characterisation and imaging), Modelling (mathematical and computational modelling) and Making (the fabrication and manufacture of devices and components). For example, we need imaging and analytical equipment to measure and to characterise, computational hardware (often small scale or purchase of cores on our central computing facilities) to perform modelling, and finally we need equipment to fabricate precursors, intermediates and devices.\n\nKey areas that will benefit from the investments in small scale equipment include: \n\nCharacterisation \n- Imaging \n- Electrical characterisation\n- Mechanical testing/ Biomechanical properties / Bio-Tribology\n- Fluid Mechanics\n- Time-resolved spectroscopy for shock physics\n\nManufacture and fabrication\n- Nanoscale film deposition\n- Chemical Synthesis\n- Plastic Electronics\n- Chemical Biology\n- Synthetic Biology.\n\nModelling and computation across engineering and physical science domains.\n\nThe provision of training for ECRs on new equipment and facilities is an important element of this proposal, and this will be undertaken by experienced technical staff and research officers. In addition to ensuring that facilities are used appropriately, the availability of training will widen the pool of ECRs using the equipment.\n\nOur preparation for this proposal has included a survey of early career researchers, which provided a detailed picture of the requirements for small equipment. If successful in this application, the next step will be a light-touch review of requests, followed by allocation and spend of funds within the specified timeline. The upgraded equipment made possible by this award will be made widely available to ECRs and other researchers through our College Facilities Directory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K030760/1","grantId":"EP/K030760/1","fundValue":"431836","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Donal Donat Bradley","coPersons":["Neil  Alford","Steven  Rose"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" This grant has been provided to support Early Career Researchers to fast-track their research at the crucially important start-up phase of their careers, helping to ensure that they have access to world-class state-of-the-art, or beyond state-of-the-art, facilities that will allow them to develop as internationally leading researchers. By helping the UK's top researchers and academics maintain cutting-edge facilities, the small scale equipment funds will increase their ability to perform ground-breaking research and contribute to the UK's international research profile.
