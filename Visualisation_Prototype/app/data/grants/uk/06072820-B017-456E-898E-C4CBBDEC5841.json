Loneliness is one measure of compromised social relationships and is a significant problem for older people with approximately 42 per cent of those aged 65 plus in England reporting loneliness (10 per cent reporting severe loneliness and 32 per cent reporting moderate loneliness); 3.2 million individuals in England.</p>\n\n<p>Loneliness has important negative consequences for both older adults and society being linked with a range of negative health, social and service use outcomes. Because of the importance of loneliness as a problem for older people a range of services to combat loneliness have been developed but few have actually achieved this aim. We suggest that part of the failure of current services is because we do not understand the pathways into and out of loneliness; the characteristics of those groups who move/into and out of loneliness; the factors that are linked with changes in loneliness and how social and health factors are linked to loneliness pathways. </p>\n\n<p>The availability of this information may help us to design services that are more timely and tailored to the needs of individual older people and help to promote quality of life in old age.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004077/1","grantId":"ES/K004077/1","fundValue":"152244","fundStart":"2013-04-15","fundEnd":"2015-02-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina  Victor","coPersons":["Ann Patricia Bowling"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
