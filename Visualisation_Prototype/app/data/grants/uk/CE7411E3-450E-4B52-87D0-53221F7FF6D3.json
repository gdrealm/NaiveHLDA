{"id":"CE7411E3-450E-4B52-87D0-53221F7FF6D3","title":"Lebanese Cinema, National Identity and the Civil War","abstractText":"The research is intended to provide an original analysis of Lebanese cinema and its relationship with national identity through an analysis of films made during and after the Lebanese Civil War. It will combine a detailed textual analysis of films with interviews with filmmakers to arrive at a well-rounded assessment of the role of Lebanese cinema in the construction and communication of national identity in Lebanon. The analysis will be linked to the social and political context in which the films have been produced, distributed and critiqued. The research will offer a comprehensive analysis of Lebanese films dealing with the topic of the Civil War, and will be the first major investigation into Lebanese cinema with published outcomes in English.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E504906/1","grantId":"AH/E504906/1","fundValue":"25049","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lina  Khatib","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
