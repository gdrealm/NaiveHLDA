{"id":"383B4D93-2352-4EF1-BEC9-80F51D5B94EF","title":"Trade and Traffic on the River Trent and Associated Waterways, 1850-1970","abstractText":"The Trent is one of the three major rivers of England (the other two being the Severn and the non-tidal Thames) which have been used for navigation on a large scale since early times. It is also one of the handful of inland waterways which continued to be used extensively for commercial navigation after the development of first the main-line railway system and later modern road transport. Most interest in the history of inland waterways in England has been concentrated on the period between 1660, when the main phase of river improvement began, and about 1850, when most traffic previously carried on canals transferred to the railways. Much less has been written about commercial carrying on inland waterways after this period, or about the administration of the waterways themselves, or about either those who worked and lived on the waterways or riverside communities, both of which had a very distinctive character. Nothing of this sort has been done in the case of the Trent.\n\nThis project seeks to remedy this gap in the literature of transport history in Britain by looking in detail at how trade and traffic on the Trent (and associated canals) changed after 1850 as a result of the coming of the railways, and then changed again after 1918 as long-distance road transport developed. It will also consider how the Trent Navigation Company, the canal companies and later the British Transport Commission and its successors responded to demands to improve the Trent and the associated canals, and with what success. Finally, it will look at life on board boats on the river and the canals, and life ashore in riverside communities whose economy dependended, certainly at the start of this period, on proximity to a major commercial waterway.\n\nThe project will be undertaken in partnership with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge, who are restoring a former working barge (the 'Leicester Trader') as a floating heritage centre for the river and have already collected a large amount of oral testimony and written and photographic evidence for the recent history of commercial navigation on the Trent. The project, through a programme of public engagement events, will also actively encourage other voluntary organisations (town and village local history societies, the Railway &amp; Canal Historical Society and riverside communities generally) to be involved. The programme will be facilitated by the named researcher, Philip Riden, who has a long record of working with community groups on local history projects and has established links with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge.\n\nThe main sources for such a study are the records of the navigation companies themselves, records created by parliamentary committees considering bills promoted by the companies and by railway companies, published Parliamentary Papers, records of central government departments responsible for regulating commercial inland navigation, records of local authorities (chiefly as sanitary authorities), records of statutory undertakers such as drainage and river catchment boards, and any records that survive of private carrying companies (and, in the case of those incorporated as limited liability companies, their returns to Companies House). In addition, for the general history of riverside communities a wide range of standard sources for 19th- and 20th-century local history can be used, and for the most recent phase of the subject oral testimony from those involved in the river will be an important source.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007637/1","grantId":"AH/K007637/1","fundValue":"69127","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  This project sought to remedy the gap in the literature of transport history by looking in detail at how trade and traffic on the Trent (and associated canals) changed after 1850 as a result of the coming of the railways, and then changed again after 1918 as long-distance road transport developed.

Finally, it looked at life on board boats on the river and canals and life ashore in riverside communities whose economy depended on proximity to a major commercial waterway.\n\nThis project used the records of the navigation companies, records created by parliamentary committees, published Parliamentary Papers, records of central government departments responsible for regulating commercial inland navigation, records of local authorities and statutory undertakers and any records of private carrying companies, together with a wide range of standard sources for 19th- and 20th- century local history, to explore the history of the Trent and associated canals in the post-railway age. A Research Associate was employed to locate, access, transcribe and collect large amounts of data for use by academics and our co-production community partner, the Newark Heritage Barge Charitable Incorporated Organisation.\n\nThe Organisation (formerly the 'Friends of the Newark Heritage Barge') is restoring a former working barge (the 'Leicester Trader') as a floating heritage centre for the river. They have already collected a large amount of oral testimony and written and photographic evidence for the recent history of commercial navigation on the Trent. \n\nThe project also worked closely with the Railway and Canal Historical Society, representatives of town and village local history societies and riverside communities more generally to record memories, recollections and testimony in support of the project's objectives. \n\nThe project's outcomes have been used in talks on various occasions to lay audiences, in seminars run in conjunction with the Newark Heritage Barge, and in a day school to conclude the project, run by Nottinghamshire Local History Association.\n\nThe project has also been a contributing partner to the Connected Communities Heritage Network 'Before the Last Traces are Gone' run by De Montfort University Leicester. The project presented at the Network Symposium and Exhibition (Dec. 2013) and has continued to be part of that project's follow-on activities. This has helped to enlarge upon the communication and reach of the project's findings.

It would not have been possible to have made use of this without a research associate who could spend large amounts of time there, because most or all of it is very poorly catalogued. In the event, we were able to photograph several thousand pages of documents dating from the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th, which will form the basis for a new study of the Trent Navigation in this period, alongside documents, mainly at the National Archives, which are already well known. By writing a book aimed at a general as well as an academic audience on the history of the Trent Navigation and associated waterways between about 1850 and the end of commercial carrying in the 1970s. We are also looking at possible sources of funding to make more of the material directly available through a digital medium.
