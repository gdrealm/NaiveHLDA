Through detailed qualitative case-studies in Kenya and Zambia, PIMA critically interrogates the heralded potential for digital communications and liberalised media sectors to promote more responsive and inclusive democratic governance, with a keen eye for turning project insights into relevance for policymakers, media houses, journalists and development organisations.<br /><br />By employing survey-based, qualitiative and ethnographic methods to comparatively analyse interactive radio and TV programmes in the context of electoral and everyday politics, we will probe whose voice counts, why and to what effects in these new digitally-enabled spaces of voice and accountability. The project takes into account local innovation in the use of ICTs and the interactions between different modes, venues and actors of information gathering and dissemination that are particularly prominent in African contexts. PIMA brings together researchers from the Universities of Cambridge, Nairobi and Zambia and the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Lusaka, working closely with select broadcast stations and other stakeholders.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J018945/1","grantId":"ES/J018945/1","fundValue":"246457","fundStart":"2012-10-31","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sharath  Srinivasan","coPersons":["Winnie  Mitullah","Neo  Simutanyi"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
