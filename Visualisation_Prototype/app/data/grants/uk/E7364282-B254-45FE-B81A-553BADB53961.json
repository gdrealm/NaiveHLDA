The metal track width will be small enough (~5 micron) to ensure the film is highly transparent (&gt;89%) but thick enough (3 to 5 micron) to give the surface of the film a low surface resistance (&lt;1 ohm per square) and excellent mechanical robustness. Thin conducting polymer or metal layers will be deposited on top as required. We will make the transparent conducting layer onto both rolls of film and sheets of glass. Processes for futher patterning of the layer will be also developed. The project partners make a complete supply chain from basic research to end users in markets for touch screens, EMI shielding, lighting, signage and displays, including OLED and PLED along with large area EL.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=DT/F002203/1","grantId":"DT/F002203/1","fundValue":"174603","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  RA gained job in Industry in UK SME\n\nConcept proven Electronics Economic","person":"Andy  Monkman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" We demonstrated that OLEDs of high efficiency could be manufactured on buried wire grid anodes Company gained a major industrial EU project on the back of our proof of concept Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
