It has been applied to landmine detection, the location and evaluation of building structures and materials, contaminant mapping plus general glacial, geological, archaeological, forensic and environmental applications. With an unrivalled ability to 'image' the shallow sub-surface at high-resolutions, the technique is the tool of choice for many geotechnical engineers and is the principle investigation method for near-surface problems. Unfortunately, the evaluation, interpretation and analysis of GPR data is a hit-and-miss affair, particularly in complex environments and advanced processing, imaging and/or visualisation techniques are often required before even the most basic interpretations are made. Many of these methods add unwanted bias or error into the data and there is a pressing need for new data analysis methods that are robust, accurate and efficient. Numerical Modelling (which simulates the propagation of the GPR waves in the ground) and Inversion (which attempts to automatically determine the shape, location and properties of a buried target from the recorded GPR signals) have both been successfully applied to real and experimental near-surface GPR data over a range problem senorios. This project will attempt to integrate these two methodologies into a single programme of research that will develop, new innovative solutions to the problem of GPR data interpretation whilst providing users with a robust, sophisticated alternative to more conventional analysis techniques. The work will focus on the key application areas of landmine detection/discrimination, services mapping (particularly leaking non-metallic fuel, water and sewage pipes) and the identification, location and characterisation of buried building foundations and similar structures. The work will utilise data collected from real-world situations with the goal of producing an analysis and interpretation technique that is practical, efficient and comprehensively tested. There are clear benefits to improving our ability to evaluate and characterise the subsurface, both economically and socially. For example, it is estimated that the cost associated with drinking water loss from leaky pipes alone is in the order over ten million pounds a year. Enhanced investigation techniques can go a long to reducing this cost. Ultimately, the project represents a new and exciting development in geotechnical GPR research with potential benefits that reach far beyond the confines of the engineering community into fields as diverse as archaeology, biotechnical sciences and forensics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E004032/1","grantId":"EP/E004032/1","fundValue":"218001","fundStart":"2007-07-17","fundEnd":"2010-07-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel John Cassidy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
