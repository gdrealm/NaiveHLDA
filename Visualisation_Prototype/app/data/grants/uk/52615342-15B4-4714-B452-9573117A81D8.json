So far we do not clearly understand the roles that discrimination and social context play in creating these inequalities. </p>\n\n<p>Research teams at King's College London (UK) and Columbia University (USA) will carry out studies to investigate:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>the roles that the historical social context and policy play in shaping observed patterns of health inequalities;</li>\n\n <li>differences in anticipated and perceived experiences of discrimination; </li>\n\n <li>how discrimination contributes to inequalities in everyday social functioning, mental health, physical health, and use of health services. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Comparisons will be made with 1600 adults from two larger studies, (i) the UK National Institute for Health Research-funded South East London Community Health study at the Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, and (ii) the US National Institute of Health-funded Child Health and Development Disparities Study in the East Bay Area of California. UK and US researchers, health practitioners, and community members will be invited to participate in developing the social and historical contextual narratives and in planning the dissemination of our research findings.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H036180/1","grantId":"ES/H036180/1","fundValue":"258986","fundStart":"2010-05-14","fundEnd":"2015-05-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephani Louise Hatch","coPersons":["Craig  Morgan","Matthew  Hotopf","Graham  Thornicroft","Samuel Benjamin Harvey"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
