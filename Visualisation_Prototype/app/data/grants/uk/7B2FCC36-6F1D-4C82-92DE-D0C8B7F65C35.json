The ultimate aim of complement is to bind to the surface of invading bacterial cells, protozoa and tumor cells to create holes in the membrane to kill the target cell. The system is based on a cascade activation so that one protein makes the next protein in the pathway active. \nAlthough this system serves a protective role it can sometimes inappropriately target self tissues and has been implicated in a wide range of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarct and Alzheimers disease. \nIt is essential to study how these molecules interact with one another and determine if there are any sites on the molecule that would be appropriate for drug intervention. The best way to achieve this is through X-ray crystallography. This technique allows the three dimensional atomic structure of a molecule to be determined. Once the structure of C1 has been determined, its potential as a drug target will be unlocked.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700850","grantId":"G0700850","fundValue":"332292","fundStart":"2008-09-29","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Darren  Thompson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
