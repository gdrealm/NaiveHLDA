{"id":"3C28513B-06CC-4EB6-A4AC-C5B9DE7DAC08","title":"Conflicts in Time: Rethinking 'Contemporary' Globalisation","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project was to create an interdisciplinary research network to examine the changing management and experience of time in the contemporary world. Globalisation has been widely analysed as an alteration in experiences of space, but we shifted the focus to time. In order to achieve this we used each workshop to examine institutions that mediate between different representations, experiences, rhythms and disciplines of time. These included museums, planning bureaucracies, global workplaces and social movements. Each workshop addressed one of these sites for the negotiation of time and brought together in a dialogue both academics and practitioners. Research findings from multiple regions of the world were always included in our conversations. In these discussions we uniquely addressed global changes to time that have occurred across the creative industries, bureaucracy, activism and labour.</p>\n\n<p>From these workshops we refuted assumptions about the emergence of a homogenous experience of global time through empirical findings. We also developed a new theoretical model through which to understand time. This analyses each social situation as a time-scape or a conflictual field of mediating acts and representations that seek to make time sensually present, manipulable and subject to various framing idioms.<br /><br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0456","grantId":"RES-451-26-0456","fundValue":"14524","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Charlotte Bear","coPersons":["Stephan  Feuchtwang"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
