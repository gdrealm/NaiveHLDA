Similar PATT grants have been operating efficiently in Southampton for over a decade. Although the number of potential observers has risen slightly since the previous renewal, we have found that our average annual spend has decreased somewhat. We therefore request funding at a slightly reduced level of 10,000 pounds per year.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/E004512/1","grantId":"PP/E004512/1","fundValue":"12485","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  Knigge","coPersons":["Thomas Joseph Maccarone","Rob  Fender","Anthony  Dean","Antony  Bird","Philip  Uttley","Malcolm John Coe","Christian  Kaiser","Ian Michael McHardy"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
