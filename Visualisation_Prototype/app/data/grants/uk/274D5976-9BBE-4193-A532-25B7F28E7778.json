We now wish to exploit this discovery and translate it into clinical applications. To do so, we need to know much more about the characteristic of this molecule. This project is designed to do so. We have assembled a team of experts in the fields of molecular biology, cellular immunology and clinical trials, together with international collaborations. We hold intellectual property right to IL-35 and are in negotiation with a biotech company to develop IL-35 as a therapeutic reagent. We believe that this project will not only lead to greater understanding of the basic knowledge of how our immune system works but also to a potent therapeutic agent against some of the major diseases impacting on global health and economy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801198","grantId":"G0801198","fundValue":"733950","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Foo Yew Liew","coPersons":["Iain  McInnes","Xiaoqing  Wei","Gerard  Graham","Alirio Jose Melendez Romero"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
