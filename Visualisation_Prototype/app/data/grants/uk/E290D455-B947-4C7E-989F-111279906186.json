However, current models of these processes have been largely limited to studies of static scenes - the psychological understanding of how moving images are processed is in a relatively under-developed state. The motivation for this research project rests in the claim that the graphical conventions of film and video supply the viewer with a form of narrative. At its simplest this may involve no more than the encoding of movement relative to a background. At a more complex level the viewer must establish a coherent representation of space from what is frequently a series of disjointed visual images involving abrupt changes in viewpoint and changes in the position of objects, relative to the screen boundary and relative to other objects. Very little is known about how this &quot;perceived coherence&quot; is achieved, and virtually nothing known about the way even the simplest of perceptual events in this context are reflected in the eye movement record. We shall measure eye movements as people look at specially constructed video sequences manipulating the position of an actor relative to a defined background.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2585","grantId":"RES-000-22-2585","fundValue":"78422","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Alan  Kennedy","coPersons":["Benjamin  Tatler"],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
