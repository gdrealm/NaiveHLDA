The first is quantum physics, which describes physics in the atomic and subatomic domains. Quantum mechanics cumulated into the Standard Particle Model, which is described by: strong, weak and electroweak force carriers; three generation of fermion matter states; and the scalar Higgs sector. The second pillar of twentieth century physics is general relativity, which describes gravity on large scales. Despite their enormous success in their respective domains, general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible at a fundamental level. String theory combines general relativity and quantum mechanics in a self-consistent framework. String theory also gives rise to the gauge, matter and Higgs structures that are observed in the Standard Particle Model. String theory therefore provides a common framework that unifies all the known fundamental particles and interactions. In doing so, however, string theory gives rise to mathematical structures that are still poorly understood. By giving rise to the gauge and matter structures of the Standard Model string theory enables the development of a phenomenological framework to study quantum gravity. For this purpose three generation string models are constructed and one tries to accommodate naturally the Standard Model data. The theory appears to have many such consistent solutions, and currently it is not known how the theory chooses between them. The problem of the string vacuum selection is a vital issue in string theory. The approach based on the landscape interpretation has gained great attention in recent years, but overall is perceived as unsatisfactory from the mathematical and physical points of view. The string phenomenology group at Liverpool aims to develop an alternative approach, which stipulates that the vacuum is dynamically selected. For this purpose quasi-realistic string vacua have been constructed that are used to explore possible dynamical mechanisms that may select them. For this purpose one exploits the various duality symmetries that exist in string theory and tries to associate the vacuum with self-duality, Another vital avenue of exploration is how supersymmetry is broken in string theory. This issue is also an area of intense research activity in the last few years.Our aim is therefore to bring together a group of UK and international experts in string theory and phenomenology to explore the possibility of dynamical vacuum selection. Confirmed participants in the workshop include: Dieter Lust, Costas Kounnas, Ralph Blumenhagen, Ami Hanany, Steve Abel, Carlo Angelantonj, Alex Kehagias, Gabriele Honecker. Other potential participants that will be of great interest to the meeting include: Ignatios Antoniadis, Massimo Bianchi, Gianfranco Pradisi, Cumrun Vafa, Hiroshi Ooguri, Robert Dijkgraaff, Chris Hull, Andy Strominger, Ashoke Sen, Ofer Aharony. Our plan is to have a three day intensive workshop with 6 talks per day and the remaining time devoted to coordinated discussions lead by a designated person. We hope that the outcome of the workshop will be new research activity in the exploration of dynamical vacuum selection in string theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F055668/1","grantId":"EP/F055668/1","fundValue":"6926","fundStart":"2008-03-27","fundEnd":"2008-06-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Radu  Tatar","coPersons":["Steve  Abel","Alon Eliyahu Faraggi"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
