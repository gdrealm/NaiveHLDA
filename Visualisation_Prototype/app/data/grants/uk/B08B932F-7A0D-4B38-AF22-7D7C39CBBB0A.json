{"id":"B08B932F-7A0D-4B38-AF22-7D7C39CBBB0A","title":"Exploiting mouse genomics to understand the workings of the cochlea","abstractText":"Our aim is to understand how the different elements of the hearing organ, the cochlea, interact with each other by making measurements from mice that have modifications of specific proteins in the cochlea. Through discovering the workings of the cochlea using this approach we will understand the basis of some forms of congenital deafness and provide the basis for eventual treatments. Environmental and genetic factors as well as the effects of ageing all lead to damage of the cochlea and consequent irreparable loss of hearing. Genetic disorders account for deafness in approximately 1 in every 1,000 births; more than 25% of the population aged over 75 has significant hearing loss. Our research depends heavily on the work of our colleagues who identify the proteins and produce the genetically modified mice, including mouse models of human inherited deafness. In this multidisciplinary approach to the study of hearing and deafness, we have developed special techniques for measuring the electrical responses from the cochlea and nano-scale movements of its different components","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301057","grantId":"G0301057","fundValue":"951622","fundStart":"2005-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian John Russell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
