Although minorities in other Latin American countries won rights in the past two decades, Chile only recently acknowledged its multiethnic makeup and introduced ethnic group rights. Postcolonial society was forged around European aspirations, whilst indigenous presence was marginalised and in some cases erased.</p>\n\n<p>Over twenty years, Latin American indigenous social movements have become increasingly active, calling for national and international recognition of political, territorial and cultural rights. This shift brought subaltern groups into public spheres to remonstrate against injustices and call for greater rights. In Chile, Mapuches publicly campaign for rights. However, indigenous politics has little impact on national policymaking, and state discourses concede only minimal recognition. In this respect, Mapuche-state relations are distinct to other Latin American countries. In this research, educational reform is viewed as a window onto multiculturalism, nationhood, rights, racism and youth identities.</p>\n\n<p>The research examines these themes in three ways: young people’s identity formation in relation to education and nation; classrooms as a site of discourses on national and racial identity; and intercultural bilingual education (IBE) as an arena for the negotiation of rights, national identity, and power relations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3168","grantId":"RES-062-23-3168","fundValue":"242564","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been used to inform key stakeholders in Chilean education fields, especially in the Araucania Region, and in respect to Intercultural Bilingual Education. The document 'ESPACIOS DE EQUIDAD: Un an&aacute;lisis de las oportunidades y desigualdades educativas para j&oacute;venes mapuche de la Araucan&iacute;a,' provided Ministry of Education officials at the national IBE office and regional office with core research findings. A shorter Executive Summary Policy report was distributed to head-teachers, Ministry of Education staff and academic institutions in Santiago and Temuco. Our findings were also used to inform professional and political figures in regional education of the context in which they work in workshops and focus-groups. Our findings were also used to inform discussion with head-teachers of two participating schools. \nOur preliminary findings were also used to provide an initial feedback document to head teachers and staff in participating schools.

We were interested to know how young people saw themselves in relation to reforms in education that award more visibility to indigenous culture and knowledge, and to explore how realistic their hopes were about the job opportunities and forms of participation. In addition to plans for further academic publications, we anticipate that academic networks established during the research period will result in new international collaborations for future research. Arising out of this project, Sarah Radcliffe has been invited to collaborate with Dr M.E. Merino (Catholic University, Temuco, Chile) on a research project funded by FUNDECYT (National Fund for Science and Technology Development, Ministry of Education, Chile) on ‘Narrating place identities: Sociocultural places recreated by indigenous Mapuche families in Santiago, Chile’ (2014-17). \nAdditionally, we prepared a document of research findings to demonstrate the extended educational policy consequences of our research, that has been distributed among educationalists and related professionals in Chile.
