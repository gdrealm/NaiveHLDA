{"id":"AE549E02-86B6-42EC-946E-E46ADBAA174C","title":"Support for Particle Physics at Brunel University","abstractText":"This grant supports particle physics data analysis from the Compact Muon Solenoid general purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider CERN and the maintainance and operation of the Electromagneitc Calorimeter and the Silicon Tracker. It also provides support for work aimed at developing new techniques for the construction of megatonne detectors for neutrinos. Exploiting the recently commissioned Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the LHC will bring greatly enhanced understanding of the &quot;Standard Model&quot; of particle physics, particularly in the area of top-quark physics, searching for as yet undiscovered gauge bosons and supersymmetric particles, and ultimately shedding light on the mysterious &quot;Higgs&quot; boson which is connected with the origins of mass. Other STFC funded experimental work on to producing a narrow beam of muons is an essential precursor to building intense beams of these particles which will be used, by their decay in flight, to provide intense beams of neutrinos to be detected in large (million tonne) detectors. New techniques for building such detectors are also funded in part by this grant. Studying in detail the properties of neutrinos will illuminate the matter/anti-matter asymmetry of our universe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K001639/1","grantId":"ST/K001639/1","fundValue":"221742","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Peter Robert Hobson","coPersons":["AM  Khan","Joanne Elise  Cole"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
