We will build models of the skills-reading relationship to test key theories from the literature. For example speech processing skills could be dependent on neural encoding of basic sounds in the auditory pathway, thus speech and non-speech skills should significantly predict reading. In contrast, speech and non-speech skills may correlate highly, but only speech skills directly predict reading acquisition. </p>\n\n<p>Previous research and our pilot work suggest a shift in reliance from broad auditory skills to more specific speech skills in beginning to intermediate readers. We will examine broad, long term trends by comparing groups of beginning vs. intermediate readers and conduct a detailed analysis of changes in individual children tested at two stages of beginning to read. </p>\n\n<p>Finally the PhD project will focus on deficit groups selected from our large sample in order to investigate whether the severity of reading difficulty varies according to the age at which deficits were observed and the breadth of deficit (eg, specific speech-sound vs. more general auditory deficits).<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H031685/1","grantId":"ES/H031685/1","fundValue":"556268","fundStart":"2011-04-09","fundEnd":"2016-12-08","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  We will continue to communicate with the schools involved in our project and more broadly at public relations events and practitioner conferences with the aim that our findings will feed into more applied research on assessment and intervention.

We have used carefully designed tasks along with powerful statistical techniques to isolate the key components of reading related skills. We have found that multiple linguistic and non-linguistic factors contribute to reading development, and the skills that are critical for reading change as children progress from beginner to intermediate readers. Our research advances theory away from traditional univariate views towards multivariate developmental models of the relationship between cognitive skills and academic outcomes. Our research will foster greater appreciation of the variability in skills that contribute to reading development. In particular, that different subsets of skills constrain reading development at different ages. We have been communicating our findings to the schools involved in our project and more broadly at public relations events and practitioner conferences with the aim that our findings will feed into more applied research on assessment and intervention.
