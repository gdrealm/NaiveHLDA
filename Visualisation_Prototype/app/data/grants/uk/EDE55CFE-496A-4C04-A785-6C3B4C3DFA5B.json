Written in Yiddish and Polish, an extensive study of its subject matter (arranged marriage in a Krako'w shtetl) through the critical medium of translation, rehearsed reading and close analysis constitute a highly significant contribution to the growing body of research into representations of Jewish life in Eastern European literature. Research on the work of East European female playwrights is disappointingly rare, so this projects focus on a female playwright and her narrative focus on a female protagonist is particularly significant.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113109/1","grantId":"113109/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Teresa  Murjas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
