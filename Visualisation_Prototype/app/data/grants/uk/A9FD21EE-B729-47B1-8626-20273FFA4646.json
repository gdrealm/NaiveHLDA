{"id":"A9FD21EE-B729-47B1-8626-20273FFA4646","title":"Defining kisspeptin neuronal networks and function in the mouse hypothalamus (Resubmission).","abstractText":"Fertility in mammals is controlled by a small part of the brain called the hypothalamus. At puberty, a protein called kisspeptin initiates the release of a hormone called GnRH, which is required for normal growth of the genitalia and fertility. Kisspeptin is produced by nerves in two specific areas of the hypothalamus known as the AVPV and the ARC regions. This project will study the way in which kisspeptin producing neurons in these regions are connected to other parts of the brain. This will allow us to understand how the activity of kisspeptin neurons is controlled by signals from other regions of the brain. To do this, we will use a specialized virus that can only spread between neurons that are physically connected to each other. The virus will be activated in kisspeptin neurons and the movement of the virus tracked over time as it spreads to connected neurons. The identity of these neurons will be determined from their anatomical location and by looking at the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that they express. The functional significance of these connections will be determined by examining whether kisspeptin neurons can respond to these neurotransmitters. This project will provide us with fundamental knowledge about how fertility is regulated by hormonal changes and under different conditions such as day length, lactation and ageing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K003178/1","grantId":"BB/K003178/1","fundValue":"467163","fundStart":"2013-01-02","fundEnd":"2016-01-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"William Henry Colledge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" We have validated the transgenic mouse line that we are using for these studies. We have shown that the fluorescent neurons in the brains of these mice are the ones of interest (Kisspeptin expressing neurons). We have identified a batch of virus that will be suitable for progressing the viral tracing experiments forward in the final year. We have identified neuronal population that make synaptic connections to the Kisspeptin neurons. These regions include the subfornical organ, the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We are currently trying the determine the identity of these neurons by immunohistochemistry using antibodies for specific neuropeptides and receptors. We have also established the CLARITY method in my laboratory. This is a method that renders the whole brain transparent and this will help us in visualizing the neuronal circuitary in 3-dimensions. We are starting to highlight regions of the brain that contain neurons that make synaptic connections to Kisspeptin neurons. THis knowledge will be useful for other scientists to integrate into their research areas, particularly in the role feeding might play in regulating fertility. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
