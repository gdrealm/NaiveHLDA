This is particularly important for the aquatic environment into which a wide range of pollutants find their way, for example from pesticide run-off, industrial spills and excess nutrients from the release of untreated sewage. Pollution remains a major problem in the UK, with the Environment Agency estimating that up to 82% of rivers are 'at risk' from chemicals such as nitrate and phosphorus. Often adverse impacts to these pollutants can only be identified when they are sufficiently severe so as to affect survival of organisms and thus are identifiable at a late stage, after the damage is done. Attempts have been made to use more sensitive molecular indicators of early change (&quot;biomarkers&quot;) but these generally inform only on the levels of chemical exposure and have limited diagnostic or predictive power in relation to toxicity. Therefore the application of molecular biomarkers to environmental monitoring has been very limited to date.\nInspired by the tremendous success of recent technologies in biomedicine, we propose to develop an equivalent system for biomarker discovery in an environmental context, i.e., to develop biomarkers for application to environmental monitoring and diagnostics. These technologies can measure many thousands of biochemicals (including gene products and metabolites) in exposed organisms and by using mathematical and computational tools we can identify the underlying pathways to toxicity. These computational models will enable us to discover a set of genes and metabolites that can be highly predictive of an adverse impact on living organisms and at the same time provide a characteristic fingerprint of the type of pollutant class(es) responsible for such impact. We will study these effects in the water flea (Daphnia magna) which is already commonly used in the testing of contaminated water samples for toxicity. A wide range of chemicals representing major pollutant classes will be assessed and the molecular signatures will be compared to physiological responses in the water fleas. This will allow us to discover molecular signatures that have high diagnostic value in an ecological context, specifically telling us about the health and reproductive fitness of the water fleas. Also, the computational methods will allow us to discover molecular signatures that causally relate to the water fleas' health. This represents a major advance over current molecular biomarkers.\nOnce these characteristic fingerprints of molecules that are predictive of different toxicities are established, we will test such fingerprints to be predictive of the chemical makeup of water samples taken from polluted environments and with proven environmental impact. Such sampling will be in collaboration with our project partner, the Environment Agency. We will be &quot;blinded&quot; to the nature of these samples, enabling a robust evaluation of our ability to (1) determine the &quot;ecological status&quot; of the water and (2) diagnose the underlying pollutant class, thus enhancing the regulators' ability to target remedial measures. Following this validation of the new predictive biomarkers we will convert them into simple, rapid and economic assays, resulting in the provision of a new generation of environmental monitoring tools. After the project, and through our collaborations with end-users in the UK, Europe and North America, we will seek to pilot our molecular biomarkers alongside conventional biological and chemical monitoring, e.g. as part of the Water Framework Directive. In summary, this exciting project is interdisciplinary, involving fundamental biochemistry and physiology, toxicology, molecular biology and bioinformatics, and promises a significant advance in the tools available to monitor the health of our environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I028246/1","grantId":"NE/I028246/1","fundValue":"591516","fundStart":"2012-04-02","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  In this initial phase of the project we have already proven 'the demonstrable contribution that excellent research makes to society and the economy'. More specifically, we have shown that the diagnostic tools and the technology that we have developed (computational biology strategy) have the potential to transform R&amp;D in the water and home product industry.\n\nThe research contracts with Thames Water and Unilever mentioned in the first section of this document are the direct outcome of the science developed in this project. In the first case, the biomarker discovery approach has been used to identify residual chemical contamination in water samples from pilot water reprocessing plants in UK. In the second case the computational framework developed in this project has been applied to additional species of interest to Unilever.\n\nThis is an extremely important example of how advance last generation biomarkers can really be developed in industry settings to improve our ability to estimate health and environmental risk of chemical contamination. Such achievement, especially considering the financial commitment of the companies involved in supporting research in our group is not very common in this area. Therefore our achievements have great transformative value.\n\nWe also held an international workshop exploring the impact of our research in risk assessment. This was held at the University of Liverpool (home institution of Prof. Falciani, PI in this grant) in conjunction of the second iEOS conference, sponsored by the NERC (http://environmentalomics.org/ieos2014/). The outcome of the workshop will be published in a opinion paper, which is currently in preparation. The ideas developed in this workshop are in line with the efforts of the OECD in developing recommendations to use complex approaches for the definition of a comprehensive framework for organizing knowledge and support risk assessment. This framework has been originally defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its further development has the potential to change the way we perform risk assessment. This workshop has been co-chaired by one of the leading scientists in the U.S. EPA (Prof. Gary Anckley) a Unilever scientist (Dr. Geoff Hodges) and by Prof. Falciani (PI of this grant).

More precisely, the project aimed at linking molecular signatures represented by genome wide transcriptional and metabolic response, to chemicals mechanism of action and organism toxicity in Daphnia magna.\n\nOur initial finding represent a considerable increase in scientific knowledge and useful biomarkers that, once validated, may improve our ability to do water quality assessment. \n\nOur work proves that we can indeed identify biologically interpretable transcriptional signatures predictive of chemical class [1]. This is an important result since the biomarkers we have identified are able to detect with a high degree of certainty the presence of important class of contaminants in the water without the need of targeted chemical analysis. \n\nWe succeeded in attracting further interest in these findings from an important UK company in the water sector. These findings have in fact attracted the interest of Thames Water (http://www.thameswater.co.uk) that have made available a small amount of funding (&pound;45K) for a proof of concept study demonstrating the applicability of our system to monitor their water purification plants. This work, which is a direct output of this project grant is currently under way.\n\nMoreover, a more in depth analysis of the expression profiling data mentioned above did show that alterations in the intracellular concentration of calcium may be the molecular initiating event underlying basal toxicity in this important organism [2]. We have also generated data representing feeding and respiration rates in Daphnia control and exposed animals and we are now developing statistical models linking molecular response to these complex phenotypes.\n\nUsing a similar strategy we have successfully attracted the interest of Unilever (http://www.unilever.co.uk) that has financed a project aiming at expanding these findings to two additional species with the purpose of demonstrating that calcium alterations may be the general mechanism for basal toxicity. This project (&pound;400K) involved both Prof. Falciani (PI in this grant) and Prof. Mark Viant (Co-I in this grant) and it is currently under way.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Antczak P, Jo HJ, Woo S, Scanlan L, Poynton H, Loguinov A, Chan S, Falciani F*, Vulpe C*.

A systems biology approach reveals a novel calcium- dependent mechanism for basal toxicity in Daphnia magna. Under revision in Environ Sci Technol. The primary objective of this project was to develop a proof-of-principle diagnostic approach for predictive ecotoxicology. As such, we originally envisaged this project to link with the UK environmental agency, industry and non-governmental organisations.\n\nMore precisely, we envisage that our findings will be used to develop biomarkers to identify in contaminated waters the presence of relevant compounds without the use of targeted chemical analysis. We also envisage that the biomarkers we will see developing from our research will be informative of the specific toxicity mechanism.\n\nThis will be use by both pharmaceutical and home products industry to asses chemical risk. Water companies will adopt our approach for assessing the quality of the water supply they are responsible for while the national environmental agencies may use it for developing better environmental monitoring programs.
