{"id":"F11F775D-E4F1-4709-8DF2-98D64CCADD51","title":"A Spatial Microsimulation Model of Co-morbidity","abstractText":"<p>Health differentials across space arise due to the clustering of individuals sharing similar demographic profiles and lifestyle into areas where similar contextual characteristics are gathered. To establish the determinants of health status at both individual and small area level a range of data is required. This project will develop a spatial microsimulation to meet the information needs of health policymakers and practitioners. East Kent Hospital Trust (EKHT) has identified the increased rates of patients presenting with two or more diseases (co-morbidity) as a pressing issue that requires detailed spatial analysis. Co-morbidity is associated with a significant decline in both life expectancy and quality and increased costs in the provisioning of health services.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Utilising the Health Survey and the Census of England 2011, this project will develop a spatial microsimulation model of co-morbidity for individuals with cardio-vascular disease, diabetes and obesity. This model will be validated, in collaboration with EKHT, to develop a case-study of co-morbidity for the area. This will inform health policy in East Kent by identifying areas of under/over-utilisation, so that local causes such as demographic, socio-economic deterrents on the demand side and ‘intervention’ behaviours on the supply side can be investigated further, with a view to identifying and sharing best practise.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K004433/1","grantId":"ES/K004433/1","fundValue":"160076","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karyn  Morrissey","coPersons":["Paul  Williamson","Alex  Singleton"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
