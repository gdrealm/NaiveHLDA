{"id":"FBE96261-FF35-4ED1-BBDE-71E7F1C700A9","title":"Evolutionary Design of Collision-based Computing Schemes in Two-dimensional Cellular Automata","abstractText":"We wish to evolve novel types of unstructured computational devices, where computation is based on collision between gliders (cellular-automaton analogues of breathers, solitons, defects) travelling in uniform space free from heterogeneity imposed by traditional computing architectures. A significant contribution --- nature-inspired design solutions and computing architectures --- will be made to the high-potential field of novel and emerging computational paradigms and architectures, and non-classical computation. Results of the project will be deployed in future automatic design and manufacturing of architecture-less high-performance computers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E005241/1","grantId":"EP/E005241/1","fundValue":"95380","fundStart":"2006-10-16","fundEnd":"2007-10-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Adamatzky","coPersons":["Larry  Bull"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
