{"id":"79E87E92-8DCA-43A7-90B6-76E0EFCB4121","title":"ENDOGENOUS SUPPRESSION OF LUNG INFLAMMATION","abstractText":"When we breathe, we frequently inhale tiny particles that have potential to injure our lungs, especially bacteria or their components. Remarkably, however, our lungs usually resist this injury and do not develop inflammation, the influx into tissues of white blood cells that are ?licensed to kill? bacteria. This resistance to the induction of inflammation is usually a good thing as white blood cells can be indiscriminate killers, inducing undesirably persistent injury of the healthy lung in various inflammatory lung diseases such as bronchitis. Our work indicates that scavenger cells in the lung are triggered to generate anti-inflammatory, protective responses by a cell surface molecule called ?alpha-v integrin?. The trigger to protective responses is binding to scavenger cell alpha-v integrin of cells undergoing natural cell death or ?apoptosis?. These arise naturally in the lung, but their production is increased by lung injury, pointing to a negative feedback loop in healthy lungs ? inhaled bacteria trigger lung cell death, then binding of dying cells to scavenger cells via alpha-v integrin, and triggering of protective responses. We want to characterise the cellular and molecular mechanisms that constitute this protective system. We hope to uncover new insights into the mechanisms, prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory lung diseases","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802069","grantId":"G0802069","fundValue":"644630","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Savill","coPersons":["Christopher  Haslett"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
