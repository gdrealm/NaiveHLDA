Chemicals released by activated eosinophils damage the delicate airway structures and lead to the airways becoming 'twitchy' and narrowed, causing wheezing and breathlessness. Eventually, this can lead to permanent structural damage, and the condition becomes very difficult to treat. Many of the established treatments for asthma, such as steroids, are thought to work by reducing the numbers of eosinophils getting into the airways, and by preventing their activation once they get there. However, it is difficult to study this problem and monitor the effects of these treatments directly, as taking tissue samples (biopsies) from the lung airways is unpleasant, can only look at a very small part of the lung which may not be representative of the overall disease process, and can cause major side effects. The goal of this project is to develop an eosinophil scanning technique that can be used to study the involvement of eosinophils in asthma, and other diseases that eosinophils may contribute to (for example, some forms of skin disease such as allergic dermatitis, some types of cancer such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, and some types of inflammatory bowel disease). We aim to purify eosinophils from blood samples, tag them with tiny amounts of harmless radioactivity (111indium), re-inject them back into the bloodstream, and use sensitive detectors to follow how they circulate in the body. We have already shown that this can be done safely and successfully in healthy volunteers. We wish to progress our studies by performing these same scans in patients with asthma. This will allow us to see how eosinophils behave in asthmatics, for example it will show us how long they stay in the bloodstream, whether they are more likely to become lodged in the lung and move into the airways, and how they are finally disposed of. This has never been done before in humans, and will provide new information on how these cells behave in the bloodstream and in the lung tissues in both health and disease. Once we have established these important properties of how eosinophils behave, we will study whether we can detect accumulation of eosinophils that we have deliberately caused by placing a purified extract of house dust mite (used widely and safely in clinical practise for skin allergy testing and also for placing in the airways as we intend) directly into a segment of the lung. Finally, we will test whether we can detect an effect of drugs such as steroids that are used to treat asthma on how eosinophils accumulate and behave in the lungs of asthmatic patients. If we can detect such effects, this will be very useful to monitor treatments and to monitor whether new drugs being developed to treat asthma are working. \nOur group has over 20 years of experience in developing these techniques in another type of white blood cell, the neutrophil, to the point that neutrophil scanning is now used routinely in clinical practice to detect infections and to assess inflammation. Applying this expertise to the eosinophil will not only supply new data on the function and fate of these cells in healthy people and those with asthma but may also provide a simple way to quantify and view eosinophilic inflammation in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J00345X/1","grantId":"MR/J00345X/1","fundValue":"399473","fundStart":"2012-04-12","fundEnd":"2015-06-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Edwin Roy Chilvers","coPersons":["Neda  Farahi","Adrien Michael Peters","Kottekkattu  Balan","Alison  Condliffe"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
