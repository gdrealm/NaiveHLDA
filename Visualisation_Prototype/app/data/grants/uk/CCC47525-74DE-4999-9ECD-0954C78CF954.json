{"id":"CCC47525-74DE-4999-9ECD-0954C78CF954","title":"Mental Control and the Self: Ironic Effects of Thought Suppression on the Perception, Behaviour, and Memory of the Self","abstractText":"<p>An ever-increasing literature on social cognition suggests that behaviour is influenced by cognitive processes that operate outside of conscious awareness. Priming research has demonstrated that once a concept becomes mentally accessible, it can influence one's responses towards others. For example, people 'primed' with (ie, exposed to) the concept of 'helpfulness' have been found to behave in a more helpful manner.</p>\n\n<p>Research on thought suppression has established that one way in which concepts become accessible is through their active suppression. That is, the very act of trying not to think about something makes it more likely that one will eventually think about it a great deal. This 'rebound' effect has been demonstrated in a variety of clinical and social contexts. For example, people asked to suppress stereotypic thoughts of African Americans eventually rely on those stereotypes to a greater extent.</p>\n\n<p>To date, these effects have only been demonstrated on responses to others. Surprisingly, the question of whether rebound effects might also influence judgments and behaviours related to the self has not been asked. This project investigates whether attempting to suppress thoughts of social concepts (eg, traits or stereotypes) leads participants to apply those concepts to themselves.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0622","grantId":"RES-062-23-0622","fundValue":"129886","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2009-03-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Natalie  Wyer","coPersons":["Timothy John Hollins","Giuliana  Mazzoni"],"organisation":"University of Plymouth","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
