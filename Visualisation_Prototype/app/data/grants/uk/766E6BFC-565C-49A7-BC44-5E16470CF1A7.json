By this we mean tensions between controlling and regulating through technical means like performance data and the rules followed by inspectors in their school assessments, in contrast with using expert knowledge, judgement and persuasion as part of self-regulation. </li>\n\n <li>Analysing the 'discourse' or rhetoric of inspection, and what it reveals about tensions in judgement and evidence, by mapping the interrelationships of inspection at different system levels and across Sweden, Scotland and England, with a focus on transnational policy learning. </li>\n\n <li>We will also map inspection processes within local authorities/municipalities and between local policy spaces and schools. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It will focus on a process that has become taken for granted in much public sector provision, and look at it as a way of shaping and steering education, and the behaviours and assumptions of the people who work in education (including the inspectors themselves).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2241-A","grantId":"RES-062-23-2241-A","fundValue":"382989","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer  Ozga","coPersons":["Linda  Croxford","John  Clarke","Sotiria  Grek","Martin  Lawn"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
