{"id":"E8BD211C-9EC8-4F39-8D37-74D475F1C1BF","title":"Functional Annotation of the Sheep Genome","abstractText":"Animals and humans are made up of many different kinds of organs and cells, each of which requires the actions of a subset of the genes in the genome. We currently know the function of only a subset of the genes in the genome. Much of what we know comes from studies of rodents but their biology is quite different to humans and their small size compromises their use. In the current study we will examine how individual genes are used in every tissue and cell of the sheep. From that information, we will be able to identify sets of genes that are always used together, and infer the function of genes of unknown function from the company they keep. That information will, in turn, allow us to interpret studies of the genetics and genomics of large animals, including humans (this study could not be done on a human). This will, in turn, inform the rational breeding of livestock for improved performance and welfare through selection for disease resistance. It will also give us a better understanding of the basic biology of humans that can be translated in better lifelong health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L001209/1","grantId":"BB/L001209/1","fundValue":"1056810","fundStart":"2013-10-16","fundEnd":"2017-05-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Arthur Hume","coPersons":["Michael Bryan Watson","Christopher Bruce Whitelaw","Alan  Archibald","Ivan  Morrison","Kim Macgregor Summers"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
