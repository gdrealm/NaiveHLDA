The historyleading up to this point is instructive. Curves have been studied for hundreds of years, withthe modern treatment evolving in the 19th century. The classification of surfaces was achievedby the Italian masters at the beginning of the 20th century, and these have been the subject ofcontinued intensive study until the present day. The next dimension up, 3-folds, was immediately considered, and in the 1930s another Italian master, Gino Fano, presented an analysis of the firstclass of 3-folds, nowadays known as `Fano 3-folds'. Nevertheless, serious conceptual problemshounded the subject of 3-folds for 70 years, until developments in the 1980s opened the floodgates and they entered the mainstream. Early work of Iskovskikh in the 1970s (reworking and correcting the work of Fano) and then of Mori and Mukai in the 1980s (incorporating the new orthodoxy, nowadays known as `Mori theory') provided important impetus. The influence of physics was also particularly important, perhaps especially in relation to the class of so-called Calabi--Yau 3-folds.Our project is to work with the next dimension up again, the 4-folds. Once more, we propose to investigate the natural initial case, the Fano 4-folds. There are three key influences that maketoday an especially exciting time to start such a project. First, the recent work in the foundationsof 4-folds---the existence of 4-fold flips---echoes Mori's central result of the 1980s on 3-fold flips.Second, Calabi--Yau 3-folds are intimately connected with Fano 4-folds, giving a direct connectionto the ambitions of contemporary physicists. And finally, we propose to employ recent work of Reid, one of the founders of the modern approach to 3-folds in the 1980s, that hints how we may apply the battery of 3-fold methods to the study of 4-folds. It is a very exciting time to be exploring this new field.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E000258/1","grantId":"EP/E000258/1","fundValue":"211886","fundStart":"2007-02-14","fundEnd":"2010-02-13","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The training of mathematicians with skills in computing and data management was a key component of this award.

These are the famous 95 hypersurfaces that have reappeared repeatedly over the past 30 years as a central part of geometry. This project completed the corresponding 4-dimensional classification of 10482 Fano 4-fold hypersurfaces, and made the data available electronically on the Graded Ring Database webpage. The pr The computer packages are publicly available (also to use freely on-line), so many users are simply not known. But as an indication, Brown and Kasprzyk (both employed on this project) recently applied these packages to coding theory. They discovered new codes that match or improve the best known minimum distances - and their results have quickly been taken up and extended by other researchers worldwide. In practical terms, a handful of new codes is perhaps not the main point, but the scope to us Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
