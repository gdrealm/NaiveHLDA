{"id":"C97EAFD7-A0C9-4A1B-8BFE-673EC17E694A","title":"Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research - University of Kent","abstractText":"Security has been an area of research strength in the University for several years. \nThere are strong technical research groups in the Faculty of Sciences: in the School of Engineering and Digital Arts with work on identity management; and in the School of Computing, with work including trust management and malware analysis. Staff such as Prof Andy King and Prof David Chadwick have very strong international profiles, have attracted significant external funding and are included in the Faculty of Sciences' plan as an area for future expansion. Another new lecturer in Security has been appointed in Computing to start in January 2015.\nWe have established an Interdisciplinary Centre for Cyber Security in 2012, which brings together the technical experience in Sciences with researchers from across the Social Sciences Faculty, in particular from highly rated Schools of Law, Psychology, and Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research. This centre provides a focus for cross-disciplinary research in end-to-end security, including human and social factors in addition to the technical solutions. Several cross-discipline externally funded research projects are in place, and many more in preparation.\n\nThis proposal aims to support the Advanced Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research through financial contributions to events, publicity material including webpages, and the day to day running of the centre through time for its director and administrative support.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N002997/1","grantId":"EP/N002997/1","fundValue":"19854","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eerke Albert  Boiten","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
