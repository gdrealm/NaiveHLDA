The study found that people in poverty often experience shame because they cannot afford fully to participate in society and because they are shamed by public agencies and by language used by politicians and the media. Poverty-related shame limits individual agency and may therefore help perpetuate poverty.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of global discussions about renewal of the Millennium Development Goals, the project aims to inform public, media and policy debates around poverty. A core component of the project is a web-based resource designed to sensitise policy makers, practitioners and the wider public to the psychosocial consequences of poverty.&nbsp; Partnerships with ATD-Fourth World, Mediae, the Media Trust and Pegasus Theatre will generate new, engaging and thought provoking content for wide dissemination, while parallel policy work will seek to establish and promote principles and a template to ensure that social protection and welfare policies promote rather than undermine human dignity and agency.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005529/1","grantId":"ES/K005529/1","fundValue":"100215","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert LLoyd Walker","coPersons":["Elaine  Chase"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
