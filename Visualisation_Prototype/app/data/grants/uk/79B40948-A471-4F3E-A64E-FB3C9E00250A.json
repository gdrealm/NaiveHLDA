{"id":"79B40948-A471-4F3E-A64E-FB3C9E00250A","title":"EPSRC Workshop on Cellular Automata Theory and Applications","abstractText":"We are proposing to organise an international workshop on cellular automata, an interdisciplinary field, whose general goal might be summarised as the quest for theoretical constructs, computational solutions and practical implementations of novel and powerful models of discrete world. This workshop will bring together work that focuses on advanced theoretical constructions, experimental prototypes and genuine implementations of cellular-automaton models, computing devices and paradigms. The workshop will make an incredibly strong impact on the development of computational models of complex systems, and put the UK at the leading level of research in computational modelling of complex systems, parallel computing and theory of mathematical machines.Most developed and even developing countries have several established groups undertaking on cellular automata theory and applications. There is almost none in UK. This is because there is no culture or scientific community of cellular-automaton experts established in UK. Analysis of publications shows that just few insulated individuals do publish cellular-automaton related papers in top peer reviewed international journals, compared to hundreds if not thousands of papers originated in USA, France, Germany and Japan. The fact is particularly sad because several leading experts in cellular automata, including famous Stephen Wolfram (New Kind of Science), are British-born but working overseas. Various workshops and conference on cellular automata were organized in Poland (Gdansk, 2005), Germany (Karlsruhe, 2000, 2004, Rauischholzhausen, 1996; Dagstuhl, 1995); The Netherlands (Amsterdamm, 2004); Belgium (Leuven, 2003); Czech Republic (Prague, 2002); Japan (Osaka, 2000; Yokohama, 2001); France (Perpignan, 2006; Lyon, 1999); Chile (Santiago, 1998); Italy (Trieste, 1998; Garnano, 1997); Switzerland (Geneva, 2002); Canada (Ontario, 2007). Despite the fact that Europe is swarmed with cellular-automata related events, England still remains relatively uninvolved. By organizing an EPSRC funded workshop in Bristol (UK) we will enable UK-based researchers, academics and students to get a sense of novel results, concepts and paradigms of cellular automaton theory, delivered by world-leading invited speakers, encourage UK-based scientists currently working on cellular automata problems to come together, attract attention of researchers from natural sciences to cost-efficient techniques of cellular-automaton modelling, and will beacon industrialists in appreciating high-potential of cellular-automaton computing architectures.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F042442/1","grantId":"EP/F042442/1","fundValue":"49694","fundStart":"2008-04-08","fundEnd":"2009-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Adamatzky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
