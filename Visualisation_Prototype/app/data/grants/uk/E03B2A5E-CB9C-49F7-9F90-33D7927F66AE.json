More than 100 million metric tonnes of tomatoes are produced each year, and in the United States and Western Europe it is the most important fruit in the human diet in terms of quantity consumed. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is known to be essential for human health providing protection from heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and certain cancers. This project focuses on understanding the molecular basis of fruit quality attributes in partnership with Syngenta, a company with a world wide tomato business. The strategy will be to compare the molecular events occurring in the fruits of wild type and naturally occurring non-ripening mutants of tomato. The regulatory genes underlying these mutations have recently been identified. The challenge is to connect the emerging network of regulatory factors with their down-stream effectors and thereby identify control points for the various ripening pathways, for example, colour development and fruit softening. We will achieve this aim by profiling the gene expression and metabolite pools of wild type and mutant tomato fruit at a wide range of stages of fruit development. Mathematical modelling techniques will then be used to associate regulators with down-stream effects and metabolites, to produce an initial regulatory framework. These models can then be tested experimentally by silencing selected transcription factors in transgenic plants and determining how this affects the patterns of gene expression, metabolite pools and ripening. This will allow us to build dynamic models to describe this important developmental process. Our industrial partner will use the information to breed improved tomato varieties.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F005458/1","grantId":"BB/F005458/1","fundValue":"218936","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Charles Hodgman","coPersons":["Graham  Seymour","Andrew  Wood"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
