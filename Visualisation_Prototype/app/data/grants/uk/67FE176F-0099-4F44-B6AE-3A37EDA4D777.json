{"id":"67FE176F-0099-4F44-B6AE-3A37EDA4D777","title":"Augmented urbanity and smart technologies: how &quot;smart&quot; are our cities becoming?","abstractText":"We intend to work in two interconnected research areas - smart technologies and smart cities -, both important to understand the enormous urban transformations in the past two or three decades. These areas are grounded on our experiences as researchers, reflected in books, peer-reviewed publications, and conferences. The expected outcomes of this research will be of three main types:\n(a) Institutional cooperation: the construction of a permanent link between the four universities for the exchanging of students, future studies and joint research projects;\n(b) Joint publication: we expect that, at least, the main investigators will be able to produce one written outcome of this experience and, probably, 2 articles to be published in journals of relevance to the field of urban studies.\n(c) Students' interchange: postgraduate students will strongly benefit from this experience of thematic and methodological exchange, and this is expected to reflect on a better quality of their dissertations and further publications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/N000013/1","grantId":"ES/N000013/1","fundValue":"49513","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  MarvinAndres  Luque","coPersons":["Alessandro  Aurigi"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
