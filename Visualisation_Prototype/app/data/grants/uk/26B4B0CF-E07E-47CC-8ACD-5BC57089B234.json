{"id":"26B4B0CF-E07E-47CC-8ACD-5BC57089B234","title":"ORACLE follow-up study","abstractText":"The ORACLE Children Study is the UK follow-up at 7 years of age of nearly 9000 children whose mothers joined the ORACLE trial in pregnancy. Women with either early broken waters or threatened preterm labour were randomised to antibiotics (erythromycin or augmentin) either singularly or in combination. Research has shown that a proportion of premature births are due to mild, unnoticed infection in the membranes surrounding the baby. Therefore, in theory giving women antibiotics could have beneficial effects on these women and their children\nThis ORACLE Children Study will look at whether disability (both presence and severity) is reduced in the children of groups of women who took the antibiotics by using a questionnaire to parent s. It will also find out if there are any differences in educational attainment by using the results of the standard National Tests at Key Stage 1 which all 7 year old children in England do.. It is important for both parents and clinicians to know, when faced with a potential premature birth and its consequences, whether antibiotics improve not only survival in the short term but also health and development in the longer term.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9226450","grantId":"G9226450","fundValue":"4930350","fundStart":"1993-10-11","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher John Mayne","coPersons":["David  Jones","Alison  Salt","D  Taylor","Peter  Brocklehurst","Neil  Marlow"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
