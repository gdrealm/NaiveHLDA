Both governments provide this support with the principal aim of restricting the trafficking of cocaine destined for Europe via the Caribbean. In Europe, cocaine use and cocaine-related deaths are at historically high levels.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to evaluate the impact of counter-drugs assistance policies and the range of criteria on which their effectiveness can be judged. This will entail an examination of how costs and benefits are distributed between donor and recipient countries, allowing for comparison of UK and Dutch approaches. Evidence is drawn from an extensive range of interviews, conducted to ascertain the perspectives of those who initiate and those who receive and implement counter-drugs assistance programmes involving international cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>The research findings contribute to contemporary debates on drug policy as well as to understanding interconnections between issues and policy options in the wider regional political economy of the Caribbean. The study represents a source of information on which policy-makers can chart the course of future policy that incorporates the use of counter-drugs assistance.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2411","grantId":"RES-000-22-2411","fundValue":"62230","fundStart":"2007-12-03","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin Brian  Elvins","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
