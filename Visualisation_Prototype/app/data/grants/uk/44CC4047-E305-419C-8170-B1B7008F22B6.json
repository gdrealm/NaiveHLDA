Family studies can also determine whether a mother?s genes affect the health of her child through inheritance by the child or presence in the mother. For practical reasons it is often difficult to collect data from all the members of a family, so statistical methods can be used to fill in the missing data. In recent years development of such methods has fallen behind similar methods designed for unrelated subjects. This project will extend our previous work on missing data in family studies, developing several new methods that will be applied to a number of collaborative studies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000718","grantId":"G1000718","fundValue":"294196","fundStart":"2011-01-17","fundEnd":"2014-07-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Dudbridge","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
