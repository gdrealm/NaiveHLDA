{"id":"FFE2323C-9168-49F1-9750-6B906D20FEA3","title":"Bilateral Australia: Trauma and unwanted memories","abstractText":"Intrusive memories are a core feature of human response to traumatic events.&nbsp; Such memories are called intrusive, as they are unintentional and typically emotionally intense. They occur frequently after trauma, and are a hallmark symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a clinical condition initiated by exposure to trauma. Intrusive memories are common across normal and psychologically disordered populations, but they are particularly important in PTSD where they make people repeatedly aware of aversive trauma memories that they would rather avoid. Despite the importance of intrusions, the exact nature and mechanisms underpinning these sorts of memories are not yet fully understood. The aim of this research is to undertake a systematic investigation into intrusive memories in the context of trauma and to examine their phenomenology and retrieval mechanisms. Electronic diaries (Palms) will be used to allow participants to note when intrusive memories occur, along with mental and contextual events that trigger them. This naturalistic form of research appears essential because intrusions occur in the context of real life activity rather than the potentially artificial surrounds of the laboratory. Further studies will manipulate the nature of intrusion triggers, and test strategies of managing distressing intrusive memories.\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2544","grantId":"RES-000-22-2544","fundValue":"76866","fundStart":"2008-06-15","fundEnd":"2009-06-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Birgit  Kleim","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
