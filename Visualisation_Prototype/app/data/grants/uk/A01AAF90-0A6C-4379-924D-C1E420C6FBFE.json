The network will be built through two interdisciplinary workshops exploring conceptual and methodological issues, looking at how scholarly frameworks affect, as much as they are affected by, the politics and the lived experience of cultural heritage. Two research organisations will host the workshops: the Archaeology Institute and Museum at the National University of Tucum&aacute;n (Argentina) in April 2011, and the Archaeology Department at Exeter University in September 2011. Funds are requested for 14 months to organise and carry out the workshops, develop the network discussions, and generate the outputs.\\n\\nIt has become increasingly evident that scholarly practices are embedded in the processes they seek to understand. Cultural politics have increasingly challenged the traditional roles of academic scholarship in the last decades, a situation that has prompted the development of ethically aware and culturally sensitive innovative research practices worldwide. In South America and NW Argentina in particular, valuable efforts by individuals and small research teams have resulted in promising results, yet their long-term impact is at risk due to the absence of interdisciplinary dialogue and the relative marginality from the global networks that channel ideas and resources. There is therefore a pressing need to insert the region within a broader context within the international flow of resources and information. Local experiences and approaches can inform academic practice and policy-making beyond its boundaries, as much as they can benefit from insights drawn from comparable contexts. The workshops will gather specialists in a variety of disciplines (archaeology, socio-cultural anthropology, history, cultural and linguisti studies), whose expertise includes research settings as different as the UK, South America, USA, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East. The participants share a common research interest in identity, material culture, and the socio-politics of research, maximising the potential for mutually beneficial synergies. The wide range of empirical and theoretical vantage points will foster novel creative thinking and analysis. \\n\\nWhile broad in scope and potentially relevant for a variety of contexts, this exploration will be tied to very practical matters. Participants from the University of Tucum&aacute;n collaborate with the Quilmes indigenous community (NW Argentina). Important advances have been achieved, despite being primarily based on fluctuating material and conceptual support. Partly due to these efforts, the Quilmes community has recently regained full management of their iconic archaeological site, the largest archaeological site in Argentina and one of the focal points of native resistance against the Spanish in the 16th century. The project thus aims first at providing an academic space for discussion and knowledge development within a community-oriented setting. This will in turn be a platform to catalyse a sustainable future collaboration with this community. The insight gained through the interactions with UK and other experts will be invaluable for this purpose. The results of the project will be disseminated in a high-ranked refereed journal article, providing an exemplary case study and discussing new pathways for good research practice. The design of a project website and a community-oriented brochure will assist in the flow of communication between the involved academics, and between them and the indigenous stakeholders.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I013644/1","grantId":"AH/I013644/1","fundValue":"32233","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marisa  Lazzari","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
