These are called counterfactual thoughts. Children seem to start thinking counterfactually at around 3-4 years old. This project will investigate the executive processes that may underpin such thinking. Executive functions are domain general processes that control thought and behaviour, and the two that seem most relevant to counterfactual thinking are inhibitory control (the ability to ignore potentially interfering cognitions or actions) and working memory (holding in mind relevant information).</p>\n\n<p>A series of four experiments will examine the relationship between two types of counterfactual tasks (counterfactual conditionals, which involve a narrative, and counterfactual syllogisms, which are more abstract logical problems) and executive functions. The end product will be an account of the development of counterfactual thinking that will be of interest to developmental and cognitive psychologists, as well as a broader cognitive science audience.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1683","grantId":"RES-000-22-1683","fundValue":"40052","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have informed further academic research on children's and adults' cognitive development.

We also showed that several measures of counterfactual thinking produced comparable findings and we investigated and published a failure to replicate one measure. Our findings will inform researchers on children's and adults' cognition. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
