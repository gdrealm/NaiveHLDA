The regulation and consequences of these changes in cell cycle time and gene accessibility will be investigated in detail in chick and mouse embryos. We also plan to carry out a screen to identify further changes in gene expression regulated by this signal switch. \n\nThis work will contribute to our basic understanding of the molecular basis of neural differentiation. It will also inform protocols for directing stable neuron production in embryonic stem cells and therefore help to develop therapies for treatment of neural injury or disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600234","grantId":"G0600234","fundValue":"1345230","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kate Gillian Storey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
