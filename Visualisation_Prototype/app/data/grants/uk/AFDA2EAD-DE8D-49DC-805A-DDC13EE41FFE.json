Please note: the summary should be described in language that can be understood by the non-specialist readerThis application is on behalf of the organising committee for Control 2006 Conference. The proposal and costing have been presented to the Conference Organising Committee, discussed and approved. A sub-committee comprising of David Murray-Smith, Reza Katebi and Bill Leithead undertook to organise the postgraduate workshop, and it was therefore agreed that the most straightforward approach was to make this application from University of Strathclyde on behalf of all the people involved in the organisation of the conference with which the workshop is associated. Further information about Control 2006 is provided below and details of the conference, its organising committee and international programme committee can be found at http://www.controI2006.org.The workshop is a cost-effective means to offer targeted training to postgraduate students working in Control and Instrumentation, and also to enhance the long term health of the professional community in this area of research. The workshop lasts for two days (26 and 27 August 2006) before the start of Control 2006. It is anticipated that 40 research students take part and the entire workshop participant will be invited to attend the Control 2006 Conference.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D507332/1","grantId":"EP/D507332/1","fundValue":"13361","fundStart":"2006-08-26","fundEnd":"2006-09-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Reza  Katebi","coPersons":["William Edward Leithead","David James  Murray-Smith"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
