There is emerging evidence that the consequences of such nutrition during pregnancy can be passed to grandchildren even when their daughters have adequate nutrition during pregnancy. These effects have been replicated in the offspring of rats fed a diet with reduced protein content during pregnancy. We have identified a mechanism by which poor nutrition during pregnancy can result in changes to how genes are controlled in the fetus and give which result in increased risk of disease in a future generation. This process of gene control is called epigenetics. In this project we will use the rat model to investigate the mechanism by which the diet of the mother changes the epigenetic control of genes in the next three generations of offspring. We already have evidence that this involves an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase-1 in the first generation and now we need to determine whether this enzyme is involved in subsequent generations. We have also shown adding folic acid to the mother's diet prevents changes in the epigenetic control of genes in the first generations. We will investigate whether folic acid can prevent changes in epigenetic control in successive generations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F013043/1","grantId":"BB/F013043/1","fundValue":"463006","fundStart":"2008-06-16","fundEnd":"2011-06-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Charles Burdge","coPersons":["Mark Adrian Hanson","Karen  Lillycrop"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" There is evidence that risk of non-communicable, metabolic diseases in humans can be induced by environmental factors during development, including poor nutrition, and can be transmitted between generations through non-genomic processes.

Translation of these initial observations into non-academic applications will require further studies. The findings provide a novel perspective on how organisms may adapt to new environments. In the context of the current epidemic of cardio-meatabolic disease, these results suggest that, if replicated in humans, projections of disease incidence and / or severity may be down graded fo Environment,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
