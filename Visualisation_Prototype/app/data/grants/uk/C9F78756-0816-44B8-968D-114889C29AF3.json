The samples were returned to Earth by the Hayabusa Mission. These samples may contain organic matter and the majority of this will be macromolecular in nature. The samples will be very small and techniques that access the major organic component are essential. Novel on-line hydrogenation equipment at Imperial College London can effectively liberate this material for analysis. The technique will be assessed for analysis of asteroid samples. Small meteorite samples will be examined and, where possible, asteroid sample returns. The findings will improve our understanding of life and its distribution in the Universe.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000551/1","grantId":"ST/K000551/1","fundValue":"153620","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Andrew Sephton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
