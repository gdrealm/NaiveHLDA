A 'Digging Deeper' participatory programme involving youth groups expressing their perceptions of life in mining settlements in various art forms explores the local population's consciousness of their cultural and social identity transformation. </p>\n\n<p>The overall aim is to disseminate knowledge of actual as opposed to rumoured outcomes of mining livelihoods to facilitate the formulation of policies tailored to current realities. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H033521/1","grantId":"ES/H033521/1","fundValue":"413137","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah Fahy  Bryceson","coPersons":["Danny  MacKinnon"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
