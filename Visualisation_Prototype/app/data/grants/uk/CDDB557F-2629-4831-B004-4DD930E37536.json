{"id":"CDDB557F-2629-4831-B004-4DD930E37536","title":"The Professions in Nineteenth-Century Britain","abstractText":"<p>The professions were an expanding section of the middle-class in Victorian Britain. As the number of professional men and women grew and their influence increased, it has been argued that they developed a distinctive view of the positive role that the state should play in reducing social and economic inequality and that this had a detrimental effect on Britain’s economic performance in the decades before the Great War and continues to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The present study aims to test this hypothesis by taking a sample of 1,000 individuals recorded in the 1851 census as being a member of the professions and reconstructing their own and their descendants’ biographies through three generations. By collecting then analysing a wide variety of biographical details about members of the cohort&nbsp; -&nbsp; their social origins, education, choice of marriage partner, children’s and grandchildren’s occupations, wealth, religious and political affiliation, leisure activities, etc -&nbsp; it is hoped to answer definitively whether the Victorian professions formed a separate caste within the wider middle-class with its owns values, interests and social practices. Account is taken in the study of the possibility of regional differences and the cohort has been drawn from nine British towns with different profiles.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005138/1","grantId":"ES/K005138/1","fundValue":"593695","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  (1)To date the limited material publicly accessible through our website (www.victorianprofessions.ox.ac.uk) has been accessed by a number of family historians and genealogical researchers with whom we have entered into profitable exchange of data.

They received informative and encouraging feedback and made contact with historians in other countries with cognate interests.

There appears to be a correlation, though one yet to be firmly substantiated between wealth, location, education, age of profession and the development of a professional project. The project has been going for only ten months. We expect that in the course of the coming year our findings to date and our expectations will be refined and enriched.
