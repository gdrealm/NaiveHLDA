We shall also be examining how technology design can be combined with the design of sustainable business models in parallel design activities, and developing new sustainable business models for rural co-operatives.The software and business systems will be designed as a collaboration between UK researchers and local software and business development organisations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E027563/2","grantId":"EP/E027563/2","fundValue":"12784","fundStart":"2007-11-02","fundEnd":"2009-03-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Matthews","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
