This is of major importance because (1) urine patches are a significant source of N2O; ca. 19% of the total N2O losses from agriculture, and (2) N2O losses from upland systems are highly uncertain. Current methods of estimating emissions from urine patches ignore the effect that livestock diet, soil type, soil physico-chemical properties and climate have on N2O fluxes. For example, urine N content varies with protein intake, and the metabolic product in the urine (known to affect N2O production) is affected by what livestock graze. Vegetation in different upland areas varies enormously, with diet selection operating in both systems. Hence it is important to link urine composition to animal movement and diet selection.\nSoils in the uplands are dominated by peats and podzols with high carbon content and low pH, influenced by cool, wet climates and topography. These factors will also exert systematic controls on rates of N2O fluxes which are likely to be exacerbated following urine deposition. Moreover, the vegetation in different upland areas influences stocking densities and the consequent potential for urine patch overlap, resulting in disproportionate N2O emissions in areas receiving high N loading rates. Soil in these areas can become compacted due to livestock trampling, reducing air filled pore space, increasing anaerobicity and enhancing conditions for N2O losses via denitrification. It is, therefore, essential to establish the relationships between urine composition (the result of grazing preference), soil type, soil physico-chemical properties (which might be influenced by topographic effects on hydrology) and climate in order to generate improved N2O flux estimates, emission factors and carbon footprints from livestock production.\nWe will address these knowledge gaps through a combination of: \ni) Fine-scale mapping of 'static' factors controlling N2O fluxes, i.e. topography, soil type, vegetation type and soil compaction, using high resolution remotely sensed imaging over contrasting upland areas\nii) Mapping of the 'mobile' factors controlling N2O fluxes, i.e. measuring livestock movement and grazing patterns in these two grassland systems using GPS collars, and observing urination events\niii) Collection of urine from sheep grazing dominant vegetation types and relating the urine composition to dietary preference\niv) Measurement of N2O fluxes following the application of collected urine to soil under typical vegetation types, and calculation of robust urine direct N2O emission factors over a 12 month period\nv) Conducting controlled replicated experiments to explore the factors controlling N2O fluxes from soil from contrasting field sites (e.g. changing urine composition, water content and levels of compaction)\nvi) Developing a novel model framework to predict the statistics of animal occupancy and to integrate predicted urine emissions with spatial and temporal information of landscape-scale explanatory factors in order to quantify aggregate N2O emissions for upland pastures\nUniquely, we will gain improved understanding of the spatial and temporal interactions between grazing patterns, forage choice, urine composition, soil and climate factors and N2O fluxes in upland systems. Outputs from the project will be compared with IPCC Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches for estimating N2O emissions from livestock grazing in the UK and provide the basis for robust and scientifically defensible alterations to standard inventory approaches, if required, along with inputs to carbon footprinting and to the spatial targeting of mitigation practices.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M013847/1","grantId":"NE/M013847/1","fundValue":"202579","fundStart":"2015-09-01","fundEnd":"2018-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Maritza Cardenas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
