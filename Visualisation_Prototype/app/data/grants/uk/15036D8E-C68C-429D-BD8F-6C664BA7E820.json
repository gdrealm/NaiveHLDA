The overall plan is to enhance UK management research capacity, strategically and sustainably, through a diversity of support activities designed to meet the development needs of UK management researchers at the different stages of their academic career. The BAM RDI (Researcher Development Initiative) design concentrates on activities that relate directly to developing the skills of researchers and research managers. The four sets of activities that are the subject of this proposal, are part of a much wider set of offerings provided by BAM and AIM jointly. They are targeted at different career points. They are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>an annual doctoral symposium;<br /></li>\n\n <li>biennial workshops on writing qualitative and quantitative articles for top rated journals, targeted at mid-career and senior academics;<br /></li>\n\n <li>a workshop on achieving research output from enterprise activities, targeted principally at mid-career and senior academics;<br /></li>\n\n <li>a workshop and support network on managing research projects; targeted at mid-career and senior academics</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0059","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0059","fundValue":"123385","fundStart":"2006-05-22","fundEnd":"2009-05-21","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Huxham","coPersons":["Zoe  Radnor","Joep  Cornelissen"],"organisation":"British Academy of Management","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
