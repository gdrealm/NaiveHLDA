{"id":"3CDF29DC-1FC2-4677-B7F8-CF907527EACC","title":"Jetty","abstractText":"Sustainability is a disputed term and concept, interpreted and imagined differently according to local urban contexts and histories. Although the term is used extensively across academia, professional and popular debate, there are often conflicting and contradictory understandings, creating a barrier to wider adoption of 'sustainable development' strategies. Meanwhile, although environmentalism and climate change are established areas of interest in the fine art field more complex meanings and understandings of sustainability have not been fully explored within urban public art practice. As an interdisciplinary project that connects the debates of fine art and urban design, Jetty investigates how a contemporary public artwork can meaningfully contribute to the reshaping of this multi-layered debate. The project is developed as a collaboration between artist Wolfgang Weileder based at Newcastle University School of Arts and Culture, and urbanist Simon Guy, Director of the Architecture Research Centre at the University of Manchester, with additional project partners from the arts, heritage, education and business community.\n\nAt the heart of the Jetty project is the creation of a temporary large-scale architectural artwork integrated within the impressive wooden structure of Dunston Staithes, a landmark Scheduled Monument and Grade II structure on the south bank of the River Tyne in NewcastleGateshead. \nIn developing the project the academic partners will work closely with Tyne and Wear Preservation Trust, the owner of Dunston Staithes as part of its initiative to provide a long-term and sustainable future for the structure. The artwork will be constructed in collaboration with trainees and specialist staff from Newcastle College Construction Skills Academy and RBAU Sunderland, providing an innovative opportunity for skills exchange for the benefit of young people entering the construction industry.\nThroughout its development and exhibition the Jetty artwork will be utilised as a catalyst for research and debate into local and professional meanings, interpretations and understandings of sustainability. Activity will focus on three distinct communities of interest considered to be at the centre of this discussion: the artistic community, including artists, commissioners and curators; urban professionals, including landscape and urban designers, architects, planners and policy makers; and members of the geographic community of NewcastleGateshead, including residents, community and local interest groups. Involvement of these groups will be achieved through a combination of focus groups, individual interviews, an international symposium, online activity, and as audiences for the public exhibition of the artwork.\n\nThe knowledge gained through this project will be widely disseminated to local, national and international audiences via a range of activities including: the site-specific installation at Dunston Staithes; the Jetty project website; an interdisciplinary symposium hosted by BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead; publication of the Jetty book; co-authoring of academic articles for high-impact and relevant research journals; presentations at national and international conferences for artistic and urban professional communities. \n\nAs a research project and case study, Jetty will benefit academics and practitioners working within the fine art, urbanism and heritage fields, providing new insights into the meanings, understanding and implications of sustainability across these different sectors. Through engagement with local communities and audiences in NewcastleGateshead Jetty will contribute to the cultural and social regeneration of the city, promoting it as a site for sustainable arts practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K006932/1","grantId":"AH/K006932/1","fundValue":"280762","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Although not yet completed our project can already demonstrate economical and societal impact. Through our research initiative the Tyne and Wear Building preservation Trust (TWBPT) was awarded approximately 500K from the HLF to restore the Dunson Staiths as a direct result of their relationship the Jetty Project. Over the next two years parts of the Dunston Staiths will be reconstructed and made accessible to the general public. TWBPT are further planning to continue a cultural programme of events on the staiths that has been directly initiated by this research project. \n\nWorking with TWBPT and other key partners from the industry and education sector have allowed for access to new audiences and stakeholders that we would not necessarily have been able to reach without these links. \n\nIdentifying local colleges as a resource for mutual skills exchange and collaboration, has allowed us to provide opportunities for local students to engage with our research and ideas and concepts of sustainability. Furthermore participating students have directly benefited from the project by developing their educational learning outcomes/portfolios i.e. onsite experience and professional mentoring.\n\nWe are expecting further direct impacts from the project as we continue to disseminate our research and engage with the local community and cultural sector.

However, we can say that during the course of the funded research we have been able to identify and extend our relationships with collaborators and to form new research partnerships. In working with third party collaborators we have also identified important new research resources. \n\nThe Jetty-Project has facilitated a new research partnership between the School of Arts and Cultures, Newcastle University and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Lancaster University. We are currently planning to continue and extend this new partnership with further joint research projects and grant applications. \n\nAs well as attracting a significant amount of financial and in kind support from both the cultural sector and the building industry the project has enabled new partnerships which have significantly contributed to the research.\n\nDue to the nature of this project and the large-scale art installations that we have installed and are currently working on we have been able to develop our skills and methodologies with regards to collaborating with other educational institutions such as local Further Education Colleges. In order to take our findings forward and be put to use by others the project needs to be fully disseminated. We anticipate this at and beyond the project completion date.
