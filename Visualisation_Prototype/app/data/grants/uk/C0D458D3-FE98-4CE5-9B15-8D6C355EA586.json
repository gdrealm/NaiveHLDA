{"id":"C0D458D3-FE98-4CE5-9B15-8D6C355EA586","title":"Multiscale vorticity and strain dynamics in mixing processes and implications for micromixing modelling","abstractText":"Mixing is encountered in over 25% of all chemical engineering and related processes such as the manufacture of foodstuff, paints, pharmaceuticals and biomaterial processing. Design and optimisation of mixing processes is hindered by a lack of understanding of the mixing mechanisms involved, especially at the smallest scales where the energy input to promote mixing is dissipated. In order to aid understanding of mixing processes and to aid formulation of improved models for process prediction, the flow and turbulence characteristics of mixing vessels will be studied by employing state-of-the-art experimental and analysis approaches that will inform how mixing is accomplished at different flow scales and by separately identifying the effects of rotation and strain so that both the mixing potential and the shear effects on reactants can be appreciated. Existing mixing models will be assessed and improvements will be suggested based on the findings of the work, aiming in particular to identify more accurate estimates of the energy dissipated and to formulate simple models based on a rigorous scientific approach. The research will aid improved mixing process design and will facilitate more reliable prediction methods.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D032539/1","grantId":"EP/D032539/1","fundValue":"202977","fundStart":"2006-09-18","fundEnd":"2009-09-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Yianneskis","coPersons":["Andrea  Ducci"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
