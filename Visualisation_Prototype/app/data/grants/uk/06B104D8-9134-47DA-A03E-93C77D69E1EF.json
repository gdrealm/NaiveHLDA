These children are highly vulnerable due to their age and their developmental disability, yet there is virtually no research in this area to guide criminal justice professionals on their potential strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>The current project adopts an experimental procedure to examine how children with ASD fare across all stages of a criminal investigation (during initial questioning, in an investigative interview, when identifying perpetrators, and during cross-examination) relative to typical children.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research will also consider several related questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Can we improve the amount of information that children recall, without a subsequent decrease in accuracy (eg, using the assistance of an intermediary)?</li>\n\n <li>How do members of the general public (who may evaluate the evidence of children with ASD within a jury) perceive witnesses with ASD?</li>\n\n <li>Which factors (eg, language, general memory, suggestibility) are associated with the performance of children with ASD in a witness context?&nbsp; </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The findings will be used to promote appropriate access to justice for children with ASD, and to develop new guidelines on best practice for interviewing children with ASD throughout the stages of criminal proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020893/1","grantId":"ES/J020893/1","fundValue":"376525","fundStart":"2013-01-14","fundEnd":"2013-09-15","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lucy Ann Henry","coPersons":["Rachel Anne Wilcock","Laura  Crane"],"organisation":"London South Bank University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
