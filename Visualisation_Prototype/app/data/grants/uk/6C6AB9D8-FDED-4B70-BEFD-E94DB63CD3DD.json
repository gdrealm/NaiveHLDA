It allowed several staff to travel to Japanand in return Japanese scientists made several trips to the UK. These included two 6 week student secondments from Japan with a third planned in 2015. the collaboration with the Japanese group is continuing and M. White travels to Japan at end November 2014.\nThe work concentrated on sharing expertise on a number of technologies for protein interactions and on luciferase imaging technology. There have been multiple exchanges of reagents. the Japanese group are developing tools to study NF-kB signalling and helped the UK team to develop an optical switch system to study the cellular response to viruses. \nthrough the project each group has established other new contacts and collaborations (Ozawa with Sutton-Liverpool, Sanderson-Liverpool, Lucas-Manchester, Papalopulu-Manchester; White with Ohmiya-AIST, Kuroda-Univ of Tokyo and Kageyama-Kyoto) Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology Cultural,Economic","person":"Michael Richard White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
