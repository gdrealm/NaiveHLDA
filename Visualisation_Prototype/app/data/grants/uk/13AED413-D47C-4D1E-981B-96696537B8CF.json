For phytoplankton, cells are expected, based on our work, to have an accentuated competitive advantage for nutrient uptake and rapid growth in warmer waters. The same may be true of other ectotherms. Although this is the case generally, it is not always true, and exceptions in the study system may further clarify mechanisms. As we work to continue to clarify mechanisms we will want to understand in what contexts we may expect smaller body sizes of single-cell producers and other ectotherms in aquatic environments. This is important because fisheries are based, ultimately, on this kind of production, eaten by zooplankton and then transported up through the food chain. The research is basic science, and is useful in that it helps us understand the reasons for one of the major biotic responses to climate change. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
