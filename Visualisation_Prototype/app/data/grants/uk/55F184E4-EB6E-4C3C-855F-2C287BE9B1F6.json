It is important for the health of both humans and animals, but can also be very toxic at high concentrations. Selenium can be found in a number of different chemical forms. In the presence of oxygen, it is usually in a compound called selenate. Selenate is highly soluble in hot water, highly toxic, and when released into the environment can present a significant hazard to health. Selenium contamination usually occurs due to the discharge of selenate waste from heavy industries such as glass production, copper smelting and fossil fuel combustion. One of the most successful ways to clean selenate contaminated areas is by the use of micro-organisms in a process called bioremediation. Micro-organisms can detoxify selenate by chemically modifying the compound back to the elemental form, selenium. Elemental selenium is far less toxic than selenate and is insoluble, forming a red solid substance that can be easily separated from the contaminated soil or water. Some micro-organisms carry out this chemical modification of selenate using a specialised reactive molecule or enzyme called selenate reductase. During a recent study of the genetic sequences of a large number of micro-organisms we have identified a sequence (gene) in an ancient micro-organism called A. fulgidus that codes for an enzyme that has a very similar structure to selenate reductase. This organism lives in deep sea hot-water vents (hydrothermal vents) at temperatures near 95oC. Comparing the sequence of the A. fulgidus enzyme with those from other micro-organisms we have highlighted regions in the sequence of the selenate reductase that may be responsible for why the enzyme reacts with selenate and not other similar compounds such as nitrate. By changing the sequence of the A. fulgidus enzyme we hope to make it behave more like the selenate reductase enzyme, but also work at high temperatures. The advantage of this work is that if we can engineer a selenate reductase enzyme that works at high temperature we can use it to remove a higher concentration of selenate from contaminated environments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D00781X/2","grantId":"BB/D00781X/2","fundValue":"295116","fundStart":"2007-01-02","fundEnd":"2010-07-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used to help inform on the use of bacterial for bioremediation and nanoparticle fabrication.
