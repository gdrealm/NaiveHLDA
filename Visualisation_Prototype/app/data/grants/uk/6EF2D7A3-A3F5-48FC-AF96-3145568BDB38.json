Epilepsy is the commonest serious neurological condition in the UK. Although medication can help, it is ineffective in 80,000 people. We propose to use a new kind of brain scan to find the brain area that is responsible for the seizures (epileptic focus) and that could be surgically removed.\nThe new brain scan technique, called EEG-fMRI, combines the recording of brain waves (electroencephalogram or EEG) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG-fMRI has already given promising results but we do not know how useful it is in localising the focus. We will first refine the technique to make it as sensitive and specific as possible and then evaluate its performance by comparing it with the best available data. We propose to develop EEG-fMRI on the most advanced scanners to maximise its sensitivity. We also want to compare the EEG-fMRI measurements with clinical data that is collected by placing electrodes inside the patient’s skull – a complicated and relatively risky procedure, but which, at present, gives the best possible localization of the epileptic focus. We hope to show that EEG-fMRI, a non-invasive and totally painless technique, can give the same kind of information as the invasive technique.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301067","grantId":"G0301067","fundValue":"1130000","fundStart":"2005-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Louis  Lemieux","coPersons":["John  Duncan","Philip  Allen","Robert  Turner","Matthew Charles Walker","David Royden Fish"],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
