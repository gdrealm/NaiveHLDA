While one form, which Flavell and colleagues (1986) have termed level-1, reflects understanding of what lies within someone else's line of sight, level-2<br />involves imagining oneself in someone else's spatial point of view for understanding how their* world looks like.</p>\n\n<p>This research is important, because PT is a conscious mental transformation that is cnxially placed at the convergence of perception, mental imagery, collaborative actions, and communication, and deficiencies have been reported in Autism<br />Spectrum Disorder (eg Hamilton et al., 2009). Understanding perspective taking in neuro-cognitive detail in adults will therefore inform research on typical and atypical cognitive development of mutual understanding.</p>\n\n<p>The Investigators' previous behavioural research had revealed that level-2 PT is a mental simulation of a body rotation - in other words, an embodied process (Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010). Yet littie is known about level-1 PT in ttiis respect. By using<br />Magnetoencephalography (MEG) the Investigators will be able to unravel how the two forms of PT differ in terms of their cortical representation (which brain areas?), activation time course (when does activity dffer?), and frequency (which brain<br />oscillations differ?).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4325","grantId":"RES-000-22-4325","fundValue":"79945","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  As evidenced by the added entries in outreach activities our findings have impacted on the debate about gender differences in the brain.

While VPT-1 relies on simple judgements about what lies within another's line of sight (LoS), VPT-2 requires the simulation of a body rotation into another's viewpoint (eSR). \n\nRecruitment of these mechanisms is general and independent of response modality, i.e. verbal localisations vs. spatially mapped key-presses. Furthermore, both mechanisms generalise in principle across genders and cultures, yet, with systematic variations in relation to social skills and egocentric bias as reported in Kessler et al. (2014) and Kessler and Wang (2012). We found that genders are more different in western culture than in Chinese culture and that Chinese are faster VPT-1 perspective takers and show for VPT-1 an other-oriented bias in contrast to an egocentric bias in Westerners. \n\nMEG investigations (Wang et al., subm.) revealed that theta brain oscillations were more strongly modulated in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during eSR and in relation to proprioceptive, embodied as well as cognitive aspects of VPT-2 processing, suggesting TPJ as the locus where the observer's embodied mind is aligned with another's. We have now confirmed this role of right TPJ by means of a further TMS study (Wang et al., subm.) This was corroborated in a further MEG study (Boegels et al., 2014) that employed a live communication game where a speaker broke previously established naming conventions, thus, requiring the listener to engage VPT-2 for explaining the sudden violations. Theta oscillatory effects suggested that perspective taking in TPJ was systematically related to areas processing language, perception, and episodic memory. \n\nFinally, revealing the basic mechanisms of VPT allowed for theoretical innovations and computational models documented by 3 publications (Braithwaite et al., 2013; Miyachikov et al., 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2013). \r\n Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
