{"id":"10152B47-53CA-47AB-9F57-467DA3F4DAD4","title":"Factors in the Outcomes of the Resettlement of Homeless People","abstractText":"<p>Homelessness affects peopleâ€™s health, well-being and social inclusion; while effective resettlement reduces the duration of the personal disruption and the likelihood of a repeat episode.&nbsp;Since the late 1990s, resettlement has become more systematic although many approaches are still used.&nbsp;Information about the outcomes of different interventions is not collated, but it is known that many resettled homeless people experience problems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This new study will provide evidence on the extent to which rehoused homeless people engage in productive activities and gain independence, new social contacts and life satisfaction.&nbsp;With the assistance of six service-provider organisations, samples of 200 resettled people will be recruited in both London and Nottingham-Leeds-Sheffield, and each will be interviewed immediately before being rehoused and after 6 and 18 months.&nbsp; Their background circumstances, the forms of the resettlement preparation and follow-up support, and post-resettlement events will be investigated.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The findings will be refined through consultative workshops with professionals and clients, and will inform both practice recommendations and contributions to the international academic and professional debates about the resettlement of vulnerable people (which to date have been informed mainly by United States evidence).&nbsp;The grant is the largest awarded by the ESRC for a homelessness study.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0253","grantId":"RES-062-23-0253","fundValue":"540714","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony Michael  Warnes","coPersons":["Maureen  Crane"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
