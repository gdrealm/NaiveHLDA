The development of these organs gave animals a major advantage over others because it allowed them to hunt for food, to avoid enemies, and even to communicate with each other / activities that are very difficult, if not impossible, without a sense of direction and cues like light, sound and smell to guide. In the most primitive forms of animals that possess such detection systems they are distributed over the entire surface of the body from head to tail. However, in more advanced animals / like in human beings / they are concentrated in the head and form relay stations transmitting information from our outside world to our brain. How do these organs develop in the embryo at the right time and at the right place? Why are they concentrated in the head? What makes them form always in the same arrangement? At the beginning of development, the embryo consists of three sheets of cells that will form different parts of the adult body. Cells that give rise to sense organs come from the same layer as the skin and the brain. How do they know whether to form a sense organ, the brain or the skin? And if a sense organ, how do they know which one to make? Most of these decisions are made very early in development and are regulated through molecules inside the cell that control which genes will be active and which ones remain silent. The molecules can be called 'regulators'. Cells that will make the smell-sensing cells in the nose contain a different set of regulators than those that will make the light-sensing structures in the eye. A 'regulator-code' determines the identity of a cell. In the last 10 years or so, it has been discovered that some of the regulators that control the formation of sense organs in the fly and in vertebrates are very similar or even identical. This has led to the fascinating hypothesis that although the structure of these organs and the way they function are quite different in different animals, the molecules that control their development may be very similar. To understand how cells that form the eye and nose become different from their neighbours and from each other, we will need to understand how the regulators work. The project we are planning investigates some of the regulators that are present in sense organs of flatworms, flies and vertebrates. How do these regulators work together to give a cell a particular identity? How are the regulators controlled? What are the molecules that switch them 'on' and 'off'? Understanding these basic principles will help us to understand how cells behave during normal development, how we can make stem cells differentiate into particular directions, how to repair aging cells and also how animals developed from blind and deaf creatures into forms with amazing abilities to sense signals from the environment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D010659/1","grantId":"BB/D010659/1","fundValue":"223732","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  No impact beyond academic impact.

We have found that initially irrespective of their later identity, all sensory progenitors are initially specified as lens. We found that lens needs to be repressed to allow other sensory placodes to develop and that initially this is achieved by FGF, but later through neural crest cell derived TGF beta and Wnt signalling. Our findings have changed the view on how lens tissue is induced, and this has been taken forward by other studies on eye development. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
