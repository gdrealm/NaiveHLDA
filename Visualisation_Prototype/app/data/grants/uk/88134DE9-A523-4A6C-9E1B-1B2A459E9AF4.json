It causes lung damage through chronic inflammation. Raising the levels of a substance called cAMP inside lung cells can stop this. Potential new medicines are drugs that bind tightly to PDE4 enzymes to stop them breaking down cAMP. Unfortunately these drugs cause nausea and vomiting, preventing their use. We’ve found that there are many PDE4 subtypes but that only certain of these need to be inhibited to stop inflammation. We aim to devise novel ways to inhibit these important PDE4 subtypes, rather than all PDE4 enzymes, in order to produce effective medicines with minimal or no side-effects. To do this we will exploit our discovery that individual PDE4 subtypes have unique ‘postcodes’ built into them that allow them to be targeted to exactly the right place in cells for them to do their job properly. Our aim is to find molecules that block this correct targeting so as to stop them working properly, providing new COPD medicines. As our drugs focus on just the PDE4 subtype involved in COPD they should not have the side effects caused by current drugs that inhibit all PDE4 subtypes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600765","grantId":"G0600765","fundValue":"1852990","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Miles Douglas Houslay","coPersons":["George Scott Baillie"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
