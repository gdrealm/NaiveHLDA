The particular interactive grouping of investigators on this MRC cooperative, combines basic science (mouse models, cell physiology, molecular genetics) approaches with clinical work (patient cohorts) to work out how a particular class of genes (the imprinted genes) are involved in the control of growth of the baby, the function of and relationship with its placenta, and how mistakes and mutations in these genes can lead to growth and developmental abnormalities and neural disorders. Each of the participating institutes encourages communication of research activities and results to the lay public. This includes proactive and responsive policies for producing press releases and talking to journalists and the media about any research of possible interest to the public. Specific public forums include a Schools Open Science day and participation in National Science Week and talks by scientists about research to school students, adult evening classes and community groups.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9723500","grantId":"G9723500","fundValue":"252463","fundStart":"2000-01-31","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Ferguson-Smith","coPersons":["Wolf  Reik","Philip  Stanier","Gavin Derek Kelsey","Colin Peter Sibley","Eamonn Richard Maher","Abigail Lesley Fowden","Josephine  Peters","Lawrence Stephen Wilkinson","Myriam  Hemberger","Gudrun  Moore"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
