Have you ever had a more serious infectious disease? Have you ever used a computer? Have you ever thought of combining the two? The use of computers to fight infectious disease may seem far fetched, but we can now realise this dream through immunoinformatics, a profound and exciting new computational science able to greatly accelerate the speed and effectiveness of vaccine discovery. Vaccines are microscopic entities that can, in effect, mimic infectious organisms so that such microbes can later be recognised and harmlessly destroyed by the human body during subsequent infection. Based on sound, experimental data we can use statistical methods to identify, in the computer, tiny bits of pathogenic micro-organisms / bacteria, virus, parasites, or fungi / which the immune system can recognise, tagging invading microbes for destruction. In order to realise the power of these advances will require much effort, however. The problem we face has made components, not least the multitudinous ways that the immune system uses to sense and recognise micro-organisms. We wish to investigate one specific part of the immune system, a single protein, called HLA-Cw 0102, and use cutting-edge technology, include isothermal titration calorimetry, to investigate how it recognises tiny fragments of invading bacteria and viruses. Using the information we gain from doing so, will enable us, hopefully, to develop new and improved potential vaccines for the prevention of a whole range of disease from AIDS to the common cold.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D004020/1","grantId":"BB/D004020/1","fundValue":"231646","fundStart":"2006-01-03","fundEnd":"2009-01-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Darren R Flower","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
