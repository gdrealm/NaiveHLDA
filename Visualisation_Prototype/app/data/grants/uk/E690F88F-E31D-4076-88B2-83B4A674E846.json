It is thought to result from a failure to repair the body as cells stop dividing and become senescent. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to investigate the causes of senescence at the fundamental level of the genes involved and the proteins they encode, using an experimental system in which an ageing-associated gene is turned off in normal human cells to induce senescence, to allow analysis of proteins that are altered as cells enter the senescent state.</p>\n\n<p>The powerful modern technique of proteomics will be used for comparison of the levels of many different proteins in senescent cells with those in cells still able to divide; even tiny chemical changes on the proteins that affect their function can be measured. </p>\n\n<p>This study will allow identification of proteins or protein modifications involved in the onset of senescence, with the longer-term aim of highlighting novel targets that could be used to develop drugs to treat or prevent conditions that currently contribute to major loss of life quality for many older people. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-356-25-0016","grantId":"RES-356-25-0016","fundValue":"353440","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been disseminated through publication of a project-specific booklet through the New Dynamics of Ageing programme (NDA Findings 32), through talks about biology of ageing to social scientists (eg invited speaker BSG annual conference 2013), and through collaborative book chapters aimed at changing the understanding of many social scientists about the contribution basic biological studies can make to improvements in health and social care for the elderly. Presentation at the NDA final conference to politicians, health care practitioners and the public was designed specifically to alter thinking and to promote greater collaboration and funding for the biological sciences in the field of gerontology.

Moreover, we found significant changes in proteins that remodel the extracellular matrix (tissue support structures). We therefore conclude that increased stress and decreased ability to remove damaged components may drive cell senescence \nContinuous treatment of human cells over a period of time with potential anti-ageing drug rapamycin significantly modulated senescence. It will now be important to test in whole organism models whether rapamycin (or newer rapalogues) can affect the accumulation of senescent cells and hence ameliorate the detrimental effects caused by the presence of senescent cells in older individuals. We are pursuing our drug findings through a privately-funded research project and are planning to form part of a consortium to develop human clinical trials.
