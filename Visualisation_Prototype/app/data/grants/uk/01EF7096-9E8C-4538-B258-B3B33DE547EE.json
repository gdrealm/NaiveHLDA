It also has important implication for health because it is difficult to design treatments for diseased states when\nit is not understood how brains function normally. In this study we will examine the mechanisms underlying information processing in two major brain regions involved in motor function: the cerebellum and cortex. The cerebellum and cortex are made up of several layers with each layer being made up of many cells (neurons). Since processing occurs roughly sequentially through the layers we will study the input layers of these brain structures, where the earliest stages of processing occur, because understanding their function is essential for understanding subsequent processing. We will use a combination of newly developed methods including laser-based imaging of cellular activity, electrical measurements and computer modelling to understand how the electrical properties of individual cells and their connections contribute to the complex and dynamic processing of signals within the neuronal network.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400598","grantId":"G0400598","fundValue":"1414760","fundStart":"2005-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robin Angus Silver","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
