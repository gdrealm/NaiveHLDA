{"id":"E70C8E2E-CE16-4013-B19F-8FDB8981FF8D","title":"Intergenerational Dynamics and Education amongst British Asian families","abstractText":"<p>The research will examine the intergenerational dynamics amongst British South Asians from various ethnic, religious and linguistic backgrounds regarding education and family life, through an in-depth study of three generations. </p>\n\n<p>It will investigate the perspectives of British grandparents, parents and young people of South Asian origins, to establish how family attributes are perceived by these three groups and how education affects family relationships. It will determine how family values regarding education are transmitted by the first generation and received, adopted or modified by the second and the third generations. It will identify key differences in family practices and education relating to the parents' ethnicity, social class membership, religious affiliation, educational level, occupation, and the gender of the parents and the children, and establish how ethnic minority identities evolve over three generations. It will contribute to education and the family theory, and generate recommendations for policy makers, and family and education support groups. </p>\n\n<p>The methods and approaches used to gather data will be focus groups, individual interviews, and digital ethnography which will involve using photographs taken by the young people for reflection. Research participants will include young people in the final year of compulsory schooling, their parents, and grandparents.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G034273/1","grantId":"ES/G034273/1","fundValue":"66892","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Tehmina Naz Basit","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Wolverhampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
