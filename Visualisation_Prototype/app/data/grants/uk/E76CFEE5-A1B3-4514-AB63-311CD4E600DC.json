{"id":"E76CFEE5-A1B3-4514-AB63-311CD4E600DC","title":"Resisting State Crime: A Comparative Study of Civil Society","abstractText":"<p>A fundamental problem in the study of state crime is how state violence and corruption comes to be defined and censured as criminal, since states rarely criminalize their own activities. In earlier work (Green and Ward 2004) the researchers have argued that they key actors in this respect are those who comprise ‘civil society’: associations independent of the state (and of non-state agents of organised violence) that communicate information about, and articulate norms relevant to, matters of social and political concern. Civil society organisations are directly involved in exposing and ‘labelling’ state crime.</p>\n\n<p>The research seeks to determine how they do this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>where their information comes from</li>\n\n <li>how they understand the boundaries of legitimate state action</li>\n\n <li>how they see and use the law</li>\n\n <li>what strategies and tactics they find effective in resisting state violence and corruption. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The study aims to explore how far civil society organisations in Turkey, Tunisia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea articulate consistent definitions of legitimate or criminal state conduct, and how far these definitions reflect or differ from legal norms through the empirical development of organisational life histories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-3144","grantId":"RES-062-23-3144","fundValue":"592089","fundStart":"2011-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Penny  Green","coPersons":["Antony  Ward"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
