However, lack of time and resources in\nthe resource- and time-poor fashion and textile sector has inhibited R&amp;D culture in fashion SMEs, weakening the UK\nsector's ability to innovate and capitalize on invention, and retain competitive edge internationally. Increasing pressures\nsuch as natural resource depletion, escalating consumption and waste, competition from overseas, and financial\nfluctuations driven by the seasonal nature of designer fashion all strongly indicate that the current fashion business model\nis unsustainable from both ecological and economic perspectives.\nCollaborative research and development between fashion designers and university researchers has great potential in\naddressing these issues, however this space is currently in its infancy.\nMicro enterprises and SMEs have a poor understanding of university research, its potential benefits and available funding\nopportunities. These businesses cannot allocate resource toward R&amp;D beyond the inventive approaches applied but\nseldom capitalized upon in designer fashion. University researchers often work in isolation from the sector, use a different\nlanguage and time frames that are not always compatible with industry needs and expectations.\nFIRE.Digital addresses these issues by developing the first digital platform for research-focused UK network of fashion\nSMEs and researchers. The key aim of the Platform is to galvanize collaborative research and innovation and provide\nsustainable source of data on UK fashion SMEs and research network.\nBuilding on the existing London-focused FIREup digital prototype (www.fireup.org.uk), FIRE.Digital will develop into a highend\nonline tool for a UK-wide network of fashion industry and researchers to connect via user-friendly online network, as\nwell as access curated fashion and textile research content, including news and funding opportunities.\nFIRE.Digital will develop existing standard backend tools to create bespoke digital data collation and visualization tools and\nmethodologies, enabling capture of quantitative and qualitative data from the registered users. This data will provide\nsignificant insights into the structure of fashion SMEs, positioning of fashion and textile researchers, UK Fashion network\nformations, digital behavior in fashion SME's and researchers, barriers to collaborative research and open innovation in the\nUK fashion industry and lead towards establishing new research topics. These tools could potentially find application in\nwider creative industry research context.\nFIRE.Digital strategic and technical elements will be developed in collaboration with a Digital Agency. FIRE Focus Group,\nconsisting of designer fashion and textile SMEs and researchers, will be utilized for analysis, development and testing of\nthe platform.\nUAL researchers will focus on defining fashion ontology and typology, which will underpin the site functionalities, as well as\nact as a benchmark for classification of UK fashion and textile sector for digital purposes.\nA comprehensive database of UK fashion researchers and fashion/textile relevant higher education institutions will be\ncollated in order to populate the platform and provide an accessible knowledge database of potential academic partners for\ncollaborative research.\nThe collation and classification of potential sources of fashion research news and information will provide a basis for a\nsustainable stream of fashion and textile research, and act as a reference resource for both fashion SMEs and researchers\nincluding development of new editorial content featuring groundbreaking people and research themes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/N504312/1","grantId":"AH/N504312/1","fundValue":"80127","fundStart":"2015-02-14","fundEnd":"2015-11-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Sandy  Black","coPersons":["Adam  Thorpe","Mark  Simpkins","Alex  McIntosh"],"organisation":"University of the Arts London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
