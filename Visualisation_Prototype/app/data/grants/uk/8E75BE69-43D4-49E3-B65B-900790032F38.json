This School enhances the training of postgraduates in the increasingly important area of liquids and complex fluids, a multidisciplinary field covering the broad swathe of scientific and technological problems that involve the liquid and related states of matter with important academic and industrial implications - from paint emulsions to food gels, mineral recovery foams to oil recovery colloids and novel liquid crystals used in display technology and bifocal contact lenses. . The breadth of the subject means that is not adequately covered by lecture courses at an undergraduate or graduate level. The Winter School is able to remedy this deficiency and provide a platform for future advances within the UK. The School also complements the existing New Generation Facilities studentships and provision of the new Doctoral Training Centres.Modest funding is requested for 30 postgraduate students drawn from a wide interdisciplinary background from across the UK to attend the School on a three year rolling programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H014624/1","grantId":"EP/H014624/1","fundValue":"24666","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The winter schools have had another three successful years with well attended courses at Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh University. The feedback has been very encouraging and the Institute of Physics Liquids and Complex Fluids group (Chair: neal Skipper) have already approached EPSRC to discussion continuation.\nStudents have gone on to a variety of roles across a wide range of academic and industrial positions and sectors.
