{"id":"480AFA2D-5D8F-48CA-92BA-0B4D5046B325","title":"Modelling Perception, Memory, and Problem Solving in Chess Novices and Experts","abstractText":"<p>A large body of empirical data has been collected about expertise in chess, but, to this day, there is no detailed model that accounts for all of them. This ambitious project aims to build a computational model that will simulate most of the key empirical phenomena, from low-level perception to high-level decision making, and from novice to world-class grandmasters. These phenomena include the type of errors made in memory experiments, search behaviour when trying to find a good move, and chessmasters' ability to play blindfold chess.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed model will combine pattern recognition, learning, and search abilities. The project will have implications for expertise in general and will shed important light on the question of bounded rationality: how can humans produce extraordinary behaviour in spite of strong biological constraints (eg limited short-term memory). It will also inform applications in human training and in the construction of real-time expert systems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1601","grantId":"RES-000-23-1601","fundValue":"175733","fundStart":"2006-08-07","fundEnd":"2009-09-18","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Fernand  Gobet","coPersons":["Peter Christopher Lane"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
