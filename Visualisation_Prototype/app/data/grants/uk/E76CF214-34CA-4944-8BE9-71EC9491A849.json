{"id":"E76CF214-34CA-4944-8BE9-71EC9491A849","title":"Tight closure and strong semistability of vector bundles in higher dimension","abstractText":"Positive characteristic describes a type of arithmetic where a certain prime number, e.g. 5, is considered to be 0. Surprisingly, in such exotic arithmetics it is not only possible to add and to multiply, it is also possible to build whole geometric theories over such arithmetics. E.g., an geometric object like a line, a circle or a sphere has for every prime number p a well-defined parallel object. Even more surprisingly, one can use these parallel worlds to prove results in the original, more visible world.Among these methods known as ``reduction to positive characteristic'' there is one theory called tight closure which was invented 20 years ago and which has turned out to be extremely successful. It is basically an algebraic theory, with a lot of open problems in its own right, and its geometric meaning is not yet understood. In this direction I established a geometric interpretation of tight closure in terms of vector bundles.A vector bundle is a collection of vector spaces which vary with certain geometric, quite complicated objects. Vector bundles play an important role in different branches of mathematics, and a lot is known about them. With this geometric interpretation it is possible to transfer this knowledge about vector bundles to tight closure, and I could solve a lot of problems of tight closure theory (but the transfer goes also, though not to the same extent, in the other direction).This is in particular true if the vector bundles involved are over a one-dimensional object, like a line or a circle (its boundary). Over higher-dimensional objects, like a plane or the surface of a sphere, a lot of problems are still open, and the proposed research project is meant to understand the connection between vector bundles and tight closure also in higher dimensions and to solve tight closure problems by this method.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E03604X/1","grantId":"EP/E03604X/1","fundValue":"188501","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Holger Wilfried Brenner","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
