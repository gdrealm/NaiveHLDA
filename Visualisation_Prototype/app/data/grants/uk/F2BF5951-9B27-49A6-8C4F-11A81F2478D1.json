It looks at the import of German vocal traditions, both secular and sacred, through historic documents, study of contemporary Liedertafel performances and church services and interrogation of the influence of Lutheran missions on indigenous music. \nThe role of Lutheran institutions in shaping choral music in Australia will be examined by looking at a selection of commissioned pieces. \nThe works of three leading Australian composers with significant Lutheran connections, Andrew Schultz, Graeme Koehne and Ron Nagorcka, will be analysed in detail.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119560/1","grantId":"119560/1","fundValue":"3825","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Fiona  Richards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Open University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
