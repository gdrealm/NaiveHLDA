As substantial resources are needed to implement large-scale programs, it is critical that interventions are designed to be both effective and efficient. With recent advances in the scientific theory of infectious diseases, we now have a good understanding of how infectious diseases spread and persist in different communities. However, there currently remains a gap in the application of this knowledge to the design and management of large-scale disease control programs. There are usually few accompanying studies that analyse how complex interventions are really working, and important opportunities are missed to learn why programs succeed in some circumstances but not in others. \n\nRabies is a horrific disease that causes an estimated 55,000 human deaths in Asia and Africa each year, mainly in children, as the result of bites from rabid dogs. To prevent human rabies, it is necessary to control the disease in dogs. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has recently provided $10M to support extensive, long-term rabies vaccination programs of domestic dogs in Tanzania, Philippines, and South Africa, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of dog vaccination in preventing human rabies. This intervention provides a rare and important opportunity to learn about the large-scale control of rabies, the design of vaccination programs, and the adaptive management of a substantial public health intervention. This project will use the considerable amounts of information generated from the BMGF program (e.g. on the number/density of dogs, proportion of dogs vaccinated, pattern of rabies cases) to carry out in-depth analyses of data to understand how and why vaccination succeeds or fails to control disease in different areas. This information will then be used to provide support for improving the design, efficiency and sustainability of the intervention as it is rolled out. The project brings together a diverse and experienced team of scientists and public-health experts working in close partnership with the BMGF program to provide timely feed-back of information required for improved implementation of the program in the field. \n\nAn improved understanding of how complex health interventions work and how they can be enhanced has widespread application and implications, not only for rabies, but also for the control of many other infectious diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901135","grantId":"G0901135","fundValue":"635722","fundStart":"2010-07-06","fundEnd":"2015-01-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel  Haydon","coPersons":["Sarah  Cleaveland","Rowland Raymond Kao"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
