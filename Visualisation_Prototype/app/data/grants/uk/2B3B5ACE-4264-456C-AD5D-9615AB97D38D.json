Our vision is that the co-localisation\nof 3T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging with positron emission and computed\ntomography imaging will provide an unparalleled resource which will markedly enhance clinical\nresearch and experimental medicine within this highly productive and unique grouping of worldleading\nbasic and clinical scientists, and feed directly into the newly established Clinical\nResearch Networks.\nWe are establishing the Clinical Research Imaging Centre in the University’s new Queen’s\nMedical Research Institute and have already secured the provision of combined positron\nemission and computed tomography, and a dedicated on-site cyclotron. We request funding and\nsupport for the provision of a 3T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scanner and\nassociated support costs. This enhanced magnetic resonance capability will build upon the\nUniversity’s highly successful clinical neuroimaging infrastructure already established in\nEdinburgh through the Brain Imaging Research Centre and complement the juxtaposed\nBiomedical Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit with its pre-clinical 7 Tesla magnetic resonance\nimaging scanner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701127","grantId":"G0701127","fundValue":"1404650","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Ernest Newby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
