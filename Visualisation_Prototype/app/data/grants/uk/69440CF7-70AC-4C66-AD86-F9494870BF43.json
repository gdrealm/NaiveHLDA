{"id":"69440CF7-70AC-4C66-AD86-F9494870BF43","title":"Genome assembly. chromosomal organization and comparative genomics of multiple bird species: beyond &quot;catalogues of genes&quot;","abstractText":"Imagine trying to navigate through a town with only the index from your A-Z to guide you and not the street map. In essence, this is what happens when the genome of a new species is sequenced. Old fashioned technology used to &quot;sketch the outline of the streets&quot; first before filling in the gaps with the gene sequence. The new technology (so called &quot;Next Generation Sequencing&quot;) is much cheaper and quicker but is quite poor at sorting out where the genes are in relation to one another. Essentially, Next Generation Sequencing assemblies are little more than catalogues of genes with little structure of the overall genome apparent. Fortunately this problem can be rectified using a technique called &quot;FISH&quot; that can take the data from next generation sequencing projects and visualise directly the genes as they appear in their rightful place in the genome. In this project we intend to do this with 25-30 recently completed genome sequences from birds. Birds are among the most diverse animals with around 10,000 living species. Many are models for human disease and development and are critical to agriculture (both meat and eggs). Others are threatened or endangered and, with impending global warming, molecular tools for the study of ecology and conservation of birds are essential. It is also possible to compare the overall structure of one genome with another, somewhat like comparing the maps of towns with similar layouts. We have developed online tools that can directly visualize the similarities and differences between the genomes of several birds at a time. Of course the differences between these bird genomes came about through changes that happened during evolution. One of the main aims of this project is to find out how and why this occurred. We have a number of ideas such as we think there may be different &quot;gene signatures&quot; at the places in the genome where evolutionary rearrangements are more or less likely to occur. We think that the whole process may be related to the mechanisms by which our genes recombine in our germ cells. We also think there may be a role for small pieces of DNA that &quot;float around&quot; these bird genomes. Finally, we have received overwhelming support from numerous laboratories all over the world, all of whom are interested in bird genomics and who would wish to use our online resource to ask biological questions of their own. For this reason we feel that this project not only will help us understand evolution in birds but also establish the UK as a central international hub for work of this kind.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K008161/1","grantId":"BB/K008161/1","fundValue":"535556","fundStart":"2013-05-06","fundEnd":"2018-05-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The project is in its infancy (just over a year old) but I have have several invitations to give public and academic lectures based around the work.
