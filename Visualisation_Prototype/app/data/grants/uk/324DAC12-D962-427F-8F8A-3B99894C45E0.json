This will include galaxy clusters, groups, mergers and coarse measurements of galaxy structure (i.e., bulges and discs). It is on this scale (&lt; 1 Mpc) at which the role of the baryons in the galaxy formation process become critical and where our understanding of structure in the Universe breaks down.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K003577/1","grantId":"ST/K003577/1","fundValue":"2166","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-11-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Loveday","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
