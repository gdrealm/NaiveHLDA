{"id":"365D761A-FF7D-4DA8-A9EF-4F0DFD98D547","title":"The time course of extrafoveal object processing during multiple object naming","abstractText":"<p>When speakers name several objects in one utterance (eg, “bread, cheese and juice”) they usually look at each of the objects until they are about to say its name. This suggests that they process the objects strictly in sequence. However, earlier ESCR-funded research demonstrated that speakers can begin to process objects and even pre-activate their names before their eyes land there (Morgan &amp; Meyer, JEP:LMC, 2005). This could mean that they can attend to several objects in parallel. Alternatively, they could attend to the objects sequentially, but their visual attention could move to a new object and its processing could begin before the eye movement towards it is completed. Several eye tracking experiments are planned to distinguish between these hypotheses. In all of them, it will be determined whether there are “spill-over” effects between objects, ie, whether the ease of processing one object affects the time required to process the preceding or following object. </p>\n\n<p>The parallel processing hypothesis predicts this to be the case because the objects should compete for processing resources.&nbsp;The serial processing hypothesis predicts no spill-over effects. The experimental results should inform theories of speech planning as well as theories of visual attention.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1508","grantId":"RES-000-23-1508","fundValue":"98995","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Antje S  Meyer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
