The majority of findings are based on the association of a gene with a single disease or characteristic, which works well for genes that are very variable between people. Our proposal is to identify some of the genes that are less variable between people, by using multiple characteristics to identify groups of genes that are involved in particular diseases. By looking for patterns in several characteristics at the same time we aim to identify disease fingerprints in known disease genes, and use those fingerprints to find new disease genes. The newly identified genes will include potential candidates for drug development and diagnostic tests.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000427","grantId":"G1000427","fundValue":"323389","fundStart":"2011-02-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Richard Gaunt","coPersons":["Ian Colin Grant  Campbell","Juan P  Casas","Ian  Day"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
