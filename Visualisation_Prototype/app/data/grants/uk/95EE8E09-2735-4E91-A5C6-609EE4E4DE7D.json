During the 1980's clinical BT began to appear in flocks of native Indian breeds of sheep, particularly in the southern states, possibly as a result of exotic strains of the virus introduced via sheep-breeding programmes. This change in epidemiology led to outbreaks among family-based subsistence farming communities in these areas, and BTV has since been become a significant constraint in both the rearing and productivity of indigenous flocks. In addition, in rain-fed agricultural areas, massive periodic outbreaks of disease occur that are thought to be related to the influence of timing and intensity of monsoon conditions on populations of vectors responsible for spreading BTV. Due to the circulation of 21 serotypes of BTV in southern India and the prohibitive costs of vaccination to the vast majority of the population, vector control remains the only feasible way of combating BTV transmission in the field. Despite this, virtually no quantitative data concerning the efficiency of available techniques in this role is available to inform control strategies. We will adopt a multidisciplinary approach involving mathematical modelling, entomology and chemical ecology to examine the epidemiology of BTV in the southern Indian states and to produce prediction, monitoring and mitigation techniques that can reduce the impact of BT in this region. Initially we will characterise southern India using mapping techniques that delineate land areas according to climate and land use patterns. We will then establish field sites across the region that are representative of both these factors and also the types of husbandry employed (with an emphasis on small holdings and landless husbandry workers). Having characterised these sites, we will then use light trapping to define adult seasonality and distribution and ground truth this survey with direct collection of Culicoides from livestock. These studies will be combined with detection of BTV within collected individual midges to define regional variation in which species are involved in transmission in southern India for the first time. The larval development sites of major vector species identified will then also be characterised via field investigations. Using data generated on adult seasonality, larval habitat preference and historic surveys of BT cases across southern India, we will then model the relationship between monsoon conditions and adult Culicoides/BT activity to assess the potential to produce an early warning system for major BTV epidemics based on meteorological variables. The provision of fundamental epidemiological knowledge will also enable an assessment of husbandry-based control techniques for Culicoides that could be employed to reduce BTV transmission by subsistence farmers in a cost-neutral fashion. We will examine traditional and novel means of control, both in the laboratory and in the field. The former will include the use of larval site modification, or targeted treatment with traditional, low environmental impact, insecticidal products available to villagers and additionally the use of stabling. In addition, information regarding host location by identified vector Culicoides will allow novel intervention strategies based upon the application of masking semiochemicals that could also reduce the use of synthetic insecticides by these communities in the medium term. The effect of combinations of these techniques will be examined via monitoring viral infection in livestock, as a gold standard for evidence of impact in the field. These data will then be assessed for integration into the everyday lives of user groups as part of wider dissemination frameworks for improvement of ruminant productivity and control of vectors of human and veterinary pathogens.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009167/1","grantId":"BB/H009167/1","fundValue":"171310","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-27","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In May 2014, we held a workshop to consult with disease managers on the value of the risk maps and forecasts and insights of disease risk factors arising from the IBVNet project (see Engagement). From this meeting, we ascertained that our forecasts of the timing of outbreaks could be used for ordering vaccines and preparing the vaccine schedule or &quot;action plan&quot; and to inform people about the likely severity of the outbreaks via a range of media It was thought that maps and forecasts might also help ministers to make policy decisions about disease control and obtain and allocate funds for vaccination and human resources. For example, animal marketing places are currently closed at soon as the first outbreaks are notified since mixing of large numbers of animals increases the risk of onward transmission. It was suggested that armed with forecasts of the kind generated by the IBVNet project, decisions to close animal markets and restrict animal movements could be made in advance of the transmission season. We ascertained the time scale and geographical resolution (district, state, village level) at which forecasts and risk maps would be of maximum value to them and the means by which they would prefer them to be communicated. These insights will be extremely valuable for tailoring IBVNet forecasts and risk maps to stakeholder needs when these are delivered in early 2015.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the adult vector season, during which animals are at risk from infection of bluetongue, varies significantly from place to place across south India and between key vector species. We are currently quantifying the monsoon, climate and host conditions under which adult vector seasons are prolonged or shortened or abundance levels increased, with the aim of guiding farmers and veterinary officers as to the probable length of the transmission season in different years and states. \nDetailed questionnaire surveys of small-holder farmers across south India confirmed that bluetongue constitutes a top disease priority and helped us to identify suites of husbandry and vector control measures in common use that might impact development sites of biting midges and in turn increase (or decrease) exposure of susceptible sheep to bluetongue virus. This will contribute to tailored advice on vector control disseminated to farmers through leaflets and broadcasts of extension scientists from ICAR. \nKey risk factors for bluetongue disease have been identified, by matching patterns in transmission with patterns in monsoon, host and climate conditions -over years and months and across districts and villages. Though monsoon rainfall increased the size of epidemics between years (state of Andhra Pradesh), disease severity varied substantially between districts within zones under similar monsoon conditions due to land use and host factors. More outbreaks occurred on average in districts with higher areas of post-flooding or irrigated croplands and rainfed croplands, probably because these land covers are more likely to contain suitable breeding habitat for biting midge vectors. Numbers of outbreaks also increased with some host types including local sheep breeds that may be more susceptible to BTV, and with buffalo densities, suggesting that the latter species may be an important reservoir species. These impacts varied between states, with the importance of buffalos and rice paddy land use being particularly significant for example in driving outbreaks in Andhra Pradesh. The risk maps and annual and monthly forecasts from these analyses at state, district and village level are being integrated into an early warning system for bluetongue disease that will be made publicly available in early 2015 and is tailored to needs of disease managers through consultation (using a workshop and questionnaire). Information on three key commonest vector species that are most likely involved in transmission in south India represents critical baseline data for ecological studies of habitat requirements of these species and subsequent development of tailored vector control methods by local entomologists. This together with insights from farmer questionnaires will contribute to tailored advice on vector control disseminated to farmers through leaflets and broadcasts of extension scientists from ICAR. \nThe risk maps and annual and monthly forecasts and understanding of risk factors from project analyses are being integrated into an early warning system for bluetongue disease that will be made publicly available in early 2015 and is tailored to needs of disease managers through consultation (using a workshop and questionnaire) - see narrative impact section.\nThe modelling approaches that we have used to link variability in monsoon conditions, hosts and landscape to bluetongue disease incidence and produce quantitative risk maps and forecasts is applicable to many of the top ranking animal health diseases in India, particularly those that are indirectly transmitted (liver fluke, Trypanosomiasis) or highly influenced by moisture levels (e.g Haemorrhagic Septicaemia, Black fever, para-Tuberculosis). We are currently in consultation with the main epidemiology institute responsible for disease forecasting (Project Directorate on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance from which the project PhD student was seconded) to facilitate applicability of these methods to a wider range of diseases.
