They are made from amino acids assembled into polypeptide chains by a specialized machinery in the cytoplasm of cells. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are short RNAs that transport amino acids to the protein synthesis machinery. Each tRNAs binds a specific aminoacid and recognizes a specific sequence on the messenger RNA, called &quot;codon&quot;. Therefore, protein synthesis proceeds in an orderly fashion, whereby the sequence of amino acids is encoded my the messenger mRNA and tRNAs &quot;read&quot; the code.\n\ntRNAs are synthesized in the nucleus, then specialized cellular factors export tRNAs to the cytoplasm, where they participate in protein translation. It was a long-held dogma that tRNAs move in one direction only - from nucleus to cytoplasm. However we and others independently discovered that tRNAs can travel back to the nucleus in an energy-dependent fashion. Nuclear import of tRNAs is conserved from human to yeast cells and it now has the name of &quot;tRNA retrograde transport&quot;. Why do tRNAs travel back to the nucleus? There may be several reasons. First, the cell can slow down protein synthesis in response to lack of nutrients to increase its chances of survival. Rapid import of tRNAs to the nucleus can contribute to this metabolic slow down because there is no protein synthesis in the nucleus, hence tRNAs retrograde transport sequesters tRNAs in a different, well separated compartment. Second, some tRNAs become damaged in the cytoplasm and they may hinder protein synthesis. Again, sequestration of damaged tRNAs in the nucleus prevents damage to protein synthesis. \n\nInterestingly, we discovered that some viruses (such as human immunodeficiency virus - HIV) hijack the tRNA retrograde transport pathway to infect cells.\n\nThere is clear and emerging evidence of the importance of the tRNA retrograde pathway in regulation of cell metabolism, tRNA quality control and virus infection but little is know about the cellular carrier that transport tRNAs to the nuclei and how the pathway is regulated. Cell metabolism and tRNA synthesis are connected to cell growth, tumour formation and response to environmental stress. Therefore, understanding the tRNA retrograde pathway will advance our understanding of such fundamental cellular processes.\n\nWe now plan to identify the carrier that imports tRNAs into the nucleus. We also plan to elucidate the regulation of retrograde tRNA transport and its impact on two cellular pathways important during stress caused by lack of nutrients and invasion by pathogens. We already have evidence that a tRNA carrier is present and have used biochemical approaches to narrow the list of candidates to thirty four. We will use a systematic approach to identify the carrier amongst the thirty four. We shall also test if tRNA retrograde transport is activated by secretion of interferon and during autophagy, two pathways activated by pathogens and other insults. \n\nIf the tRNA retrograde transport is implicated in regulation of protein synthesis and activation of critical cellular pathways, then it will be important to be able to agonize or antagonize the tRNA carrier. This will potentially provide an important target to reduce uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, improve cellular barriers to infection and promote cell survival during stress.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L021404/1","grantId":"BB/L021404/1","fundValue":"352910","fundStart":"2014-09-15","fundEnd":"2017-09-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ariberto  Fassati","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" The grant started in September 2014.
