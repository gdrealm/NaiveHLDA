This will include galaxy clusters, groups, mergers and coarse measurements of galaxy structure (i.e., bulges and discs). It is on this scale (&lt; 1 Mpc) at which the role of the baryons in the galaxy formation process become critical and where our understanding of structure in the Universe breaks down.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J002291/1","grantId":"ST/J002291/1","fundValue":"2505","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Loveday","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
