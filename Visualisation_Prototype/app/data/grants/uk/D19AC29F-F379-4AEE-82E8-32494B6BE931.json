The computer games sector represents an extreme case of interdisciplinary innovation because it involves a highly heterogeneous pool of participants, such as software engineers, artists, animators, musicians, scriptwriters, managers, as well as unexpected user collaborators such as casual “gamers”. Such a research setting makes the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration highly visible. The proposed study involves a detailed ethnographic analysis of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the computer game development companies. The theoretical approach adopted here draws on “boundary objects”, which provides a new way of thinking about the way in which collaborating groups overcome the knowledge boundaries between them. To date, however, very few studies have addressed innovation processes that involve overcoming the boundaries between the highly heterogeneous disciplines found in creative industry settings such as computer games development, encompassing entertainment and cultural as well as technical forms of expertise. By relating the conduct of such processes and the role of boundary objects within them to innovation outcomes, this study aims to make a significant contribution to theory, policy and practice.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2809","grantId":"RES-000-22-2809","fundValue":"81801","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joe  Nandhakumar","coPersons":["Harry  Scarbrough"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
