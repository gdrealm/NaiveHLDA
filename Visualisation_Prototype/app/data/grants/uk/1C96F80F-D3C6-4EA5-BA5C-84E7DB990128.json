Although the development of this disease is governed by genetic factors it is clear that environmental factors additionally play a big role in determining whether Type 1 diabetes actually develops in a genetically prone individual. Among the environmental factors that might impact on diabetes development is infection. We, and others, have shown that some worm or bacterial infections actually prevent diabetes onset in a mouse model of Type 1 diabetes. By identifying the mechanisms by which infections prevent diabetes onset in this model this may lead to the development of novel therapies to prevent this autoimmune disease developing in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601174","grantId":"G0601174","fundValue":"480555","fundStart":"2007-07-16","fundEnd":"2010-07-15","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anne  Cooke","coPersons":["Pietro  Mastroeni","Paola  Zaccone"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
