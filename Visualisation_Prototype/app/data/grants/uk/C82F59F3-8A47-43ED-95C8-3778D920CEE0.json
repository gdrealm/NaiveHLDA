The foamability of a primary surfactantin admixture with co-surfactants, polymers and fatty soildrops/particles will be measured, and correlated with interfacialtransport properties of foam films. Formulations which foam well willbe targeted. Optical, drainage and rheological properties of the bulkfoams formed during sudsing will be measured and characterised.Bubble scale modelling will be used to describe bubble shapes andstability. Finally continuum level mathematical models of sudsing,described in terms of average foam properties (foam volume, averagebubble size, average liquid content), will be developed incorporatingthe key research findings.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F000049/1","grantId":"EP/F000049/1","fundValue":"189788","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Cox","coPersons":["David Michael  Binding"],"organisation":"Aberystwyth University","findingsText":" * the presence of calcium mixed into a surfactant solution leads to the production of mesophases, that hinder surfactant transport and suppress foaming, \n\n\n\n* the presence of sebum soil mixed into surfactant solution also greatly hinders foaming (the effects of sebum can be reproduced by a simple particle-oil mixture) \n\n\n\n* in many cases, quasistatic simulations reproduce stress fields in flowing foam experiments, \n\n\n\n* for faster foam flows however, it is necessary to consider the effects of surfactant accumulation on foam flow, \n\n\n\n* a capillary-suction based model for film failure rates in foam predicts the experimental evolution of the bubble-size distribution.
