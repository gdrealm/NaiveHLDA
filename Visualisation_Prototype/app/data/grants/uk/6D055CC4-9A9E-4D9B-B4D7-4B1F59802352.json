The plant cell paradigm has been shown to be a useful a model for the study of nuclear GSH and its functions in other organisms. For example, this study led to the characterisation of Arabidopsis mutants lacking the nucleoporin called ALADIN, which has implications for studies on this protein in relation to human disaease.

Living organisms use anabolic reductive processes to store energy and catabolic oxidative processes to release it. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that redox controls and signals are important regulators of nearly every aspect of cell biology. Indeed, redox signalling was probably the first type of sensory regulation that evolved in nature, because it prevented uncontrolled &quot;boom and bust&quot;, scenarios in energy availability, utilisation and exchange. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione are part of the rich portfolio of signals that contribute to the regulation of whole cell redox stability or homeostasis. Cellular redox homeostasis is a crucial regulator of cell fate in mammals and plants and that regulated changes in the abundance or accumulation of oxidative (e.g. ROS) and reductive (e.g. pyridine nucleotides, glutathione and ascorbate) signals can exert a major influence over the mitotic cell cycle that underpins growth. Ascorbate is the most abundant low molecular weight antioxidant in plants where it fulfils essential functions in growth and development. Glutathione is a tri-peptide that has a thiol (SH) group. It also plays a key role in root and shoot development. Using plants cells growing in liquid culture we have shown that amounts of ascorbate, glutathione and pyridine nucleotides vary independently during exponential growth and we have provided evidence for the differential regulation of each of these redox pools. We have found that glutathione moves from the cytosol to the nucleus early in the cell cycle. Depletion of the glutathione pool causes net glutathione synthesis the cytosol. We have produced evidence of a link between the glutathione pool and enzymes working to repair DNA in the nucleus such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). There is a strong correlation between PARP expression and activity and GSH accumulation. Moreover, the finding that GSH can be recruited to the nucleus suggests a relationship between redox regulation and nuclear enzyme activity. The three major conclusions of our work are:\n\n1. The pyridine nucleotides, ascorbate and glutathione are regulated independently during the growth of Arabidopsis cells in culture. \n\n2. Glutathione is recruited into the nucleus early in the cell cycle, the ratio of glutathione in the nucleus and cytosol being an important regulator of growth and defence processes. \n\n3. There is a strong correlation between the abundance of glutathione and PARP gene expression and enzyme activity during the cell cycle. These findings demonstrate that glutathione is important regulator of the cell cycle, leading to new concepts of redox regulation of nuclear proteins during cell proliferation in plants and animals.
