It is strongly connected with learning and memory, which in turn depend on changes in how the brain processes information - referred to as 'neural plasticity'. For example, some diseases involving impaired memory are associated with a reduced ability to smell; learning about smells is easier when an individual has experienced them before; and newborns show preferences for odours that their mothers experienced during pregnancy. Although many of these effects take place in the brain, this kind of 'plasticity' can also take place at the first stage of processing - in the neurons in the nose. However, we know very little about this peripheral plasticity. We hypothesise that changes in the peripheral sensory code form an essential component of neural plasticity underlying altered olfactory behavioural responses. This hypothesis is supported by our recent work showing that peripheral olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) can generate variable responses to exactly the same odour. This implies that the sensory code reaching the brain is not predictable for a given odour and that plasticity in the sensory code occurs in the periphery. We will study the fruitfly larva. The neural 'wiring diagram' of a larval nose is the same as in humans, but much simpler - it has only 21 OSNs, compared to millions in humans. Each of these OSNs is unique because they possess different types of odour receptors. Because of this, we can record the electrical firing activity of individual OSNs in a whole larva and find out how each one responds to a range of odours. Furthermore, we can genetically alter larvae so that only 1 or 2 identified OSNs are capable of responding, or we can selectively kill individual identified OSNs so that they cannot respond. Behavioural tests tell us which odours larvae can detect and which ones they prefer and, just like more complex animals, larvae show altered responses to odours dependent on previous experience of specific odours. They can also learn to respond to an odour that is associated with a sugar reward. We will first describe the changes that occur in the electrical responses of individual OSNs in larvae that have been trained using specific odours. We expect to find OSN-specific changes in the sensory code following prior exposure of the larva, or its mother, to an odour. We also predict that the ability to learn associations between specific odours and food reward will be enhanced. Once we have acquired the electrophysiological data, we will construct a computer model of how the peripheral olfactory code works in this simple organism. This model will be based on real firing data from the responses of individual OSNs to a range of odours. It will then be used to make predictions about how well the system can discriminate particular odours. We hypothesise that prior olfactory experience and accompanying peripheral neural plasticity will improve discrimination ability and we will test this both on real larvae and using the computer model. The model will also predict which OSNs are the most important for discriminating specific odours and we will test this using larvae in which these OSNs have been selectively killed. The numerical simplicity of our larvae will allow us to gain new insights into sensory coding and how this links to behaviour in a whole animal. The computer model can be developed for application to more complex sensory systems. In addition our work will be relevant to the development of improved odour-based insect pest control strategies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H009914/1","grantId":"BB/H009914/1","fundValue":"489897","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings being prepared for publication.

For this they need an efficient olfactory system with the capacity for both short and long term plasticity.\n\nThe olfactory system of Drosophila larvae comprises a peripheral system (21 olfactory sensory neurons - OSNs) and a central system (21 glomeruli in the antennal lobe connected to the mushroom body by projection neurons). Combinatorial coding in the periphery allows larvae to detect and discriminate a large number of odours. Previous studies have characterised the odour-response profiles of 19 of the 21 OSNs and found that a given OSN’s response to a given odour is often highly variable (Hoare et al 2008, 2011). This raised the possibility that the peripheral olfactory code exhibits plasticity and that this plasticity may be directly involved in mediating behavioural adaptation and learning.\n\nUsing larvae possessing only one functional olfactory sensory neuron (OSN), we have studied the effect of short and long-term exposure to an odour on the response of individual OSN classes to a panel of odours, using extracellular electrophysiology and behavioural assays. \n\nOur study shows that prior exposure to an odour significantly modifies odour-evoked, but not spontaneous, activity of OSNs. However, this modification is relatively weak; significant odour-evoked responses are maintained, showing that responsiveness of the peripheral olfactory system of the larva is robust. A computational modelling approach based on the electrophysiological data has been developed to explore the information-processing implications of response plasticity; the results show that prior odour experience does not affect the ability of the system to detect and discriminate odours. \n\nBy including the electrophysiological data set in a computational model, we have also investigated the features of the peripheral code. The response dynamics of each OSN class to a panel of odours are different, so we explored how this is used to discriminate between odours. Both firing intensity and the temporal pattern of firing can be used to enable both odour detection and discrimination. However, the latter is more effective. Initial odour identification at stimulus onset depends on firing intensity. However, discrimination accuracy can be improved by ‘waiting’ for more temporal information to become available. A better understanding of olfactory coding may contribute to research into human disease in which olfaction is impaired – for example, Alzheimer and Parkinson’s diseases.\n\nOur findings will be of interest to researchers developing improved odour-based pest control strategies.\n\nUnderstanding of computational aspects of olfactory coding may be exploited by researchers developing electronic noses, for use in both scientific and commercial settings.\n The larval olfactory system of Drosophila shows some homology with the mammalian olfactory system but it is numerically much simpler. Our findings in larvae will contribute to understanding of mammalian, including human, olfaction. The computational modelling approach can be applied to studies of sensory coding, and how the code may be modified by experience. Chemicals,Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
