This model will be tested against mesoscale model simulations and its limitations explored numerically. In particular two hypotheses will be examined. The first hypotheis is that regional simulations of very extreme rainfall are consistent with the proposed hybrid model. The second hypothisis is that the hybrid model is suitable for finite time periods and can be adjusted for non-stationary parameters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F011822/1","grantId":"NE/F011822/1","fundValue":"204525","fundStart":"2008-01-21","fundEnd":"2010-10-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  We have presented our results to EDF who where interested in flood management.

This finding supports the need for high resolution climate models, as a coarse resolution model will not be able to capture the enhanced sensitivity of extreme rainfall to temperature.
