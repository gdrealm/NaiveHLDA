To move the world of digital economy successfully to the next phase with Web 2.0 it is vital to have identity management solutions in place. The Internet technologies today contribute significantly to vital societal objectives such as email, supply chain management, e-commerce, healthcare and VoIP communications.The proposal covering key areas of digital economy, i.e. the Internet Communications, Identity Management and the Socio-economic impact of the internet being submitted under the INTERACT Call for Proposals, aims to build upon the new relations developed under the previous INTERACT:India grant, under which visits to leading Indian educational institutes and laboratories were made, followed by the organisation of two major workshops which were attended by more that 200 scientists and engineers from all over India besides delegates from the UK. This proposal aims to strengthen the UK's links with the rapidly developing research base, the emerging information security industries in the Indian market in identity management, internet communications, and their socio-economic impacts. The request is for funds to enable a group of experienced researchers in UK with complimentary fields to develop new and mutually beneficial partnerships with scientists, engineers, economists, and social scientists at several major Industrial and University laboratories in India. The major aim of the mission is the raising awareness of the quality of research in the UK and then the strengthening of mutually supportive research. The proposal seeks to support for a number of actions, to open a new series of contacts in this aspect of the burgeoning Indian 'high tec' market, to enable wider dissemination of research capabilities and results, to share and benefit from experience in technology and knowledge translation and to allow a detailed exchange of ideas and expertise in this growing field.New industrial, academic and research laboratories have been identified during the last two workshops and through the proposed Network activity the planned link can be expanded and will be exploited academically and commercially.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F031335/1","grantId":"EP/F031335/1","fundValue":"134521","fundStart":"2008-02-27","fundEnd":"2010-08-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"M  Rajarajan","coPersons":["Kenneth Thomas Victor Grattan"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
