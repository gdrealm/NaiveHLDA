Multiplication of EBV is essential to produce the virus particles that allow EBV to infect cells and spread between individuals. Infection of antibody-producing cells in the blood with EBV results in abnormal continual growth of the cells. Most of the time the virus hides in these cells, without replicating. Recently, the replication of the virus has been linked with its ability to cause these cells to grow continuously.\nOne viral gene has been nicknamed &quot;The master regulator of lytic EBV replication&quot;. The gene generates a protein, known as Zta, which is required for replication of the viral genome. Zta alters the expression of viral and human genes by binding directly to DNA in the genomes. It recognises a very short region of DNA, containing only 7 DNA base-pairs - of 2041 potential combinations, there are 32 functional variations of this code and each is called a ZRE. \nZta increases the expression of some genes but decreases the expression of others. The ability of Zta to increase the expression of viral genes is key to its ability to promote viral replication and the molecules that allow Zta to increase gene expression are partly understood. In contrast little is known of the mechanism of Zta causing decreased gene expression. Two cellular genes known to be down-regulated by Zta are normally required by the immune system to function, so Zta may allow EBV to avoid destruction by the immune response.\nHere, we aim to discover the molecular mechanisms that determine whether the expression of a gene is increased or decreased by Zta.\n(i) We will employ state-of-the-art techniques (ChIP-Seq) to identify binding sites for Zta in the human genome. We will also determine whether genes near the Zta binding sites have increased or decreased gene expression. We will also investigate the other proteins that bind to genes near Zta and will investigate whether the DNA at Zta-binding sites is methylated or not. We can then select representative human genes to investigate further to identify which neighbouring DNA elements cause Zta interaction with a ZRE to either increase or decrease gene expression. \n(ii) We will explore whether Zta-mediated increases or decreases in gene expression are influenced by the attachment of a small protein molecule (SUMO) to Zta or through Zta binding to other host proteins using a proteomics strategy. \n(iii) This project will identify those host genes that are regulated by Zta during viral replication and so is likely to highlight further mechanisms used to reprogram human cells for viral replication. This will increase our understanding of the basic process of EBV replication and potentially these can be explored as targets for future drug discovery.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J001708/1","grantId":"MR/J001708/1","fundValue":"385988","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison Jane Sinclair","coPersons":["Martin  Rowe"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
