Poor health and disability remain the two most significant barriers to employment among older people.&nbsp;This Network will bring together academic and practitioner experts in engineering and design; work-related stress and well-being; ergonomics and human factors; employment trends and management practices; and workforce ageing and policy interventions. This multi-disciplinary team will address the complex and inter-related factors which determine the relationship between older people and the labour market. The objective is to develop a ground-breaking, integrated research proposal for a Collaborative Research Project under the third call of the New Dynamics of Ageing programme. This will examine workplace interventions which are beneficial for the employee and, at the same time, bring business and organisational benefits for the employer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our network is underpinned by two overarching frameworks, that of Inclusive Design and of Workability. Inclusive Design allows us to investigate the specific needs and preferences of older workers, whilst providing better workplace solutions for all ages. One of the fundamental principles of inclusive design is matching the demands of the product (job) to the individual’s (employee’s) capabilities. This is also central to&nbsp;the second framework, that of Workability. This takes a holistic approach to ageing and individual coping and well-being in employment and is based on four different actions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Adjustments to the physical work environment, </li> \n <li>Adjustments to the psycho-social work environment, </li> \n <li>Health and lifestyle promotion</li> \n <li>Updating skills.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0139","grantId":"RES-351-25-0139","fundValue":"19359","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kerry Ann Platman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
