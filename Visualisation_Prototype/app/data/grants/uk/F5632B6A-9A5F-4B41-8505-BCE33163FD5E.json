{"id":"F5632B6A-9A5F-4B41-8505-BCE33163FD5E","title":"Liverpool Telescope Operations 2014-2016","abstractText":"The Liverpool Telescope (LT ) (http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/) is the world's largest and most sophisticated (in terms of range of science programmes, flexibility of scheduling, and sophistication of instrumentation) robotic telescope with a dual role to carry out internationally competitive research and deliver the key observing resource to the National Schools Observatory. The NSO offers school children near-immediate access to a world-class observatory. Since its launch in 2004, this has led to over 70,000 observing requests from schools and the NSO currently works with over 4000 teachers throughout the UK and Ireland. At the core of the NSO is the website which provides support material for a range of subjects and receives well over 1 million hits each year. \n\nSince operations began in 2004, LT has specialised in delivering high impact results in time domain astrophysics. Indeed, the observatory is unique in actively encouraging rapid-response and difficult-to-schedule monitoring projects from the U.K. and Spanish communities. Refereed publications that include LT data typically average 36 citations/paper; to date 14 such papers have appeared in the high-profile journals Nature or Science, these having on average 86 citations/paper. \n \nFrom the outset, the goal has been to provide a wide variety of instrumentation to cater for the broad interests of the LJMU and U.K./Spanish communities. Currently, optical photometry, spectroscopy and polarimetry are offered with instruments and a software environment that are capable of sampling timescales from ~10 milliseconds to ~10 years. A continuous programme of instrument upgrades has been aggressively pursued throughout the last decade. Over the next 12 months we aim to complement the existing suite of five instruments with a new, high-throughput optical spectrometer and a two-band, near-infrared imager. Together these seven instruments will keep the facility competitive and ensure its position at the forefront of time domain astronomy for at least the next five years. \n\nThis application is for an STFC contribution over the period 2014-2016 (at a reduced level to previous years) to the funding for the maintenance and operation of the Liverpool Telescope, and hence the continuation of its role as a major resource both for the LJMU Astrophysics Research Institute and the wider UK community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M003035/1","grantId":"ST/M003035/1","fundValue":"497752","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Iain Allan  Steele","coPersons":["MF  Bode"],"organisation":"Liverpool John Moores University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
