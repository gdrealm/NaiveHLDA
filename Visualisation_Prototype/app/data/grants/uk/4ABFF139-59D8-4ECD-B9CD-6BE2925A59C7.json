Equipping Newly appointed-Early career Researchers and the next Generation in York (ENERGY)","abstractText":"Our vision is to conduct cutting-edge research with the greatest chance of impact and adventure through supporting our most promising Early Career Researchers (ECRs*), working on major global challenges, specifically EPSRC challenge themes of Energy, Healthcare Technologies and Manufacturing the Future. Investing in this research programme will support the best research being carried out within the Physical Science Departments at the UoY. The University of York (UoY) seriously recognises the need to invest in the next generation of research stars and leaders. UoY has an excellent track record in identifying talented young scientists from across the Physical Sciences, whilst nurturing their careers and growing their adventurous research ideas and ambitious plans. Their futures are underpinned by significant investment in state-of-the-art equipment, buildings infrastructure, mentoring schemes and training, and exposure to both established and emerging interactions with academic and industrial groups from across the world. The proposed new small equipment will enable significantly more effective use of existing large equipment and facilities inspired by ECR. The latter is supported by dedicated groups, headed by world-leading researchers, and Centres of Excellence in several areas of strategic importance. As a clear deliverable we propose to bring together all of our Physical Science ECRs on a regular basis (i.e. in the form of workshops) to disseminate research findings, share experience, identify collaborative possibilities and future research projects (of strategic importance to EPSRC). We will also showcase our research plans at career researcher development events, within the Yorkshire area and on a national level (e.g. SET-for-Britain), whilst also engage in outreach activities (e.g. seeding the next generation of students entering into the Physical Sciences). Investment in the UoY will enable ECRs to develop and connect their research programmes, whilst exploiting current large-scale equipment infrastructures. Investment in these activities will greatly influence and facilitate inter- and intra-disciplinary research, in bridging physics, chemistry, electronics, biology and medicine, and forge intra-departmental synergies with translation from fundamentals to real-end user applications.\n\n* We define ECRs as academics within 5 years of becoming independent, post-doctoral researchers (PDRs) and PhD students.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K031589/1","grantId":"EP/K031589/1","fundValue":"482600","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Knox Local","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
