{"id":"7D9D5B60-7DBB-4163-AB7D-C6EB79A8AA5F","title":"Challenging Elites: rethinking disconnection and recovering urban space","abstractText":"Our project is grounded in the lived experience of contested urban spaces and neighbourhoods undergoing rapid change. Through deep engagement within four contrasting sites in England and Scotland over five years, we will investigate power dynamics and their consequent material, cultural and symbolic struggles, bringing together academics, community and campaigning organisations, citizens, artists/designers, activists and planners. We will propose, test and analyse live, investigative interventions through arts, media, design and storytelling that enable participants to challenge taken-for-granted or 'common sense' narratives of urban development, belonging and civic participation. The project brings together a multidisciplinary team of academics and community partners with a deep commitment to participatory practice. \n\nWider outputs from the large grant proposal developed from this process will include: publications, exhibitions, events, debates, reports, film, audio, media, and direct, participatory urban design and public art interventions in the chosen localities. \n\nThe research questions, aims, objectives and methods outlined above, agreed across the consortium, will be subject to an intensive co-production process through the development phase of the project. Within this process questions, issues, concepts and approaches will be refined, challenged and reflected upon. As well as workshops, presentation of brief position papers and discussion, we will also test out some of the other methods that are core to the project - walking, mapping and making temporary art/design interventions in the chosen locations. This deliberately peripatetic and experimental approach will require members of the research team and partners to visit different locations, engage in discussion, listen to participants and interact with wider communities, seeking appropriate permissions and assessing the potential of the sites to generate powerful evidence/testimony drawn from tension, conflict and ongoing urban redevelopment plans. \n\nWe will also identify appropriate archival sources, assessing relevant heritage and built environment resources, meet with new cultural and voluntary sector organisations, and generate detailed criteria for finalising the selection of sites where we will work. We will recruit an advisory group which will act as a challenging sounding board and connect the project to wider stakeholder communities, including local/national policymakers, academic, charity and third sector networks, artists, architects and urbanists, think tanks and media organisations. \n\nScoping papers and brief literature reviews will be shared amongst the whole team through a series of short blogposts linked to the development of a public website as well as use of closed social media in order to build trust, confidence, sharpen our approach and clarify concepts and methods. We will also connect with international sources of comparative methods and approaches including projects and programmes in India, the USA, mainland Europe and other international academic networks dealing with our themes and questions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M006093/1","grantId":"AH/M006093/1","fundValue":"24170","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham  Jeffery","coPersons":["Ben  Rogaly","Roger  Green","Susan Mary Porter","Becky  Taylor"],"organisation":"University of the West of Scotland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
