Existing macroeconomic research has tended to focus on a number of simple idealised financial market structures where financial markets allow full international risk sharing. Existing models therefore provide only limited insights into how differing degrees of financial market development interact with monetary policy and welfare in open economies. </p>\n\n<p>This project will construct and analyse a number of theoretical models where financial markets do not allow full international risk sharing. The project will address three main questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>How do international financial market flows and asset prices respond to monetary policy and exogenous shocks when financial markets do not provide full risk sharing and how do these responses depend on the extent of financial market development?<br /></li>\n\n <li>How should monetary policy respond to exogenous shocks when international financial markets do not provide full risk sharing and how does the optimal monetary rule differ in different financial market structures?<br /></li>\n\n <li>What are the implications of the choice of monetary policy regime for the endogenous determination of international financial market structure?</li>\n</ol>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-156-25-0027","grantId":"RES-156-25-0027","fundValue":"61477","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Sutherland","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":" not required at this time not required at this time Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
