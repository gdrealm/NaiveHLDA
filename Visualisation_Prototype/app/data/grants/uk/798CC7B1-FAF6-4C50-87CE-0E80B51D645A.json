However, in the 'collaborations and partnerships' part of this document we have reported on the impact of projects/collaborations under the RIBEN umbrella. \n\nOverall, what can be highlighted in terms of RIBEN's impact is that:\n(a) RIBEN was 'ahead of the curve' in many of the co-funding and co-governance relations it was obliged to pioneer with its industry partners. What it pioneered has been of considerable value more widely - not least in helping shift the 'culture of engagement' in ESRC towards the flexible, realistic, facilitating and supportive approach which over the past two years has increasingly defined ESRC practice.\n\n(b) RIBEN succeeded in pioneering new relations with the retail sector, which, at the time the CBC was being planned (2007/8) was regarded as being notoriously difficult to penetrate and engage with. Moreover, an industry in which key stakeholders were either deeply suspicious of the motivations of social science researchers, and/or saw little evidence in that research of appreciation of the strategic and competitive pressures retailers (large and small) faced, or the complex fragility of their contributions to the UK economy\n\n(c) RIBEN succeeded in forging these new relations during the depth of the severe economic downturn and collapse of consumer confidence which characterized 2008 as the shockwave of the global financial crisis of 2007 tore through the UK economy. To have obtained external 'user' partners (each providing three years financial or in-kind support) for 11 of the 15 CASE retail sector studentships made available to RIBEN, during five years of double dip recession, declining family incomes, public sector expenditure cuts, and deepening 'austerity', is in the view of the RIBEN Co-Directors a considerable achievement. \n\nFinally, it can be argued that RIBEN's achievement provided\nencouragement and an emulation target for the successful ESRC Retail Data Navigator 'capacity building' scheme which was launched in 2012.

As such, due to the nature of RIBEN, we cannot report on specific research findings. \n\nRIBEN has arguably has played a not insignificant background role in\nhelping shape, a new environment of knowledge exchange and enriched\nunderstanding between ESRC and the retail sector - this highly important sector of the UK economy.\n\nRIBEN was 'ahead of the curve' in many of the co-funding and co-governance relations it was obliged to pioneer with its industry partners. What it pioneered has been of considerable value more widely - not least in helping shift the 'culture of engagement' in ESRC towards the flexible, realistic, facilitating and supportive approach which has increasingly defined ESRC practice. Moreover, it can be argued that RIBEN's achievement provided encouragement and an emulation target for the successful ESRC Retail Data Navigator 'capacity building' scheme which was launched in 2012. In recent years there has been a noticeable shift in the way the ESRC engages with the retail industry. A new environment of knowledge exchange and understanding has been created between the ESRC and this highly important sector of the UK economy which had previously been regarded as extremely difficult to penetrate.\n\nThe RIBEN Capacity Building Cluster (CBC) has arguably played an important background/facilitating role in helping shape this new 'culture of engagement'. As such, we anticipate that the 'legacy' of the RIBEN CBC will be reflected in this shift in the 'culture of engagement', and in the dividends which are beginning to flow from the flexible, realistic, facilitating and supportive approach which ESRC now adopts in respect of co-funding and co-governance arrangements with the industry. \n\nFeedback received from industry partners suggests that efforts made by\nthe RIBEN co-Directors have resulted in retailers and retail trade bodies\nincreasingly appreciating the value of evidence-based research and being willing to consider long-term collaborative research projects with academic partners - a trend which contradicts the short-termist stereotype of firms operating in this industry.
