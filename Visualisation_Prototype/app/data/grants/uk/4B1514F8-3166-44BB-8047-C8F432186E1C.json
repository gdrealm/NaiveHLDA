There will be two main phases to this investigation. </p>\n\n<p>The first phase will investigate the role of source-monitoring errors and semantic activation on false memory production when using the test-induced priming procedure. For the second phase of this investigation DRM and categorised lists will be designed and matched for BAS. False recognition and recall is generally higher for DRM lists compared to categorised lists, and differences in BAS of these lists may explain why. Differences in BAS will be investigated by manipulating BAS scores within both DRM and categorised lists.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3561","grantId":"RES-000-22-3561","fundValue":"77352","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lauren Michelle  Knott","coPersons":["Mark L Howe","Stephen Anthony Dewhurst"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
