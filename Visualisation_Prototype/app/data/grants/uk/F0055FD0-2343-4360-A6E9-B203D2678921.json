A wider variety of science courses are available with more emphasis on applied science and teaching about socio-scientific issues. This study examines school responses to this major curriculum reform. A particular focus is teacher enactment of the science curriculum in the classroom. The study is also investigating the initial impact of these reforms on student achievement, attitudes towards science education and participation in post-compulsory science courses. The study combines nationally representative data, using the National Pupil Database, and in-depth school-based case studies. Data will be collected over a three year period enabling a longitudinal analysis of the developing enactment and impact of these reforms in the initial years. The study will identify any targeting by schools of specific courses on students with particular characteristics and any differential success across courses in terms of student achievement and uptake of post-compulsory science education. The study will also provide a generalised account of factors impacting on student attitudes to school science and their participation in post-compulsory science courses.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-179-25-0004","grantId":"RES-179-25-0004","fundValue":"385883","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Ryder","coPersons":["James  Donnelly"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" The EISER study examined school responses to a major reform to the science National Curriculum for 14-16 year olds in England. This reform made available a wider variety of science courses with more emphasis on applied science and teaching about socio-scientific issues and the nature of science. \n\n\n\nThrough a document analysis we identify multiple aims ascribed to the reform, reflecting the differing values and authority of stakeholders. However, these written aims only achieved meaning through practice in schools. Analysis of interviews with around 50 teachers over three years shows that enactment of the reform varied greatly, and was influenced by personal goals, internal features of their workplace, and external contexts such as educational policies outside of science and national accountability measures. \n\n\n\nThrough an innovative analysis of national datasets we have investigated patterns of participation across science courses over five years. Science participation has become increasingly diversified, with a stronger presence for applied science courses. There is evidence that the under-representation of girls within 'high status' Triple Award science courses is reducing over time. By contrast the under-representation of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds on these courses (even when controlling for prior attainment) remains largely unchanged. \n\n\n\nAnalysis of group interviews with students from 19 schools over two years shows that whilst some students responded positively to attempts within the reform to improve their interest in science (e.g. inclusion of socio-scientific issues) other students preferred a focus on learning traditional science knowledge.
