{"id":"DDDD0B2A-3B50-4289-8E1B-7FB2F7FAFC28","title":"13TSB_ENDANI: Automated pen-side faecal egg counting system for grazing livestock","abstractText":"We propose to develop automated methods for counting parasite eggs in faecal samples from grazing livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, horses and pigs), and for distinguishing the eggs of different parasites. The proposed technology will form the basis of novel pen-side tests to indicate levels of infection in individuals and groups of animals at the point of care, and hence inform decisions on treatment. As a result, use of antiparasitic drugs will become more efficient and more sustainable, and select less strongly for drug resistance, which currently threatens livestock health, welfare and productivity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L011379/1","grantId":"BB/L011379/1","fundValue":"265665","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Eric Rene  Morgan","coPersons":["Mark Charles Eisler"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" The project is ongoing and discoveries are promising but covered by non-disclosure agreements at the present time.
