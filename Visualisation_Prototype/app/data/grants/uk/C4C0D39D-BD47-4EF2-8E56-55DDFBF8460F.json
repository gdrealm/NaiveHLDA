{"id":"C4C0D39D-BD47-4EF2-8E56-55DDFBF8460F","title":"The meaning of health security for disaster resilience in Bangladesh","abstractText":"<p>This project assesses how health influences vulnerability to major disaster events. It generates knowledge on health security as part of disaster risk reduction and its role in sustainable livelihoods. The project aims to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> Identify how health security influences vulnerability and resilience to disasters.</li> \n <li> Assess how health security monitoring can facilitate early warning and preparedness against changing thresholds of disaster risk.</li> \n <li> Evaluate which approaches to health security enable people to monitor resilience as an aid to mitigating the impact of disaster events.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>The project is focused on Bangladesh. Datasets are used to assess how the impacts of disasters are related to pre-disaster health levels and the extent to which the period of recovery is related to this. Participatory research methods identify local perspectives on how health affects vulnerability to disaster. The research will provide findings that inform how health and health management builds community resilience to disaster risks in disaster prone locations. This will assist in the monitoring of health security at local, national and international levels and contribute to identifying how people can carry out their own individual and community based assessments of resilience to disaster.<br /></p> \n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E014852/1","grantId":"ES/E014852/1","fundValue":"221981","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Elvin Collins","coPersons":["Abbas  Bhuiya"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
