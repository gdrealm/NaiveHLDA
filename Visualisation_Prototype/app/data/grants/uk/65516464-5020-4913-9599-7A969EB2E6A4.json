In additon, the key information will be publicised through scientific and media conferences.During public presentations it will be emphasized that the programme addresses a fundamental issue of our defence against infection and the control of self-destructive inflammatory diseases. The principles to be uncovered by the programme, which is based on our ongoing novel discovery carried out under the current MRC programme grant, will have far reaching implications not only in fundamental science but also in the practical applications in treating some of the most important human diseases. These include new methods for vaccine development and suppressing destructive inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. We will concentrate on uncovering the mechanisms by which bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) can synergise with specific antigens to activate T lymphocytes (T cells) and maintain the life span of these cells, the memory T cells. T cells play a pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response and the ability to regulate their functions is crucial in enhancing the host response to pathogens and controlling excessive immune response which could be detrimental to the host. For example, if we know exactly how we can produce an enhanced T cell response and sustain T cell memory when encountering the bacterial product BLP, then we could design a method to boost our response to the infection to produce a better vaccine. On the other hand, when dealing with the infection, there is a danger that the host may produce excessive response to BLP and cause self-destructive inflammation. We have now found that another molecule called ST2, present on T cells, can down-regulate the signal produced by BLP. If we understand precisely how this works, we may be able to devise new methods to control the excessive inflammatory response. Thus, the programme holds considerable promise in finding novel approaches to combat infectious and autoimmune diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9818261","grantId":"G9818261","fundValue":"2848020","fundStart":"1999-03-16","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Foo Yew Liew","coPersons":["Damo  Xu"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
