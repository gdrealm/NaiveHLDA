Finding and implementing these solutions is a top priority for governments and scientists worldwide, and has been articulated as a key BBSRC strategic objective. Opportunities for plant science to contribute to global food security include increasing the yield and quality of crops, combatting diseases, enabling maximal crop productivity in sub-optimal growth conditions, and increasing maximal yield potential. Utilising non- food components of food crops, such as cell wall material and waste products of food production to produce energy and industrial feedstocks, has a major role in reaching sustainability and maximising overall yield of renewable resources from limited land and soils. Grass crops are essential for human existence by directly or indirectly serving as the primary source of human nutrition. Wheat, rice and coarse grains such as maize are the most important crops for human food production, therefore increasing grain production sustainably is a critically important strategic and scientific objective. Wheat is the main arable crop in the UK, planted on 60% of arable land, with an annual farm gate value of ~&pound;2.5b and a processed product value of approximately &pound;150bn. Yield increases in wheat are slowing compared to past gains achieved primarily through improved agronomy and also in relation to other grain crops, notably maize. Genetic and transgenic improvement of wheat is therefore a very high priority in the UK and world- wide, and large international programmes for wheat genetic improvement are underway. A high quality genomics sequence provides a complete, accurate and durable record of genes, predicted proteins and other genomic elements that today are a fundamental foundation for neay all areas of biological research. This proposal describes a UK component of an international coordinated wheat genome sequencing project that will make decisive and innovative contributions to sequencing the wheat genome and supporting crop improvement through genomics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J003743/1","grantId":"BB/J003743/1","fundValue":"2667350","fundStart":"2012-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew Derek Clark","coPersons":["Ksenia  Krasileva"],"organisation":"The Genome Analysis Centre","findingsText":" We have made considerable progress in achieving objective 1 a draft genome sequence of bread wheat Chinese Spring 42. We have produced large quantities of whole genome shotgun data from high quality PCR-free large insert tightly size selected libraries for paired end sequencing and assembly, and a variety of long mate pair libraries covering a range of insert sizes for scaffolding over repeats. To improve this further we are developing the use of fosmid libraries in vectors that are compatible with Illumina sequencing of fosmid ends (FosIlls) for scaffolding in the 40kb range.\n\nFor objective 2 generating the sequence of four chromosomes to high quality reference standards we have commissioned the physical separation of 3 of the chromosomes not already available and the making of a library for sequencing. One of these was then fingerprinted to select a minimal tile path (MTP) for sequencing together with the already fingerprinted 3DL. We have developed a high throughput, low cost BAC sequencing pipeline to prepare and sequence the samples in a rapid, cost-effective manner. We have parallelised processes to sequence at first 384 samples (BACs) at once and have successfully increased this 6-fold to processing 2304 samples at once. We have also decreased the cost and increased the throughput to the extent that it is possible to sequence the whole bread wheat genome using randomly generated (not MTP) BACs quickly and at low cost. This would achieve further cost savings as creating an MTP is time consuming and costly. We can still see further considerable savings and increases in speed that are possible.\n\nFor objective 5 the re-sequencing of genes of mutagenised populations, and genes of diverse Triticeae genomes relevant to wheat pre-breeding research, we have developed an automated exome resequencing pipeline starting with leaf tissue and progressing to identify SNPs. This pipeline is useful for wheat and numerous other crops. \n\nFor objective 7 to maximize the impact of the research through training and outreach we provided a training workshop in using the wheat genomic resources for breeders, and were excited to hear about the breeders work as well as their positive feedback on our progress and to hear what data or tools they would like us to prioritise to serve the community.
