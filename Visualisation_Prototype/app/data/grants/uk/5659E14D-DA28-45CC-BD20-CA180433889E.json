By reading a variety of texts both literary and journalistic alongside each other, it explores not only what is said about war and multi ethnicity in former Yugoslavia, but also how it is said, by whom, where and for whom. \nThe key output will be a monograph, which will be the first to provide a comprehensive examination of German responses to war in the 1990s. By reading journalistic alongside literary texts, a different perspective on the study of war reporting emerges. Arguing that common images and narratives exist across very different genres of texts, this study moves the discussion of war reporting beyond the question of objectivity and truthfulness. Instead, it focuses attention on the ways in which stories of war, journalistic and literary, were shaped by German myths of identity, national and multicultural, as well as by Germany's past. By tracing in some detail the shifting position-takings on war and multi ethnicity throughout the 1990s, this study also offers a very thorough analysis of changing discourses in post-unification Germany.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113024/1","grantId":"113024/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Karoline  Van Oppen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
