{"id":"2E12BCF3-C248-48DE-94E6-353F236ADD3D","title":"Classical field theory and solitons","abstractText":"Topological solitons are particle-like solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations.In simple terms, by studying systems that have waves it is a surprise to find that they also have particles; which can be thought of as a coherent collection of waves. They arise very naturally in a variety of physical disciplines including particle physics, cosmology, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics. In some of these systems the solitons can be studied experimentally and in others the work is currently at a more theoretical and mathematical stage. The proposal is for a research workshop to bring together various groups working on different aspects of solitons with different applications and objectives, in order to identify common themes and initiatenew collaborations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E012930/1","grantId":"EP/E012930/1","fundValue":"2876","fundStart":"2006-07-28","fundEnd":"2006-10-27","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Sutcliffe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" The dynamics of phase transitions, the transition from the inflationary to Big Bang eras, and the study of solitons and other extended objects in field theory and M-theory, all require classical or quasi-classical field theory; most of the time progress requires numerical methods. A recurrent theme is nonlinearity, often in the form of solitons and other topological defects, spanning many areas of physics: from particle and nuclear physics, through condensed matter physics to cosmology.\n\n\n\nThis  ","dataset":"gtr"}
