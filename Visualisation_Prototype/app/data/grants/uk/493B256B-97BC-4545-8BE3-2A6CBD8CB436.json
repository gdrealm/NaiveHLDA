It will provide an accounting analysis of different chains to supplement information from standard statistical sources and interviews with all the key actors. Financial results and drivers of behaviour will be related to business models, so as to raise questions about the buyer driven business model favoured by most of the big supermarket chains. Does vertical disintegration embed inefficiencies and transaction costs which are not visible in supermarket accounts; and is the distinctive Morrisons model of integrated meat processing a viable alternative? All this is set in the context of argument and evidence about broader issues including rising imports, welfare standards and food security. Vion Food Group Limited, Britainâ€™s largest pig producer and a major supplier of own brand meat products to the supermarket chains, has joined the ESRC in co-funding this project whose outputs will include a major public interest report.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-185-31-0004","grantId":"RES-185-31-0004","fundValue":"74912","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karel  Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
