We have little empirical evidence about the lived experiences of South Asian communities growing older in the UK especially the nature, structure and processes of negotiation within families, social networks (global and local) and the experiences and meanings of 'care' and support' in everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>Several factors make understanding the family lives, social networks and experiences of 'care' and 'support' of South Asian communities important including high levels of health and economic inequalities and isolation and loneliness are high, especially for women. South Asian family and household structures are becoming increasingly complex, diverse and fluid resultant from altered migration patterns, intergenerational changes, increased mobility, changing expectations, and transformations in gender roles with more (younger) women participating in paid work.</p>\n\n<p>Using a diverse sample of 120 men and women aged 50+ we will explore: (1) social identities and levels of participation in transnational and local communities; (2) perceptions and experiences of family lives, social networks, 'place' and locality; and (3) ideas, meanings and experiences of 'care' and 'support'.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-352-25-0009","grantId":"RES-352-25-0009","fundValue":"244660","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christina  Victor","coPersons":["Wendy  Martin"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
