Incorporation of this material into soil as an aqueous suspension has been found to dramatically lower the fertilizer losses which occur ubiquitously in soils with medium to high rainfall, and/or irrigated soils. This is done through immobilization of the most soluble form of nitrogen (nitrate), and thus embodies a novel application for BCP to maximise nutrient use-efficiency in soils. Until now, proof of concept has been successful at the laboratory scale. However, market research, and meetings with potential investors have conclusively identified a need for evidence at the farm-scale. Rothamsted is in need of research council support to provide the data which is vital for attracting further investment, and establishing a self-supporting enterprise with the potential commercial partners identified herein.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021628/1","grantId":"BB/J021628/1","fundValue":"119918","fundStart":"2012-11-05","fundEnd":"2013-11-04","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The patented technology is being discussed with commercial companies for use in agriculture.
