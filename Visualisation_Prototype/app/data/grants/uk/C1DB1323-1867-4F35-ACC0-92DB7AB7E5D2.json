{"id":"C1DB1323-1867-4F35-ACC0-92DB7AB7E5D2","title":"Integrable Nonlinear Evolution PDEs on the Interval","abstractText":"During the three-month research visit of Professor Deconinck to Cambridge, we will investigate two problems which arise in the analysis of the celebrated nonlinear Schr\\ odinger equation (NLS) formulated on a finite interval: (a) The reduction of the general theory for solving intial-boundary value problems on the finite interval in the particular case that the boundary values are periodic in space. (b) The asymptotic behaviour of the solution in the case that the given Dirichlet boundary conditions are periodic in time. Regarding the first problem, we note that the related beautiful algebraic-geometric theory characterises the particular finite-gap case in terms of theta functions. Our goal is to characterise the general case in terms of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem and to rederive the results of the finite-gap representation as a particular case. Regarding the second problem, we note that for the linearized version of the NLS it has been shown recently that the asymptotic behaviour of the solution depends on the commensurability of the time period $T$ of the boundary data with $L^2/ \\pi$, where $L$ is the length of the finite interval. Our goal is to obtain an analogous result for the NLS.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H022201/1","grantId":"EP/H022201/1","fundValue":"15981","fundStart":"2010-01-18","fundEnd":"2010-04-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  For example, several researchers including David Smith and Natalie Sheils have used the results of the so called Unified Transform (or Fokas Transform) to solve new mathematical problems.

The PI has developed a new method for solving large class of such equations. This method has been acclaimed as the most important development in the exact analysis of linear PDEs since the works of the classics in the 18th century. In this proposal, this method is developed further and implemented to a particularly difficult problem. The method is currently being investigated as an alternative to the finite element method and boundary integral method for the solution of linear elliptic PDEs for the interior problem. In addition it is considered as an alternative Wiener Hopf technique. Education,Other","dataset":"gtr"}
