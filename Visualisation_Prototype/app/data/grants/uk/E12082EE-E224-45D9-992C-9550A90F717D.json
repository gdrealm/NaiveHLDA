{"id":"E12082EE-E224-45D9-992C-9550A90F717D","title":"The structure of threading defects in GaN nanorods","abstractText":"The proposal is to use the SuperStem facility at Daresbury to analyse the atomic structure of new threading defects observed in GaN nanorods grown by molecular beam epitaxy as part of a recent EPSRC grant, EP/D080762/1, joint between Bristol, Nottingham and Bath Universities. A model for these defects, which are planar faults, has already been derived as a result of low resolution observations in the transmission electron microscope in Bristol, and this has been used to propose a new nanorod growth mechanism. The SuperStem will enable us to directly analyse the displacements associated with these faults, and thereby clarify the growth model.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H020284/1","grantId":"EP/H020284/1","fundValue":"6574","fundStart":"2009-10-07","fundEnd":"2010-08-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not yet, as a complete understanding of these defects has yet to be achieved Electronics,Energy Cultural","person":"David  Cherns","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" The aim was to use high resolution electron microscopy at the SuperSTEM to clarify the core structure of new threading defects we have reported in GaN nanorods. The work showed that the displacement due to these defects was less than a c-lattice spacing, confirming indirect observations from other techniques. The observations for one defect suggested an even-smaller displacement than c/2, which was proposed on the basis of a tentative model, implying that the model was not the complete solution. Unfortunately it proved not possible to confirm the displacement for other defects in the time available.\n\nThe research identified an unexpectedly high degree of surface oxidation on the non-polar GaN surfaces, which is now being examined further., and may have implications for growth of nanorod devices based on GaN Current work is seeking to clarify the surface oxidation observed, as this may have technological significance Electronics,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
