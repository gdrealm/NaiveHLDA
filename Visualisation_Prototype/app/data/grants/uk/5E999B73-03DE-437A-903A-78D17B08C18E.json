Despite the fact that many different chemically unrelated proteins form amyloid fibrils, the final fibrillar complexes appear to share similar fundamental structures. The primary objective of the proposed work was to determine the intermolecular organisation of polypeptide in a model amyloid fibril system at high resolution using solid-state NMR techniques. \n\nThe most significant achievement of this award was the first determination of the 3D structure of an amyloid fibril using a simplified model system. We also extended this approach to a larger and far more challenging system, making the first steps towards determining its structure at atomic resolution.\n\nSince all amyloid fibril structures share a common structure, whether derived from model polypeptide systems or disease-related proteins, our findings provide insight that are of relevance to medicine and to the pharmaceutical industry. Our findings present the first atomistic structure of a polypeptide in an amyloid fibre. This can be used to design small molecule inhibitors to arrest protein self-assembly, of relevance to diseases of ageing such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. \n\nWe also presented advanced methods for the determination of protein structure using MAS solid-state-NMR spectroscopy, which have applications towards a wide variety of protein and polypeptide systems.
