New songs are developed through a series of workshops and exchanges between young composers, poets and singers, which are then performed live at the Wigmore each year. \\n\\nThe aim of this project is to develop a digital platform - an interactive website - that will not only make these sound and visual files available, but also document the process of collaboration and materials which poets, composers and singers use to think about the crossings between their different traditions, including the way in which languages of poetry, music and sound can be thought in new digital environments. In addition to the focus on Voiceworks, which will include a blog for those participating in the programme and a live streaming of the Voiceworks performances at Wigmore Hall on the internet, the website will generate an archive of materials available to researchers and those interested in the wider interactions of text, music and song over the last century and beyond, a resource that can be added to as new work emerges. Those active on the project will also film and record with permission a range of contemporary work currently taking place in London - from live poetry, to sound performances, to new work in opera and song - which can be made available on the site. \\n\\nThe developing of a website such as this is an opportunity to think about the digital archive and its emerging possibilities as a research question in its own right. Discussion of, and active participation in the making of, the digital Voiceworks project will be supported by talks and colloquia throughout the period of the grant, culminating in a public symposium at Wigmore Hall. The curating of the website over the period will involve the exploration of how innovative poetic and song composition can be brought to wider audiences and new generations, by using the technologies of a digital environment (flickr, youtube, itunes, vimeo) to inform its work. It will include poets and composers in residence on the site for agreed periods of time, the commissioning of particular work or exchanges, interviews, the development of new areas of the archive by invited participants. Its aim is to exploit the creative possibilities of the digital field for the field of song, music composition and poetics, in a unique collaboration which brings the traditions and cultural/creative assets of an institution such as Wigmore Hall, as well as proven innovative practice and research at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and Birkbeck's Centre for Poetics, an internationally known forum for performance, publication and discussion of contemporary poetries, into new networks and potential.\\n\\n\\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H037004/1","grantId":"AH/H037004/1","fundValue":"136498","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-04-01","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Voiceworks website established at Voiceworks.org.uk in March 2011.
