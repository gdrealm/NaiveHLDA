The Centre aims to develop new treatments for disease through research into stem cells.\n?Stem cells? are master cells that have the ability either to multiply themselves or form the specialised cells that make up different tissues. Scientists and doctors believe that understanding how stem cells behave will lead to development of new treatments. The new treatments may involve replacing cells in the patient that have been damaged by disease. In other cases it may be possible to identify drugs that are able to make the patient?s own cells carry out the repair. \nStem cells will also be used in testing new drugs. At present the effect of new drugs is measured in tests with animals or with cells from animals. Sometimes the results are misleading because of differences between humans and animals. By using human cells for tests, scientists will reduce the number of animals that are used and the frequency with which misleading results cause expensive delays. \nScientists at SCRM have identified a number of diseases which to work on first. These are chosen because Edinburgh scientists lead the field in studying these diseases and stem cells may genuinely help to treat them. One aim is to be able to repair bone more effectively, especially to assist in hip repair. Other research will try to develop treatments to repair the nervous system, in diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis or Motor Neuron Disease. At present many patients with liver disease die before a suitable organ becomes available for transplantation. Stem cells may provide an alternative means of treatment. Stem cells may be used to repair the immune system and give back the patient?s ability to fight infections. In the longer term other programmes will address issues concerned with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and damage to the eye.\nSCRM will provide high class training for the basic scientists and the doctors needed for the new treatments to be applied safely and effectively. Finally, SCRM will work hard to ensure commercialisation of its research and work closely with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. \nTogether these activities in the new Centre will help to position the UK at the forefront of international stem cell science, provide important new opportunities for development of novel therapies and create well paid jobs in the UK.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700711","grantId":"G0700711","fundValue":"1668830","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles  Ffrench-Constant","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
