It is a two year feasibility study.There is body of knowledge about sensors, sensor networks, and aggregation of sensor information on which we can build. But while there are a number of systems for monitoring and informing consumers about energy use, these tend to be closed systems in which the information service provide controls the infrastructure, be this an energy provider, a road traffic information system, or a building management system.The assumptions which underlie this work are threefold:i) that globally deployed solutions will use mobile phones to interact with users (since in many parts of the world this is the only information infrastructure);ii) that there is a gap in our knowledge about how information applications can influence user behaviour both individually and as a collective; andiii) that we require platforms that both give flexibility to allow the rapid evolution of deployed applications, and are commercially viable.This is not a technology development study; the building blocks - sensor networks and mobile handsets - are available. It is an examination of two distinct but interacting challenges: (i) developing and evolving compelling and influential energy information applications; and(ii) providing a large scale commercial platform on which this development and evolution can be undertaken by independent application providers in light of observed behaviour.In each case the specific instances (energy awareness application, sensor aggregation) and general methodologies (user-centric application development, intermediate network services) will be examined. To meet these challenges we have brought together a multidisciplinary team from Cambridge, Nottingham, Exeter, and China Mobile. The expertise includes business modelling, networking and distributed systems, security, psychology, and sociology.China Mobile have allocated $100k in personnel and other costs to this project.China Mobile, the world's largest mobile operator are a key partner in this project, having demonstrated a willingness to entertain business models and deploy intermediate services - such as aggregation of sensor information - to allow application innovation by third parties.As well as providing insights into the problems described (and many subproblems) the main output of this project will transferred to commercial exploitation via China Mobile or one of its global partners and via the Horizon Digital Economy Hub at Nottingham and Cambridge.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I000240/1","grantId":"EP/I000240/1","fundValue":"122790","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Follow on research activity in understanding little studied complexities fo energy attribution in shared spaces - EPSRC funded CTech.\nThrough UKERC in policy advice around correct framing in communications around energy savings.\nOngoing activity wiring the Connected Digital Economy Catapult with energy sensors (within CTech).

Addressing three challenges:\n\n1. The provision of applications that are compelling to users, that provide comprehensible information that make the consumers aware of the implications of their behaviour, and which can be delivered onto the projected ecosystem of deployed handsets;\n\n2. Ensuring that privacy concerns are addressed: Mobile devices can be enabled to monitor and report a great deal of information about an individual's energy use, for example by interaction with smart meters or smart plugs in the home or office, or through location information supplied to inference engines. Some of this information is useful in the aggregate, e.g. for the optimisation of transport, but awareness of ones own behaviour necessarily involves processing, by some agent or application, information related to ones behaviour; and\n\n3. Ensuring that a viable business model exists for those providing the infrastructure behind the applications: There will be a large volume of very small event descriptions, which will be passed between service providers and third party application providers with consumer and provider specific privacy constraints. It is important to consider the underlying mechanisms of behavior chance at a psychological level - observed short changes in some contexts may not be sustainable or appropriate in others as shown by our work on counter intuitive results around shared commendation - this has lead the team to the follow on project C-Tech as the URL shown.
