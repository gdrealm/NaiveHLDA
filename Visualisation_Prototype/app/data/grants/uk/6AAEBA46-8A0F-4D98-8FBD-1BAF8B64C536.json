The intention of the project is to explore the range of ways single screen (produced for the cinema or TV) and multi screen works (produced for the gallery) respectively, can interrogate the illusionistic conventions of 'the interview' and thereby the production of biographic and political knowledge. It will deal with one specific biography, that of civil rights activist and former internee, PJ McClean.\\n\\nFifty years ago, PJ McClean, was arrested under the Special Powers Act and detained without trial for four years in Crumlin Road Prison, Belfast. During his incarceration he was 'interviewed' and cross-examined by representatives of the state regarding his involvement with a non-violent, socialist movement. Because he would not sign a document to say that he belonged to this 'banned' organization he served four years without ever going to trail. He was one of around 240 men interned at that time for many different reasons. Most of them are now very old or have passed away. This is the historical context for the series of filmed interviews I will undertake in Composing Histories.\\n\\nComposing Histories will use a practice based approach in order to explore visual, spatial and temporal techniques of 'the interview' both as research method and as thematic under-pinning of the film. It will employ traditional emperical interview research methods in combination with those used in oral history and art practice. Composing Histories will address the need for an analysis into the importance of 'the interview' as a means of making and constructing histories.\\n\\nThe film will document the filming of an interview between Fergal Keane, political journalist and PJ McClean from the view point of an onlooker, a daughter, an evesdropper. Does the formal interview recorded by the journalist and crew have more validity than the informal one recorded by the daughter?\\n\\nCan the use of conventions employed in experimental films produce an expanded study of a subjective portrayal of a political individual? Composing Histories proposes to present a significant contribution to knowledge in so far as it provides a record/account of a certain under-represented period of Northern Irish history while investigating where family history and media technologies collide and the private becomes public.\\n\\nThe first output will be a feature length documentary constructed using the interview footage recorded privately with the footage shot formally in the studio. It will inter-cut news footage from TV at that time to set the context. It is anticipated that the film will be screened at International Film Festivals in 2007-08.The second outcome from the research will be a multi-screened presentation made for a gallery, (to be premiered at The Void Gallery, Derry City, N. Ireland) and finally a co-written academic essay will use the gathered material to produce an academic essay for publication.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F00592X/1","grantId":"AH/F00592X/1","fundValue":"26044","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mairead  McClean","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Greenwich","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
