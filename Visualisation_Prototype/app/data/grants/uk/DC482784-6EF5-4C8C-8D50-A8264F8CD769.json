{"id":"DC482784-6EF5-4C8C-8D50-A8264F8CD769","title":"BB/N003861/1","abstractText":"The aim is to reduce the reliance on external inputs to the farm, by providing fertilizer for the grass on which the cows feed, to use the waste from the cows to grow duckweeds, a very fast growing floating aquatic plant with a high protein content. To use the duckweeds as a substitute supplementary feed source for the cows and to use any organic waste left over to produce biogas. \n\nThe project aim is to create a circular farm by using manure from cattle to create struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate is a mineral compound with the formula: NH4MgPO4.6H2O) and ammonium sulphate fertilizer; duckweed biomass to provide a substitute feed source for the cattle in place of imported Soya; and to use waste material from these processes in an anaerobic digester to create biogas that will provide both heat and power to the farm and the production process. \n\nThe manure is collected and digested in an anaerobic digester unit to produce biogas and a residue. The residue is speared into solid and liquid fractions. The solid fraction can be used a s a soil conditioner directly on the farm. The liquid fraction is used to make struvite by adding magnesium chloride, and also processed to remove nitrogen to form solid ammonium sulphate. The residue form this process, which is still rich in both phosphorous and nitrogen, is heated and passed into an indoor slow flowing lagoon system designed to optimize the growth of Lemna species, or duckweeds. The effluent is processed by the duckweed and leaves the lagoon within the limits for discharge to the environment or is recycled through the lagoon system until the discharge limits have been reached. The process is designed to be continuous, but this depends on a constant supply of cow manure and duckweed. Part of the research project is to determine what conditions favor the most rapid growth of duckweeds in this system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N003861/1","grantId":"BB/N003861/1","fundValue":"36511","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Ray Newman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
