{"id":"0A2D5EEA-0F96-4BD1-A8C8-DB307039E1F8","title":"'Rolands Barthes's notes for Seminars on 'Sarrasine''","abstractText":"The &quot;'Sarrasine&quot; notes' are Roland Barthes's seminar notes from 1968 and 1969, given at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, and which became his 1970 publication S/Z. They concern his radical reading of Balzac's short story 'Sarrasine'. These notes will be the final publication of all of Roland Barthes's lecture and seminar notes in the 'Traces Ecrites' series co-ordinated by Les Editions du Seuil in Paris, and directed by Professors Eric Marty (Paris VII) and Claude Coste (Grenoble). \nThe three publications so far in this Barthes series (2002, 2002 and 2003) have been prestigious and successful publications widely reviewed in France and across the world, the first of these being translated into English (2005); and the final three volumes (2005, 2006, 2007) will complete the series with regard to Barthes. It goes without saying that Roland Barthes is a world-renowned literary and intellectual figure; and the &quot;'Sarrasine&quot; notes' will be the only book in the series published by a scholar who is not French. Three articles on the subject by myself have appeared so far in France. The seminar notes on 'Sarrasine' run to about 260 pages of text, of varying length and some with numerous additions, crossings-out, words in ancient Greek and complex numbering systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E505783/1","grantId":"AH/E505783/1","fundValue":"28171","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Stafford","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
