{"id":"6E490BFA-C05A-4B30-983E-DC7B552BC73C","title":"CO2-EOR ranking and screening tool","abstractText":"Primary oil recovery factors typically range between 15 to 25% of the original oil in place (OOIP). An additional 20 to 40% OOIP is possible with water flooding. A further 10 to 20% OOIP is then possible by CO2 flooding, especially if CO2 is fully miscible with oil. The opportunity to add oil reserves to the UK inventory from CO2 EOR is substantial. Based upon a West Texas analogue indicated the additional reserves would lie in the range of 3 to 8 billion barrels. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that CO2 can be permanently stored when deployed in association with CO2-EOR.\n\nAs part of a CO2 EOR national scoping programme it is important to have an effective method of estimating potential incremental recovery of the hundreds of UK North Sea depleted oil reservoirs. This project proposes to develop a bespoke numerical simulator for this purpose. The main challenge lies in the development of robust algorithms of simulating the partially miscible displacement of oil by CO2 in the presence of a saline formation water. The project will benefit from innovative numerical techniques, previously developed from NERC science associated with nutrient migration in chalk aquifers. The project will also involve secondment of university staff with a leading industrial partner (RPS Energy) to ensure efficient and relevant knowledge exchange.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L008076/1","grantId":"NE/L008076/1","fundValue":"22206","fundStart":"2014-01-27","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Simon Alexander Mathias","coPersons":["Jon  Gluyas"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" We have discovered a new way of solving numerical problems associated with enhanced oil recovery simulation.
