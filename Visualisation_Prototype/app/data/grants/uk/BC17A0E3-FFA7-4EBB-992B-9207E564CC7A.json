However, findings have often been inconsistent, for two main reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>First, the majority of research has focused on individual-level variables (eg job demands, relationships at work, social support, coping resources) and has largely ignored the impact of higher-level organisational characteristics (eg policies and practices, leadership, organisational change). \n</li>\n <li>Second, although the study of work-related health is concerned with the individual within the wider organisation, research methodology has typically used single-level approaches. Inconsistent findings can have important implications for the management of work-related health.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The aim of this project is to understand which and in what way elements of the wider organisational context influence employee work-related health, using an appropriate methodology. </p>\n\n<p>It takes a multilevel approach by looking at the impact of both individual and organisational level characteristics simultaneously. In order to establish causal links, it also assesses relationships at multiple points in time. </p>\n\n<p>The findings of the project will help to extend current theory on the determinants of work-related health. They will also help to develop the necessary knowledge and skills for managing work-related health in a successful and sustainable way.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0344","grantId":"RES-061-25-0344","fundValue":"264778","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The findings have helped the participant organizations' to develop healthy workplaces, Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail Policy & public services","person":"Maria  Karanika-Murray","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Nottingham Trent University","findingsText":" This project aimed to understand the characteristics of the workplace context that are important for individual health and well-being. Following an integrative, conceptually and methodologically, approach, these characteristics were identified and grouped into the workplace characteristic model. A measure to assess these, workplace design questionnaire, was also developed and validated. Results indicated that the aspects of the workplace impact on a range of health and well-being outcomes, over and above the characteristics of the job, and are as important as leadership. This research has important theoretical implications as it provides an understanding of the aspects of the workplace that can support individual health and well-being. in addition, it has practical implications for developing healthy workplaces and interventions to promote health and well-being. This research has important practical implications for developing healthy workplaces and interventions to promote health and well-being. First, organisations can use the short and comprehensive measure to assess the healthiness of the workplace. Second, the results can be compared with an extensive set of benchmark data of UK private and public organisations. Third, principles of healthy workplaces have been developed that accompany the manual of the measure. Fourth, this research provides a missing understanding of the characteristics of healthy workplaces that can support individual well-being and productivity. Fifth, this theoretical development is the missing link between good job design and good workplace design and can as such lead to further research and conceptual developments. Sixth, the findings can be used to develop practical and actionable organisational interventions.
