{"id":"8C866A77-811A-469D-842E-EEA9E5A3FD96","title":"Particle Theory at the Higgs Centre","abstractText":"There are two types of fundamental forces in Nature: those responsible for particle \ninteractions at subatomic scales and those responsible for the large scale structure of \nthe universe. The former is described by Quantum Field Theories (QFT) such as the \nStandard Model(SM). Currently, our understanding of Nature at the most fundamental\nlevel is at the crossroads. Last year, the LHC at CERN collided protons at higher energies \nthan ever before, and observed sufficient collisions to find a significant excess at 125 GeV,\nconsistent with the Higgs boson of the SM. Over the coming years it should become\nclear whether this is indeed a SM Higgs, responsible for generating masses for vector \nbosons, leptons and quarks, or whether it is something different. It should also become \nclearer whether there is more physics at the TeV scale, or whether this is it. In either event, \nit is clear that this will be a transformative period in fundamental physics, making the next \nfew years the most exciting time for a generation or more. \n\nOur programme of research at the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics in Edinburgh is \ndesigned to be at the forefront of these new discoveries: indeed Peter Higgs himself is \nEmeritus Professor here. Specifically, we provide theoretical calculations, using pen \nand paper, and the most powerful supercomputers, of both the huge number of \nbackground processes to be seen at LHC due to known physics, and the tiny signals\nexpected in various models of new physics, in order to discriminate between signal and \nbackground, and thus maximise the discovery potential of the LHC. \n\nIn parallel, we will attempt to understand the more complete picture of all the forces of \nNature that may begin to emerge. The fundamental force responsible for large scale structure \nis described Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR). During the last three decades, \nstring theory has emerged as a conceptually rich theoretical framework reconciling both \nGR and QFT. The low-energy limit of String Theory is supergravity (SUGRA), a nontrivial \nextension of GR in which the universe is described by a spacetime with additional \ngeometric data. Members of the group have pioneered approaches to deriving observable\ncosmological consequences of String Theory, to studying how the geometrical notions on \nwhich GR is predicated change at very small (&quot;stringy&quot;) distance scales, \nand the systematic classification of SUGRA backgrounds. The group is also engaged in \nusing these theories to improve calculations in existing field theories. \n\nIn summary, our research will impinge on both theoretical and computational aspects \nrelevant to probing the phenomenology of incoming LHC data, and will also encompass \na wide range of topics in QFT and gravitational aspects of String Theory, impinging on \ncosmology, particle physics and on the very nature of String Theory itself.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L000458/1","grantId":"ST/L000458/1","fundValue":"1914950","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Richard David Ball","coPersons":["James  Lucietti","Joan  Simon","Anthony David Kennedy","Luigi  Del Debbio","Jos√© Miguel  Figueroa-O'Farrill","Einan  Gardi","Roger  Horsley","Arjun  Berera","Roman  Zwicky","Peter  Boyle","Donal  O'Connell"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
