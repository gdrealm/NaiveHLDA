First, it will consider whether the doctrine of parlimentary sovereignty has always contained within it the possiblity of Parliment binding itself by means of clear legislation. If this is the case, it would allow the United Kingdom to develop a unique and valuable model for constitutional development: uncodified, gradual and variable entrenchment.\\n\\nSecondly, it will consider the extent to which the Empire/Commonwealth insights regarding sovereignty and legal system are relevant to contemporary European constitutional development. In particular, it will explore the paradox of new and distinct legal systems emerging by means of constitutional continuity.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112880/1","grantId":"112880/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter C Oliver","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
