This 2-volume work stretches to almost 800 pages. It is one of the earliest texts to be produced in the French Caribbean, and offers fascinating insights into contemporary racial anxieties surrounding the hybrid figure of the mulatto, as well as reflecting at length on contemporary political events and historical figures. Maynard is writing at a particularly turbulent time with regard to debates around slavery and human rights, and the issues dealt with in the text are of continuing contemporary interest, given the urgent debates around the memory of slavery in both France and the UK. The edition is under contract with L'Harmattan (Paris) to appear by end-2008, in the series 'Autrement m&ecirc;mes', edited by Prof. Roger Little.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F003587/1","grantId":"AH/F003587/1","fundValue":"26474","fundStart":"2008-01-28","fundEnd":"2008-05-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used by other scholars interested in issues of race and gender in the longer history of the French Antilles.
