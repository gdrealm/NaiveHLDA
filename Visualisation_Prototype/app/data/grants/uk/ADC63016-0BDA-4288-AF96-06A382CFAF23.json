{"id":"ADC63016-0BDA-4288-AF96-06A382CFAF23","title":"Holistic Evidence and Design: Sensory Impacts, Practical Outcomes (HEAD)","abstractText":"People spend around an average of 90% of their time in buildings and the built environment sector (at least until recently) makes up 20% of GDP. The built environment is evidently a significant part of society that impacts on individuals through their direct experience, but also forms a massive element of the economy and of society's investment in its infrastructure. This research offers the potential for clients and their advisors to be able to use the engineering knowledge of a calibrated Environment-Human Performance Model to predict the impacts of various options and so to create optimal designs with greater confidence. \n\nThis is a two year project to contribute to the longstanding research question: can evidence be found for a link between a building's overall design and the performance of the occupants of that building? To explore this complex issue it makes sense to focus on building uses for which clear and objective user performance measures are available and it has been decided to take primary schools as the special case to address the above general challenge. Hence the specific proposition that this study seeks to explore is that: Demonstrable evidence can be found for the holistic impact of school building design on the learning rates of children in primary schools.\n\nDespite a lot of design knowledge about schools, there is nothing that links the integrated features of school design directly with the impact on pupils' performance. Filling this gap should have a transformative impact as it will enable researchers and designers to contextualise and calibrate the specific elements being considered within an holistic impacts model. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study will be carried out shaped by the notion that the characteristics of the brain's functioning in synthesising sensory inputs shows the importance of three aspects of our environment, namely: naturalness, individualisation and the appropriate level of stimulation. This broad framework will be used to guide the selection of physical dimensions to measured, working within the rich context provided by the multitudinous focused studies already in existence.\n\nThe core element of this study will be an expert assessment of 150 diverse classrooms (c4500 pupils) to test, improve and validate an Environment-Human-Performance (E-H-P) model that allows the measurement, and so assessment, of built spaces and their human impacts. In this case the impacts will be measured improvements in the pupils' performance in mathematics, English and science. A sample of ten schools for a six month pilot phase has been identified to provide a diverse sample of school types and sizes. Once started the project will further identify five diverse classrooms within each school, in terms of their physical characteristics (orientation, level, size, etc). Building from the pilot study over the following nine months, the assessment of spaces will then extend to twenty more schools (100 classrooms) of diverse types and locations across UK. The data collected will support further analysis to refine and robustly evidence the E-H-P model. The theme of diversity in the spaces sampled is important to provide maximum opportunity for the impact of the physical factors to become evident. \n\nAfter this main phase of measuring spaces and developing the E-H-P Model, a second six month phase of validation and refinement will be carried out through targeted, follow-up researcher observation of 50 classrooms, c1500 pupils. This phase is essential to calibrate the range of major factors identified with rich descriptions. In addition, observation of dynamic user influences, especially in relation to outliers, will strengthen the evidence base for the E-H-P model. The final phase of three months will focus on finalising the analysis and writing up the results and their initial promotion to the sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J015709/1","grantId":"EP/J015709/1","fundValue":"453011","fundStart":"2012-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project is not finished yet, however, the publication of the Phase 1 results of the HEAD project (in an academic journal) has already led to a number of radio interviews, an extensive Guardian webpage discussion and a section in the Guardian Schools' supplement on 4 April 2013. Since then there has been on-going press coverage and the study has been quoted in over a hundred articles around the world. The study has been quoted by the Education Funding Agency (following a meeting with them) and invited presentations have been made to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Education (11/02/13), at the Norwegian Schools' conference, to the CSO in Australia and to the OECD. As a practical example, feedback has been given to Ealing Council and they are planning a targeted program classroom improvement once the final results are available.

In Phase 1 these hypotheses were tested using multi-level modelling of data collected on 751 pupils from 34 varied classrooms in seven Blackpool primary schools. Controlling all other factors, the built environment factors alone were found to have an estimated impact on variations in learning that scaled to around 25% of all influences taken together. \n\nThis is the first time this type of impact has been successfully isolated. The published results (&quot;An holistic, multi-level analysis identifying the impact of classroom design on pupils' learning&quot;) was the Building and Environment Journal's most downloaded paper in 2013, was selected as its &quot;best paper&quot; for the year (with two others) from amongst 1300 submitted and has been cited in books and journal papers 23 times already.\n\nIn Phase 2 of the project the volume of data was increased fivefold, extending to Hampshire and Ealing. We now have data for 3766 pupils in 153 classrooms, from 27 primary schools. The analysis, confirms the importance of broadly similar factors to Phase 1. Owing to the much greater sample size, the overall influence on variations in learning rates has levelled out at 16%, but with much greater certainty. \n\nWhat the HEAD project has achieved so far is:\n\n(a) To provide significant traction on the stubborn problem of providing evidence of the holistic impact of the built environment on human well-being and performance - involving the use of a robust model (covering naturalness, individualisation and level of stimulation), twinned with a multi-level modelling approach to the analysis;\n\n(b) To provide clear indications of practical design choices that appear to support the learning process in primary schools;\n\n(c) To suggest the importance of an inside-out design approach in which individual classrooms are each carefully considered;\n\n(d) To highlight that many of the factors are to do with the users' choices and can be addressed in existing buildings, once they have been revealed. This research has implications for policy makers responsible for school design at an international, national and local level. It will also inform designers in their choices when developing schemes for new or altered schools. Users (teachers) can act immediately in how they choose to configure their classrooms.
