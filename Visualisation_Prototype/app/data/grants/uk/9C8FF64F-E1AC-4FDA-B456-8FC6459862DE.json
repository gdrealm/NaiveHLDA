{"id":"9C8FF64F-E1AC-4FDA-B456-8FC6459862DE","title":"DEVELOPING MEDIA LITERACY: TOWARDS A MODEL OF LEARNING PROGRESSION","abstractText":"<p>Media literacy has recently become a prominent theme in UK cultural policy. However, teachers have been seeking to develop media literacy in schools for many years, both by means of specialised Media Studies courses with older students, and through incorporating elements of media education in a range of other curriculum areas. </p>\n\n<p>This is the first large-scale systematic research project to explore the practice of media education in schools. The researchers will work with teachers to develop teaching strategies and materials, to implement these and to study the outcomes. The specific aim here is to develop a model of learning progression in media education, which will seek to specify what children of different ages might be expected to understand about media; and how their learning could develop over time, and in the course of a sequence of learning activities. </p>\n\n<p>The research team will work with teachers of children aged from six to sixteen from contrasting social-economic backgrounds, following parallel groups of students over a three-year period. The research will involve detailed classroom observations, interviews with teachers and students, and the evaluation of students' work. The findings will be disseminated nationally and internationally through academic publications, professional development and teaching materials.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F041616/1","grantId":"ES/F041616/1","fundValue":"645013","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impact report with key findings was submitted in February 2013  ","person":"David  Buckingham","coPersons":["Andrew Nicholas Burn"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
