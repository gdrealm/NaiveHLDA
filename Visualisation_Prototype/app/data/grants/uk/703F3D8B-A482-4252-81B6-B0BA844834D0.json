However, up to one-third of\npatients implanted with a CRT device show no improvement in symptoms and up to half of patients show no improvement\nin cardiac function. These non-responders are a strong burden to healthcare systems by causing considerable\nunnecessary costs, e.g. for devices, implantations, recurring follow-up visits as well as hospitalisations for acute HF\ndecompensation The aim of this project is to develop a single platform which integrates all stages of the CRT pipeline,\nreferred to as the &quot;Guide CRT&quot;, to improve response rate. The main components of this include MR clinical imaging\nprotocols dedicated to HF patients, tailored image processing tools (segmentation of the heart morphology, myocardial scar\nand coronary sinus, as well as analysis of left ventricle (LV) wall motion), fused visualisation for improved patient selection\nand planning of LV lead placement, and the image-based guidance technologies to support CRT device implantation.\nGuide CRT will be evaluated on a cohort of 50 patients. Through the proposed joint efforts between leaders in their\nrespective industrial, academic and clinical fields, we aim to demonstrate that integrating comprehensive multimodal\nimaging data and tools can help to provide answers to the great challenges of CRT, namely identification of patients who\nare likely to respond and guiding LV lead placement to maximise this reponse.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505328/1","grantId":"EP/L505328/1","fundValue":"454212","fundStart":"2014-03-17","fundEnd":"2017-03-16","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kawaldeep Singh Rhode","coPersons":["Reza Sarvghad  Razavi"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
