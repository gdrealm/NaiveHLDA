We aim to further our understanding of SGV and assess how it can be used to promote behaviour change.&nbsp; We will explore the generality of SGV (across approach and avoidance behaviours; and across different cognition measures), the mechanisms of effect (role of degree of deliberation about the behaviour and public commitment to the behaviour), and the moderators of the effect (impact of measuring different cognitions, impact of different levels of past experience with the behaviour).&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>Real world Randomised Controlled Trials on two behaviours (cervical screening, child immunisation) will examine what factors influence SGV.&nbsp; In addition, Laboratory Experiments will further elucidate the generality, mechanisms and moderators of SGV.&nbsp; Better understanding of SGV would inform its use as a simple but effective way to change behaviour and inform our understanding of how merely measuring cognitions may change behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-2220","grantId":"RES-062-23-2220","fundValue":"292918","fundStart":"2010-06-28","fundEnd":"2013-03-27","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Conner","coPersons":["Cath  Jackson","Gaston  Godin","Paschal  Sheeran"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
