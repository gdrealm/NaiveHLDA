As predicted by Moore, silicon integration capability has been doubling every 18 months over the past four decades, providing the foundation for low-cost computing and memory technology.\n\nThe digitisation of information and communication technologies sparked a number of innovations revolutionising the way we compute and communicate. Ubiquitous high-bandwidth communication, enabled by WiFi and 3G/4G technologies, facilitates on-demand access to a vast amount of application and location specific information including multimedia and broadcast content, video and voice communications, email and SMS/MMS. Furthermore, it has enabled on-demand access to personalised storage and computing resources, providing the foundation for the development of cloud computing infrastructures and a wide range of online web-based services and applications. With the decreasing cost of communication and storage the Internet has also become the global communication infrastructure for a wide range of autonomous sensor technologies, referred to as the &quot;Internet of things&quot;. Key application areas include monitoring/surveillance, smart grid, smart homes and smart cities. \n\nMonitoring internet traffic and mining meaningful information from both the online traffic and the stored information has emerged as essential for many critical applications and services. For example resource management, market intelligence, physical and cybercrime investigations and forensics, cyber space policing, situation awareness and the monitoring of malicious behaviour for criminal and terrorist intent. As the scale, diversity and distributed nature of current and emerging data assets increases and as data becomes ever more ubiquitous and critical to decision making, effective real-time mining of useful information becomes essential. \n\nConsidering the exponential increase of internet traffic and stored data, traditional software based approaches have become inadequate and unsustainable. Performance gain achieved due to Moore's law does not keep up with the required computing bandwidth of current and near future generated data assets. Internet traffic bandwidth is doubling every 12 months while the emerging content diversity is significantly increasing mining complexity. As the enterprise becomes more data centric, with a significant increase in data assets within the public and private cloud, traditional scaling by increasing the number of computing resources can no longer be sustained due to cost and power dissipation.\n\nMost data mining algorithms are derived by the software community and are optimised for data structures for platforms based upon the Von-Neumann architecture. An effective solution now requires a paradigm shift in the way we process data and also how we extract meaningful information from a large amount of distributed, constantly changing data that is partially stored or in-transit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J020540/1","grantId":"EP/J020540/1","fundValue":"252523","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sakir  Sezer","coPersons":["Paul  Miller","Michael John Loughlin","Shane  O'Neill","Fatih  Kurugollu","Weiru  Liu","Kieran  McLaughlin","Dwayne Charles Burns"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
