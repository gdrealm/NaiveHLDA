A central, but as yet poorly understood element of this millennial-scale climate change behavior is an asynchronous phasing of climate between the poles [Blunier et al., 1998], known as the 'bi-polar seesaw'. It is likely that the variability in intensity of intermediate flow from high to low latitudes is closely linked to these climate changes in the polar regions (sensu [Stott et al., 2007]). Computer simulations also suggest that variations in intermediate water circulation are intricately coupled to climate change in the polar regions' [Broecker, 1998; Stocker and Johnsen, 2003; Sijp and England, 2006]. Whilst there is growing recognition of the importance of intermediate water circulation for the bi-polar seesaw, millennial-scale variations in intermediate water circulation in crucial parts of the world ocean are not known. We are interested in the history of southern sourced intermediate waters (Antarctic Intermediate Water - AAIW) in the Indian Ocean. The role of GAAIW in the bi-polar seesaw is of global relevance due to its large volume and associated energy storage capacity. In the Indian Ocean, results of a New Investigators project (by the PI) provided insights into the short-term surface- and intermediate water variability recorded in the Arabian Sea. Surface ocean records from core NIOP 905 from the Arabian Sea imply a direct in-phase relation of monsoonal change with the well-known Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the N-Atlantic [Ivanochko et al., 2005] in line with previous results [Altabet et al., 2002; Schulz et al., 1998]. Striking new results are that 1) surface ocean and intermediate depth changes occur out-of-phase and 2) the intermediate water variability shows a close relation with Antarctic climate history, hence hosting evidence for a bi-polar seesaw pattern. Whilst the surface ocean change reflects Northern Hemisphere climate change, the intermediate water record seems to be tied to that in the south. This implies a climate connection between the high and low latitudes most likely mediated by variations in glacial AAIW (GAAIW) strength, with GAAIW enhancements occurring during the HE's, opposite to the N-Atlantic record of overturning circulation (figure 1). A locally derived signal for core NIOP 905, however, cannot be ruled out at this stage and additional research in a more southern position is required. Here we propose to utilize high-quality sediment core 64PE304-80 from the Mozambique Channel. This core is particularly suited for paleoceanographic work because it combines a very high sedimentation rate (~25 cm/ka), excellent carbonate preservation and a crucial location, allowing to trace surface and intermediate water changes at the millennial-scale. We aim to find evidence of increased GAAIW in the Channel to verify the wider significance of the Arabian Sea results, and the surface ocean data will help unravel the Indo-Atlantic surface water exchange (passing through the Channel) via the Agulhas system, which is a crucial component of Earth's climate [Peeters et al., 2004].","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I01599X/1","grantId":"NE/I01599X/1","fundValue":"53297","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-20","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The impact of this project beyond academia is currently limited.

A few years back the so-called bi-polar seesaw was discovered in ice cores. This climate change behavior is an out of phase climate oscillation between the poles, with glacial millennial-scale climate change over Antarctica leading the change in Greenland by 1-1.5 thousand years. Progress has been made in describing the phenomenon in various key locations around the globe. Little progress has been made though, regarding the underlying causes. This project is based on marine sediment sections from the western Indian Ocean and aims to a) document changes in the water column structure for this region and b) place them in a larger context. The results show that the monsoon driven surface ocean circulation in the area varies in tune with the well-known millennial-scale variability found in Greenland ice cores. Surprisingly, our data also reveal that the change at intermediate water depth predates surface ocean change and shows a strong relation with Antarctic climate change. This finding suggests that intermediate water circulation may be instrumental for the bipolar seesaw, by temporarily storing energy in the intermediate depth ocean helping to maintain the energy imbalance between the poles. An ongoing PhD-study targets the deeper parts of the water column in the western Indian Ocean to better understand if this behavior was restricted to intermediate water masses or reached deeper in the water column. Our findings will stimulate new research aimed at a better documentation of the changes in subsurface circulation around the globe, both from a sedimentary paleoceanographic as well as from a climate modeling perspective. In particular the role of subsurface water masses, possibly temporarily storing energy, may be important for predictions of future climate change. We will also apply for new funding.
