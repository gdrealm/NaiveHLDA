{"id":"B7C9F7E4-8420-4538-BFC2-8050224ECD99","title":"Chromosomal Instability in Cancer Pathogenesis and Treatment (MRC Programme 1)","abstractText":"Normal cells tightly control the duplication and integrity of their genetic information encoded in chromosomes, and its segregation into daughter cells during cell division (mitosis). They use complex pathways for DNA repair and mitosis to achieve this. There is mounting evidence that these pathways are disrupted early in the evolution of cancer, leading to instability of chromosome structure and number that promotes the progression of the disease. We are studying human genetic diseases where chromosome instability is associated with cancer to understand the pathways that control DNA repair and mitosis, and how they are altered in cancer cells. Because the majority of drugs currently used to treat cancer affect these pathways, we are studying how alterations in them can affect the response of cancer cells to treatment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001521","grantId":"G1001521","fundValue":"1964410","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ashok R Ventikaraman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
