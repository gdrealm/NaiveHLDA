Her distinctive artistic identity displays a tension between modernist and anti-modernist tendencies. By examining the social and cultural implications of this conflict within her painting, my research aims to both highlight the gendered component of her ambivalent response to modernity and to reassess her work, which has been constantly downplayed in art historical and biographical accounts, both with the stylistic context of primitivism and the broader cultural history of Modernism.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112611/1","grantId":"112611/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"M.Xon  De Ros","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
