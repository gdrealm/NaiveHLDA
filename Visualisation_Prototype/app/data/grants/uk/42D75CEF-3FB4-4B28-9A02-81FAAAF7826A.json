{"id":"42D75CEF-3FB4-4B28-9A02-81FAAAF7826A","title":"Novel in-soil nutrient sensors","abstractText":"Efficient agriculture requires the targeting of fertilizer applications throughout the year when it is needed by the crop to achieve maximum yields. For nitrogen, if too much is applied at the wrong time then it can be lost to the atmosphere or leached in drainage water before it can be accessed by roots. Crop measurements can be useful indicators of the plant's nutritional status, but when a deficiency is detected by these methods it is already too late to adjust inputs and a sub-maximal yield will result. Earlier and more accurate methods of measuring soil nutrient availability are needed to maintain an optimal supply to crops and minimise the amount lost to the environment. A new type of soil nutrient sensor has been developed and this funding is requested to rigorously field test the system and compare it with current methods. Other uses of the technology will also be tested, including the feasibility of using it to measure other important crop nutrients in the soil.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L004305/1","grantId":"BB/L004305/1","fundValue":"124939","fundStart":"2013-11-04","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research results are being reported to farmers and fertiliser companies.

These sensors have been produced using a manufacturing process that has greatly decreased the cost of their production. The decrease in production cost has enabled the field testing of the sensors in a range of different soil and crop types. The sensors can provide a measure of the soil available plant nitrogen so that farmers can better target the application of fertiliser and avoid applying excess to their crops. The field testing of the sensors is enabling the comparison with the current methods for assessing soil nitrogen availability. This data is being reported to farmers and will be published to enable improved nitrogen fertiliser use efficiency. A key aspect of the production and use of these sensors is balancing a low manufacture cost with useful lifetime for use in the field. Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
