The classic pattern matching problem consists in recognizing a pattern P as &quot;matching&quot; or &quot;not matching&quot; within a given text T and of listing all the occurrence positions, if any. It is\nstraightforward that the text may be whatever kind of input data and the pattern is usually a smaller piece of the same kind of data. One instance of the problem is to suppose that the text is provided before the pattern.\nThen the text can be preprocessed to build an index data structure that accelerates dramatically further searches.\nThere exist several such data structures. This branch of pattern matching is usually called Text Indexing.\nIts natural application scenario is when the text does not change or changes slowly with respect to the great amount of pattern search queries, e.g. a sequenced genome, a digital library or a biometric database.\nThe most important variant of Text Indexing concerns &quot;approximate matching&quot; of the pattern with text segments.\nIt is called Approximate Pattern Matching. Approximate means that an occurrence of the pattern within the text is considered a match even if it presents some errors, but if the distance (resp. similarity) between the pattern and the text segment is under (resp. over) a certain threshold.\n\nApproximate variants of text indexing fit well with scenarios where a mistyping errors may occurs, the data sampling process is prone to introduce errors, the data source is not constant over the time as for biometric data, or when we are just looking for data similarity, e.g. for genes mutations in DNA sequences.\n\nPattern matching plays a fundamental role in many research and application fields, like information retrieval, data mining, bioinformatics, molecular biology functional and structural analysis, molecular pharmacology, computational musicology, network security, biometric identification, and many others. Among these, bioinformatics and computational molecular biology are the domains that mostly and directly benefit from any enhancement of pattern matching theoretical knowledge and solutions.\n\nWhile straight text indexing counts many efficient solutions, its approximate versions have not found optimal solutions yet. Several solutions exploit the property that an approximate match is usually composed of some shorter and closer\nmatches, i.e. exact matches or approximate matches with a smaller number of errors. This approach does not provide any breakthrough towards an optimal solution.\n\nOur approach is to design data structures and their related algorithms to get an efficient solution to the problem. We have explored and experimented several solutions that provided remarkable potentialities. They need to be developed further and tailored to some applications. Implementation for external memory and for distributed calculus shall be\ninvestigated. As a by-product some theoretical results related to the distance between sequences should be achieved. The complexity of many classical result will be reviewed to highlight their dependence from the maximal-repetition-with-error parameter. All this is expected to provide a substantial step forward in the pattern matching research field.\n\nThe technological breakthrough proposed in this research allows to dramatically decrease the computational cost of detecting local similarities within a large family of biological sequences and of performing some approximate pattern matching related tasks. Furthermore, our designed algorithms will extend the range of applications of approximate pattern matching based solutions as they will allow to accomplish more complex investigations on sequences with the same computational resource either at the level of personal computer scale solutions, and of big research centres.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017108/1","grantId":"EP/J017108/1","fundValue":"156691","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Mapping reads (short strings) against a reference genome sequence is\nan essential problem in Computational Molecular Biology for locating patterns in genomes. Such a problem has to take into account the errors that may arise due to the inherent limitations of the experimental equipment (for example, sequencers that produce reads from genome sequences). However, with the recent advancement of the state of the art, the number of errors in short reads has become quite small. The so-called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, generate millions of almost error-free short reads. Hence from the mapping point of view, only one mismatch may be expected.\n\nMotivated by such real-life applications, the paper focuses on full-sequence indexing for mapping reads with at most a single mismatch. Pattern matching and exact indexing have received a lot of attention and found efficient solutions so far. But their utilisation for approximate matching is far less efficient. This is why it became necessary to provide solutions for approximate indexing whose goal is to pre-compute full-text indexes accepting efficient approximate queries.
