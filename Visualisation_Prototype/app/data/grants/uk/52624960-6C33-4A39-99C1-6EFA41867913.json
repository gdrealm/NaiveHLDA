For example: Why is the Sun's outer atmosphere (the corona) over 100 times hotter than the visible surface of the Sun so that the gas is ionized and forms a plasma?\nThe answer to such a key question depends upon a range of expertise and the SMTG is in an excellent position to answer these questions.\nWe study a wide variety of physical phenomena using mathematical modelling (a combination of fundamental theory, analytical models, computer simulations, forward modelling and observations). It is an integrated approach that is needed, i.e. a mixture of modelling methods and a comparison between observations from several satellite missions and the theoretical models. The topics we will investigate, using plasma theory, are: the physical mechanisms responsible for keeping the corona much hotter than the lower parts of the solar atmosphere (coronal heating). These mechanisms obey physical laws that can be expressed as nonlinear partial differential equations. However, what makes them distinct is that different phenomena require different dominant terms. Hence, the physical processes and the plasma response will be different in each case. It is the rich complexity of the non-linear equations that makes them hard to solve and to determine what the key physical processes are responsible for each heating event. A most important research tool is the parallel computer formed by linking many commodity processors together. Then the simulation involves splitting the problem up into smaller parts that run on different processors at the same time (in parallel). Thus, our simulations are completed quicker. Hence, with a job that would require 10 years on single machine, will be completed in a couple of weeks on 512 processors. We address key issues in the STFC Science Roadmap, especially, how does the Sun affect the Earth? However, a detailed understanding of the physics of our research topics are important not only for the Sun, solar-like stars and space weather, but also for understanding such diverse astrophysical processes such as star formation in giant molecular clouds, the evolution of astrophysical discs around stars, black holes and in Active Galactic Nuclei, and the physics of winds and outflows from stellar to extragalactic scales.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L005522/1","grantId":"ST/L005522/1","fundValue":"196988","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  This award is for research on the local dynamics of magnetic fields in the solar corona.
