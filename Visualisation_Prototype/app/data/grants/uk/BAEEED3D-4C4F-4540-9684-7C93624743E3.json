{"id":"BAEEED3D-4C4F-4540-9684-7C93624743E3","title":"Finite and Algorithmic Model Theory","abstractText":"Mathematics plays an important role in computer science, especially logic. The study of the logical aspects of computer science enables us to prove things about computers and computer programs. The study of logic in computer science has enabled us to develop new programming languages, new techniques to solve problems and new ways of solving problems. This workshop is an opportunity for mathematicians, who sometimes dont concern themselves with computer science, and computer scientists to get together and see how they can further develop the role of mathematics within computer science.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D056853/1","grantId":"EP/D056853/1","fundValue":"19000","fundStart":"2006-01-08","fundEnd":"2006-04-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was a grant to organise a mathematics workshop.
