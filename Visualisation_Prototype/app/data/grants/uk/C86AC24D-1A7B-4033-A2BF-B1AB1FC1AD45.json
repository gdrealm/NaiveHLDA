{"id":"C86AC24D-1A7B-4033-A2BF-B1AB1FC1AD45","title":"High Efficiency Betavoltaic Cells","abstractText":"Market demand for low-power miniature electronics is increasing rapidly with long-lasting (&gt;10 years) power sources required for implantable electronic medical devices (such as neurostimulators to alleviate the effects of Parkinson's disease) and miniaturised sensors e.g. for structural health monitoring in inaccessible and extreme environments. Li-ion batteries have revolutionised portable electronics, but they cannot always meet the environmental, energy density or battery life requirements for some of the most demanding applications. Semiconductor devices for betavoltaic energy generation (the direct conversion of energy from beta particles emitted from radioisotope sources to electricity) can overcome these problems, but existing betavoltaic technology suffers limitations; the devices either suffer from poor efficiency when used with desirable and safe low energy beta emitters such as Tritium, or employ complex designs and structures which are difficult to mass produce commercially. \n\nThis project will capitalise on previous STFC funded radiation detector research to develop new betavoltaic batteries which overcome the limitations associated with existing betavoltaics and are suitable for a wide range of commercial and scientific applications. Alongside the scientific development, a major component of this project is the development of a commercialisation plan for the technology in order to fully realise the benefits of the work and enable the rapid commercial and scientific exploitation of the technology.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002772/1","grantId":"ST/M002772/1","fundValue":"87086","fundStart":"2015-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Anna Megan Barnett","coPersons":["Robert  Prance"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
