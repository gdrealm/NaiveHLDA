Rather than focusing on same-sex eros as a coded discourse about private sexual acts, it concentrates on the phenomenon as it visibly manifest itself in images and text. By putting the phenomenon back into its proper context (social, political, cultural and religious), it aims to provide a better understanding of how the phenomenon actually operates, and in turn a better understanding of a wide range of topics in Hellenic studies in which the phenomenon plays a role.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112897/1","grantId":"112897/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Davidson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
