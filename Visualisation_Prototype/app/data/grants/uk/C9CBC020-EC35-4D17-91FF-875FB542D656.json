During the course of forum activities, we presented findings from our work and attendees were asked to consider the role of social networks in their life, different ways in which they could develop and maintain social relationships and the challenges they faced in doing the same. Attendees were involved in extension discussion around the topic and were keen on obtaining further information regarding our research findings. \no We will shortly be releasing a series of policy reports and having a launch event of our findings aimed at policy makers.

Below we summarise findings with respect to our main research questions: \n\nDimensions of social relationships and wellbeing \no Our research shows that different social networks dimensions may have varying effects on measures of wellbeing. In analysis of data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we found that having a number of close ties and frequent contact with family and friends was associated with greater life satisfaction and a better quality of life over a 6-year period. Merely having a large number of contacts was, however, not associated with improved wellbeing. \no In an analysis using data from ELSA, we examined the role of social isolation and loneliness memory and recall. Our analysis showed that both isolation and loneliness were associated with poorer memory and recall over a 4 year period. \no In an analysis using data from ELSA, we examined the role of social isolation and loneliness on objective physical function (walking speed) and self-reported disability. Our analysis showed that while social isolation was associated with poorer objective physical functioning, loneliness was associated with higher levels of disability.\no In analysis examining social isolation and loneliness from wave 2 of ELSA to predict survival (mean follow-up = 7.25 years), we found that following adjustment for a range of covariates including demographic variables and health status, being highly isolated was associated with a 26% increase in the hazard of death but being lonely did not independently lead to higher mortality.\no In cross-sectional analyses comparing data from England and India (2010/11), we found that loneliness was associated with lower life satisfaction in both countries but the association as more marked in the case of England suggesting differences in cultural meanings attached to loneliness. \n\nAt-risk groups\no We examined transitions in caregiving status over a 2 year period using ELSA. We found that women who continued to be caregivers over this period reported a decline in quality of life. Women who stopped being caregivers over this time reported higher levels of depression. Neither effect was seen among men. \no Among individuals who were highly isolated (those who report none or only 1 social connection) a fairly high proportion (46%) report never being lonely. Women, those of a lower socioeconomic status, individuals who scored higher on neuroticism and those who believed they had less control over situations at home were more likely to report being lonely some or all of the time. This indicates the role of stable personality characteristics on persistent loneliness in the isolated. \n\nChanges in wellbeing and social connections\no Using data from ELSA, we analysed the associations between social isolation and loneliness at baseline (wave 2) and enjoyment of life and life satisfaction over a 6-year period. Wellbeing showed a U-shaped relationship with time. Both isolation and loneliness were associated with smaller increases in life satisfaction over time. Social isolation was also associated with sustained decreases in enjoyment of life over time. In line with our Pathways to Impact statement, we believe that our findings:\no Offer useful distinctions between different conceptualisations of social relationship and help identify which may be most important to different dimensions of wellbeing. We believe this is of use to various national and international level organisations involved in the measurement of wellbeing. \no Suggest important cultural differences in ways in which some dimensions of social relationships may be perceived and could hence guide future cross-national comparisons. \no Provide a valuable evidence base indicating the need for a more nuanced approach towards understanding social relationships and wellbeing in older age. Our project partner, the International Longevity Centre-UK, has ensured that the work remains policy relevant. We will be releasing a series of reports based on our work and launching these at a formal event aimed at policy makers. \no Help practitioners such as doctors, nurses and care-workers who need to identify individuals at greatest risk of poor outcomes. \no Help older adults consider the importance of social connections in their lives, and consider ways in which they could develop and maintain better social relationships so as to ensure greater wellbeing. \no Academic beneficiaries include social science researchers interested in the role of social networks and wellbeing, health researchers, economists who work on measurement and determinants of wellbeing and social policy researchers who are interested in policy changes to improve wellbeing.
