In March 2013 Strand One placed several substantial datasets in the public domain which will enhance the visibility of LLAKES and confirm its reputation as a centre engaging in data-driven cutting-edge research. One of these is a time series dataset containing national statistics on lifelong learning systems and their outcomes in OECD countries. This covers the period from 1960 up to the present and includes: 1) administrative data on key socio-economic indicators and on inputs and properties of LLL systems and 2) aggregate survey data representing mean levels and distributions of skills, competences, attitudes and identities. We believe that the longitudinal and comprehensive character of the dataset will be very attractive for researchers interested in investigating relations between macro-level institutional characteristics and socio-economic outcomes both diachronically and synchronically. In May 2012 Janmaat was awarded a one year British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship (?50,690) allowing him to explore the effects of tracking and school ethnic and social composition on civic engagement using British longitudinal datasets. This research represents a follow-up and deepening of the Strand One projects on perceptions of inequality (Project 1.3) and school ethnic mix and social attitudes (Project 1.4). The planned output of the Fellowship is four articles in high impact factor journals. The BA-MCF and the Projects 1.3 and 1.4 feed into the Crisis for Contemporary Youth project of Theme One of LLAKES Phase Two. \n\nStrand Two Research on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Innovation and Learning. The work undertaken in Project 2.1 by Guile and James on the effects of the transition from Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) on SMEs in the Creative sector in Birmingham and by Unwin and James on regeneration and skills in Manchester provided the intellectual case to secure funding from the ESRC for an interdisciplinary research network (with Guile as the Principal Investigator) - the Knowledge-Dynamics, Innovation and Learning Network (KILN). The researchers, from seven countries (UK, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden) cover the fields of economic geography, organisational studies and workplace learning. The network will explore two related issues: i) how the learning and skills of individuals are linked to collective learning by firms in different kinds of production-consumption networks; and ii) how learning and innovation takes place across geographical, organisational and professional boundaries. Guile and Unwin's work on workplace learning, skills and innovation was also featured in the ESRC's report, Re-igniting Growth. \n\nScientific Impact \n\nStrand One research on education, citizenship and social cohesion continues to make a significant impact on the wider academic community. Green and Janmaat's book, Regimes of Social Cohesion: Societies and the Crisis of Globalization, inspired a report on social cohesion authored by the Framtidskommissionen (Commission on the Future) of the Swedish Government. It has further informed the work on social cohesion at the CEPS/Instead Research Centre in Luxembourg conducted by Paul Dickes and Monique Borsenberger. Andy Green gave invited lectures based on the book at Hong Kong University; National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan; Zhejiang University, China; Bergische Universit?t, Germany; the University of Latvia; the LLAKES Second International Conference at the Institute of Education and the ASEM Forum on Lifelong Learning, Copenhagen. Janmaat's research on classroom diversity and ethnic tolerance, as published in LLAKES Research Paper 4 and in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies (2012, January issue), has also been taken up by oversees scholars. Janmaat was invited: to contribute a paper on this topic to a volume edited by Jaap Dronkers, a well-known Dutch educationalist and to present at the ESA mid-term sociology of education conference in Ghent in September 2012 and at a one-day conference on citizenship education in February 2013 at the University of Amsterdam. In May 2012 Hoskins completed her European Commission project on Participatory Citizenship in the European Union. Three separate reports (the Contextual, the Analytic and the Good Practice Report) mapped the theory, policy, practices and levels of civic and political engagement across Europe. A special event, organised by the University of Southampton, was held at the Houses of Parliament in December last year to present the project and disseminate its findings. Several members of parliament participated in this event. \n \nStrand Three research on young people's transitions continues to have significant scientific impact. Evans and Field were commissioned to edit a Special Issue of the British Journal of Educational Sociology which brought together chapters based on research in all three strands of LLAKES Phase One and took forward the synthesising of their research findings. The invitation to produce this volume is indicative of recognition and growing scientific profile of LLAKES research. Project 3.2's core membership of the European Employee-Driven Innovation (EDI) network, sponsored by The Danish Strategic Research Council and supported by the Danish Trade Union Confederation, LO, has developed critical insights into innovation that are complementary to those of Strand Two and work on the health care sector forthcoming in Theme Two. These have been recently published in the Palgrave collection Employee-driven Innovation: A New Approach edited by H?yrup et al. (2012) and debated in the open-access Journal Lifelong Learning in Europe, with an invited international overview by Evans. The concept of Employee-Driven Innovation first featured in EU socio-economic research priorities in the call for the FP7 programme as a direct result of the EDI network's interventions. Schoon et al's findings from Project 3.1 on the role of school engagement and 'non-cognitive' skills' in promoting successful development and attainment have been taken up by Department for Education. Riley's research in Project 3.3 has been the subject of an INDICSER (Indicators for Evaluating International Performance in Service Sectors) Paper (Mahony, M. and Riley, R., 'Human Capital Spillovers: The Importance of Training', INDICSER Discussion Paper No. 23, December 2012.) \n\n\nEconomic and Social Impact\n\nStrand One research on pre-school education and care is beginning to influence the current, very prominent, debate on policy in this area. Two LLAKES Research Papers (32 and 36), co-authored by Andy Green and Tarek Mostafa, have identified universal pre-school education and care (PSEC) as a clear 'win-win' policy in terms of its beneficial effects for both competitiveness and social cohesion. A simulation using Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data showed that universalising PSEC would improve educational performance for all social groups with smaller inequalities in performance. The maximum reduction in skills inequalities at 15 occurred in the simulation by universalising attendance for the bottom six socio-economic deciles while maintaining current attendance levels of higher social groups. Analysis of actual time-series data for a range of countries shows that higher rates of PSEC attendance are also strongly associated with higher rates of female employment. The research has been picked up by the press with articles appearing in The Independent, Western World and Nursery World in December 2012, with numerous follow-up blogs. The authors were invited to present their findings to the relevant policy team at DFE and at a Fabian Society House of Commons seminar in January, 2013. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has also invited LLAKES to advise them on their current report on PSEC. The Comparative Analysis of Early Childhood Cognitive Outcomes project in Theme Three of LLAKES Phase Two will build on this work, using longitudinal data for several countries and regions to compare how social gaps in cognitive achievement develop during the early years in different policy environments.\n\nStrand Two research on the role of apprenticeship in relation to city-region regeneration and sectoral development continues to have an impact on a range of non-academic stakeholders at local and national levels. Fuller and Rizvi's evaluation for the Southampton Skills Development Zone Board of a city-wide initiative to provide apprenticeships for unemployed and disadvantaged young people by public sector employers has contributed to a review of its strategic planning for future initiatives. Manchester City Council has asked Unwin to prepare further case studies of apprentices involved in its regeneration initiatives as part of a planned exhibition on new approaches to youth unemployment. As a result of the Southampton and Manchester studies, the London Borough of Camden has invited Unwin to advise on strategies to increase apprenticeships and make better use of planning and procurement levers. At a national level, Guile's study of media apprenticeships in the North West has led to an invitation to join Creative Skillset's new Research and Evaluation Committee and its Apprenticeship Advisory Group to help identify ways to introduce apprenticeship into hard-to-reach sub-sectors. Fuller, Guile and Unwin's research on the interconnections between apprenticeship forms of learning and skill formation at the intermediate level resulted in the Gatsby Foundation commissioning them to study the role of technicians and technical level work in the healthcare sector (reported in outputs). Gatsby has also commissioned Fuller and Unwin to do a scoping study on the relationship between apprenticeship and the concept of occupation. Fuller and Unwin have also been commissioned by the National Apprenticeship Service to produce a new version of their Guide to Creating and Managing Expansive Apprenticeships for Employers, Colleges and Training Providers to be launched at the Skills Show in October 2013. Their research was cited in the Richard Review of Apprenticeship (Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, 2012); they were consulted twice by Doug Richard and asked to give detailed feedback at the draft report stage. Findings from this research also contributed to Unwin's role as Chair of the Commission of Inquiry into the Role of Group Training Associations (which reported to government in September 2012) and as academic adviser to the Commission on Adult Vocational Teaching Learning (CAVTL) which reports to government in March 2013.

These are organised into three strands based primarily on their distinctive levels of analysis. Strand One conducts macro research at national and supra-national levels. Strand Two focuses on meso-level research on the relationship between sectors, the institutional and policy architecture of education and training, and city-regions. Strand Three concentrates on individual-level life course analysis. Each strand adopts interdisciplinary and mixed-method approaches and considers both economic and social outcomes. \n\nStrand One: Models of Lifelong Learning and the Knowledge Society (Leader: Janmaat). The research identifies the characteristics of lifelong learning (LLL) policies and systems in different OECD countries and analyses comparatively how these interact with welfare and labour market systems to generate different patterns of skills and income distribution, different sets of youth and adult values, and variant forms of social cohesion and economic competitiveness. A major theoretical objective was to identify different models of the 'knowledge society,' their concomitant 'regimes' of social cohesion and competitiveness and their underpinning education, welfare and labour market systems.\n\nProject 1: Equality and Inequality in Lifelong Learning (Leader: Janmaat). The aim of this project was to analyse the LLL system characteristics (and related societal factors) which contribute to inequality of skills outcomes at the end of compulsory schooling (measured at 15 years) and amongst adults. A dataset has been completed, with the help of our French EDESCO partners, which includes data on aggregate skills outcomes at 15 and amongst adults, and LLL system characteristics, including pedagogical differentiation (age of first selection, grade repetition, remedial teaching) and the division of powers across levels of government (regarding the curriculum, assessment and teacher recruitment). New indicators were developed from qualitative and quantitative country data on foreign language teaching (number and volume), citizenship education (nature, content and volume) and higher education (public/private, unified/binary, modes of funding, access). The project decided not develop a new dataset on the distribution of adult skills since the forthcoming OECD PIAAC survey will provide this. Some important findings are already emerging. Cross-country analysis of the data shows that inequality in skills outcomes at 15 is associated with system characteristics such as: school choice and diversity; selection to secondary schools; ability grouping within schools; and devolution of powers to the regional level. However, income inequality and levels of participatipon pre-school education and care have less effect. Analysis of the trends in PISA scores between the 2000 and 2009 surveys suggests that the variance in test scores has decreased only very marginally in the UK, where outcomes are still amongst the most unequal in the OECD, particularly in respect to the impact of social background on individual achievement (social gradient) and the effects of the social mix of school intakes on individual and school average performance. An analysis of Millennium Cohort Study data shows that ability grouping in primary schools in England is more widespread than previouly thought, with one in six pupils allocated to a set or stream by the age of seven. \n\n\n\nProject 2: Analysis of Macro-Social Data on Educational Inequality, Income Inequality, Social Cohesion and Competitiveness (Leader: Andy Green). The aim of this project was to analyse the impact of different models of lifelong learning on social cohesion and competitiveness. The research identifies distinctive 'regimes' of social cohesion, which are closely related to types of political economy, in 'liberal', 'social market', 'social democratic' and, to a lesser extent, East Asian groups of countries. Whereas social cohesion in the social democratic and social market states has been strongly institutionally embedded and associated with widely shared sets of values, in the UK, the US, and other liberal states, it has relied more on active civil society and core beliefs in individual freedoms and opportunities and rewards based on merit. Increasing inequality and declining mobility in the UK appear to be eroding these core beliefs and causing social and political trust to atrophy. Analysis of the long term trends in measures of trust show the steepest declines since 1959 in the UK and the US. In the liberal countries, levels of support for democracy and gradual reform amongst lower income groups were lower than in comparable groups in other groups of countries, and the gaps in attitudes between income groups were growing, whereas they were stable in other groups of countries. Early research showed adult skills inequalities to be inversely related to levels of trust. Cross-country analysis shows that high levels of participation in pre-school education and care have positive effects on levels of female employment and students' skills at 15, but no effects on the distribution of skills at that age. Further research has been conducted on 'Production Regimes, Job Employee and Skills Development' (Gallie, forthcoming Research Paper) and work is underway on the relationships between trust, networks and innovation (Temple, forthcoming Research Paper). However, the statistical modelling of the relationship between adult skills distributions and income distributions has been deferred until we have the more up-to-date data on adult skills which will be provided by PIAAC. \n\nProject 3: Experiencing Inequalities (Leader: Hoskins). This project aimed to investigate: firstly, how subjective evaluations of inequalities are shaped by education, age, ethnicity, and social class background; secondly, what the interrelations are between different kinds of evaluations (perceptions, beliefs and values, judgements); and, thirdly, how these evaluations are in turn influencing attitudes relevant for social cohesion. These relationships have been examined through research in five national contexts (Denmark, England, France, Germany and Singapore) and in three different educational settings (lower secondary, upper secondary and university). The data are both quantitative and qualitative, based on a total of 2000 questionnaires and 150 in-depth interviews. We administered fewer but more in-depth questionnaires than originally planned and included an extra country in the sample (Singapore). The collection, data entry and data cleaning of the quantitative data have been completed. The collection of the qualitative data has been completed, with key interviews transcribed, and, where necessary, translated into English. The data are currently being analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics for the quantitative and content analysis for the qualitative part. \n\nProject 4: School Ethnic Mix and Social Attitudes (Leader: Janmaat). This project aimed to analyse the effects of school ethnic and social segregation on students' attitudes relating to ethnic tolerance, trust and participation, controlling for other individual and school-level variables. The research has been completed and extended to cover the effects of ability grouping in schools. The research found that grouping by ability is associated with more social segregation across classrooms (but not with more ethnic segregation) and that it leads to greater disparities of civic knowledge and skills, but not disparities of civic attitudes and participation. With regard to the link between segregation and levels of civic attitudes we found that in Germany and Sweden native majority children are more tolerant the more ethnically diverse their classrooms. In England there is no relation between classroom diversity and ethnic tolerance and there is a negative relation between the average civic competence of ethnic minority children and the ethnic tolerance of their white classmates. In other words, the more competent ethnic minority children are, the less tolerant are their white classmates.\n\nProject 5: Europe, Higher Education and Regionalism (Leader: Dale). This project examines the relationship between competitiveness and social cohesion as it is mediated through education at the European level. The project is underway but has been substantially delayed (see Section 8).\n\nResearch Findings from Strand Two (Leader: Unwin). Research in Strand Two examines how education and training opportunities (for 16-24 year olds and adults) are shaping and shaped by the regeneration and innovation strategies of city-regions in the UK (including, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Greater Manchester and Southampton). The research investigates the characteristics and outcomes of key regeneration networks populated by, among others, employers, government agencies, democratic bodies, Education and Training providers, and 'Third Sector' organizations. These networks have been substantially affected by the major changes in regional structures and funding instigated by the new Coalition Government and the research projects in the strand have adapted to reflect these changing conditions. Project 4 is completed and the remaining projects are still ongoing. \n\nProject 1. Cultural Quarters: Small Businesses, Self-Employment and Innovation (Leader: Guile). This project has broadened its original scope beyond the spatial boundary of cultural quarters to examine the way in which the knowledge, skills and experience required for innovation are being conceptualised in the Creative and Cultural (C&amp;C) sector in city-regions as firms seek to diversify their existing and/or to create new product and service strategies. Working closely with Project 1.2, this project is finding evidence of the way in which education and training policies and provision have to be 'creatively' reconfigured to accomplish this goal. Two case studies are being developed examining: a) the role of learning and knowledge development in small and medium-sized enterprises in the C&amp;C sector in Birmingham; and b) the development of a new model of apprenticeship for project-based work in the Media Industry in Greater Manchester. Emerging findings show that the demise of Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and on-going development of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are disrupting well-established innovation networks and support structures through which firms learn about technological, business and policy developments, and which sustained project ecologies in the sector. Changing markets, as well as fast-moving technological developments in social and digital media, have forced firms to adapt their products, processes and knowledge bases. Intermediary organisations are playing a vital part in facilitating the process of innovation, including in the development new forms of apprenticeship. \n\nProject 2: Retail Parks: Worker Identity, Aesthetic Labour, and the Youth Labour Market (Leader: Fuller). The original aim of the project was to use retail parks to explore how spatial, and network dimensions at the level of the city region underpin the relationship between the local community and economy and the role that education and training plays in this. As the research progressed in two city regions (Southampton and Greater Manchester), other sectors were introduced and the role of the City Council and its partners became more central to the analysis of regeneration strategies which had education and training at their core. Research in Glasgow is scheduled for Autumn 2012. The research is now focusing on how apprenticeships are being created for disadvantaged young people in Construction, Business Administration and Health and Social Care. Interviews were conducted with apprentices and leading stakeholders including employers, local government, the Skills Funding Agency, JobCentre Plus, Youth Services, RDAs, education and training FE providers, and the National Apprenticeship Service. The key finding to date is that City councils are at the heart of regeneration activity with the capacity, expertise, networks and levers to strengthen the relationship between the community and the economy. This is highlighted by the role and potential of planning and procurement powers to lever education and training. Public-private-third sector partnerships are characterised by the dependence of the private and 'third sectors' on public sector (city council) resources and leadership.\n\nProject 3: Innovation, Knowledge Transfer, and the Role of Higher Education (Project leader: Mason). The objective of this project was to investigate the extent to which higher education institutions (HEIs) contribute to regional economic development through collaboration with businesses on research and innovation. A key aim is to identify the most productive ways for HEIs to support knowledge transfer and industrial innovation in slower-growing regions which tend to be the most dependent on universities for their contributions to economic growth. The Higher Education - Business and Community Interaction Survey (HEBCIS) data has been analysed and case study interviews have been conducted with representatives of 12 firms and six university departments which are engaged in innovation in renewable energy technologies (in particular, wind and marine/tidal energy). Initial statistical analysis shows that universities with high levels of interactions with industrial clients in basic and strategic research areas are highly concentrated in a few regions of the country which tend to be above-average in terms of growth and productivity. However, the same data also show that there is scope for less highly-ranked universities in slower-growing regions to make substantial contributions to technical problem-solving and skills development in local firms and organisations. In the case of marine/tidal energy, most firms appear to still be in relatively early phases of development involving strategic R&amp;D and therefore their relationships with universities tend to be confined to institutions which rank highly in academic research terms. But, offshore wind generation has reached a stage where there are in principle considerable opportunities for less highly-ranked universities to contribute to the development of local supply-chains to support the construction, operation and maintenance of offshore wind facilities. \n\nProject 4: Industrial Competitiveness, Social Inclusion and the Upskilling of Older Workers (Leader: Mason). The project examines recent trends in employer-provided training for adult workers and assesses progress in the updating and improvement of adult worker skills (as a contribution to higher levels of competitiveness) and the expansion of training opportunities for adult employees with low or no qualifications (as a contribution to greater social inclusion). The research involved a detailed analysis of Labour Force Survey (LFS) data and UK City-Regions Dataset and telephone survey of employers at two points in time (mid-2008:409 respondents; mid-2009: 285 respondents) plus semi-structured follow-up telephone interviews with 45 participating employers. The research shows that there has been some narrowing of the gap in training rates between low-qualified and highly-qualified employees but that, across the workforce as a whole, average levels of off-the-job training have declined through much of the 2000s and have now returned to 1993 levels. Establishment-level survey data in mid-2008 and mid-2009 suggest that the recent recession contributed especially to reduced levels of off-the-job training. The effects on skill levels of reducing off-the-job training have been partially alleviated by more precise targeting of on-the-job training. However, in a sizeable proportion of establishments, future productivity and competitiveness are likely to be impaired by failure to upgrade adult workers' skills to standards which employers themselves perceived as necessary prior to the recession.\n\nProject 5: The Higher and Further Education Marketplace (Leader: Robertson). This project aims to map and analyse the ways in which higher and further education institutions impact upon regional growth, competitiveness and social cohesion in the Bristol/West, England/Southwest region. So far, two aspects have been studied. First, the role of university incubation to support the growth of business start-ups and second, a survey of 2,500 students' experiences of entrepreneurial education in two city-based universities has been completed. Scheduled research has been delayed on: a) the role of industrial doctorates and foundation degrees connecting the university and further education sectors with industry; and b) the globalised nature of HE as exemplified in the Global Colleges Programme in the city-region of Singapore to develop entrepreneurs. See Section 8.\n\nResearch Findings from Strand Three. Strand Three research focuses on the processes and consequences of participation in different forms of learning and experience beyond school and through adult life. Results indicate that while early childhood experiences remain influential, experiences in later life are also important in shaping life chances, opportunities, and well-being. Although there are persistent social inequalities in transition experiences and attainment, with no weakening of the relationship between family background and academic achievement, the associations between parental social status, education expectations, and school engagement has loosened in Britain, as participation in education after 16 has increasingly been established as the norm. Learning in adult life has been shown to have both economic benefits and associations with well-being.\n\nProject 3.1 Education-Employment Transitions (Leader: Schoon) has used existing longitudinal datasets to: 1) examine changing social and gender inequalities in education and employment transitions in three British age cohorts; and 2) assess the role of school engagement, ambition values, and early aspirations as predictors of education and employment trajectories, and academic attainment. The team has developed a life course learning model of political trust and examined off-diagonal transitions exploring mechanisms that enable some young people to turn around initially problematic transitions, such as early school leaving or teenage parenthood. Current work focuses on predictors of entrepreneurship. Findings highlight the mechanisms through which socio-economic (dis-) advantage is transferred from one generation to another, pointing to the mediating role of early socialisation experiences in the family and the education system, as well as the importance of individual agency. In addition to early socialisation experiences, later experiences with institutions in society also play a role in shaping life chances and opportunities. Non-linear progression patterns are better understood using a process-oriented rather than age-fixed approach. \n\nProject 3.2 Adult Basic Skills, Workplace Learning and Life Course Transitions (Leader: Evans) is examining key factors that facilitate and inhibit sustainable workplace provision for employees with low levels of initial qualification. Thirty companies have been followed up and the project team has focused recent fieldwork on five new company sites and providers that have developed innovative and flexible forms of workplace tuition. Findings indicate that complex and rapidly shifting funding arrangements, that place a heavy emphasis on target-bearing qualifications, have militated against sustainable workplace 'Skills for Life' provision in England. The economic downturn has exacerbated the challenges of adapting such provision to the workplace. Organisations that have sustained provision have succeeded in integrating courses within a broader 'ecology of learning' whereby there is both support and formal recognition within the organisation as a whole. The workplace as a site of learning has an important effect in boosting employees' motivations and facilitating learner outcomes in a diverse range of work-related and personal activities within and beyond the work setting. Positive impact on career attitudes and trajectories of employees is likely to be eroded over time unless the broader organizational setting supports the ongoing practice and development of skills and pathways for career development. \n\nProject 3.3. Economic Experience in Working Life (Leader: Weale) has used an innovative modelling approach based on the 'mover-stayed' framework to explore jointly wage dynamics and the determination of employment in relation to the impact of lifelong learning as measured by qualification attainment (Dorsett et al, 2010). Analysis of the Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for the major European Union countries proved to be unhelpful as the different countries use qualification level codings in different ways. The results show substantial effects on earnings from lifelong learning for men and women with higher returns from qualification level upgrading than from learning with no upgrading. Much of the benefit of lifelong learning comes from increased employment prospects, and this effect is particularly marked for adults with low initial qualification levels. While upgrading offers a route out of poor labour market experience, a second sub-project has shown very substantial uncertainty surrounding the benefits of upgrading which may explain lower than expected take-up of lifelong learning opportunities. A third sub-project has shown the presence of substantial knowledge spill-overs from work experience within industries and within the workplace, showing that workers gain from their collective experience.
