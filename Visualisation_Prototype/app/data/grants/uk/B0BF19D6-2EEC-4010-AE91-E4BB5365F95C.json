{"id":"B0BF19D6-2EEC-4010-AE91-E4BB5365F95C","title":"LBAS: Centre for Russian, Central and East European Studies.","abstractText":"Our aim is to promote the development of the study of Russia, Central and Eastern Europe. We place language training at the heart of our activities and actively develop the research agenda, focusing on key themes in these countries. By doing so we put the UK in a leading position to engage with this important region.\n\nThe expansion of the European Union (EU), the current economic crisis, issues of security, welfare, migration, minority rights and developments in culture and society are key themes for CRCEES. We are well aware of issues surrounding migration as it impacts on this country, but why does this take place? What is going on in our chosen area which results in the flow of different peoples to this country and what are the implications of this? What is happening to the European Union? What are the economic and social implications of the current crisis and where does the EU go from here? Will there be further expansion, for example, to include Turkey? What is happening to our 'near neighbours' in Ukraine and Russia and in the former soviet space, particularly in Central Asia and the Caucasus? Why is nationalism on the rise and what does this mean for the stability of the region? We have seen the Greek crisis but there are many countries in our selected area of research which are equally vulnerable. In an increasingly competitive world we need to know more about these societies and cultures. We have long history of cultural engagement and have worked with various embassies and funding bodies in the promotion of public events, including literary and music evenings which are open to the general public. This is something we aim to continue in the next phase of the Centre. Awareness and understanding of different cultures is an important part of our work. Cultural discourse and interaction will continue to form a crucial theme for us and we have made links with many local migrant communities as well as public bodies and NGOs in furthering this agenda.\n\nWe have been engaged in the development of new research and cultural agendas, such as exploring the ways in which Russian and East European cultures are translated and perceived across disciplinary, linguistic and academic-end user boundaries. \n\nOur training of postgraduate students and young researchers to become specialists in the field of Russian, Central and East European Studies and our engagement with the academic and public policy agendas are crucial for the well-being of the United Kingdom. Many other European countries have held a competitive edge in this area for some time. \n\nIn the first phase of funding for Language Based Area Studies, the Centre for Russian, Central and East European Studies and the other Centres have developed an international brand which has succeeded in producing a new cohort of specialists. These young graduates, who are now working in academia, public policy, the business community and in the NGO sector, are making a positive contribution not only in terms of the issues outlined above, but in making the UK a more competitive force in this vital region. These new specialists together with those already in academic life possess a solid grasp of the various languages of the region, which increases their ability to make a real impact.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000063/1","grantId":"AH/K000063/1","fundValue":"410913","fundStart":"2012-02-14","fundEnd":"2014-05-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Ross Berry","coPersons":["Clare  McManus"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
