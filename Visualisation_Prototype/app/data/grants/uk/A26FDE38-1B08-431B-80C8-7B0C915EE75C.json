There is no effective treatment. Some patients have inherited forms of ALS, and carry a mutation in a gene called SOD1. Scientists have made laboratory mice with inherited mutations in SOD1, and we use these to understand the cellular and molecular basis of ALS. One very important use of these mice is to test new therapies, prior to their use in patients. Since mice develop ALS in a predictable way, we can follow the progression of their disease symptoms very carefully, and detect small changes in muscle function even before visible signs of disease. However it has become standard practice to determine the effect of a drug on extending the lifespan of a group of mice. We aim to refine this process in order to limit the suffering of the mice used in this research, by studying the effects of drugs at an earlier stage, before they lose a substantial number of motor neurons and become paralysed.\nA particular problem in treating ALS is to deliver therapeutic drugs to the motor neurons, which are buried deep within the spinal cord. We will also use these mice to measure at the molecular level how effective treatments are in motor neurons. This is important because most drugs are developed in the laboratory using cells grown in culture, and often have different or reduced effects in a living animal. We can measure the effects of therapeutic drugs using fluorescent probes. We will inject mice so that these probes are taken up by their motor neurons. This will enable us to directly measure how well the drug is working in motor neurons in the spinal cord of the mice. An obvious benefit of this is that we can identify the best drugs and doses to use in our experiments, without having to let the mice develop paralysis. Equally important in terms of animal welfare, is the ability to exclude therapies that are ineffective at an early stage in the drug development process, without excessive animal testing.\nIn summary we will refine the use of mouse models of ALS, to help develop more effective therapeutic approaches, and to limit the suffering of the mice used in these experiments.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700628/1","grantId":"G0700628/1","fundValue":"164730","fundStart":"2008-05-05","fundEnd":"2011-05-04","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Andrew James  Grierson","coPersons":["Richard James  Mead","Pamela Jean Shaw","Mimoun  Azzouz"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
