We aim to exploit this preliminary breakthrough to develop these new materials and, crucially, to discover what properties they possess. The proposed work is essential if these materials are to have widespread impact. Polyaminoboranes have excellent potential and are readily accessible from cheap starting materials (amine-borane adducts). Synthetic development and improved catalysts will allow access to a wide range of materials with different properties, for which exciting potential applications can be envisaged. We will also target polyiminoboranes, BN analogs of polyacetylene, which have been predicted to possess interesting properties as a result of significant electron delocalisation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018468/1","grantId":"EP/H018468/1","fundValue":"311852","fundStart":"2010-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has contributed to the global fundamental research database and has had considerable impact in this regard.
