We need to constantly develop and invest in new detector technologies, and we need state of the art laboratory equipment in order to do this. The UCL group will be further developing its expertise in a number of detector technologies but especially super-fast detector readout techniques, cryogenic noble-gas and liquid detectors and devices capable of reaching extremely low levels of background radioactivity.\n\nFor many more details of UCL's High Energy Physics research program, please refer to our 2012 Consolidated Grant application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L003244/1","grantId":"ST/L003244/1","fundValue":"36535","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"David Simon Waters","coPersons":["Mark Andrew Lancaster"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
