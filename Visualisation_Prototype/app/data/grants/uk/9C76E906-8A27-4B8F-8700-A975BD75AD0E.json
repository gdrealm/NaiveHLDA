The biogeochemistry of the oceans plays an important role in the Earth System: it regulates the cycles of major chemical elements and controls the associated feedback processes between the land, ocean and atmosphere. The oceans currently take up about 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities, storing it in deep waters for centuries. This uptake occurs against the backdrop of an active natural carbon cycle, where carbon is constantly recirculated between the surface and deep ocean in response to physical, chemical and biological processes. As a result, changes to ocean biology can influence the uptake of carbon dioxide by the oceans, and can have important implications for climate. While the physical and chemical processes that affect ocean biogeochemical cycles are relatively well understood (e.g. circulation, solubility), our understanding of the role of biological processes is far less advanced. In large part this stems from the complexity of elemental cycling within living organisms, and the high diversity (taxonomic and functional) of marine communities. At present, marine ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic environmental change particularly through climate-induced changes in physical properties (e.g. ocean currents and temperature) and by ocean acidification (e.g. carbon dioxide-mediated drop in pH). If we are to maintain a safe environment in this century and beyond it is essential that we improve our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry so that we can better forecast and quantify its response to global change, and so that we can better identify potential feedbacks between the ocean and the rest of the Earth System. \n\nBy synthesising empirical knowledge into quantitative descriptions, computer models allow scientists to investigate the functioning of, and interactions between, biogeochemistry and climate. Earth Systems models now routinely simulate the biogeochemical interactions of the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere in order to study the dynamics of the climate system and to make projections of future climate. A joint goal of NERC and the UK Met. Office is to develop a new earth system model capable of predicting global and regional impacts of environmental change from days to decades. This will include a novel and unified biological modelling approach for ocean biogeochemistry. The detail required to adequately represent the ocean biogeochemical processes relevant to climate in a numerical model is a subject of much ongoing debate. This has led to a diversity of models which differ not only in their structure, but also in their formulation and parameterisation of key biological processes. \n\ni-MarNet will evaluate the existing suite of ocean biogeochemical models in the UK in order to inform the decision for the next UK earth system model. Simulations of both the recent past and the next 100 years will be made to assess the ability of models to reproduce observations and to quantify the change and responsiveness of the models to climate change. This model comparison will provide new information that helps to identify the role of ecosystem complexity in the representation of biological activity and the ocean carbon dioxide sink, as well as the of both sensitivity to climate change. i-MarNet will also generate a strategic plan, via coordination of the UK science community, to develop a new state of the art ocean biogeochemical model that builds on the best available science and the strength of existing models. \n\nIn summary, the project will provide crucial information to guide ocean biogeochemical model developments in the UK, and will define a roadmap to help resolve key scientific questions as well as provide a better understanding of the functioning of the climate system that improves climate projections","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K001345/1","grantId":"NE/K001345/1","fundValue":"281607","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings of the project have been use to help select the ocean biogeochemistry component of UKESM1. \n\nUKESM1 is being developed jointly by NERC and the UKMO as a simulation tool for the UK participation in CMIP6 and the next IPCC report.

OBGC models are now integral components of Earth System Models (ESMs), but they compete for computing resources with higher resolution dynamical setups and with other components such as atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial vegetation schemes. As such, the choice of OBGC in ESMs needs to balance model complexity and realism alongside relative computing cost. Here, we present an inter-comparison of six OBGC models that were candidates for implementation within the next UK Earth System Model (UKESM1). The models cover a large range of biological complexity (from 7 to 57 tracers) but all include representations of at least the nitrogen, carbon, alkalinity and oxygen cycles. Each OBGC model was coupled to the Nucleus for the European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean general circulation model (GCM), and results from physically identical hindcast simulations were compared. Model skill was evaluated for biogeochemical metrics of global-scale bulk properties using conventional statistical techniques. The computing cost of each model was also measured in standardised tests run at two resource levels. No model is shown to consistently outperform or underperform all other models across all metrics. Nonetheless, the simpler models that are easier to tune are broadly closer to observations across a number of fields, and thus offer a high-efficiency option for ESMs that prioritise high resolution climate dynamics. However, simpler models provide limited insight into more complex marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem pathways, and a parallel approach of low resolution climate dynamics and high complexity biogeochemistry is desirable in order to provide additional insights into biogeochemistry - climate interactions.\n \nA report has been prepared to analyse candidate ocean biogeochemical models and provide the UK Hadley Centre with the information required to make an informed decision regarding ocean biogeochemical model implementation in the next UK Earth System Model (UKESM1). The report seeks to asses any potential trade-offs between ocean biogeochemical model complexities, model efficacies in an Earth System context, and computational cost. This work has helped inform the selection of MEDUSA is the baseline OBM for the next UK ESM. I-Marnet provide a valuable framework for the assessment of the suitability of ocean biogeochemistry models for inclusions in ESM's. Models have been assessed in terms of:\n\nBiological fidelity: structures, parameterisations and parameter sets of candidate models have been expertly assessed in a network workshop with a view to their realism and use of &quot;best practise&quot;.\n\nComputational cost: in consultation with the UK Met Office each candidate model has been benchmarked for its computational cost and data storage requirements.\n\nModel skill: in consultation with model developers a set of common ocean biogeochemical model outputs have been assessed against observational datasets. Model skill has been assessed through traditional &quot;beauty contest&quot; statistical techniques that take into account mean model biases and spatial pattern correlation coefficients. Although this analysis forms the bulk of this report we also explore &quot;emergent constraints&quot; as an innovative method of assessing model skill with respect to climate projections which makes optimal use of an ensemble of ocean biogeochemical models.\n\nThe recommendation was the adoption of Medusa-2 as the OBGC component of UKESM1. _ More generally, the very constructive iMarNet collaboration offers a promising basis for the UK to take the lead in developing the more complex ocean ecosystem models capable of addressing broader issues of environmental change, beyond the representation of biogeochemical feedbacks in Earth System Models.
