In doing so the series aims to cross-fertilise research and practice in the field of education with that in other professional fields, such as educational psychology and medicine, and also to draw upon knowledge of teacher professional learning from education systems across the UK and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>The series will also attempt to explore what can be gleaned by drawing on insights from socio-cultural theory, activity theory and social learning theories in analysing the theoretical and pedagogic underpinnings of teacher workplace learning.</p>\n\n<p>The seminars will additionally sustain and foster cross-institutional networking in the Northwest of England that was generated by a previous ESRC funded project focused on building the research capacity of and in teacher education.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0880","grantId":"RES-451-26-0880","fundValue":"18001","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Olwen  McNamara","coPersons":["Jean Mary Murray","Marion  Jones"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
