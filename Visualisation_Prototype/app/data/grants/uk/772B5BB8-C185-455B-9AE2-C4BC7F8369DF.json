The disorder arises because of mutations in a gene called FMO3 and not because of poor hygiene. Why do changes in the FMO3 gene cause body and breath odour? When we eat food that contains choline (which many foods do, e.g. red meat, seafood, some vegetables, soya, eggs and chocolate) then the bacteria that live in our gut cause the problem. The bacteria break choline down to produce a small molecule called trimethylamine. This chemical is the one to which the human nose is most sensitive and which is also the chemical that gives rotting fish its characteristic smell. In people with a normal FMO3 gene there is no odour problem because the FMO3 enzyme we have in our liver changes trimethylamine into a chemical that does not smell. BUT, if the FMO3 enzyme cannot do this, then the trimethylamine is not changed and is excreted in urine, sweat and breath. Social isolation, ridicule and limited employment prospects are experienced by those with TMAU, this usually means a low quality of life; high levels of depression, suicide and divorce occur in this population. Our study will test a therapy for TMAU that will reduce the amount of urinary trimethylamine excreted. Our pre-clinical findings will prepare the way for clinical studies in humans in the future. A reduction in body and breath odour will contribute greatly to an improved quality of life for those with TMAU.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015494/1","grantId":"MR/K015494/1","fundValue":"360684","fundStart":"2013-08-12","fundEnd":"2016-04-11","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth Anne Shephard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
