{"id":"5F1B3027-966C-4ECB-BAE0-AE688E23EFCD","title":"Representation growth of linear groups over local rings","abstractText":"Zeta functions play a major role in number theory, starting with the Riemann zeta function, and continuing with Dedekind zeta functions and more general Dirichlet series. More recently zeta functions have started to play a role also in group theory and representation theory. In these cases the zeta function encodes an infinite sequence of numbers a_1, a_2,..., where a_n is, for instance, the number of irreducible n-dimensional representations of a group. The zeta function defined using this sequence is called the representation zeta function of the group. Among other things, the zeta functions help us to say something about the growth rate of the sequence a_1, a_2,.... For large classes of interesting groups the precise rate of growth is governed by a rational number called the abscissa of convergence of the zeta function. \n\nThe first part of this project will study the abscissa of convergence associated to the groups SL_N(o), that is, the group of N by N matrices with determinant 1 and with entries in a local principal ideal ring with finite residue field, such as the p-adic integers Z_p. The precise value of the abscissa of SL_N(o) is a mysterious object and there is currently not even a guess as to its precise value. We will develop and use several constructions for representations of the related group GL_N(o) of invertible matrices over o to pin down the value of the abscissa more precisely than has been done previously. A prominent role here is played by the so-called regular representations. \nThe first goal is to find a precise conjectural value of the abscissa and to prove it for as many groups as possible. Since our methods work for all rings o, the second goal will be to address the problem of whether or not the abscissa of SL_N(o) is independent of o, where N and the residue field of o is fixed but o varies.\n\nThe second part of the project will generalise certain results from classical Deligne-Lusztig theory to the generalised unramified Deligne-Lusztig construction. These results will then be used to prove a generalisation of an asymptotic formula of Liebeck and Shalev for Chevalley groups over finite local rings G(o_r). There is some evidence that this formula can be viewed as a finite group analogue of some formulae for the abscissa of G(o), but the precise explanation for this is still not known, and our work aims to shed some light on this.\nFinally, we aim to tie together the above topics by showing that the representations given by the generalised unramified Deligne-Lusztig construction for GL_n(o_r) are regular, and have therefore been included in the counting in the first part of the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K024779/1","grantId":"EP/K024779/1","fundValue":"94549","fundStart":"2014-01-13","fundEnd":"2016-01-12","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Not applicable this year as we are still at the early stages of the project.

So far we have obtained the following results:\n\n1. A refinement of a result of Liebeck and Shalev which says that the abscissa of convergence of a family of finite simple groups of Lie type is r/k where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. We have proved that the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the so-called regular representations. \n\n2. A new and simplified proof that the abscissa of convergence of a simple compact Lie group is r/k, where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. This was previously established by Larsen and Lubotzky, using a different argument. As a consequence, we prove that also in this case the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the regular ones (i.e, corresponding to a regular weight).\n\n3. We have proved that the group GL_N(o), where o is a compact discrete valuation ring, has finitely many twist-isoclasses of representations of each dimension. Moreover, we have proved that if the characteristic of o does not divide N, then the twist representation zeta function of GL_N(o) has the same abscissa of convergence as the representation zeta function of SL_N(o).\n\n4. We have almost finished computing the abscissae of the twist representation zeta functions of GL_2(o), for arbitrary o. In particular, when o has characteristic 0 but residue characteristic 2, this leads to the value of the abscissa for SL_2(o), which was previously unknown. Our results of finite groups of Lie type and Lie groups is currently the best explanation of why the abscissae are exactly r/k, but further work of experts in the field may eventually result in a full explanation.\nOur results for GL_2(o) or SL_2(o) will be the first ones on the abscissae of convergence in the case where o has residue characteristic 2. Previous techniques were inadequate to deal with these case. This opens up a host of new questions about representation zeta functions of SL_N(o) in &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; characteristic, that is, when the residue characteristic of o divides N, or when the characteristic of o itself divides N. These results are of interest in connection with the search for a generalisation of a result of Jaikin-Zapirain beyond compact p-adic analytic groups. The results are also closely connected with the work of Avni, Klopsch, Onn and Voll, and it is likely that our results will be of interest to these workers. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
