The majority of the workload is managed in specialist children s hospitals, and requires facilities for dialysis and transplantation. If the diseases that lead to kidney failure could be studied more systematically, by collecting clinical information, blood and DNA samples from the whole UK population, then better strategies for preventing kidney failure could be devised. \nThis study will collect information from 2 such diseases, in an ongoing basis, and has the robust support of all the leading UK kidney organisations. This will be the first time such comprehensive disease information has been collated, and will set up an infrastructure for many more kidney diseases to be studied in the same comprehensive way.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800571","grantId":"G0800571","fundValue":"349929","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Moin  Saleem","coPersons":["C Mark Taylor","Neil  Sebire","Caroline Olive Savage","Charles Richard Tomson"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
