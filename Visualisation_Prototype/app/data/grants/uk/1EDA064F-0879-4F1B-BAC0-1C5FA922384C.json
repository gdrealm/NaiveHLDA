The inability to touch products during the purchase decision-making process is one of the key challenges for fashion retailers. Product returns rates for fashion currently average 25 per cent and the abandoned shopping basket rate for online retail in the UK currently stands at around 65 per cent. The research objectives are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>to assess the application of a novel form of image interactivity technology in the fashion retail context. Specifically the research seeks to address the perceptual gap between digital and physical product evaluation both online and in the physical store environment via the use of novel touchscreen technology, developed by Heriot-Watt University</li>\n\n <li>to assess the potential of image interactivity technology in fulfilling consumers' utilitarian and hedonic online shopping motives </li>\n\n <li>to identify the barriers and facilitators of adoption by fashion retailers, with a focus on SMEs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The methodology will include the collection and analysis of quantitative data from retailer websites (Google analytics), supplemented by qualitative data gathered from interviews with retailers and focus groups with consumers.</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005247/1","grantId":"ES/L005247/1","fundValue":"117845","fundStart":"2014-01-20","fundEnd":"2015-04-19","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patsy  Perry","coPersons":["Kathryn Mary Waite","Mike  Chantler"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
