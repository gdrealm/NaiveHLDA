The psychophysical experiments will provide novel information on the use of multiple haptic inputs as a function of type and relative positions of receptors being stimulated, as well as information on how concurrent haptic and visual input is integrated. The computational studies will evaluate whether copula-based wavelet analyses are able to simulate human discrimination performance, with information being combined immediately across sensory inputs. As an alternative, this will be compared with approaches in which time series (including wavelet-based) analyses are conducted for each input before integration takes place across inputs. The work will provide a detailed account of how sensory integration operates within and across modalities, which can subsequently be used to guide the construction of artificial sensory systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000134/1","grantId":"BB/E000134/1","fundValue":"60717","fundStart":"2006-11-24","fundEnd":"2008-05-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The work has provided a framework for understanding the processing of multiple levels of visual stimuli, helping to improve the diagnosis of attentional disorders Healthcare Societal","person":"Glyn  Humphreys","coPersons":["Fionn  Murtagh"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" The work on the project showed new constraints on sensory integration of sensory signals in tactile perception, demonstrating effects of the body positions of the sensors and the temporal intervals between the signals.
