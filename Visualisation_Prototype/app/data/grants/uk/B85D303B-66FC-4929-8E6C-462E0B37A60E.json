Biosensors are extremely useful in diagnosis, fighting terrorist and prevention of pandemic disease spread. Through detection of associated molecules such as DNA and antibody-antigen, they are very promising in early diagnosis of cancers and genetic disorder. Widespread applications of thus biosensors will lead to fast and accurate diagnosis, thus preventing unnecessary mortality and saving thousands of lives. Deployment of biosensors at key public locations enables detection of disease or biological substances in time, preventing spread of diseases or biochemical attach. High quality biosensors must be very sensitive, easy to use, low cost and fast with integrated electronics. Also multi-detection of many molecules using arrays is essential for reliable diagnosis and detection. Although many technologies have been developed such as microarrays and label-free electrochemical and optical biosensors. they have various shortages: lack of sensitivity and resolution, bulky and precise control of the sample position, or a large device size and lack of scalability etc. A multi-disciplinary team from Universities of Cambridge (CU), University of Manchester (MU) and University of Bolton (BU) is formed to develop a technology platform for biochemical detection using the most advanced film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR) technology. FBAR device has a structure similar to quartz crystal microbalance but with a submicrometer thick piezoelectric (PE) active layer. It consists of a thin PE-layer with electrodes on both sides. Application of A.C. signals generates a standing wave between the two electrodes through PE effect. The resonant frequency is extremely sensitive to mass attached on the electrode surface owing to small device dimensions (thus the small base mass) and high operating frequency. Extremely small concentration of biomolecules can be detected through specific bio-binding with pre-deposited probe molecules on the electrode surface. The device has the combined merits of all other biosensors: label-free, ultra-high sensitivity and low detection limit, small dimensions, suitability for multi-detection using FBAR arrays, electronic output signal and low cost. The project will initially focus on development of high performance FBARs using piezoelectric (PE) ZnO thin films owing to its relatively mature technology. Biosensing technology will be developed in parallel using prostate-specific antigens (PSA) and peptide aptamers that specifically bind to those PSAs. Peptide aptamers have much better stability and specificity than proteins. Development of ZnO-based FBAR biosensors enables us to clarify all issues in device modelling, fabrication and characterisation, immobilization and biodetection etc. At the second stage, the project will develop novel FBARs on glass and plastic substrates using low cost PE-polymers. PE polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymer PVDF/TrFE have a piezoelectric constant and coupling coefficient comparable to the piezoelectric ceramics, and are biocompatible and chemically inert. Owing to their flexibility, it allows fabrication on low cost glass and plastic substrates. The cost of these biosensors will be extremely low. BU has excellent facilities for modelling and design, and for material and device characterisation. They will be responsible for modelling, design and characterisation. CU has a world-class cleanroom housed with excellent deposition, etch and microfabrication facilities. They will offer the expertise and experiences in device fabrication. The MU has first class biolab environment and relevant facilities for biological research. They are experts in protein adsorption, interfacial conformation, structural unfolding, and synthesis and cloning of peptide aptamers.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F063865/1","grantId":"EP/F063865/1","fundValue":"277017","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results of this project havce been used to significantly advcance the use of film bulk acoustic resonator devices for a range of sensing applications, including in the biological sensing and physical sensing fields.

The project was divided into four sub-goals: (1) to develop a technology to fabricate a highly sensitive FBAR\nsensor which can be used as an universal sensing technology platform employing special bio-binding systems and\nchemical absorption layers; (2) to develop a technology to fabricate low cost, high performance FBAR devices using a PE\npolymer on a glass substrate; (3) develop a biorecognition system based-on peptide aptamers which has specific binding\nability with prostate-antigens, immobilization of biomolecules on the device surface and biodetection. (4) to characterize the\ndevice performance and to verify its biodetection functionality using specific biochemical systems. To realize these goals,\nthe project has achieved a number of measurable objectives:\n1. To optimize device structure and dimensions to obtain the best FBAR device performance. Models have been\nestablished which enable simulation of the device performance taking into account of the influence of the electrode and\nactive layer thicknesses, material quality, surface roughness and attached biological species. (Objective unchanged and\ncompleted)\n2. To optimize the deposition of ZnO thin films for FBAR devices. Particular attention was paid to the requirement for\ndetection in liquid, meaning that a TSM FBAR is needed with off c-axis crystal orientation. In practice, the deposition of offaxis\nmaterial was not achieved. However, by using a novel HiTUS sputtering deposition technology for the ZnO, a far\nbetter on-axis alignment of ZnO crystals was achieved which has led to devices being fabricated with a world-leading\nquality (Q) factor (~2000).\n3. To develop a technology to process high quality PE polymer thin films. The technology addressed the issues of thin film\nformation, adhesion with the substrate, patterning, etching, poling to obtain the piezoelectric properties, and the excessive\ndamping on the &quot;soft&quot; substrates. Such devices were successfully manufactured and measured. The Q-factor of these\ndevices was, as expected, lower than that of the devices made with ZnO. Also, as the quality of the ZnO was far better\nthan expected (see objective #2) the focus of the project was shifted to concentrate more on the ZnO material.\n4. To develop high sensitivity FBAR sensors using ZnO and PE polymers as the active layer with operation frequencies up\nto 2 GHz. A technology was developed to fabricate biosensor arrays. (Objective unchanged and completed).\n5. To develop a bio-recognition system which has a strong binding affinity and specificity with ability to retain biological\nidentities when bound with probe molecules. To develop a technology to deposit bio-probe molecules on the device surface\nand a method to interrogate them to bind with target molecules for detection. (Objective unchanged and completed).\n6. To characterize the FBAR device with PE ceramic and polymer thin films, and to develop a method to quantify the target\nmolecules bound with the probe molecules. And to develop a method for multi-channel parallel detection. In practice,\nbiological measurements were not made with the PE polymer as the ZnO devices were of significantly better quality than\nexpected.\n7. To develop a technology for replacing metal electrodes on FBAR devices with carbon nanotube electrodes. This was a\nnew objective, which was completed successfully. The new devices show significantly improved performance due to the\nreduced mass of the CNT electrodes (compared with metal) and the suppression of surface travelling waves, resulting in\nenhanced Q-factor. We were the first group worldwide to propose, realise and publish such CNT electrode-based devices.\nOverall, the result of this work has been that we lead the field in high sensitivity FBAR devices with a mass detection limit of\n~1E-15g (approximately the mass of a single virus). The results are being used by a diversity of industries with a requirement for physical or biological sensing.
