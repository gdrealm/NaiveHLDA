Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and evident from observations of increasing global average temperatures. Warming is also observed in the oceans, and is accompanied by a change in salinity, with the high latitudes becoming 'fresher' (i.e., less saline) and the subtropics and tropics becoming more saline - a redistribution of properties that has the potential to affect ocean circulation. There are also clear effects of climate change on the chemistry of the oceans. Whilst increased uptake of more abundant atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to an acidification of the oceans that threatens marine ecosystems, only little is known about the effects of higher concentrations of certain trace metals, as a result of anthropogenic pollution and changing erosion patterns on land. Such changes are very important, however, as the ability of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is strongly coupled to the supply of so-called nutrients, elements that are essential for life in the ocean. \n\nAs part of this project, we will develop a better understanding of such 'biogeochemical cycles'. We picked out three trace metals, neodymium (Nd), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), which together represent the behaviour of many different elements in the ocean. For example, both Cd and Pb are today supplied to the environment by human activity and this may alter their natural cycles. As Cd is an important micronutrient in the ocean, such changes could also affect the global carbon cycle. As part of our project, a PhD student will focus on understanding whether the natural flux of dust from desert areas to the ocean and the anthropogenic particles the dust scavenges in the atmosphere have an important impact on the marine Cd and Pb cycles. The student will furthermore study, how the cycling of these elements in the ocean is altered by changing oxygen concentrations. Oxygen is (next to the nutrients) another important player in biogeochemical cycles, and its solubility in seawater is temperature dependent. Climate models predict that extended zones with low oxygen concentrations will develop in the future oceans.\n\nAnother important aspect of the ocean system is that ocean currents are the key mechanism for distributing heat, and thus they have a significant impact on regional and local climate. Furthermore, water mass movements (both vertical and lateral) are very important for the carbon cycle, as the deep ocean contains 50-60 times more carbon than the atmosphere. Today we can monitor ocean circulation by measuring the physical properties of seawater. Observations over the past 50 years, however, do not give us any clear indication whether the pattern of ocean circulation is changing. From studies of the past we know, however, that ocean water masses had a different configuration during the ice ages and past periods of extreme warmth. Neodymium isotopes in seawater are often used for such reconstructions, and the results show stunning relationships between past temperatures, carbon dioxide levels, and ocean circulation.\n\nA patchy understanding the modern Nd cycle however limits our confidence in such reconstructions, and thus our ability to transfer the inferred mechanisms to future models. In particular, it is generally assumed that away from ocean margins, Nd isotopes are an ideal ocean circulation tracer as they are only modified by mixing between water masses. However, there are many potential marine processes, which may not be in accord with this simplistic view. Such uncertainties will be addressed by the current project, based on a comprehensive suite of new observational data that will be collected for samples from strategic locations in the Atlantic Ocean. In conjunction with modelling efforts, our new data will shed light on the processes governing the marine Nd cycle and the suitability of Nd isotopes as circulation tracer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J021636/1","grantId":"NE/J021636/1","fundValue":"365608","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Our findings will hopefully spur future funding in the area of marine geochemistry and help to groundtruth a key tracer for palaeoceanography.

With this grant we seek to improve our understanding of the modern cycle of Nd in the ocean by measuring its isotopic composition and concentrations in more than 200 seawater samples. No detailed results can be shared yet as we are only one year into the grant. We are only a bit more than one year into the grant, and hence it is premature to talk about results in detail. We however envision that our results will provide unique insights into the marine cycles of Nd, Cd and Pb, three important trace metals in the global ocean. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
