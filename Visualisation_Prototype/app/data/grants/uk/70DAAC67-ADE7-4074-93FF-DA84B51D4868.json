The overall aim is to increase understanding of the impact of gender, pubertal status and environmental adversities on the emergence of depressive symptoms. The project will examine whether early onset of puberty is associated with an increase in level of depressive symptoms, and whether this is a greater risk factor for girls compared to boys. There will also be an investigation of whether depressive symptoms with an onset in childhood (pre-puberty) are more strongly associated with environmental adversities than adolescent onset depressive symptoms. The project will take advantage of the unique and extensive data collected by an ongoing longitudinal population-based study- the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Using recently developed statistical techniques known as ‘group-based trajectory modeling’, the first phase of the project will use prospective data on depressive symptoms to identify and classify distinct pathways of development of depressive symptoms (known as ‘trajectories’) in children aged 9 to 13 years and examine gender differences in the trajectories. Longitudinal data on environmental adversities and pubertal status will then be used to examine the impact of these factors on the depression trajectories.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F025947/1","grantId":"ES/F025947/1","fundValue":"81706","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Carol  Joinson","coPersons":["Jon  Heron","Glyn  Lewis"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
