A common cause is damage sustained during childbirth to the muscles that normally provide control of bowel movements. Current medical and surgical treatments are often inadequate. Emerging treatments involving the use of a patient's own muscle cells offer the possibility of restoring function to the damaged muscle, but improved methods for delivering the cells to ensure they survive and repair tissue are needed. \n\nThe aim of the proposed research is to demonstrate, through proof of principle, that muscle cells attached to the surface of a unique type of degradable polymer microsphere are more effective at restoring injured muscle compared with conventional methods of muscle cell delivery. The aim will be achieved through an interdisciplinary project involving biologists, clinicians and materials scientists. The experimental study will include investigating the optimal conditions for attachment of muscle cells to the microspheres; delivery of the cellularized microspheres to pre-clinical models of muscle injury; measurement of integration of the transplanted cells at the injury site; and ability of the transplanted cells to restore muscle contractility. In parallel to the experimental study we will establish women's views on the innovative therapy we are proposing, which will help us to design a therapeutic system best suited to the user's needs. \n\nThe outcome from the present study will provide timely, key information for the future development of the therapeutic system. The experimental outputs will be used to design future clinical trials investigating the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in faecally incontinent patients. Both the polymer microspheres and cell types being investigated are already being developed independently for other clinical uses, making transfer of findings from this project to the clinic for faecal incontinence much faster. If successful, the therapeutic system will have tremendous economic benefits to the UK NHS, as well as delivering social, economic and psychological benefits to patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L002752/1","grantId":"MR/L002752/1","fundValue":"475224","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Day","coPersons":["Anton  Emmanuel","Francesco Saverio  Tedesco"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
