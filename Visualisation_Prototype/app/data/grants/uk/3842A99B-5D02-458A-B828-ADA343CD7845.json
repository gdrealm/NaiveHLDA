It is an idea that crosses the boundaries of academic disciplines and has also entered into public understanding. Instead, it is proposed that perpetrators are 'engaged followers' who identify with the cause and the authority figure who instructs them to inflict harm. These ideas will be investigated:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>through virtual reality simulations of Milgram's famous obedience studies</li>\n\n <li>through online studies employing a modified Milgram paradigm</li>\n\n <li>a field study will be designed to investigate these ideas in a more realistic setting. </li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The final part of the work will be to organise a set of seminars bringing together historians and psychologists to discuss the nature and role of obedience in real-life atrocities. In this way, the aim of the project is to affect both academic and popular understandings of obedience and atrocity.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L003104/1","grantId":"ES/L003104/1","fundValue":"196367","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Reicher","coPersons":["Stephen Alexander  Haslam","Mel  Slater"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
