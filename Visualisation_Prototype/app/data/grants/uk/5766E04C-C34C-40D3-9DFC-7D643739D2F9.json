Currently, it is recognised that this will likely stem from a diverse portfolio of renewable and existing energy sources as well as the development of technologies for energy storage, conversion and usage. As the majority of the UK's total energy consumption can be attributed to heating (48%) and transport (38%) these are clearly significant targets for change. \n\nOne possible route for energy storage on a domestic scale is the storage of heat that could later be converted to electricity if required. Energy harvesters designed to recycle or use various forms of energy that would otherwise be wasted (such as kinetic, thermal, acoustic, or solar), could also find applications with regards to reduction of energy demands. A technology that applies to both these applications is the thermoelectric energy generator (TEG). \n\nThe TEG is typically based on the Seebeck effect: a physical process that results in the generation of an electric current when a temperature difference exists between two terminals. Advantages of this technology include reliability, flexibility, and relatively small volumes, however due to low efficiencies and high costs it is currently limited to niche markets. One of the bottlenecks for improvement of the TEG efficiency is the co-dependence of the key material properties (i.e., thermal and electric conductivities) according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. Whilst some progress has been made on this by nano-engineering, there is still some way to go before widespread commercialisation becomes viable. \n\nA solution to this bottleneck could be found in a new phenomena that involves the interplay of thermal and electron spin currents: the spin Seebeck effect. It is similar to the Seebeck effect in that a thermal gradient can be used to generate a current, but with two main differences: the material must be magnetic (whether metallic, insulating or semiconducting), and the electric current generated is spin polarised. This is significant as it has led to the observation of spin dependant conductivity, a feature that could allow us to sidestep the limit imposed by the Wiedemann-Franz Law and thus improve the efficiency of TEGs further. \n\nHarnessing the maximum spin polarised current generated by the spin Seebeck effect typically requires the use of expensive platinum contacts. For such technology to become economically viable therefore would require research into cheaper alternatives. It has been shown that small amounts of platinum, bismuth or tantalum in otherwise 'inactive' copper can result in a similar harvested voltage compared to pure platinum contacts. The aim of this research project therefore, is to explore the possibility of alternative metal contacts with respect to spin Seebeck effect based TEGs and to assess the viability of such an application.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L024918/1","grantId":"EP/L024918/1","fundValue":"97422","fundStart":"2014-04-07","fundEnd":"2016-04-06","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  As we are still in the early stages of the award it is difficult to comment on the academic impact of this research in specific sectors. [Aside from increased awareness of this research field (enhancing the knowledge economy) at CIMTEC (RA talk), Electrochem (invited talk) and RAMs (poster presentation).] The main types of impact that have arisen so far are outreach activities such as the Big Bang Fair, which have had societal impact by increasing public engagement. I have also built on the award by obtaining additional funding from the University (attracting R and D investment) in order to enhance the research capacity knowledge and skills of the Department. This has resulted in the purchase of new electronics and a new cryostat for resistivity measurements.

So far we have identified the thickness distribution of thin films deposited over large area films (often difficult for the technique we are using) and are confirming the deposition conditions required for good quality thin films (essential for this project). \nIn addition we continue to develop our understanding (and design) of a potential waste heat harvesting (thermoelectric) device based on this effect. The deposition parameters required for the thin films (Fe3O4, Co2MnSi) could be applied to any other application using these materials (e.g. Co2MnSi is common in spintronics applications).
