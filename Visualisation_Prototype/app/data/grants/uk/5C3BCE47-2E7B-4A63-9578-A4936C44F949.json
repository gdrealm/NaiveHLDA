Through an analysis of the sequential organisation of code switching between immigrant parents and their British-born children in Chinese families in Tyneside, we demonstrate how differences in personal needs, social identities and cultural values are negotiated in response to a wide array of interactional and social factors. The research will provide new insights into (changes of) family values in diasporas and migrant communities, evaluate current theories of intercultural communication and conflict resolution, and contribute to the development of a general theory of the pragmatics of code switching.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119481/1","grantId":"119481/1","fundValue":"9055","fundStart":"2006-01-23","fundEnd":"2006-10-22","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Hua  Zhu","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
