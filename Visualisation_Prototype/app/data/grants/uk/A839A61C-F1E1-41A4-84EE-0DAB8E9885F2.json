The stimulus that evokes such parental effects may appear only transiently during the parent's lifetime, and may have only a transient impact on the parent, and yet may nevertheless exert a long-lasting influence on the offspring if it is imposed during a critical window of sensitivity in the developmental process. These offspring may then transmit such effects to their own offspring, generating longer-term trans-generational effects. Despite increasing evidence for these effects, why they have evolved, and why they differ so widely across species, remains poorly understood. A key reason for this poor understanding is the lack of a robust theoretical framework for investigating the phenomenon. Trans-generational effects are particularly relevant to humans, as it is increasingly recognized that some aspects of phenotype are flexible in relation to prevailing conditions, whereas others are strongly influenced by ancestral experience. Processes such as climate change, economic development and migration all challenge organisms, including humans. How different organisms can respond to such challenges is determined in part by the variable contribution of trans-generational effects to phenotypic development. Thus, understanding trans-generational effects has many practical implications, for understanding how organisms will respond to different types of environmental change.Our research hypothesis is that trans-generational effects are an adaptive consequence of evolved life-history strategies, and that we can therefore predict under what ecological conditions they will arise. We propose to use novel life-history models to explain the diversity of trans-generational effects across species. These models consider how organisms should divide their resources between competing processes such as growth versus reproduction. A 'decision' in the parent generation has implications for the phenotype of the offspring, and hence what 'decision' should be made in this generation. We will use 'evolutionary game theory' in these models, which considers how the best strategy for one individual must take into account the strategies of other individuals, such as their offspring. In order to build these models, we will need to develop novel mathematical methods for modeling life-history evolution that can better accommodate trans-generational influences. Trans-generational effects pose some particularly intriguing challenges for mathematical modeling, because there are time lags between when information 'enters' phenotype (eg being a first-born), and when natural selection operates (eg on the offspring of that first-born individual). These time-lags are mathematically very complex, and they may be further complicated by asymmetries between the two parents. For example, the ovum develops during the mother's own fetal life, whereas the sperm develops during the father's adolescence. The two parents therefore provide information to the offspring from contrasting time periods, which might in turn influence how the offspring should respondWe are also interested in how organisms can respond to 'extreme events', such as forest fires or famines. These events occur less often than every generation, hence many generations never actually experience them. We will investigate how such extreme events might contribute to the evolution of trans-generational effects. Once developed, we will use our model to evaluate our theoretical analyses across different species. We will pay particular attention to humans, benefiting from data on cohort studies already available to the investigators. These cohort studies provide data on 3 or more generations, and will allow us to undertake analyses using insights from the mathematical modeling.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H031928/1","grantId":"EP/H031928/1","fundValue":"676567","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our work has helped to advance current understanding of the evolutionary origins and consequences of maternal effects, and thereby influence subsequent research in this area.

Using a continuous-time population dynamical model, we derived a general framework to assess the evolution of nongenetic effects in spatiotemporally fluctuating environments. This framework allowed us to specify under which environmental conditions nongenetic inheritance is likely to evolve. Among others, we find that the evolution of nongenetic inheritance is highly sensitive to particular life history details (e.g., presence of mortality versus fecundity selection) and only occurs when the environment has certain characteristics (different environments encountered at roughly similar rates). Our predictions can be used in experimental tests of the evolution of nongenetic inheritance in micro-organisms or in Arabidopsis.\n\n\n\n2. We developed a number of game theoretical models to assess the responsiveness of mothers to local environmental information. These models provide insight on whether offspring can be forewarned via maternal effects about coming hazards and risks (such as disease). We find that maternal resource levels substantially affect responsiveness of mothers to theze hazards. Among others, these models provide insight on why maternal resources are often an important modulator of offspring disease resistance.\n\n\n\n3. Extension of conventional models of parent-offspring conflict to incorporate population structure and limited dispersal reveal that conflict may become more intense when dispersal is limited because local competition among related young can reduce the cost of any decline in maternal productivity, favouring greater selfishness on the part of offspring. When young can solicit additional resources by means of costly begging, solicitation will be more intense when dispersal is limited.\n\n\n\n4. We used a quantitative genetic model, including phenotypic plasticity and maternal effects, to explore how maternal effects may accelerate or slow down the rate of phenotypic evolution. Our results suggest that the relationship between fitness and phenotypic variance plays an important role. Intuitive expectations that positive maternal effects are beneficial are supported following an extreme environmental shift, but, if too strong, that shift can also generate oscillatory dynamics that overshoot the optimal phenotype. In a stable environment, negative maternal effects that slow phenotypic evolution actually minimize variance around the optimum phenotype and thus maximize population mean fitness.\n\n\n\n5. We modelled multigenerational effects on fitness and showed how, at equilibrium, negative maternal and negative grandmaternal effects maximise expected mean fitness. If, however, maternal effects are positive, negative grandmaternal effects maximise expected mean fitness. Our work elucidates the complex, often antagonistic relationship between different transgenerational contributions to phenotypic evolution.\n\n\n\n6. We investigated fitness effects by the interaction of within- and transgenerational plasticity in a quantitative genetic framework. We decomposed expected mean fitness into three components (variation penalty, adaptation, optimal plasticity) to study the fitness costs of interactions between within- and transgenerational plasticity. The optimal strength of maternal effects to minimise the variation penalty is strongly negative, but adaptation and optimal plasticity are maximised by positive maternal effects. Expected mean population fitness is highest away from the peak levels of phenotypic plasticity, particularly in slowly or rarely changing environments. Phenotypic plasticity is highest when the lag between juvenile development and adult selection is shortest.\n\n\n\n7. Using ideas from Geometric control theory we developed an analogue of the G matrix to incorporate\n\nnon-genetic effects. Using this we can describe quanititatively the impact of non-genetic effects, in constraining and directing evolution, in terms of singular values and singular vectors of an extended matrix. We find that non-genetic effects can constrain/unconstrain and change the direction of evolution.\n\n\n\n8. We assessed the evolution of multiple maternal effects in a fluctuating environment, when selection acting on one maternal character is not necessarily similar across the different maternal traits. Using individual-basedsimulations in combination with optimal control theory, we find that the sign and magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue of the maternal effects matrix M generally evolves to be aligned with the average autocorrelation across two subsequent generations. Consequently, slowly changing environments selectively favor entries of M that lead to positive eigenvalues, whereas rapidly changing environments lead to M having negative eigenvalues. When fluctuating selection acting on one character occurs with a time-lag relative to selection acting on other traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects: positive maternal effects evolve from characters in which fluctuations in selective conditions are advanced relative to other traits, while negative maternal effects evolve from characters in which fluctuations in selective conditions are delayed. Additionally, when one character experiences more noisy selective conditions relative to other traits, we find that this selects for large and positive cross-trait maternal effects from the maternal character that experiences least noise. Our results emphasize that the evolved structure of M may tell us more about experienced selective conditions than currently anticipated. As stated above, we hope that further analyses of the evolution of transgenerational effects on infant growth and body condition might help to inform healthcare practice in relation to infant nutrition We hope that we and others may extend and build on existing results, exploring specific application of our general theoretical findings to the evolution of transgenerational effects on human infant growth. We hope that these further analyses might help to inform healthcare practice in relation to infant nutrition. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
