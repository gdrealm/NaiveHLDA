{"id":"FCEAB9F9-3FE2-43FF-90BC-51A02E883D94","title":"Spatial, temporal and metabolic regulation of PI 3-kinase derived lipid signals in health and disease","abstractText":"The correct functions of our cells and tissues are controlled by a wide range of signalling molecules such as hormones and growth factors. These usually bind to receptors on the outer surface of cells and trigger the production of intracellular signals called second messengers. We study a special class of second messengers called inositol phospholipids and one in particular which is phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate or PIP3. PIP3 is the second messenger produced by insulin action and it plays an important role in controlling the amount of sugar in the blood. Failure to produce PIP3 in insulin responsive tissues after a meal is a major cause of diabetes. Cells control PIP3 levels through enzymes that make it, called PI 3-kinases, and other enzymes, called phosphatases, which destroy it. Mutations in one of the PI 3-kinases which cause its activation at the wrong time can cause cancer and occur commonly in breast and colon tumours whilst inactivating mutations in one of the phosphatases, called PTEN, cause many other tumours. We study the regulation of PI 3-kinase signalling especially focussing on the phosphatases that destroy PIP3. We collaborate with several large pharmaceutical companies who are targeting PI 3-kinase signalling to develop drugs for the treatment of cancer, type 2 diabetes and inflammatory diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G9403619","grantId":"G9403619","fundValue":"4214150","fundStart":"1994-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Peter Downes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
