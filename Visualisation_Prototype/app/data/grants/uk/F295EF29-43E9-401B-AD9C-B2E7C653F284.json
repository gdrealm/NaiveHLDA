Existing studies are mostly based on the approaches suggested by researchers in the USA, with limited - if any - cultural adaptations. Therefore, a large scale study which will explore the views of Europeans in developing an instrument that is valid in the European context is desirable. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To investigate the issue thoroughly, both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected in three European countries (ie UK, Germany and Greece). Each country belongs to a different European cluster in terms of culture. More specifically, the UK belongs to the Anglo group, Germany to the Germanic group and Greece to the Near East group.&nbsp; The project will be completed by mid 2011.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G035903/1","grantId":"ES/G035903/1","fundValue":"81395","fundStart":"2009-06-15","fundEnd":"2011-12-14","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"George  Christodoulides","coPersons":["Cleopatra  Veloutsou"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
