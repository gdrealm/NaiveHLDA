Involving a research team from Classics, Geography and Computing, Hestia produced two innovative outcomes: the understanding of geographic space in Herodotus's Histories in terms of connections between places and peoples rather than as points on a map; and the development and use of web technologies for visualising and thinking about a narrative. Hestia2 represents a deliberate shift from experimenting with geospatial analysis of a single text to making Hestia's outcomes available to new audiences through a variety of creative means: (i) a seminar series fostering knowledge exchange of Hestia's spatial analysis of a text between researchers and non-academic communities; (ii) an innovative online platform designed to enhance the experience for general enthusiasts, students and teachers of reading Herodotus and be extensible to other texts with spatial aspects; and (iii) a blog and free learning materials aimed at disseminating Hestia's resources and generating public interest.\n\nWith the digital medium rapidly transforming the ways in which information is viewed and processed, data visualisation is one of the key challenges to academic and non-academic groups alike. Cultural heritage groups, government agencies and firms working in the digital economy, all have to deal with the problem of presenting big data in ways that make sense to their users but that do not reduce the complexity of the data or give a misleading picture. Hestia2 uses the key intellectual outcome of the original project-the analysis of spatial relations embedded in literary texts-to discuss humanistic approaches to data visualisation which, by virtue of being based on real content that is complex and messy, can help contribute to this debate. In a four-part seminar series, Hestia2 considers: (i) network analysis techniques, methods and models used for data exploration; (ii) the role of GIS in mapping texts; (iii) digital visualisations of data, especially complex literary texts; and (iv) the extent to which digital technologies help non-academics access and comprehend research.\n\nTo promote wider engagement among teachers, students and general enthusiasts with the original project's re-imagining of the geography of Herodotus's Histories, Hestia2 brings together the disparate technological innovations into a cohesive, intuitive reading interface (called GapVis). This platform allows users to grasp the total distribution of place references at a glance, move through the narrative and see locations appearing and 'fading from memory', and focus on individual places including their relationships to other locations mentioned 'in the same breath'. By trialling Hestia GapVis with an experienced academic innovator, Hestia2 will ensure a robust and user-friendly reading interface fit for the enthusiast, student, teacher and researcher alike. In addition, by using the Pelagios project's index of references for places mentioned in Herodotus, users of Hestia will be able to link to and bring together different kinds of online data associated with those places, from other texts that mention them, artefacts and inscriptions found there, to digital photos of them.\n\nTo enhance dissemination of Hestia's outputs, all activity will be documented on the blog and disseminated via social media, while free learning materials will be produced to enrich the resource. The blog will promote continuous dissemination and discussion of the findings from the seminars as well as feedback about the GapVis reading interface. By documenting the work of adapting the Hestia dataset to GapVis, Hestia2 also sets down guidelines for other users, who may wish to repurpose GapVis for displaying a text of their own choice that has geospatial elements. Lastly, Hestia2 will work with the OU's OpenLearn unit to build free learning materials that provide context for reading Herodotus in GapVis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K007025/1","grantId":"AH/K007025/1","fundValue":"63896","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Tools and methods that we have developed have led to a collaboration with Google (http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/) and have been used in classrooms both at university (http://hestia.open.ac.uk/reading-herodotus-spatially-in-the-undergraduate-classroom-part-i/) and at school (http://hestia.open.ac.uk/hestia-meets-a-virginia-us-high-school-latin-class-part-i/).

Challenging the usual abstract Cartesian mapping of the ancient world, Hestia draws attention to the connections between places underpinning Herodotus's narrative. The results eschew schematic spatial distinctions in favour of conceptual model based on networks and flow. Hestia's experimental use of new technologies to visualise and analyse geospatial data in a narrative may be of use for the wider community (public agencies, high-tech industries and educationalists) interested in data visualisation, especially of geospatial concepts, and the challenge of making sense of 'messy data'.
