{"id":"E1E5BC40-4952-40CA-A74C-37D7AE346274","title":"The Implementation of EU Policy: Do Parties Matter?","abstractText":"<p>Membership of the EU entails (in addition to opportunities) obligations and duties that are carried out by the administrations of the member states. However, the implementation of EU public policy is much more than just a technical exercise. Indeed, it entails value-laden choices made by both the officials who carry out EU policy on a daily basis and their political masters (especially ministers). This project seeks to examine whether and how a change of the party in government affects the implementation of EU policy at the national level. Such a change might be consequential because parties (a) attract different groups of voters and represent varying coalitions of interests and (b) reflect distinct ideological traditions and platforms. If parties matter, then the output of that process will vary. For that purpose, the principal investigator will compare how governments of the Left and the Right behave when they implement EU policy in Britain and France, ie two countries that differ from each other in terms of the politically contentious nature of membership of the EU. The project focuses on the implementation of the working time directive (Directive 93/104).</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F026005/1","grantId":"ES/F026005/1","fundValue":"67889","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  They are part of an ongoing academic debate but they have also been used for the purposes of shedding light on the true preferences of one of the two currently ruling parties in the UK in relation to their preferences for the future of this country.

This is so because governments retain a degree of discretion (which they use) in that stage of the policy process. This research shows that who is in power matters for those who want to understand how decisions collectively made in Brussels are put into effect at the national level and this ought to shape our understanding of how the EU operates and the way in which it affects the lives of ordinary citizens across the Continent. It also contradicts those who say that membership of the EU necessarily undermines democracy at the national level.
