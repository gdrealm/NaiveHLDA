{"id":"2D6477A0-ABA6-45F0-A39A-AE93E50746A4","title":"Global chromatin interactions in post-mitotic neurons.","abstractText":"Cell division poses one of the central questions of biology, namely, how does a single cell manage to replicate and separate its entire genome ensuring that both new cells receive an exact copy of each chromosome. To do this, a specialized group of proteins, known as the cohesins, play a central role ensuring that newly replicated DNA molecules do not prematurely separate, resulting in abnormal chromosome distribution and ultimately cell death. However, recent studies have shown that cohesin proteins do more then simply hold DNA strands together. Evidence from human diseases and animal models have suggested cohesins also control gene expression in the cell. My research will focus on how cohesin proteins, with their unique ability to hold DNA molecules together, influence gene expression during cellular development and if this can be explained by their role in establishing the correct 3-dimensional organization of genes within the cell nucleus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001649","grantId":"G1001649","fundValue":"334466","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Suzana  Hadjur","coPersons":["Gary  Schroth"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
