Vitamin D is generated by exposure of the skin to sunlight. Recent public health campaigns to reduce skin exposure to sunlight have been successful in reducing the occurrence of skin cancer, but there is some concern that they have also caused low levels of vitamin D in many people. Pregnant women and children in particular are likely to have inadequate levels. Low levels of vitamin D could have detrimental effects. There is increasing evidence that individuals who have lower levels of vitamin D have higher risk factors for diabetes and heart disease, such as higher fasting blood sugar levels and higher cholesterol and blood pressure. We will examine the association of vitamin D (measured in blood samples taken from their mothers during pregnancy and themselves when aged 7-9 years) with measures of blood cholesterol, glucose and insulin and blood pressure in a large study of individuals who are now aged 17-18 years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701603","grantId":"G0701603","fundValue":"1358630","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-11-26","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Deborah Anne Lawlor","coPersons":["Naveed  Sattar","Philip  Guthrie","George  DaveySmith","Nicholas John Timpson","Jonathan  Tobias","Elina  Hypponen","William Duncan Fraser","David  Evans"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
