By providing new methods of corneal stem cell transplantation the sight of many more patients can be restored. Currently, corneal stem cell transplantation involves a lengthy pre-surgical step during which time the corneal stem cells are harvested from donor eyes then grown in a flask to increase their number prior to transplantation. This step is time consuming, technically demanding and hugely expensive as it requires highly trained surgeons/scientists and specialized laboratories. If the potential for corneal stem cell therapy is to be fully realised cost effective surgical procedures need to be developed urgently. This investigation stems from our previous work in understanding the limitations of the current corneal stem cell transplantation techniques, specifically the materials used to grow and convey the stem cells to the patient. Previously, we have quantified the nanostructure of corneal stem cell substrates and applied these measurements to the design of new biomaterials. We have since discovered a gel-based substrate that encapsulates corneal stem cells has significant advantages over current biomaterials. Therefore, to simplify corneal stem cell transplantation we will develop a gel-based stem cell delivery system that can transport and retain a relatively small number of freshly isolated corneal stem cells to the surface of the eye using a range of experimental models that are close to humans. The gel will retain the transplanted stem cells long enough for them to attach, grow and repair the damaged cornea. The gel will be over 90% water (a hydrogel) and possess a degree of flexibility very similar to the host tissue. Unlike other forms of corneal stem cell transplant the donor stem cells will not require extended periods in culture. Therefore, preparation of the transplant material will take minutes not weeks to complete and the transplanted cells will not contain animal derived growth factors or potentially dangerous unwanted cell types (both unavoidable consequences of growing stem cells outside the body). Specific small molecules that can stimulate the cells to grow may also be added to the gel aiding the replacement of xenobiotic materials.\nWe believe the application of hydrogels to the delivery of therapeutic stem cells will also be applicable to other diseased tissues (skin, bone, brain, heart) where there is a need to localise a small number of transplanted stem cells in a very precise manner.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900877","grantId":"G0900877","fundValue":"443432","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Che John Connon","coPersons":["Vitaliy V Khutoryanskiy"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
