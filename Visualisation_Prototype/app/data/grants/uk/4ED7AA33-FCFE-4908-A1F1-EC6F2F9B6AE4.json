This type of engine ingests a fresh charge of air and a quantity of gaseous fuel simultaneously to produce a lean premixed charge. This lean charge is then compressed and near the end of the compression stroke a small quantity of diesel fuel (the pilot fuel) is injected into the cylinder. After a delay period, this pilot diesel fuel then ignites and both the pilot diesel fuel and the lean mixture of gaseous fuel and air combust. By retaining a high compression ratio, thermal efficiencies similar to or higher than conventional diesel engines can be realised at high loads. The proposed work employs an existing research engine at Loughborough University, and this engine will be converted to run on dual fuel using methane as the gaseous fuel. The barrier to the current deployment of dual-fuelling in light-duty engines is a result of the higher engine speeds required for these smaller engines, which result in temporally shorter combustion events. This is a concern for dual-fuel combustion, which typically has a slower combustion than conventional diesel because of its premixed nature and relatively low flame propagation rates. This proposal aims to demonstrate that, through the use of hot exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) and multiple diesel injections, the dual-fuel combustion rate can be increased to meet the requirements of light-duty diesel engines.Currently the light duty diesel engine sector emit 35MT CO2 per year. If all light-duty diesel vehicles in the UK were converted to dual-fuel natural gas, CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 7 MT/year. For initial deployment in fleet applications, light-duty dual-fuelled vehicles would reduce CO2 emissions by 20% while reducing fuelling costs; even the cost of installing a fuel delivery system would pay-back in approximately 5 years. These impacts, once the technology has been demonstrated, should be of interest to operators of fleets of light-duty delivery vehicles as well as to major automotive companies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H050388/1","grantId":"EP/H050388/1","fundValue":"148622","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The data obtained from this study can give guidance to automotive manufactures regarding fuel injection strategies for dual fuel engines.

The main challenge at the onset of the programme was that of engine speed, i.e. reduced time for the\ncombustion phase of the natural gas in the cylinder. However, this did not materialize and the engine operated at up to\n3000rpm very well.\nThe AVL single cylinder diesel engine at Loughborough University was adapted to run as a dual fuel engine. After the\nengine was commissioned, baseline testing was undertaken and a strategy developed for dual fuel operation using single\nand split injections. For these engine tests 3 loads and 6 engine speeds were used. To allow comparison of the dual fuel\noperation to that of a stand diesel engine, the input energy was held constant for each test. This allowed the effects of dual\nfuelling to be seen more readily. Initially a single injection of diesel was to be the base case for dual fuel operation prior to\nsplit injections. However, for some of the test points the maximum rate of cylinder pressure rise was exceeded and split\ninjection operation had to be employed. Using the engine in dual fuel mode produced some excellent results in both\nperformance and fuel economy. With dual fuel combustion the natural gas burns in a slow premixed fashion and this\nextended the length of the positive power production part of the power stroke. This also reduced the overall peak cylinder\ntemperatures. To understand how smooth the engine was running a statistical analysis was employed whereby the\ncoefficient of variance of the indicated mean effective pressure (CoV IMEP) was determined. The industry standard is a\nvalue of CoV IMEP of less than 5%.\nThe main findings about split injection can be summarized below.\nAt 50% load: As the gas substitution level is increased, the cylinder pressures remain near constant and there is a\nreduction in thermal efficiency. At high substitutions and low speeds the CoV IMEP becomes unacceptable. However as\nthe engine speed is increased the CoV IMEP returns to acceptable levels. Engine emissions of soot and CO2 are\nsignificantly reduced at all speeds. The NOx emissions generally improve.\nAt 75% load: As the gas substitution levels are increased, the cylinder pressures again remain near constant as does the\nthermal efficiency. For this load condition, the CoV IMEP was significantly improved. Engine emissions of soot and CO2\nare significantly reduced at all speeds. Again the NOx emissions generally improve.\nAt 100% load: As the gas substitution levels are increased, the cylinder pressures rise as the mass of gas substituted\nPage 4 of 7 Date Saved: 23/10/2012 14:24:54\nDate Printed: 23/10/2012 14:25:22\nAdd web address :\nincreases and a there is an increase in the indicated thermal efficiency. For this load condition, the CoV IMEP was\nsignificantly improved. Engine emissions of soot and CO2 are significantly reduced at all speeds. For this load case the\nNOx emissions increase with gas substitution.\nAs the main aim of this project was the reduction of engine out CO2, the main findings are presented in tabular form below:\nSpeed Load CO2 Saving%\n1000 75% 48.9\n1000 100% 35.8\n2000 0.75% 43.6\n2000 100% 44.3\n3000 75% 33.2\n3000 100% 36.6 The fuelling strategies reported from the study have demonstrated that high speed operation of a dual fuel engine is possible. The study focused on steady state testing. Future work will be to understand transient operation of this type of engine. The work details optimum operational injection strategies that industry can employ for small bore, high speed dual fuel engines. Energy,Environment,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
