Trillions of growing cells need to end up in the right place in order to fulfil their destiny. Even in a full grown body, our cells and tissues still need to communicate, and new cells grow and migrate to repair and renew our tissues. To achieve this crucial job, the body uses signalling molecules and receptors to direct and guide cells, and to allow communication between different cells in the body. These molecules signal like traffic lights, stopping or allowing growth and cell movement.\n\nThe netrins (in particular NET-1) are a family of signalling molecules with multiple functions in human biology. They have been initially identified as crucial signals responsible for guiding axons in the developing nervous system, for which they were named after the Sanskrit word &quot;netr&quot;, which means &quot;one who guides&quot;. New research has also associated netrins to the development and maintenance of non-neural tissue, such as the vascular and muscle systems as well as mammary gland and the heart. \n\nThe importance of netrins signalling in human disease has become increasingly clear as mutations in netrins and their receptors have been linked to Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that netrin-mediated changes in synapse function may influence human neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, it has been shown that netrins are activated and serving as pro-cancer factors in various human cancers, such as pancreatic adenocarcinomas, metastatic breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and neuroblastoma. Specific disruption of netrin binding to its receptors could therefore represent an efficient anti-cancer strategy.\n\nGenetic studies have provided a broad brush-stroke understanding of these mechanisms, however much still remains to be found out about impaired netrin signalling leading to human disease. Crucially, the details (fine brush-stroke) of netrin recognition at the surface of cells and how information is transmitted into the cell are only poorly understood. This level of detail can greatly aid drug design. We aim to unravel these fundamental mechanisms by providing molecular snapshots of netrin-receptor complexes using the methods of X-ray crystallography combined with functional, biophysical and cell-based experiments. Our results will be placed in a context of neuronal systems and whole organisms via collaborations with neurobiologists to get an integrated picture and a deeper understanding. This will potentially allow the structure-guided design of new therapeutic and/or diagnostic approaches.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L017776/1","grantId":"MR/L017776/1","fundValue":"625589","fundStart":"2014-04-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  Siebold","coPersons":["Alexandru Radu Aricescu"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
