{"id":"B06E84C6-8F26-4EA0-8530-EEAF96B855AE","title":"Innovate UK InterCityAir","abstractText":"The InterCityAir project will develop a wireless sensor for the measurement of air pollution. The sensor will be integrated into urban traffic management systems in the City of Chester to reduce levels of toxic gases to which the public are being exposed.\n\nInterCityAir will directly address the following key challenges of this call, namely: The use of environmental and social data to address urban challenges, the creation of a new value proposition through integration of datasets, and an improvement in the monitoring of the urban environment through the development and deployment of an intelligent sensor system.\n\nInterCityAir will develop an air quality (AQ) sensing platform that can be integrated with the transport management systems of Cheshire West and Chester Council (CWAC). C-Tech will develop a wireless sensing unit comprising commercial sensors that could be deployed as a stand-alone system or city-wide network at low cost for remote real-time monitoring of air quality. The sensing units will be wireless enabled and suitable for road-side AQ monitoring with a view to be adapted for on-board vehicle monitoring of AQ. \n\nThis project will establish the feasibility of linking the C-Tech sensing unit with existing traffic count data and the traffic signalling system to alleviate traffic build-up and associated pollution hotspots. \n\nThe University of Chester (UOC) will deploy air quality instrumentation alongside the CWAC real-time nitrogen oxides (NOx) monitoring site in the Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) on the Boughton gyratory to gather comprehensive baseline data to understand fully the performance of the sensor package in the complex urban atmosphere. This site in the AQMA will be used as a demonstration site for the sensing platform developed by C-Tech.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N007247/1","grantId":"NE/N007247/1","fundValue":"20009","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin James Phillips","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Chester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
