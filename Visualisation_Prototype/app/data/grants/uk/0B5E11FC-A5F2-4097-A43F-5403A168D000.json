That year saw her first military adventure overseas: a controversial intervention in Sicily quickly led to full scale war with the Carthage, the major western Mediterranean power, based in north Africa. Victory in Sicily set in train the creation of an empire which by 44 B.C. controlled most of the Mediterranean and much of continental Europe. This is a familiar story, as is the flip-side: the profits and power to be gained on the stage of this vast empire corroded the consensual ethos by which the Roman aristocracy had limited its natural competitive urges. Competition for political office and military command led to political corruption aimed at a city populace of voters now unable effectively to exercise its sovereignty over the vast empire, and increasingly unrepresentative of the Roman citizen body. The populace, rural and urban, was subjected to increasing socio-economic stresses, as continual recruitment for war and the unbalancing of the economy through imperial revenues ate at the traditional fabric of politics and society. Political polarisation set in, between the champions of the status quo, the representatives (sometimes self-styled) of the popular will, and over-mighty generals. The Republic was overthrown in Civil war, and Caesar set himself up as dictator; within a few years he himself was assassinated. Further civil wars were eventually ended by the emergence of a sole victor, Augustus, who became the first emperor.\\nThis project seeks to tell another story, however. The familiar tale just told is essentially a retelling of the histories written by Greeks and Romans themselves, during and just after the events; and this has been the case since the Renaissance. This project seeks to give a voice to two other categories of evidence: Roman documents inscribed on stone, and the evidence from archaeological enquiry. Some of this material is brand new; some has been known since the Renaissance. Until now no historical narrative has allowed either voice to occupy centre-stage alongside the main protagonist, the textual material which has traditionally been the study of classicists, and has exercised a dominant role in interpretations of the late Republic for this reason. One consequence of this change of emphasis will be increased light shed on new groups of actors throughout the story. Three groups are very important here: the inhabitants of the countryside and the small towns, as opposed to the urban poor and nobility of Rome; Italians as opposed to Romans (that is the half to two-thirds of the the population of the peninsula who did not have the Roman citizenship until about 90 B.C.); and the elites and populations of other peoples subjected by Rome across the empire. With the exception of the Greeks, their explicit testimonies are few, and we are often reliant on interpretations of archaeological remains to allow them to speak. But that is not a reason for not making the effort. The end result ought to be a narrative which seeks to explain the uniqueness of the rise of Rome from an Italian viewpoint, a viewpoint with which the Romans were deeply engaged, and which influenced their own sense of who they were, and where they thought they were going. The traditional leading actor in this drama, the account based on literary sources, will not be banished from the stage, but his words will now be heard within a real dialogue: this role and those of the former supporting actors will have to take account of each other; the result ought to be a better representation, of how the growth and failure of the Roman Republic were experienced by a greater number of players, in more locations, than has previously been achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G006148/1","grantId":"AH/G006148/1","fundValue":"25781","fundStart":"2009-04-19","fundEnd":"2009-07-18","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research is still in progress, but the findings have enabled me to begin a further cycle of work on the relationships between cultural identities and exogenous power structures, first in Italy in the late Iron Age / early Hellenistic period, and currently in contributing the the debate on &quot;Romanization&quot;, where I was asked to contribute the keynote lecture at an international conference (E Pluribus Unum: I percorsi della Romanizzazione / Out of Many One: the paths of Romanization), in which I developed the theme of the importance of Roman interactions with various local groups in a Mediterranean context, and the necessity of understanding cultural stability as an important part of the narrative of change, and of examining the Roman/local interface, and what happens at that interface, as a pre-requisite for building wider models.  ","person":"Edward Henry Bispham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" The research has enabled me to understand the political development of the Roman Republic, in terms of how political problems were managed, how stresses developed within the political system, and how this political system eventually became unable to cope with internally- and externally-generated stress, which exposed its structural deficits. I have also paid attention to levels of continuity and areas of vitality and robustness in the political process. I have also explored processes of cultural change, both those caused or promoted by the expansion of the Roman Empire, and those associated with the interaction of Rome with the 'conquered' culture of the Greek East (see also this year's output). The impact on Roman identity of both processes was profound. \nThe research has also allowed me to bring to the fore, especially through integration of archaeological evidence, the agency of those outside and below the ruling Roman elite, not simply the urban poor who were involved in politics, but the inhabitants of rural Italy, the soldier-farmers on whom the demands of war and the impacts of socio-economic change fell most heavily. This giving of due weight to those with little voice in the traditional elite-generated narratives was an important objective in the project, and allows for a more nuanced and less ideologically-determined assessment of change, political, social and economic. Finally, the rise of the Republic to Empire has been assessed within its wider Mediterranean setting, as one process among many which were active in the Greek East, in the Iberian peninsula and in temperate Europe. The research did not find that these were equivalent processes, but that they interacted, and that changes elsewhere in the Mediterranean, and to a lesser extent in temperate Europe, did impact on the evolution of Roman imperial and political ambitions. On a more micro scale, the ongoing interaction of Rome with existing local groups and networks in the Mediterranean was found to be of considerable importance, and within the broader dynamics of inequalities in power, the nature of contact and negotiation at the interface between groups of difference sizes, Roman and non-Roman, was shown to be an essential ingredient in the stability of the empire, as well as in promoting exploitation and tension. My own intention remains to produce a source-book on the Roman Republic, to allow interested readers to engage for themselves in assessment of the problems and themes central to the period. The research has shown which (re)sources are the ones which are most needed for such an undertaking, and what level of commentary and editorial assistance is needed.\nI hope that those interested in the study of politics in any area or period, particularly those interested in the robustness of political systems, and the impact on them of imperial expansion, would find the work stimulating. The same applies to those interested in cultural identity, and processes of (multi-)cultural change. The findings could be applied to a range of historical societies and contexts, as an explanatory model. In my own work, which will move to address more fully the processes of cultural change in the Roman Republic and the wider Mediterranean (&quot;Romanization&quot;), the assessment of cultural interactions and identity has already led to one publication (on the relationship between endogenous and exogenous identities; see also publication outcome for this reporting cycle), and another is in progress. \nEqually, current debates in British and European politics are deeply engaged with questions both of the robustness and credibility of political institutions in the context of expansion of the state, and of the importance of identity and its relationship to political entitlement in a very mobile and dynamic Mediterranean / European world. These areas of contemporary political debate would, for example, fit very well with the focus of the research discussed here.
