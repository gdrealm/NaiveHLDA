Most people diagnosed with dementia die less than 10 years after diagnosis. In dementia, brain cells malfunction in the early stages of the disease and then start to die off. Alzheimer s disease, named after the man who described it 100 years ago, is the commonest form of dementia worldwide, and accounts for about two thirds of dementia cases. Currently, there are no medicines that slow down or cure any type of dementia. One reason for this is that only humans get dementia, so giving animals like mice a type of dementia that looks and acts like the human disease is difficult. If other animals got dementia, we would be able to study the disease in them and develop new drugs to treat the disease. To get around this problem, we have come up with a way to grow human brain cells in the lab, by turning a person s own skin cells into the brain cells that are affected by Alzheimer s disease. We ve used this to make brain cells that get a type of Alzheimer s disease, by making brain cells from people who were born with Down syndrome, the commonest cause of mental retardation in the world. Unfortunately, most adults with Down syndrome also get Alzheimer s disease, because they have an extra copy of one of the genes that can cause Alzheimer s disease. The Down syndrome brain cells get sick in the lab in a way that is very similar to what we see in the brains of people with Alzheimer s disease, but they do it in months instead of decades. When we feed the brain cells with drugs that are being developed to treat Alzheimer s disease, we stop the development of the disease. We are now using these cells to find new drugs that can slow down the disease, as a first step to going on to test them in people with Alzheimer s.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002501","grantId":"G1002501","fundValue":"711321","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frederick John Livesey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
