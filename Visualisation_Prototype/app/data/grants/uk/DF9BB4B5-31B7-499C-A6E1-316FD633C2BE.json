{"id":"DF9BB4B5-31B7-499C-A6E1-316FD633C2BE","title":"Applications of the Coupled Cluster Method in Nuclear Physics","abstractText":"All the elements heavier than iron are synthesised in some of the most violent events we know about, the explosion of supernovas. These explosions occur in such extreme circumstances that nuclei that in our world live only for incredibly short times, play a dominant role in the synthesis. One of the key current goals in experimental nuclear physics is to understand such unstable nuclei, which is a challenging process. As theorist we try to develop and apply powerful computational techniques, to find ways to describe both the outcome of the experiments, as well as other nuclei of interests. In the proposed work we shall use one such scheme to tackle mainly light nuclei, working our way up in the mass to the most interesting nuclei.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/C005899/1","grantId":"EP/C005899/1","fundValue":"277358","fundStart":"2005-09-02","fundEnd":"2009-03-01","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Niels Rene Walet","coPersons":["Raymond Francis Bishop"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
