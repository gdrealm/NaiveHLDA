{"id":"CD8657F1-C739-44A9-A6CD-4D0C2F3015BC","title":"The Future of Landscape and the Moving Image","abstractText":"The Future of Landscape and the Moving Image is a collaboration between three researchers - the geographer Doreen Massey, the cultural historian Patrick Wright, and the film-maker Patrick Keiller - that sets out to locate economic, social and political aspects of the current global predicament in the UK's landscapes. \\n\\nThe researchers will collaborate in the production of several works, each primarily identified with one of the three: Patrick Keiller will research, photograph and write a feature-length film, a document of journeys through the UK's landscape in search of images of urban and rural landscapes, and what is generally understood as 'nature', as the basis for a critical commentary, so far envisaged as a re-imagination of the UK's landscape as that of a semi-fictional near future. In parallel with this, Patrick Wright will research and write a book, a critique of past and present ideas of deep settlement, and their engagement with landscape. These will be accompanied by an essay by Doreen Massey, in which she will argue for a sense of place as open to elsewhere; for place, as she puts it, as event.\\n\\nThe project follows similar studies by members of the project team, including Patrick Keiller's films London (1994) and Robinson in Space (1997), Patrick Wright's books On Living in an Old Country (1985), A Journey through Ruins (1991), The Village that Died for England (1995/2002) and recent essays; and Doreen Massey's influential essay 'A global sense of place' (1991), her book For Space (2005) and a forthcoming book on London in the UK and the world.\\n\\nThe researchers' collaboration dates from Keiller's Robinson in Space, which was informed by Massey's essay, and its expansion as a book that included a conversation between Keiller and Wright. Doreen Massey was interviewed in Keiller's film The Dilapidated Dwelling (2000) and all three contributed to the anthology The Unknown City (MIT, 2001). All are or have been based both within and outside London. Robinson in Space investigated England's economic geography in the mid-1990s, a period characterized by a particular interpretation of the world's economy. The project proposed here is a further evolution of this mode of research, after a decade during which perceptions of the world's economy have changed, suggesting a study of the new predicament, with its many anxieties. \\n\\nThe project begins with the observation that, as people move about the world, the identification of a person or a culture with a particular place or landscape becomes more problematic. Despite this - in different ways, and in different parts of the world - people seem, increasingly, to value a sense of belonging to or being rooted in a place or landscape, especially if this is absent, in circumstances of exile or loss. The project asks if it is possible to reconcile this idea of belonging and dwelling that accommodate mobility, rather than deriving from claims to long-established settlement. It will explore the meanings and value of landscape, and of images of landscape, in terms of debates about the future of the UK's and other economies and cultures, especially the contrast found in advanced economies between increased consumption, GDP per capita etc., and much smaller in increases in wealth assessed in terms of environmental, social and cultural capital. Its overall objective is to identify, understand and document aspects of the current global predicament, and explore its possible futures.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E510566/1","grantId":"AH/E510566/1","fundValue":"299887","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2010-10-20","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  As a commentary on the UK's environmental and economic predicament.

The proposal also suggested that an economically permeable, supposedly multicultural UK might be a promising landscape in which to attempt this. \n\nThe project began by examining the idea that the early development of industrial capitalism in the UK derived partly from a relative freedom of movement not then enjoyed by the working populations of other west European nations. This led us to encounter Karl Polanyi's book The Great Transformation, just at the point that the scale of the 2007-8 banking crisis was becoming clear. Polanyi's critique of what he termed market society, and his dismissal of belief in the 'naturalness' of markets - the belief expressed in Edmund Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity (1795), and so frequently encountered in the UK's political mainstream - informed the project's exploration. A related theme arose from encounters with former sites of US military activity, which were seen as illustrative of the central role of the state, and of military power, in neoliberal economies, despite their free-market ideologies. This role became very visible with the extent of government intervention in the banking crisis. \n\nAs the project developed, we came to see dwelling (as formulated by Heidegger, or otherwise), displacement and the supposed discrepancy between them in a context of the long history of commodification of land and labour, and the environmental deterioration that continues to accompany this - in the most extreme scenario, the possible future extinction of all life on the planet. It seemed that the answer to the project's question was not to be found in some reformulation of dwelling that was easier to reconcile with everyday experience of life in present-day advanced capitalist economies, but in challenging much of the common sense that underlies such economies, including assumptions about the naturalness of markets, neo-Darwinist interpretations of evolution, and prevailing attitudes towards non-human living things. \n\nIn this way, we believe the project - the film, its elucidation in Professor Massey's essay, Professor Wright's parallel enquiries, and our discussion - advances a novel and ultimately optimistic perception of some of the most pressing problems of the period. The project's outcomes have included a DVD/Blu-Ray edition available from commercial retailers, a popular and very well-attended exhibition at Tate Britain, and a book that accompanied the latter, all of which enable the findings to be put to use by others.
