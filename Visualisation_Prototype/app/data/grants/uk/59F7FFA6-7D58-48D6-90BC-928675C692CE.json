{"id":"59F7FFA6-7D58-48D6-90BC-928675C692CE","title":"Media Talk: Key Debates in Contemporary English Broadcasting","abstractText":"The monograph builds upon my previous research in media discourse and will be published by Palgrave. It focusses on four key debates in contemporary English broadcasting authenticity, persuasion, closeness and conflict, and significantly advances extant work on broadcasting discourse in three ways:\n1. It investigates the interplay of visual, aural and verbal modes of communication;\n2. It explores tradition and emerging forms of broadcasting;\n3. It increases awareness of differences and similarities of English - language broadcaster output by analysing data from three geographical distant countries: New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113125/1","grantId":"113125/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Nuria  Lorenzo-Dus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
