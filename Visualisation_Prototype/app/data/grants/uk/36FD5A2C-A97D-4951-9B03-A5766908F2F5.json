The most important for our survey respondents are the funding shortages in the sector, including shortages in legal aid funding in both countries studied. These shortages have a series of knock-on effects including the loss of highly skilled personnel and an increased sense of competition within the sector for diminishing resources. Alongside shortages in funding, the sector is also experiencing a high degree of feelings of disconnection from organisations doing similar work, frustration and dismay at the lack of legal consistency and accountability in the area of asylum law, psychological strain such as secondary trauma that leads to high and costly staff turnover and difficulties in balancing short and long term priorities, dealing effectively with news media and using social media technologies in ways which further the work of their organisations.\n\nAsylum support groups in the US and the UK shared most of these challenges. The major differences between the two countries included differences in knowledge about and attitudes towards asylum seekers among the general public and differences in legislation within the two countries, but these differences were not enough for us to conclude that either country faces a unique set of challenges.\n\nResponses to the various challenges uncovered varied greatly between participants, sometimes uncovering fundamental disagreements between our respondents. For example, there is deep ambivalence in the sector with respect to using pro bono (ie volunteer) lawyers and interacting with the news media in order to raise the profile of groups or issues. There were also, however, a significant number of areas that respondents agree upon, which have allowed us to forge a set of recommendations:\n\nFor individual organisations:\n\no Consider how volunteers in the student, retired and client/ex-client categories can best support your organisation.\n\no Recognise that psychological strain, including secondary trauma, is a significant and costly issue and that resources invested in combating it invariably pay off long term by reducing staff turnover.\n\no Only engage with social media if it promises to meet your specific organisational objectives and does not divert resources away from your core mission.\n\nFor the general asylum support sector:\n\no Develop real and virtual meeting spaces, or forums, where organisations can stay connected, share good ideas, learn from each other and form a united voice.\n\no Explore the possibilities of closer collaboration, for example by pooling resources to access expertise in dealing with news media, using online social media effectively and combating psychological strain. There may be capacity for larger organisations to allow smaller groups to tap into their expertise in these areas eg by allowing them to consult their media and IT people, or use their counselling services.\n\nAs campaign priorities:\n\no To push for greater disclosure of judge- and court-level decisions in the UK which would allow inconsistencies in legal processes to be identified.\n\no To resist the introduction of video-linking technologies in court proceedings.\n\no To resist the use of remote detention.\n\no To resist frequent Government policy changes.
