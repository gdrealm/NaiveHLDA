If the answer turns out to be &quot;yes&quot;, all models for the dynamics and evolution of the Earth's core will have to be re-evaluated.\n\nFor over 80 years, the Earth's core has been considered to consist of an iron-nickel alloy, with a few percent of light alloying elements. The pressure range in the core is ~135","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M015181/1","grantId":"NE/M015181/1","fundValue":"669148","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2018-05-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Lidunka  Vocadlo","coPersons":["Ian George Wood","John Peter Brodholt","David  Dobson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
