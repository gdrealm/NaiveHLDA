{"id":"E5FB3782-EFAB-48A2-B46A-F394072B7E70","title":"An Edinburgh Speech Production Facility","abstractText":"The proposal is for a facility designed to record and analyse the movements of the lips, tongue, and jaw during spoken dialogue. This facility will be the first of its kind in the UK, and will be useful for applications in speech recognition and speech synthesis, as well as for developing theories of the cognitive representations and processes involved in normal and impaired speech production. The first output of the facility will be a database of recorded dialogue that will be useful for researchers interested in the relationships between speech movement and acoustics (important for speech technology applications), as well as in the particular types of pronunciations that speakers use during spontaneous dialogue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E01609X/1","grantId":"EP/E01609X/1","fundValue":"619576","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alice  Turk","coPersons":["Steve  Renals","Simon  King"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" We created a publicly available corpus of speech recordings that includes synchronized articulatory and acoustic records of speech in dialogue. Our facility is available for funded use; we offer calibration, gluing, recording, and data post-processing services. We commissioned the development of data analysis software, available through Articulate Instruments.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
