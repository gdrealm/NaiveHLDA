Why &amp; how did these sites fit into the emerging Celtic landscapes we still see today? Crannogs show a distinctly westerly distribution being absent in England, with one in Wales, but common in Scotland (400) &amp; Ireland (1500). Being under water these sites can have remarkable preservation of perishable artifacts, but because they are rarely in the path of development few have been excavated, however, many are under threat from erosion, pollution &amp; natural decay. The recent discovery of a crannog with near-perfect preservation of artefacts due to road construction at Enniskillen (Drumclay) &amp; another superbly preserved wetland village in Dumfreis &amp; Galloway (Black Loch of Murton) offer rare glimpses of their archaeological potential &amp; provides a unique opportunity for this project. Although crannogs can be found from the Scottish Islands to the SW of Ireland the central point in the distribution is the North Channel of the Irish Sea, separating Dumfreis &amp; Galloway from Antrim &amp; Down. There are many cultural links between these regions particularly in the Iron Age &amp; early Medieval Periods. Was Medieval Christian and/or noble connection founded upon earlier Iron Age cultural links &amp; is this reflected in vernacular traditions including crannog construction? In order to answer these questions &amp; explore the common lake-settlement heritage we need to know more about the chronology, longevity, intensity of use &amp; environmental context of these enigmatic sites. The fact that in both areas their construction spanned over two millennia suggests there is no single stimuli for construction, however, indications of parallel chronologies may have implications for cultural, political, symbolic &amp; environmental stimuli.\n This project takes to a new level previous research by the applicants which developed a new methodology for 'remote sensing' crannog construction &amp; inhabitation through the analysis of lake sediment cores. This involved a multi-proxy approach utilising pollen, diatoms &amp; insects which relied on the inevitable disturbance to the biology of small lakes caused by crannog construction/use. This project will go far further by applying these techniques alongside a new generation of bioarchaeological methods, particularly geochemistry, lipid biomarkers &amp; DNA metabarcoding in conjunction with archaeological excavation, landscape survey &amp; community involvement. A major limitation of previous work was that none of the crannogs remote sensed were excavated. One of the most variable aspects of crannog archaeology is longevity of use. Recent excavation at Cults Loch (SW Scotland) suggests it may have been in use for no more than half a century with construction in pulses. Whereas indications from Drumclay suggests it may have been occupied for several centuries. An allied question is the intensity of use - were they dwellings &amp; if so used seasonally, episodically or permanently? It is clear that longevity &amp; intensity are key variables but since only a few crannogs will ever be excavated we need additional estimates from unexcavated crannogs. Site ages will be established using 14C AMS dating from lake cores, volcanic ash &amp; tree-ring counts. Improvements in crannog dating each side of the Irish Sea will have important implications for understanding the stimuli for crannog construction since correlation may relate to common environmental conditions, especially under the unstable climatic conditions of the later prehistory &amp; the sixth century AD. Although primarily a survey &amp; environmental project, material culture will be compared as part of the survey element &amp; partnership with excavations. Material culture from structures to portable artefacts are invaluable for understanding the cultural context of crannog use from agricultural implements to religious items.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M005259/1","grantId":"AH/M005259/1","fundValue":"704016","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"A G  Brown","coPersons":["Andrew Charles Henderson","Finbar  McCormick","Nicola Jane Whitehouse","Peter  Langdon"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
