From all possible sources of variability the statistical variability introduced by the discreteness of charge and granularity of matter in transistors with features already of molecular dimensions is the most problematic of all. In conjunction with the statistical variability the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and/or hot carrier degradation can result in acute statistical reliability problems. It is widely recognized that both technology computer aided design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) tools lack the essential capabilities to predict and compass the increasing variability and reliability problems in the technology and circuit design process. This deficiency, and the corresponding tool development needs, were highlighted in the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) of the European Nanotechnology Platform ENIAC and in the ENIAC Joint Undertaking Multi-Annual Strategic Plan. It was prioritized in the first 2008 ENIAC call for proposals and the corresponding 2008 ENIAC Annual Work Programme. The European semiconductor and design industry, research institutes and selected academia based research groups have reacted swiftly to the ENIAC call putting together a powerful consortium to address the SP7 priorities. The DMG at Glasgow, which is a world leader in the simulation and forecasting of statistical variability, has been invited as a key partner in the corresponding ENIAC MODERN proposal. This proposal is part of the funding package designed to support the DMG participation in ENIAC MODERN and includes funding from ENIAC, EPSRC and Scottish Enterprise. This will affirm the UK's leadership position in this field but more importantly will make available the associated knowledge, expertise and simulation tools to the vibrant UK CMOS device and design communities and will give a competitive advantage to the vibrant UK design industry. It will also train experts at the interface between technology, devices and design which are much needed in the UK chiples and fables design companies like ARM, CSR, Wofson Microelectronics and the numerous UK SMEs with chip design activities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G04130X/1","grantId":"EP/G04130X/1","fundValue":"716387","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Asen Mihailov Asenov","coPersons":["Scott  Roy"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
