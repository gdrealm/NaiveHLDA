Atomic force microscopy allows visualisation of living cells and systems without labels, in real time, with good spatial and temporal resolution. However a drawback of this technology, in order for it to be widely applicable to be used in high-throughput and for study of dynamics, is the time taken for image capture. We are at the forefront of development of VideoAFM, which will increase the speed of imaging by 1000 fold. This will revolutionise the use of the technology in many biological applications. This unique project will fully integrate technology development with addressing real biological problems in the area of microbial cell surfaces. In particular we will examine the surface properties of the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which allow it to interact so successfully with its human host. A direct collaboration between the investigators and a commercial manufacturer of the technology will allow practical outcomes to be converted into real products within a short timespan. Thus the project will overcome existing limitations to give a widely useful technology for biological science, which will be exemplified by the applications carried out during the project.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001378/1","grantId":"BB/E001378/1","fundValue":"461138","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Hobbs","coPersons":["Simon J.
