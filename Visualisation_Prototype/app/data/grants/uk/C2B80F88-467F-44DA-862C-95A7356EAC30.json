Additionally, TEM and x-ray/neutron diffraction work will be carried out in order to investigate dislocation structures established and whether particular forms develop during non-proportional straining. The non-proportional 'Nakajima' tests will be carried out on two materials; namely, a conventional 'forming grade' steel and a high strength steel for which currently, formability is a problem. 3D representative volume elements, RVEs, with appropriate periodic boundary conditions will enable texture development, non-proportionality of straining and localisation and necking to be studied and direct comparisons may be made with the experimental data. The key features of the crystal slip model - the form of the evolution of statistically stored dislocations, the development of geometrically necessary dislocations due to plastic strain gradients, and the establishment of dislocation structures - can be refined by use of the TEM and the experimental localisation results. Once established and validated, the RVE technique becomes powerful and enables parametric studies of the effects of non-proportionality to be carried out in a way that is simply impossible with an equivalent experimental programme.The computational models will naturally take into account the full range of length scales that occur in this problem: at the dislocation and grain levels as well as length scales related to the formation of the localized band of deformation. The resulting simulations will be used to guide the development of simplified models based on the Marciniak and Kuczynski approach. This will be undertaken at a number of different levels to aid the development of tools that can be readily used within an industrial environment. Also the full range of simulations will be used to aid the development of design rules which account for non-proportional loading and which can be used to guide the initial development of a processing route.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I021043/2","grantId":"EP/I021043/2","fundValue":"384427","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Fionn Patrick Dunne","coPersons":["Richard Ian Todd","Angus J Wilkinson","Alan Charles Cocks"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
