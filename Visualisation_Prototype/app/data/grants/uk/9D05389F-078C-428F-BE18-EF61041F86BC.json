While there is strong evidence that these disorders are genetic in origin, the genes responsible are in almost all cases unknown. Rett Syndrome belongs to the autism family because affected individuals show late onset symptoms including repetitive hand movements, lack of speech and mental retardation. Rett is exceptional, however, because we know that the root cause is virtually always due to mutation of a known gene: MECP2. Mice that have the same mutation show symptoms very similar to Rett Syndrome, permitting us to study the disease in depth. We made the surprising finding last year that mice with advanced Rett-like symptoms could be rescued by switching on the MECP2 gene. In other words Rett Syndrome, in mice at least, is highly reversible. Here we wish to build on that study by applying sensitive tests for many aspects of brain function. Using these tests will be able to see how reversible each Rett-like symptom is and to find out which region of the brain is responsible. By mapping symptoms onto the brain in this way, we hope to set the stage for targeted therapies that may treat specific defects in Rett and perhaps related autistic conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800401","grantId":"G0800401","fundValue":"1481100","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Adrian  Bird","coPersons":["Stuart  Cobb","Leanne Campbell  McKay","Jim  Selfridge","Gernot  Riedel"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
