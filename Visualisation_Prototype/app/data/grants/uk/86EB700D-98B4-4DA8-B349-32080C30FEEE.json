Bone formation strategies, although attractive, have yet to yield functional and mechanically competent bone. Bone tissue engineering has been heralded as the alternative strategy to regenerate bone. Understanding how cells function and form matrix, and the fabrication of materials to provide appropriate scaffolding conducive to cell attachment and maintenance of cell function, are central to improving existing protocols. The use of mathematical models to predict skeletal cell behaviour and activity during tissue formation has tremendous potential to enhance understanding of tissue regeneration and ultimately to improve clinical outcomes. We therefore propose a multidisciplinary approach to examine the potential of predictive mathematical modelling to further understanding of bone tissue growth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D001668/1","grantId":"BB/D001668/1","fundValue":"252060","fundStart":"2006-01-09","fundEnd":"2009-04-08","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Oreffo","coPersons":["Mark  Taylor"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
