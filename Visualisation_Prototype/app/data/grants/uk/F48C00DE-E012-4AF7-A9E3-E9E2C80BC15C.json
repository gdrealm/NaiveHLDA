Web-delivered interventions to help people change their behaviour have the potential to cost-effectively provide 24/7 personalised support for management of health. The LifeGuide research programme impacts on people who create interventions, opening up access and improving the efficiency and productivity of researchers. It also impacts on the wider public, who benefit directly from using the wide range of LifeGuide interventions that are being created, which will be rolled out for population use after successful trialling.\n\nIn the five years since we released the first beta version of LifeGuide, already around 30,000 participants in our trials in the UK and across the EU have used interventions that we have developed with LifeGuide to help them manage a wide range of health problems, and our early findings indicate that these interventions have been beneficial. We have already been funded to develop and evaluate public health and illness management interventions for the following health problems: weight management and weight loss maintenance; smoking cessation; hand hygiene (to reduce the transmission of infection in the home, especially during a pandemic); self-care for colds and flu (to reduce unnecessary consulting in primary care); support for home-based stroke rehabilitation; coping with cancer-related fatigue ; reducing antibiotic prescribing to combat the growth of antimicrobial resistance; online support for users of exercise referral schemes; cognitive-behavioural therapy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome ; self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure in primary care; support for parents to manage their child's eczema. We are also currently funded to investigate the best ways to improve health literacy in diabetes across Europe, and to develop interventions for managing back pain, home-based rehabilitation for dizziness, and mindfulness techniques for stress management.\n\nOur positive early quantitative trial findings have been accompanied by accounts by some users of life-changing impact; one user of our weight management intervention spontaneously reported that 'With POWER I realised I didn't need my old ways of thinking. I was thinking in a different way, and to my surprise I was getting results. I learnt to focus and analyse situations, understand how I usually react to them and think of alternative ways to react so I can achieve my goals. So I started applying that in other parts of my life. Now at the end of the sessions, I've lost 9kg and 1-2 dress sizes, I don't feel depressed, I've learnt how to deal with my stress, my family are much happier and healthier, I've motivated other people to lose weight, and I am much more confident that I can maintain and continue my weight loss and my happiness.'. Another positive real-life account of a LifeGuide website is contained in an NCSCT quarterly report, which states that 'The NCSCT website continues to be at the core of our communication and engagement functions and is being continuously updated and improved. From the website going live on 25 June 2009 to date (31 March 2011) there have been a total of 22,998 site visits.' \nIn addition to the benefits to the members of the community using these interventions, using LifeGuide for intervention development has resulted in savings to the funders and developers of these interventions, because the websites and software resources employed to develop them can be flexibly reused. These beneficiaries include National Institute for Health Research, the EPSRC and MRC, EC and medical charities (e.g. MacMillan). Many more members of the public are likely to have benefited from the interventions developed by other teams using LifeGuide. \nAlthough we will not roll out our interventions widely until they have been proven effective in substantial clinical trials, we are already carrying out large trials of implementing our interventions in real-life contexts. For example: at the invitation of NHS Redcar and Cleveland we are making our interventions available to the community in the North East of England through the public health team and their workplace health improvement schemes (several thousand people have enrolled); our GP training to reduce antibiotic prescribing is being disseminated in Belgium as part of their national antibiotic campaign, through their GP further education website; as part of the Wessex Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care we are disseminating three of our interventions throughout the Wessex region; we are working with the MoD to make modified versions of our weight management available to naval and army personnel.\n\nThere are reasons for expecting the impact of the LifeGuide project to continue to grow considerably over the next few years. With regard to the impact of our interventions, LifeGuide interventions can contribute to meeting the NHS QIPP agenda to achieve increased efficiency gains despite the growing demand created by an ageing population, by enabling literally millions of individuals to self-manage their health when appropriate. In our current LifeGuide projects and proposals we are therefore further consolidating our links with public sector (NHS, Public Health England), private sector (e.g. Omron Healthcare) and third sector organisations (e.g. Asthma UK, Blood Pressure UK) that are in a position to exploit our interventions, and we will be actively working towards implementation of successful interventions. With regard, to the impact of our software, the open source model we have adopted for our software development should facilitate its uptake and continued development by other users. Researchers at the University of Dundee have already developed a user interface for LifeGuide which makes intervention building easier for novice users, and we are in discussions with other centres in the UK and US that wish to develop and sustain the software. LifeGuide has been designed to be flexible enough to be used to support any positive behaviour change, for example in education, management, or energy consumption, and we will explore opportunities for its use in other sectors than healthcare.

With the ESRC funding, we developed a unique set of open source software tools, the 'LifeGuide', that allows intervention designers with no experience of programming to create interactive web-based interventions to support healthy behaviour. Using this software platform, our team has attracted further funding to develop and successfully trial numerous health-related interventions for PC, tablet and smart phone. Our interventions are now being disseminated in the UK and internationally by the NHS, public health teams and education websites for health professionals. Our software has been widely disseminated through workshops, papers and presentations and is now being used independently by researchers worldwide. Our accumulated experience of creating numerous interventions has enabled us to also develop a distinctive 'person-based' approach to effective intervention development which we are now disseminating to the e-health research community.\nOur research programme\no In the past 5 years, research collaborations with our team to develop and trial web-based interventions using LifeGuide have attracted funding of well over ?20 million (from MRC, EPSRC, NIHR, EC and medical charities). \no Our first intervention to be fully trialled (INTRO) was created and modified for use in 5 countries in less than a year, substantially reduced antibiotic prescribing rates in UK, Spain, Poland, Belgium and the Netherlands, and was published in the Lancet\no Our second intervention, developed to combat the spread of infection in the next influenza pandemic, has been successfully trialled in 20,000 people (paper submitted)\no We have already published well over 20 development papers and reports of feasibility and community trials based on this research programme; numerous further major papers will be forthcoming as our trials are completed. Our first published paper (Webb et al., 2010) has been cited 235 times to date.\no The LifeGuide team were awarded ?1.5 million further funding by the EPSRC under the call for Promoting Cross-Disciplinary Research, for a programme of work ('UBhave') that is building on LifeGuide, extending the LifeGuide intervention software for delivery by mobile phones, enhanced by input from sensing. \n\nOur support for intervention designers\no The LifeGuide Community website now has around 2000 members worldwide, and the LifeGuide software has been downloaded over 1000 times. \no Numerous researchers (including postgraduate students) in the UK and internationally have independently created interventions that we are hosting on our server, and other teams are creating interventions that they are hosting themselves.\no Our web-based 'LifeGuide Community' resources support intervention designers by providing the software for free download, together with wikis, demos and facilities for all members of research teams to comment on every page of the intervention during development (see https://www.lifeguideonline.org/)\no The UBhave research programme (see above) has provided funding to continue the programme of activities (including meetings, workshops, symposia, visits, web-based resources) to build an interdisciplinary science and research community engaged in creating and evaluating digitally supported interventions We anticipate that the LifeGuide programme of research will continue to grow substantially in academic impact. We receive numerous invitations to collaborate in research projects that utilise the LifeGuide software and our intervention expertise for novel applications, and expect this field of activity to continue to expand. These activities allow us to continue to refine and share our expertise in developing engaging and effective digital interventions, and to adapt these skills to changes in technology (e.g. usage of mobile platforms with sensing capabilities). The interdisciplinary LifeGuide community that we have created continues to grow and consolidate, and we are forming collaborations that will promote the long-term sustainability of the community by establishing additional centres of expertise and support for LifeGuide use. In terms of non-academic impact, now that the trials of our earliest interventions are being successfully completed we are moving into a phase of disseminating our interventions to patients, clinicians and the general public throughout the UK and internationally. To do this, we are very actively exploring a variety of routes and partnerships, including working with Public Health England, third sector organisations, health professional education providers, commercial partners, international collaborations and by setting up or joining social enterprise initiatives.
