{"id":"3C1912D2-A2DF-40DF-92B5-4BF7C0628BB6","title":"ClearfLo: Clean Air for London","abstractText":"Poor air quality, particularly in urban areas, has a demonstrable effect on human health, but the processes responsible for producing the main pollutants, namely particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and heat are not well understood and are poorly predicted. The ambition of ClearfLo is to provide integrated measurements of the meteorology, composition and particulate loading of London's urban atmosphere, made at street level and at elevated sites, complemented by modelling, to improve predictive capability for air quality. This ambition will be addressed by establishing new measurement capabilities in London, which will be used for long-term measurements and intensive observation periods, and by analysis and modelling of the measurements to establish key processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H003142/1","grantId":"NE/H003142/1","fundValue":"156498","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Please see response from NE/H003142/1 Lead RO: University of Reading Environment Policy & public services","person":"William  Bloss","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":" Please see response from NE/H003142/1 Lead RO: University of Reading Please see response from NE/H003142/1 Lead RO: University of Reading Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
