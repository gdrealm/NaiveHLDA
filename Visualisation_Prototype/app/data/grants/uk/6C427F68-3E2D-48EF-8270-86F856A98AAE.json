{"id":"6C427F68-3E2D-48EF-8270-86F856A98AAE","title":"Human monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and prevention of hepatitis C virus infection","abstractText":"Chronic Hepatitis C virus is a blood-borne infection that can result in development of very serious liver disease. The most severe forms of liver disease can only be treated by liver transplantation. Re-infection of the transplanted liver is often rapid and current treatments are ineffective in this group of patients. Alternative therapies are sought, particularly for this group of patients. Therefore, we will isolate human monoclonal antibodies from individuals who have naturally cleared virus. These antibodies will provide important lead therapies to prevent transplant re-infection and will also provide important information that will help vaccine design. An important aspect of this work will be to study how the virus changes during infection, so that those antibodies that target the widest range of virus strains are identified.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801169","grantId":"G0801169","fundValue":"538878","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Kelvin Ball","coPersons":["William  Irving","Lindy  Durrant"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
