{"id":"DA0D3B76-BC1E-4CAE-B015-6960F6066E9D","title":"2010 Grant Balance - University of St Andrews","abstractText":"The University will use the Unspent Balance funding to support two University Rising Star Fellowships (RSFs) each of 6 months duration to be held from 1st October 2011 to 31st March 2012 in an EPSRC thematic area within the University's Schools of Physics &amp; Astronomy, Chemistry, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Computer Science, Geography &amp; Geoscience or Psychology. \n\nThe RSFs will be awarded competitively to existing Post-Doctoral Research Assistants &amp; Fellows with the objective that they use the time and money to lay the foundations for an independent research career. The 6 month project will provide the opportunity for the Fellow to undertake a pilot project in St Andrews in advance of their applying for independent research funding in their chosen topic.\n\nThe RSFs may only be held in St Andrews and successful applicants will be employees of the University of St Andrews for the duration of their Fellowship. Applicants must be existing PDRAs or PDRFs and must have agreed with a current St Andrews PI that their independent work may be hosted in that PI's laboratory or research group.\n\nThe pilot project proposed by potential RSFs must address an identified need, be novel and covered under the remit of the EPSRC's themes; ideally the project should be directed at providing basic data and/or results from which a new independent grant application could be submitted by the UCDF. We are encouraged by the level of interest among young researchers in the University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J014745/1","grantId":"EP/J014745/1","fundValue":"83851","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Hawkesworth","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
