We will do this using a Consortium of eight of the leading members of the UK's Distributed Institute for Atmospheric Composition, utilising the UK's Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement's BAe 146 research aircraft, the resources of the UK's University Facility for Atmospheric Measurements, the Malaysian Meteorological Service's Global Atmospheric Watch station at Bukit Atur, Sabah, Malaysia, and the Royal Society of London-supported Danum Valley Field Centre. We will bring significant added-value to NERC resources by the active participation of international collaborators.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/D001900/1","grantId":"NE/D001900/1","fundValue":"165748","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Nicholas Hewitt","coPersons":["David  Fowler","Brian Matthew Davison","Eiko  Nemitz","Hugh  Coe","Claire  Reeves","Nicola  Carslaw","Lucy Jane Carpenter","Mathew John Evans","Nick A Chappell","John Maurice Plane","Paul Steven Monks","Martin William Gallagher","John Adrian  Pyle","Brian James Bandy","David  Oram","Hans Friedrich Graf","A.
