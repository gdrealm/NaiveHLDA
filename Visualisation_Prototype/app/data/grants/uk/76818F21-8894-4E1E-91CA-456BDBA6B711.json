{"id":"76818F21-8894-4E1E-91CA-456BDBA6B711","title":"New Multi-Component Reactions For Array Synthesis","abstractText":"The project will develop new methods for so-called Multi-Component Reactions which will be able to generate arrays of amines and sulfonamides with a stereogenic (handed) centre next to the nitrogen functionality with complete control over each and every group attached to the nitrogen and the adjacent stereogenic carbon. The method will bring together up to six components in one reaction vessel to give single products in a predictable and controlled manner. By varying the six components any one of a huge number of potential chiral amines can be accessed, therefore allowing medicinal chemists easy access to either large numbers of chiral amines or specific sub-sets of chiral amines with ease and accuracy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F068352/1","grantId":"EP/F068352/1","fundValue":"305871","fundStart":"2008-06-01","fundEnd":"2011-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A number of chiral amines were made for GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology ","person":"Robert Andrew Stockman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" We discovered a general, one-pot synthesis of chiral amines which does not require chromatography.
