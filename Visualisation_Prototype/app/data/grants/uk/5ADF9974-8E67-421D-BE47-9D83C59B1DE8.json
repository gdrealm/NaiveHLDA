{"id":"5ADF9974-8E67-421D-BE47-9D83C59B1DE8","title":"Faiths and Civil Society","abstractText":"<p>The UK government has come to regard faith communities as potentially key contributors to civil society for three main reasons: because they are potential service providers; sources of community cohesion; and in terms of the prevention of extremism. But their role is subject to debates and contests which are currently largely unaddressed in the policy context. These are associated with practices, methods and conceptual dilemmas about meanings and definitions. </p>\n\n<p>Whilst a number of academics are interested and active in the area of faiths and civil society this work has largely been fragmented across disciplines, interests, faiths and institutions. This seminar series seeks to draw together and organise the work as an identifiable, disseminated and strongly networked area of research. It has three key approaches: first, to identify and critically discuss these debates and contests; second, to initiate and conduct projects of research to address them; and third, in doing so, to build up a coordinated network of academics from a variety of disciplines and faith perspectives (including people of no faith) to pursue this agenda systematically and in dialogue.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4257","grantId":"RES-451-25-4257","fundValue":"13874","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The network grant established a core group of researchers, policy makers and practitioners across a range of disciplines and professions, with a working interest in public faith in common.
