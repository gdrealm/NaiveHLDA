{"id":"6BC54F0F-4329-4AA2-93D8-DF326F38D527","title":"The early development and formal definition of the Ionic capital","abstractText":"Until the Classical period there were two predominant kinds of architectural expression in Ancient Greece, the Doric and Ionic modes of design we know as the orders. The Ionic capital, with its elaborate spiralling volutes, is by far the most complex part of this vocabulary. This project will create three-dimensional virtual models of key examples, and through their analysis together with archaeological inquiry will arrive at an understanding of the motivations and considerations that guided its early development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119412/1","grantId":"119412/1","fundValue":"99468","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark  Wilson Jones","coPersons":["Paul Nicholas Richens"],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
