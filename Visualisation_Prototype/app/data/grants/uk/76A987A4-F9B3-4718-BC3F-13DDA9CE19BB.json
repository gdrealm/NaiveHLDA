It is the first prototype of such a LH Cogen system for utilising of low grade heat from processing industries and solar heat to generate power and cooling. A linear expander has also been developed and tested using compressed air. A computational model has developed to predict the outcomes and efficiency of the LH Cogen system. The system developed may be used in domestic environments or scaled up to be utilised in processing industries. Food and other processing industries such as breweries; domestic applications driven by the waste heat from chemneys or solar heat. Education,Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
