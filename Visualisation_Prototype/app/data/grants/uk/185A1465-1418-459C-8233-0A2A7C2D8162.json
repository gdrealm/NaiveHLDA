Unfortunately, it is limited by the diffraction limit of light, which only allows visualisation of structures ~10x the size of individual molecules. However, when a cell responds to environmental signals (e.g. growth factor response, immune response, differentiation), essential decisions depend on the interaction of single or few molecules. Electron microscopy is able to look at individual molecules, but requires extensive fixation and staining protocols incompatible with living cells. Recently, new imaging techniques have been developed that circumvent the diffraction limit of light: They all take advantage of the fact the diffraction limits the size of structures that can be resolved, but much smaller structures can be imaged as long as they emit enough light. One powerful method is localisation microscopy, which achieves this by sequentially imaging single (or few) molecules - sufficiently spaced from each other - which are then switched off. The localisation of these molecules can then be determined with high precision, and from many (10,000-30,000) frames, a high-resolution image can be constructed. This method offers theoretically unlimited (and practically ~10-fold) resolution, but is limited to 2D or small 3D volumes and is slow, so only suited for fixed or slow-moving live samples. We therefore want to combine it with another method which allows full 3D super-resolution at high speed: Illuminating the sample with a grid pattern will result in an interference pattern from the low frequency (large scale) of the illumination pattern and the high frequency (small scale) of the sub-resolution structures in the sample. From the known structure / frequency of the grid pattern, the unknown structure of sub-resolution structures can be mathematically calculated. This method is fast and works in full 3D, but is limited in its resolution to 2x the normal resolution.\n In the current proposal, we propose to install a new, fully automated instrument combining both methods, thus allowing high-resolution, full-3D, fast imaging of fixed and live samples with multiple fluorescent labels. Success of these methods depends critically on sample preparation, of which we have years of experience in the light microscopy facility of Imperial College [FILM], based on a simple, manual super-resolution microscope. The results also critically depend on the correct processing and interpretation of the data, as well as handling of huge amounts of image data. We therefore propose to extend our existing image data workflow around the OMERO open-source image database and use it as the central hub for super-resolution data, from which the raw data are sent off for processing and the results written back and linked to the original data, allowing efficient, central processing, easy comparison of multiple settings and algorithms and full documentation. Eventually, published data including raw data will also be made available through OMERO.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L015129/1","grantId":"BB/L015129/1","fundValue":"731582","fundStart":"2014-01-31","fundEnd":"2015-01-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The grant was for a piece of equipment - a superresolution microscope.
