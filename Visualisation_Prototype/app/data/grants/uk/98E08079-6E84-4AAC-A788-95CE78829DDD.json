{"id":"98E08079-6E84-4AAC-A788-95CE78829DDD","title":"Power and Predictive Success in Revealed Preference Tests","abstractText":"<p>Revealed preference arguments lie at the heart of microeconomics. Given a set of outcomes, be they the basket of foods purchased by a household or the fleet of cars produced by General Motors, economists assume that choices are the result of optimising behaviour. This has implications for observed behaviour that can be tested where suitable data is available. </p>\n\n<p>Revealed preference (RP) theory offers an elegant method of testing for optimising behaviour without the need to assume a functional form for preferences. In essence RP theory rules out certain combinations of choices co-existing. Generally RP tests find that economic theory performs reasonably well. But is this a triumph of economics, or a warning that RP tests are undemanding?</p>\n\n<p>Under certain data arrangements passing an RP test is somewhat like hitting an unmissable target; passing the test offers no support for economic theory. It would therefore be useful to have a way to report the results of RP tests that accounted for this lack of support. This research project proposes developing just such a measure using the notion of predictive success proposed by Selten and Krischker (1983) and Selten (1991) for use in evaluating the outcomes of game theory experiments.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3770","grantId":"RES-000-22-3770","fundValue":"73710","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Laura Emily Blow","coPersons":["Timothy Kenneth Beatty","Ian  Crawford"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
