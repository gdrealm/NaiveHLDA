{"id":"D247C53E-DB4C-4349-A256-57D3D892950D","title":"Easy Expression of Authorisation Policies","abstractText":"The primary purpose of this 20 month long project is to allow Grid managers to be able to specify the authorisation policy for access to their Grid computing resources through the use of controlled natural language. The policy tool will parse the policy, interpret it, and store it in its own internal representation, using a model and ontology developed at the start of the research. The policy tool will prompt the manager to clarify any unclear terms (e.g. what is Fred? Is it a filename or a username?), resolve any ambiguities, and once this has been done will print the policy out in similar natural language, using wording as near to the original input language as possible. This will allow the manager to see if the computer has fully understood his policy, but if not, the manager will need to edit his policy and resubmit it, until the computer's version is identical in meaning to his own. Finally, the tool will compile the policy into two existing XML authorization policy languages (XACML and PERMIS) so that the policy can be automatically fed into existing Grid authorization engines (policy decision points). In this way, we can be assured that the policy that is implemented is the one that the manager intended it to be.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D052181/1","grantId":"EP/D052181/1","fundValue":"109383","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Walter Chadwick","coPersons":["Martina Angela  Sasse"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" The project achieved its original objective of building a natural language policy creating interface, but only for very basic authorisation policies. This is because it is a much greater and more complex task than originally envisaged to build generic authorisation policies with complex clauses such as conditions, separation of duties, delegation of authority etc. This was a relatively small project over a short duration (20 months). Consequently the original objectives are still valid and achievable, but only in a project that is an order of magnitude greater than this one. The software is application and sector independent so can be used by any sector of the economy. Any organisation that wishes to create a natural language interface for creating basic authorisation policies, can use this software The researchers at the University of Kent made the sofware and documentation publicly available as part of the PERMIS open source software suite. It gets hundreds of downloads per year.\n\n\n\nThe researchers at Kent were able to continue this research under a follow on EC FP7 integrated project called TAS3. Kent and Sheffield put in another research bid to EPSRC to continue the current research, but this was not funded. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
