{"id":"781C4C4E-9FC1-4F8B-9C82-FBFBB8F9B6C4","title":"A Study of Iranians' Driving Habits","abstractText":"<p>Iran has the highest rates of road traffic accidents (RTAs) worldwide. Although the high levels of RTAs in Iran are new and reflective of the changing character of Iranian society, the habit of reckless driving is not. Thus, the problem of RTAs are studied not only in the context of the existing driving laws, traffic regulations, car and road safety, but also in a historical context, which reflects the interplay between the Iranian cultural identity, sense of individuality and community, on the one hand, and the Iranianâ€™s perception of law and order, on the other.</p>\n\n<p>This study will explore driving habits as a social activity, with legal and cultural dimensions reflective of how a group of people interact with each other at the micro level and with society at large to create a form of social order. The empirical part of this project will be based on open interviews with ordinary Iranians, traffic officers, lawyers, taxi drivers, the representatives of the Iranian car industry and traffic researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The interviews will aim at describing how Iranians perceive, experience and conceptualise their driving habits and how they view the recent attempts to improve the traffic and driving behaviour by introducing severe penalties.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J002062/1","grantId":"ES/J002062/1","fundValue":"79858","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Reza  Banakar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
