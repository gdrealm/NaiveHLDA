Itâ€™s economic growth, however, has not been inclusive. The trickle down effects of growth have been negligible for vast swathes of India's population, most of whom live in the countryside. The demographics of the poor are starkly socially marked. Economists tell us that India's Dalit and Adivasi communities, who account for almost 25 per cent of the country's population and were historically seen as 'untouchable' and 'savage', suffer from disproportionate levels of poverty, remaining worse off than other groups almost everywhere across the country. But econometric analysis is unable to tell us how and why this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This project uses historically situated ethnographic studies to analyse the consequences of rural political and economic transformation on Dalit and Adivasi lives across a number of settings in some of the most under-researched parts of the subcontinent. This project thus seeks to explore the ethnic dimensions of poverty: the processes through which Dalits and Adivasis continue to be disproportionately poor despite Indian economic growth.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K002341/1","grantId":"ES/K002341/1","fundValue":"1011390","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alpa  Shah","coPersons":["Barbara  Harriss-White","Jonathan Patrick Parry","Jens  Lerche","Clarinda  Still"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
