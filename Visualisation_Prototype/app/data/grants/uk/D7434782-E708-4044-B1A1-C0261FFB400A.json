Through them the imprint of medieval religion continues to be made visible. Equally valued are the surviving manuscripts, artefacts and music of medieval worship. However, we are rarely able to connect the buildings with the texts, artefacts and music, or comprehend how they were first used in rituals.\\n\\nThis project makes that connection by investigating the experience of medieval worship in the cathedrals and churches for which it was intended through re-enactments of rituals. With the input and synthesis of knowledge and skills from different disciplines, scholarly and applied, we shall transform medieval texts, spaces and objects into the complicated, gestural and highly sensory experience of medieval worship - engaging sight, sound, smell and touch. Through live encounters, audio-visual recordings, publications, and online resources and interpretation, we will enable specialist and non-specialist, Christian and non-Christian, to engage with the buildings, and to understand their nature, function, ordering and use.\\n\\nWorship affected and involved every level of medieval society, yet we still know little about how exactly it was conducted and experienced. Only through re-enactment is it possible to analyse and evaluate the experiences of the distinct social groups engaged with that worship: clergy, assistants, musicians and lay people. So far as we can, we have to strip off post-medieval and post-Christian assumptions, and take account of the spirituality of the time. Such practice-led investigation has to be rooted in scholarly research of the texts to establish the content and conduct of the rituals, and of the architectural, social, cultural and religious contexts in which they were used.\\n\\nThe research falls into three phases: (a) investigation of norms of general ritual practice and local adaptation, issues of musical performance practice, ritual analysis of buildings, and religious, social and cultural context; (b) preparation of editions, reconstruction of artefacts, and direction of the historical re-enactments; (c) observation, analysis and interpretation of the experience of the re-enactments, testing the validity of such an applied research process for historical understanding and assessing its transferability to other manifestations of religion and its social context. This involves a research team and supporting research group with expertise in liturgy, musicology, architectural, social, cultural and church history, ethnomusicology, practical theology, and anthropology and sociology of religion - as well as clergy, musicians and craftspeople.\\n\\nThe re-enactments of the rituals will be set in two contrasting medieval buildings: the great cathedral of Salisbury, a building specifically shaped and designed for these rituals; and the modest parish church of St Teilo reconstructed as it was in about 1520 at St Fagans: National History Museum of Wales - one of thousands of churches to which Salisbury rituals were adapted. Salisbury offers the original ritual space (albeit partly changed), clergy and musical resource, an education team and visitor outreach. St Teilo's provides a newly reconstructed medieval interior, museum staff engaged in study and interpretation of earlier buildings and their social context, education and outreach. Both settings enable public access to the re-enactments.\\n\\nRecent isolated and partial re-enactments of medieval worship have proved revealing, but this project can be far more systematic, comprehensive and of long-lasting value, generating edited texts, audio-visual recordings, and scholarly interpretation and contextualisation of the experience. It will provide a template for future research. The outcomes will be disseminated among scholars, educators and students, to church and charitable bodies who use andcare for medieval catherdals and churches, those who fund their upkeep, and the wider public.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H017445/1","grantId":"AH/H017445/1","fundValue":"385534","fundStart":"2009-12-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Elements of impact were built into the research project design. Two institutions worked as partners from the outset: Salisbury Cathedral and St Fagans National History Museum, Wales. \n\nSalisbury Cathedral, the influential centre of medieval worship in Britain in the late Middle Ages, provided a great medieval cathedral building for three enactments of medieval liturgy, and the resources of clergy, choir, vergers and congregation who took part in those enactments. They gained direct experience of aspects of medieval worship, how the building was originally used, and the opportunity to reflect on this in relation to their regular experience of worship in the building. \n\nThe medieval church of St Teilo now re-erected in St Fagans Museum provided a contrasting medieval space (now being decorated and furnished as it may have been c.1520) for five enactments. Stages of impact involved discussion with (and formation of) key members of the curatorial staff and their external advisors; participation in the enactments by a range of volunteers (who worked alongside researchers who also participated in the enactments, sharing and gaining insights from them); observation of the enactments by members of the public visiting the museum and also by curatorial staff who saw artefacts belonging to the museum being used in their medieval ritual context. The project also contributed to the enhancement of the interior of St Teilo's Church by the provision of additional furniture, ritual objects and hangings based on medieval models, as an ongoing benefit. The videos of the enactments of medieval liturgies in St Teilo's Church also provide an ongoing educational resource for the museum.\n\nIn making artefacts, furniture, hangings and vestments the project team collaborated with 18 craftspeople and artists. This had a developmental impact on this creative cohort, who gained new insights and explored new procedures, techniques or discovered new solutions in constructing and decorating these items with medieval models as the basis; it also contributed economically through the investment of over ?90K.\n\nThe medieval organ made for the project as the most substantial artefact has enjoyed wide use not only in the enactments but also in the regular services at the cathedrals of Salisbury, St David's and Bangor, enabling organists, choirs and congregations to explore early church music repertory. It has also been used for public lectures and workshops at St David's and Bangor, exploring the use of the organ in church before and after the Reformation, and at Salisbury Cathedral for a professional development conference (Cathedral Assistant Organists).\n\nThe research undertaken for some of the liturgies has already been transferred to other cathedrals and churches. Vespers and Compline have been used as part of the St David's Cathedral Festival (2013), and for quincentenary celebrations at King's College, Aberdeen (2014). The spoken introduction to Vespers at St David's (reflecting on the lay experience of medieval worship) inspired the authors of a new book on the medieval nave roof to include a new section about lay experience of the roof during worship in the Middle Ages. At Bangor Cathedral, the enactments have extended both to historical reenactments involving cathedral singers and congregation (Elizabethan Evensong, 2012), and to a series of modern services which have taken advantage of the physical and sensory experiences explored in the medieval enactments (2011-14). Enactments of a medieval Mass in Christ Church, Bronxville, New York, and post-Reformation Holy Communion services in Washington, Connecticut have not only extended the impact to clergy, singers, church musicians attending a conference, and the regular church congregations in a North American context.\n\nThe discovery of fragments of thirteenth-century liturgical books used in the diocese of Salisbury has led to further joint initiatives at Easton Royal (as part of a Heritage Lottery funded project to explore the past history of the village, including the lost priory) and Salisbury Cathedral, where the manuscripts may have been copied. The chant from the manuscripts has been identified, transcribed and prepared for performance by members of the research team, who also guided the performance and introduced the repertory to large, non-specialist audiences. At both Easton Royal and Salisbury Cathedral, the audiences experienced chant that their forebears would have heard the thirteenth century, including a unique item not heard there since the thirteenth century.\n\nThe findings of the project, much enhanced by the edited videos of the enactments, have formed the non-specialists and specialists at the series of courses promoted by the Continuing Education department at the University of Oxford on the study of Places of Worship in Britain (2012, 2013), and the Warwick Parish Studies initiative (especially the large gathering in 2012) promoted by the University of Warwick. These have in turn led to planned events in Aldworth (Berkshire), Ludlow (Shropshire), and Ranworth (Norfolk) being scheduled in 2015. Practical engagement is planned with the Gloucestershire churches 1315 initiative, which is expected to lead to an enacment in Autumn 2015, as part of their 700th anniversary celebrations.\n\nIn each case, the availability of the comprehensive resources on the project website (www.experienceofworship.org.uk) offer opportunity for follow-up from these events, and for more general enquiry. Prepared texts, organ, vestments and ritual artefacts are available to continue this process of offering something of the experience of worship in the medieval churches and cathedrals that are so dominant a feature of the built environment within the British Isles, and to encourage reflection on both the use of the buildings and the worship within them in the twenty-first century.

As the report shows, these are often interconnected or overlapping.\n\nThe project set out to consider the relationship between texts, rituals, objects and spaces through practice-led research related as a means of elucidating aspects of the experience of worship in late medieval cathedral and parish church. It undertook this research through primary collaboration with two non-academic partners: Salisbury Cathedral and St Fagans: National History Museum, Wales.\n\nThere were three stated stages to the research: investigation, realisation and interpretation. The investigation and realisation stages were overlapped and were ongoing: investigation, compilation, translation and preparation of working texts for a series of liturgical enactments; research, briefing of 18 craftspeople, and construction of a range of artefacts required, especially for the medieval Mass (and otherwise unavailable); consideration of the relation of textual rubrics for the ritual and the actuality of their manifestation in particular medieval buildings; (a) briefing of cathedral clergy, choir and congregation at Salisbury regarding the medieval context, (b) recruiting, rehearsing and 'inculturating' a body of volunteers to act as medieval clergy, singers and congregation at the enactments St Fagans.\n\nThe outcomes of this part of the research process are available as a substantial web resource, available for other researchers and students, either for research or study of this project, or for transfer of the same materials to other settings, or to serve as a model for other comparable inititiatives. The resource includes documentation, performances texts, supporting materials, participant responses and diaries, and 15 videos of (a) 8 complete enactments of liturgies, and (b) 3 introductory videos and 4 accessible videos illustrating stages of the project - making, doing, responding, and reflecting.\n\nThe third stage of research - interpretation - challenged the methodology of the project. Quite deliberately no analytical method was predetermined. The expertise of the research team (and additional associates) was primarily musicological, historical and liturgical (though informed by advice and input from other disciplines including theology, anthropology, ethnomusicology and sociology), and a significant number of the researchers were also practitioners (singers, keyboard players, leaders of worship). A key element of the research method was allowing practice to inform historical enquiry, and historical enquiry to inform practice - a process that several of the team were used to applying in the context of musical performance.\n\nGiven the extent and complexity of the project, not least in executing the enactments within strict partner timetables, it was not always possible to document or record every possible facet of the enactments (though over 100 hours of unedited video of enactments, interviews, and observation of the process by the film-makers are available for future review by researchers in the social sciences in particular). Nevertheless, important methods were devised that separated enactment (as an event in the present of a historical ritual) from re-enactment (as an imaginative process for historical engagement by participants in the ritual), and also separated the responsive process of experience (occasioned through the senses, emotions, intellect or the physical - often in combination) and the pro-active process of engagement. These issues are examined in greater detail, both in principle and in relation to specific facets of the project, in the collaborative volume Late medieval liturgy enacted listed elsewhere in this report.\n\nAlongside the core element of practice-led research, a parallel investigation of the medieval ritual practice of Salisbury Cathedral has been undertaken. The initial intention was to produce an online version of the first volume of W. H. Frere's Use of Sarum as sortable comparative Latin texts with translation. Frere's edition includes parallel texts of the thirteenth and fourteenth-century versions of the Customary. In practice these proved inadequate. Therefore, in addition to Frere's texts (with translations) four readings of the Customary have been transcribed and translated in order to separate key developments in ritual practice at the two cathedrals in Salisbury in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Not only does this provide a major online resource for scholars and students, it is raising new questions about the configuration and use of the first cathedral (now a ruin) - the place where the highly influential Use of Salisbury was formed and codified. This research has been enhanced by the discovery and identification of thirteenth-century liturgical books from thirteenth-century Salisbury, sources from a period for which evidence from the cathedral scriptorium was otherwise very sparse. The monograph on the relation of medieval ritual to medieval building is informed by these new texts and discoveries, though this has delayed its completion (now expected in 2016).\n\nThe key objectives of the project have been met, and additional opportunities have been grasped to further the investigation in additional enactments through collaboration with the AHRC network for medieval liturgy performed, and in collaboration with two conferences of American Sarum (2011 and 2013) which engaged an additional body of people in the research process, and extended its range to consider the implications of the Edwardian and Elizabethan Reformations. More specific research has focused on the interaction of voices and organ (with the resource of the medieval organ made for the project), considering processes of improvisation, issues of pitch, and the relationships between chant, improvised polyphony and composed polyphony. Outcomes of these additional initiatives are listed in this report, but are also ongoing.\n\nBeyond the original intentions of the research proposal, there has already been enhancement of the research process through additional practice-led initiatives and study of new sources. Three strands of enquiry are ongoing: investigation linked to other medieval churches and cathedrals, especially those with significant medieval artefacts in situ; issues of performance-practice and improvisation; transcription and translation of the early Ordinal from Salisbury, in order to complement the Customaries, for fuller provision for the research and study of the Use of Salisbury in its earliest extant recorded stage.
