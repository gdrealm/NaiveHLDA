Currently, these\naromatic chemicals can only be sourced from fossil based inputs, limiting applications, increasing the cost and\nenvironmental impact. Lignin, the 2nd most abundant organic polymer in plants, is one of the few potential natural sources\nof aromatic chemicals. Building on a successful feasibility study that proved that the aromatic diacids inherent within lignin\ncould be extracted and substituted in polyester based plastics, this project aims to demonstrate that these metabolites can\nbe produced in a commercially viable manner by the innovative use of modified bacteria to selectively control lignin\ndisintegration when matched with novel chemical processes in scalable batch/continuous reactors. Larger trials will convert\nthe resultant kg quantities of diacids into novel block copolyesters, for evaluation in a high value global bioplastics market\nof value &gt;&pound;150m.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M028550/1","grantId":"EP/M028550/1","fundValue":"342152","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy David Howard Bugg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
