{"id":"E6EA7420-C654-45CA-89DC-79A147387906","title":"Engineering Safe and Efficient Hydride-Based Technologies","abstractText":"Imagine providing a small, safe and energy efficient hydrogen refueller that can be installed in a domestic garage or industrial warehouse that will ensure that consumers can have an easy and resilient method of refuelling, reducing the reliance on refuelling stations whilst the hydrogen economy infrastructure develops. Current technology provides options which are bulky, take a long time to refuel and require storage at high pressures.\n\nThis work uses metal hydrides as a solid state storage option for hydrogen, reducing the pressure at which hydrogen is stored and reducing the spatial footprint, at the same time using a metal hydride compressor to provide further compression of hydrogen to on-board vehicle requirement levels. The challenge is in designing a compact system that can deliver the flow rates of hydrogen to compete with conventional petrol refuelling or by providing an alternative method that fits in with the lifestyle of a consumer. This work is meeting that challenge and ensuring that it puts safety at the forefront of its design philosophy.\n\nFundamental modelling is required to underpin this work, with materials developments combined with advanced mechanical design to deliver a robust safe design of system and components.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K021117/1","grantId":"EP/K021117/1","fundValue":"1208510","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Malcolm Grant","coPersons":["Gavin Stuart Walker","Carol Norma Eastwick","W  Malalasekera","David  Book","Salah  Ibrahim"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
