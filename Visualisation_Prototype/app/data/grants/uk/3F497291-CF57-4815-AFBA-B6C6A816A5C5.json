We know that these children will get serious cardiovascular disease in adulthood; but we do not know what are the best treatments to prevent or delay the onset to these diseases. This proposal is to establish a UK national cohort of children with type 2 diabetes, carefully characterised, so that they can be involed in clinical trials of treatments to improve their outcomes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800661","grantId":"G0800661","fundValue":"721167","fundStart":"2009-04-27","fundEnd":"2014-04-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Timothy  Barrett","coPersons":["David Brian Dunger","Jerry  Wales","Julian  HamiltonShield"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
