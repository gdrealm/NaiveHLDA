{"id":"2493B10A-5E34-44B5-904B-09D9879E6AD1","title":"Scotland's Diasporas in Comparative International Perspective","abstractText":"This seminar series seeks to advance the study of global migration into and out of Scotland by bridging historical and contemporary approaches through the application of a multidisciplinary and comparative framework to little researched areas in the field. It is timely and important in light of Scotland's rising population figures, growing diasporic consciousness among policy makers at home and emigrant communities overseas, and especially the forthcoming referendum in 2014 on Scotland's independence. Bringing together academics from a range of disciplines, together with policy makers, practitioners, and those in the voluntary sector and public domain, it will more broadly seek to infuse the study of historical migrations with relevant and debated theoretical and conceptual frameworks from the social sciences, and integrate the study of contemporary mobility with insights from the past. This is critical for the study of migration to and from Scotland, particularly its historical dimension, is under-theorised and under-conceptualised, while contemporary movement is often theoretically rather than empirically informed with little appreciation of historical context.\n\nThe seminar programme comprises seven two-day seminars centred on key themes and one two-day international conference. Each gathering will be organised by one or more of the applicants in conjunction with key public partners including politicians (Scottish Migration to England); Surgeons Hall Museum/Royal College of Surgeons (Scotland's Medical Diaspora); International Slavery Museum Liverpool (Scotland and Slavery); National Museums Scotland (Public Spaces and Forgotten Suffering); Sri Lanka's Ministry of Higher Education (Scottish Ties to Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean World); Trades House Glasgow (Religious Tensions and A8 Immigrant Receiving Countries); and the Scottish Government (Scotland's Diaspora Strategy). Each seminar will conclude with a roundtable session guided by the applicants reflecting on progress made on the key topics, methodologies, and concepts arising from the meetings. \n\nA central component of the seminars will be engagement with debated concepts in migration studies such as diaspora, transnationalism, ethnicity, identity, and legacies. Anthropologists, sociologists, economists, demographers, heritage studies scholars, and museologists will provide disciplinary insights into these frameworks with a view to extending our understanding of the insights they generate. The series will also be informed by an important comparative framework provided by the applicants and invited commentators, to assess in what ways migrants to and from Scotland differed or resembled other ethnic groups. Invited speakers will similarly showcase a range of methodologies (including quantitative, anthropological, and ethnographic approaches) that they have developed to inform their perspectives on migration, and the various seminar groups will brainstorm new methods for future research on migration. The research informed policy and practice implications of these seminars is a further critical component of the series with those involved promoting knowledge exchange, furthering dialogue with policymakers and practitioners across a range of sectors, and informing international debates on the topic. It is hoped to demonstrate that detailed study of the Scottish case has broader and more general resonance in diaspora studies.\n\nAs well as establishing an international research network comprising established, early career academics, postgraduate students, policy makers, and practitioners who will explore collaborative research agendas, other key outcomes of the seminar sessions include: a range of high quality publications in high impact journals; four edited collections; and the development of a museum exhibition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L000377/1","grantId":"ES/L000377/1","fundValue":"30411","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-03-01","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas  Devine","coPersons":["Angela  McCarthy","Nicholas John Evans"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
