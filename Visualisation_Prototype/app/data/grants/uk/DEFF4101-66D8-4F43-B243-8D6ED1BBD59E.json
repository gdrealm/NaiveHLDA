{"id":"DEFF4101-66D8-4F43-B243-8D6ED1BBD59E","title":"Early Modern Discourses of Environmental Change and Sustainability","abstractText":"This network examines discourses of environmental change and sustainability in the period 1500-1800. Anxieties over land productivity, resource management, environmental deterioration were as prevalent in the early modern past as they are today. Governments and local communities in this period had to find ways of dealing with drought, floods, harvest failures, over-grazing and fuel shortages. Environmental change brought about widespread dearth, social unrest and political destabilisation. Despite this historical heritage, current discourses of environment and sustainability are perceived as expressing fundamentally modern anxieties. This network is designed to bring together scholars from across the humanities and social sciences to consider the expression, negotiation and transformation of notions of environment and sustainability over time and place.\\n\\nThe main aim of the research network is to advance understanding of both early modern and modern cultures of sustainability through collaborative research. The core disciplines involved are literary studies and history, which will collaborate with disciplines such as archaeology, geography, politics and development studies in a series of linked workshops and a conference. Discussions in our workshops will focus on: how, in the 'organic', low-carbon economy and culture of pre-industrial Britain, households and communities adapted to environmental change; how society as a whole responded to real and imagined crises, and the strategies people devised in order to safeguard future generations. Moving beyond purely economic explanations, we will consider the social, cultural, political and moral meanings invested in early modern discourses of sustainability. The workshops will lead to a major conference on the broad theme of 'Environment and Identity'. The conference will extend the geographical, chronological and political scope of the workshops by investigating the relationship between government policies and local initiatives, and encouraging comparison between past and present. The network thus also includes specialists working on regions other than Britain and on modern times. To further secure this liaison between past and present, we operate in partnership with two organisations: on the one hand, with English Heritage, an enterprise for national heritage site conservations; and on the other hand, with the Peninsula Partnership for the Rural Environment (PPRE), an enterprise led by agricultural and social scientists and ecologists to inform rural and environmental policy. There is much potential for using historical examples to inform modern debates on sustainable solutions. We intend to publish a volume of essays, based on the conference, thus covering a subject of burgeoning interest for which no comparable publication exists.\\n\\nAs environmental change has a direct impact upon the meanings of place and the formation of social identities associated with particular locales and landscapes, local dissemination is central to the network and will be promoted through regional collaborations with institutions such as the University of Exeter's Institute of Cornish Studies, the Cornish Audio Visual Archive (CAVA), Cornwall Heritage Trust, Cornish Mining World Heritage, and County Record Office. To raise the regional and public profile of the network, Exeter's Cornwall Campus will provide the venue for a public day school. The day school will be a forum for the exchange of ideas concerning issues of environmental change and sustainability in the past and present, and for the future of Cornwall. At this event, speakers will include members of the Institute of Cornish Studies, English Heritage, Peninsula Partnership for the Rural Environment and Exeter's Centre for Rural Policy Research. \\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H039082/1","grantId":"AH/H039082/1","fundValue":"24446","fundStart":"2010-07-31","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Findings reported and discussed in a public workshop, 2011.\nReport on network activities published by project partner Peninsula Partnership for the Rural Environment (PPRE) and used by project partner English Heritage.

The aim was to communicate the relevance of early, pre-industrial environmental discourses to not only specialists in the field but also to members of the public and institutions/individuals who engage with environmental issues in the present day. The significance of the historical trajectory of these issues were established and explored through thematically phased workshops and a conference, which were the specified outputs of the award. Discussions and engagement during these events initiated key debates and have generated research projects and collaborations for many members of the network, including the early career PI and CI.
