Training covered the core skills that are vital for the practices of both primary data collection and secondary analysis.These are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>why and how to share research data; ethics, consent and confidentiality when sharing research data</li>\n\n <li>copyright and the use of existing data resources; data description, contextualisation and documentation</li>\n\n <li>data formats and software; and data storage, back-up, and security.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These skills, which we are envisaging will become an integral part of all post-graduate training programmes, should not only maximise the impact of a researcher's own research but also foster greater appreciation of the use of secondary sources. A programme of workshops was held held around the country, with a number of travel bursaries available for post-graduate students.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H023445/1","grantId":"ES/H023445/1","fundValue":"79913","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Louise  Corti","coPersons":["Elizabeth Lea Bishop","Veerle  Van Den Eynden"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
