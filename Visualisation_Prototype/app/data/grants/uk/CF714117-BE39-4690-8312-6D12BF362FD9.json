We are dealing with cellular automata that exhibit dynamics of travelling self-localizations, or particles, compact mobile patterns composed of non-quiescent states. Studies of cellular-automaton particles bring significant values in a range of disciplines, from non-linear sciences to computer engineering. The automaton particles are discrete analogues of breathers, solitons, excitons, kinks, defects and other localizations observed in natural systems. The discrete travelling self-localizations are used as signals and modulators in collision-based unconventional computing architectures. We propose a novel way to formally typify, and dynamically classify, and to estimate computational potential of interacting particle systems. We represent dynamics of interacting automaton particles by sets of regular expressions, and construct deterministic finite-state machines generating the expressions derived from the localization dynamics.To achieve the objectives proposed we are inviting Dr. Genaro Martinez / international expert in computational studies of cellular automata / to work at the University of the West of England, Bristol, for twelve months. We are asking for a one year salary for the visiting researcher, and usual overhead costs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F054343/1","grantId":"EP/F054343/1","fundValue":"95072","fundStart":"2008-07-23","fundEnd":"2009-07-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew  Adamatzky","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
