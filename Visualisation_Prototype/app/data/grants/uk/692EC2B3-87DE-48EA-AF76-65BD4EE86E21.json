It will provide not only a continuation of a valuable time series, but also a programme of innovation that will further our understanding of the role, impact and nature of campaigns in the modern political arena\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;The study will provide an empirically based account of the style and intensity of constituency campaigning in the election; investigate the role of the parties' central organisations in planning and managing constituency campaigns; analyse the extent to which constituency campaigns involve traditional party members as well as party supporters; and investigate the electoral effects (both short and long-term) of constituency campaigning in a new electoral context.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;The core of the proposed study is a questionnaire survey of the election agents of the three major parties and two national parties. It will be complemented by a series of semi-structured interviews with party officials of all five principal parties as well as semi-structured interviews with representatives of the main political competitors in a sample of seven constituencies.\n<br />\n<p></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2762","grantId":"RES-000-22-2762","fundValue":"80422","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Justin  Fisher","coPersons":["Edward  Fieldhouse","David  Cutts"],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
