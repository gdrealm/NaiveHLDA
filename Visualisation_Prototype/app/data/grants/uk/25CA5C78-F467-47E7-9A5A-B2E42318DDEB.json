It is likely that while many adults may have heard of chaos theory, they will not understand how it is used in research or to understand complex systems. As such, the project seeks to illustrate how chaos theory is currently being used to study complex phenomena, including those of human systems, highlighting the relevance of physics research to everyday life.\n\nThe project specifically seeks to engage a range of general audiences, including those who are not traditionally interested in science, as well as engaging young people (14-18). To reach out to non-traditional audiences for science events, the project takes an innovative approach combining both science and the arts. The choice of performance venues (a Science and an Arts Festival and two secondary schools) allows us to engage the audience in familiar (comfortable) venues as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the performance in engaging different types of people (both those who are already interested in science and those who are who do not normally attend such events). This effectively eliminates the barrier for some audiences of attending an event in an unfamiliar space. \n\nFurthermore, such 'Sci-Art' projects can effectively embed scientific ideas in a wider cultural context - taking science out of its traditional spaces of the research facility and placing it within other cultural institutions (e.g. festivals). As this is an emerging approach to science communication, which focuses on 'normalising' science, making it part of everyday life rather than setting it appart as something esoteric or difficult. As this is an emerging field, evaluation will focus on understanding the impacts of the approach on the audience. Evaluation of such Sci-Arts approaches is sorely needed, as there is insufficient evidence at this time of their immediate and wider impacts. Thus, the project is likely to have impacts beyond awareness and interest raising amongst the audience attending the performances, and to influence the nature and direction of future arts-based science communication initiatives.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001500/1","grantId":"ST/L001500/1","fundValue":"9973","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Not as yet.

However, we have developed and premiered a performance 'the Chaos Cabaret' designed to explain key concepts related to chaos theory. The initial performance has allowed us to test the narrative and explore the score and to reflect on the audience we attracted. With this in mind, we will further develop the project with a view to holding a schools performance as well as performing the cabaret at the Cheltenham Science Festival (who attended the performance in Canterbury and indicate that it is of interest). It is too early for us to have any findings suitable for others. I have not fully analysed the evaluation questionnaires as yet. Furthermore, the composer was adamant that we not leave out evaluation questionnaires, but in future I will override this as it proved very difficult to secure post show evaluation information (6 interviews were secured and 24 pre event questionnaires).
