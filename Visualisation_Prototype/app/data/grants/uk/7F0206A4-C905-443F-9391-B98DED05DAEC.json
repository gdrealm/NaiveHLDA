It is highly relevant to yield, quality and environmental considerations as flowering at the appropriate time ensures best use of the available growing season, promoting sustainability and reducing the need for inputs. The genus Brassica includes species with many morphological forms that are cultivated for use as vegetables, oils, fodder and condiments, and much of this morphological diversity can be attributed to variation in flowering time. Biennial cultivars require a period of cold treatment (vernalization) to induce flowering. This flowering behaviour is critical for the production of some vegetable forms and for adaptation to certain agricultural practices, such as planting of overwintering cauliflower varieties. Annual Brassica cultivars do not require cold treatment to flower, although some annuals can respond to vernalization by flowering earlier and more uniformly. How different varieties respond to vernalization has a big effect on when and how they mature. Many vegetables are harvested and eaten at the vegetative stage, prior to flowering. Successfully predicting the timing and length of the vegetative phase has a big influence on the quality and commercial return from the crop. For other vegetables it is the timing of the floral transition that is critical. In this project we will identify genes which can exert greater or lesser control on the vernalization process with the aim of using this information to produce parent lines and hybrids which have a more predictable harvest period. We will relate variation at these loci to performance under present and historical weather patterns to associate specific allelic combinations with maturity under different climatic conditions. Knowledge of key Brassica vernalization genes and how they vary in different vegetable Brassicas will allow us to address key questions about the impact of climate patterns on the availability of UK-produced quality Brassica vegetables.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H004602/1","grantId":"BB/H004602/1","fundValue":"332536","fundStart":"2009-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The results and data produced from this project will have impact in a number of ways:\no The analysis was conducted using populations of plants that form part of the breeding programs of the industry project partners. \no More than 5,000 putative polymorphic markers were identified between the parent lines that can be used to develop both gene-targeted and generic markers\no Several hundred SNP based markers were developed and used in the project and these are now being used by the industrial partners\no Genomic and Transcriptomic illumina sequence data from 4 parent lines has been shared with the industrial partners \no A number of QTLs associated with flowering genes have been identified as affecting flowering time and backcrossed into a common background \n\no Partner awareness was enhanced regarding the impact of weather and climate on field trials and associated impact prevention measures, as was appreciation of how scientific understanding can be deepened through a multi-disciplinary approach Agriculture, Food and Drink Societal,Economic","person":"Judith Ann Irwin","coPersons":["Caroline  Dean"],"organisation":"John Innes Centre","findingsText":" This Horticulture LINK project used a combined candidate gene and Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) approach to identify Brassica genes involved in the regulation of heading date in purple sprouting broccoli (PSB). Our approach was informed by the extensive existing understanding of the regulation of flowering time in the related model species, Arabidopsis thaliana \n\nThe harvested crop in Brassica oleracea vegetables, such as cauliflower and broccoli, is dependent on the plant making the switch from vegetative to reproductive growth to produce an immature inflorescence. \n\nWorking closely with our industrial partners, we have mapped QTL variation for heading date in three divergent populations. These populations have been phenotyped in the greenhouse and in field trials at two UK locations that experience very different winters: Cornwall (relatively mild) and Lincolnshire (relatively cold). The segregation in these populations has allowed us to identify individuals with heading dates ranging from 80 to 320 days with the potential to significantly extend the growing season in the UK. Together we have developed comprehensive linkage maps for these populations that have allowed us to identify 11 QTL affecting heading date. Four of these QTL were mapped in multiple environments in which we phenotyped the populations. \nWe focussed on five of these QTL in two of the populations and have identified Brassica orthologues of the Arabidopsis flowering time genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FRIGIDA among the potential candidate genes for these QTL. Screening a diverse array of Brassica oleracea germplasm we found allelic diversity across crop types that segregated with vernalization response: for example different alleles at one FRIGIDA locus ( BolC.FRI.a) segregate with annual (eg broccoli, autumn cauliflower) or biennial (e.g. Brussels Sprout, Kale) crop type.\nIn collaboration with our third partner, Weatherquest, we used the phenotypic data from the field trials conducted in geographic locations with contrasting winter climates to improve our understanding of vernalization response to variability in winter climate. We then used these results to predict the impact of possible future climate scenarios on crop scheduling and to identify types of vernalization response which might need to be bred into new varieties for enhanced food security. Final analysis of this data has still to be completed and a manuscript submitted. Information will be useful to industrial partners in their breeding program both in Brassica and other species. It will also be of use to those working independently and in collaboration on flowering and other developmental processes in Brassica and other complex genomes Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
