The emerging field of study of multilingual America is beginning to revise the American literary canon, by re-discovering and analysing texts in languages other than English. Wander Words contributes to that project, by drawing attention to the ways in which bilingual immigrant writers have resisted, embraced, or changed American literary English. Their representation of language migration in fiction, life-writing, and essays is analysed to demonstrate that even when they write in dominant English, their words wander: from language to language, from genre to genre, and from meaning to meaning, intended and unintended.\\nThe research proceeds from two key questions: How is the transition to life in a new language represented in American immigrant literature in two periods of mass-immigration: the beginning and end of the 20th century? And what remains, if anything, of the other, native language in this writing in English?\\n\\nImmigrant writing has not been systematically examined for its language wandering; to date, the interest has been focused on themes of migration and cultural difference. My project is original in putting the migrant's languages, as the media in which cultural difference is lived and represented, centre stage. The interdisciplinary approach I adopt is innovative too, in that it combines literary-critical methods (including psychoanalysis, which is rarely used in the critique of 'ethnic' writing) with insights drawn from linguistics, migration studies, and neuroscience. \\n\\nThe overall argument, that consideration of bilingualism changes the complexion of immigrant writing, develops from partial answers to the key research questions in each chapter. Chapter 1 sets the context of multilingual America and Americanisation and English Only campaigns, and Chapter 2 outlines an interdisciplinary approach to immigrant writing. Literary theory, psychoanalysis, theory of life-writing, and linguistics provide ways of moving from world to text, through theories of representation and of linguistic 'choices.' Differences and convergences between literary forms (life-writing, fiction, essays) are considered, as well as thematic issues and bilingual textual practice. \\nChapter 3 investigates the contrast between Eva Hoffman's late 20th century and Mary Antin's early 20th century memoirs about their migration to the US and to English. It demonstrates that contextual factors as well as differing theories of language and of writing explain that contrast. Chapter 4 explores further the period of Americanisation around WWI in Edward Bok's Americanisation tract and Dirk Nieland's self-parodic sketches in an invented Dutch-English. Gender comes to the fore when these are compared with Dutch women's unpublished immigrant letters.\\nChapter 5 picks up on gender and language and the burning question of Spanish in the US, through a close reading of Richard Rodr&iacute;guez's three volumes of autobiographical essays, against that of other Chicano/a writers who represent the bilingual dilemma differently. Rodr&iacute;guez's complex argument for English as socio-cultural mobility is balanced out in Chapter 6 with Bharati Mukherjee's representation of 'passing' in English and her transnational take on multilingual India and the monolingual US. Mukherjee is read through Gayatri Spivak's 'right to critique both places.' Chapter 7 argues for the aesthetic innovation of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's multilingual Dictee, and examines the anxiety of audience for such writing. Chapter 8, finally, pulls together insights from preceding chapters on the importance of context, form, and linguistic practice as well as thematics, and re-states the case for criticism of 'ethnic' writing to condiser the language question as central.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F004257/1","grantId":"AH/F004257/1","fundValue":"29755","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Maria  Lauret","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
