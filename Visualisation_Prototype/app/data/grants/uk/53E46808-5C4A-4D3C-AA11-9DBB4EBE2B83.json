{"id":"53E46808-5C4A-4D3C-AA11-9DBB4EBE2B83","title":"Topological Engineering Translation Grant","abstractText":"We will exploit the unique features of supercritical fluid electrodeposition (SCFED), which we pioneered as part of the Basic Technology program Topological Engineering , to solve important technological problems in the fields of microelectromechanical (MEMs) accelerometers, magnetic nanowires for recording media, and plasmonic optical metamaterials. We are currently the only group in the world with a generally applicable method for electrodeposition from a supercritical fluid. We developed SCFED to enable the deposition of device quality inorganic semiconductors such as Ge, Si and GaAs under electrical control/feedback and into nanostructured templates. Here, we will apply this technique to deposit metallic systems as this will allow us to make significant technological impact in the near future. Using a supercritical fluid (SCF) as the medium for electrodeposition adds a number of key advantages to the already widely exploited advantages of electrodeposition. These include zero surface tension, low viscosity, fast mass transport, a large electrochemical window, and the related ability to deposit highly reactive materials. The proposed work on MEMs accelerometers will produce a device with world leading sensitivity and in addition demonstrate the ability to electroplate onto free standing MEMs devices which would be destroyed by surface tension during wetting or drying. The proposed work on magnetic materials focuses on the deposition of ultrahigh aspect ratio nanowires of FePt, FeRh, and SmCo. We will also demonstrate the applicability of SCFED to the production of nanostructured metal-dielectric negative refractive index materials with ultralow loss and ultrahigh optical non-linearities. The results from these three technological demonstrators will be disseminated in a manner to attract maximum attention from materials scientists and technologists across science and industry and attract further funding from industry and associated government organisations, e.g. TSB. The award of a Translation Grant to support this work will enable us to rapidly exploit our world leading position in this new materials deposition technology by undertaking a series of proof of principle studies, which would not be easy to fund separately and where there inter-relatedness will lead to the sum being greater than the parts. It will also enable us to ensure continuity of funding for three key researchers together with providing us the flexibility to develop other projects as the important advantages of SCFED become apparent to the wider materials community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H007369/1","grantId":"EP/H007369/1","fundValue":"674195","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"David Christopher Smith","coPersons":["Michael  Kraft","Pier  Sazio","Philip  Bartlett","Andrew Lee Hector","G  Reid","Peter  De Groot","William  Levason"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" We continued to develop electrodeposition from supercritical fluids via this grant.
