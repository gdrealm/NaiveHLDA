{"id":"DDDFA9CF-4D90-4646-8674-29C1169792D7","title":"Experimental Particle Physics Rolling Grant 2009-2014","abstractText":"The Particle Physics Group at Manchester University will continue to probe the fundamental particles and forces of nature. This is done by several experiments: ATLAS at the LHC at CERN will study proton-proton collisions at the highest energies yet, and is expected to reveal a wealth of new particles. LHCb will reveal further details of the properties of B hadrons. Dzero is at Fermilab, which is presently the highest energy collider till the LHC starts. SuperNemo will search for a type of nuclear beta decay which, if found, would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle. We also run an ongoing R and D programme for the detectors, electronics, accelerators and computers we use for our investigations into fundamental physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H001166/2","grantId":"ST/H001166/2","fundValue":"3200240","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Stefan  Soldner-Rembold","coPersons":["Terry  Wyatt","Cinzia  Da Vi√°","Roger  Barlow","Stephen  Watts","Rob  Appleby","Frederick  Loebinger","Thorsten  Wengler","Un-Ki  Yang","David Spencer Bailey","Brian  Cox","George  Lafferty","Christian  Schwanenberger"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
