{"id":"C2AD2ED1-D104-4BC0-89B5-F13DC65AC174","title":"A TRAINING COURSE FOR PROTEOMICS DATA MANAGEMENT","abstractText":"Proteome science is reaching maturity, and many laboratories throughout the UK have set up successful groups which are carrying out a variety of proteome experiments on different organisms, species and tissues. These experiments generate large volumes of data in a variety of different formats and styles, all containing information on the proteins that are expressed in the biological systems under study. However, it is increasingly clear that this data is not being captured, stored or managed in a consistent way, and this prevent different groups from exchanging and comparing their data sets effectively. There are, however, data standards being developed and repositories of proteome data are starting to appear. We aim to deliver a short course and associated distance learning version, which will train researchers in how to capture, analyse and store their proteomic data in a consistent fashion. By offering such professional development opportunities to scientists, we aim to promote good practice in proteome data management, help data exchange in this field, and allow more comparative proteomics and exciting experiments to be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D006996/1","grantId":"BB/D006996/1","fundValue":"84769","fundStart":"2006-01-21","fundEnd":"2009-05-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  We delivered a training course in proteomics and associated bioinformatics tools, which have upskilled a large number (&gt;30) researchers in the filed.
