This network of nerves runs uninterrupted from the oesophagus to the anus. It is estimated to contain a similar number of neurones as that found in spinal cord (about 100 million) and serves to allow bowel function to be controlled and coordinated without influence from the central nervous system (CNS). Many parallels have been made between the CNS and ENS which has led to the latter being considered 'The Second Brain'. One thing that the ENS has in common with the CNS is that it undergoes age-related neurodegenerative changes that are in a number of ways comparable to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. However, we know remarkably little about the mechanisms underlying the effect ageing has upon the enteric innervation and in particular sensory signalling from the gastrointestinal tract. The overall aim of the project is to determine how ageing impacts on sensory signalling from the GI tract and the mechanisms that underlie these changes. Our central hypothesis is that sensory signalling from the bowel is attenuated as the organism ages as a consequence of neurodegenerative changes in the enteric nervous system and associated sensory innervation. These leads to functional changes in sensory signalling arising from altered mediator release from the mucosal epithelium and altered receptor expression. To investigate this we will use mice of different ages that have been housed under identical conditions. We will thus be able to compare how the sensory neurons that innervate the gut respond to controlled mechanical and chemical stimulation in animals of different age. Young adults (3 months) will be compared to middle age mice (12 months) and aged animals (24 months). A number of key chemical mediators (including 5-HT and ATP) are stored in the intestinal mucosa are released upon bowel stimulation and in turn activate the sensory neurones. We will investigate how the cells that store these mediators change during ageing. We will measure the amount of mediator release and the receptors that the mediators act on on to mediate sensory signals. We will also utilize mice that have been genetically manipulated to alter these sensory signalling mechanisms. In particular mice lacking a specific receptor for 5-HT (called 5-HT4 receptor knockouts) will be studied because these animals have been shown to develop early enteric degenerative changes. We want to examine if sensory signalling is deficient in these animals. Similarly, another knockout that lacks an enzyme called tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH1) and does not synthesise 5-HT in the gut will be examined for a functional defect in its sensory signalling mechanisms. Therefore, this project aims to understand the mechanisms underlying changes in gastrointestinal afferent sensitivity that occur with ageing. A better understanding of these processes may eventually lead to therapies aimed at preventing or reversing these enteric neurodegenerative changes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G015457/1","grantId":"BB/G015457/1","fundValue":"377686","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Grundy","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" We characterised the sensory signalling properties of aged gastrointestinal afferents and found that ageing was defined by attenuated mechanosensitive afferent signalling in both the jejunum and colon. Aged jejunal afferents responded poorly to stimuli evoked by luminal perfusion of nutrient rich solutions , while 5-HT mediated facilitation of mechanosensitive afferents was impaired in aged colonic afferents. Ageing therefore impacts upon multiple gastrointestinal sensory functions associated with satiety, basal mechanosensitivity and plasticity of neural sensory mechanisms. \n\n\n\nAgeing attenuated 5-HT3 signalling processes in both regions. These changes occur concomitantly with altered capacity for 5-HT biosynthesis. Gut projecting DRGs show little age-related change in excitability, although the number of 5-HT responding DRGs decreases with age. Therefore ageing preferentially affects gut wall physiology, targeting 5-HT signalling processes in particular. This project has defined pathways susceptible to ageing and highlighted potential targets for future research into treatment strategies for age-related gastrointestinal sensory dysfunction. We obtained &pound;15k via University of Sheffield from the HEIF 2011-2015 Proof of Concept fund to develop a collaboration with Biopta, Glasgow to evaluate the potential for commercialisation of a model to investigating gastrointestinal adverse reactions as part of a safety pharmacology screen for use in drug discovery. \n\n\n\nIn the longer term, understanding how ageing effects the sensory innervation of the gastrointestinal tract could lead to novel approaches to ameliorate constipation and incontinence that is frequent amongst the institutionalised elderly. Aged tissue was used as a resource for several groups across the University of Sheffield including the newly established Sheffield Institute of Translational Medicine (SiTRAN) and members of the Medical School who were engaged in complementary or quite different research to our own. In addition to sharing tissue during the course of this grant, we have also generated a biobank of fixed and frozen intestinal tissue which we will be able to access over the coming years. These samples will be a useful source of material for student projects or for external partners including the Shared Ageing Resource Management (ShARM). This is a new venture in which biogenerology groups can share material from aged animals that are surplus or not required for their projects, and therefore minimise the costs of ageing research and adhere to the 3Rs principles.
