{"id":"809A3B9E-785E-4E8D-8AD4-EDA685EEC143","title":"What is Gender Equality in a Global Era?","abstractText":"<p>The seminar series will investigate and assist in the reformulation of the conceptualisation and operationalisation of the concept of gender equality in a global era. Gender equality is a deceptively simple concept. While its meaning might appear obvious, in practice this is often fiercely contested. Indeed, ‘gender equality’ is perhaps an essentially contested concept.</p>\n\n<p>There are many dimensions to these debates. One issue is the extent to which the gender equality can be defined in a way that is universally relevant (as in the 1995 UN Platform for Action), and the extent to which it is sensitive to context. This sensitivity to context lies at the heart of the debates about diversity and gender equality. Can gender equality mean the same thing in different cultures? What are the implications of cross-cutting inequalities, such as those of ethnicity and of age? The seminars will consider the implications of the increased salience of the global horizon for notions of gender equality. In relatively new policy areas the translation of concepts into measurable indicators that can be supported with quantitative data is a challenge. The seminar series engages with the concept of gender equality in a series of substantive domains. What is gender equality in the knowledge economy, or in gender-based violence? It examines the gender equality in the context of diversity and different social systems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4047","grantId":"RES-451-25-4047","fundValue":"15350","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sylvia  Walby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
