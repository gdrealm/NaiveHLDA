{"id":"BB37DD29-2EEA-40FD-A92C-C9F3749BE2F9","title":"National Astronomy Week 2014: Target Jupiter","abstractText":"The key aims of the project are as follows:\n\n1. To raise awareness of and engage a wider audience with some of the most exciting STFC related science, namely astronomy, space and planetary science. For example the forthcoming European Space Agency JUICE mission will provide an excellent link to current research with Jupiter, the main target for observation which will be well placed during the chosen week 1st-8th March 2014.\n\n2. To promote and facilitate UK wide access to exciting astronomy events and activities, especially direct observation through a telescope. This will assist with the communication of new knowledge, not only about the night sky and astronomy but across other related disciplines, and engage those who currently have little or no interest in these subjects.\n\n3. To support science education. There is significant evidence that astronomy and space are effective in encouraging young people to take a more positive view of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects. The Week has this at its heart and activities will be designed to foster this objective.\n\n4. Promote the natural heritage of dark skies and further the understanding of why these must be preserved.\n\nThe overall impact of the project is to inspire as many people across the UK as possible about astronomy and the night sky including the general public, families, youth groups, school children etc. In particular we believe that involving young people in such a dynamic science by giving them the opportunity to take a closer look into space (Jupiter being one of the most fascinating objects to look at through a telescope) is an important way to inspire them to better appreciate and increase the chances of them pursuing further study and careers in STEM subjects as a whole.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L001578/1","grantId":"ST/L001578/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2013-09-23","fundEnd":"2014-05-22","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Sandra  Voss","coPersons":["Robert Mark Massey"],"organisation":"The Observatory Science Centre","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
