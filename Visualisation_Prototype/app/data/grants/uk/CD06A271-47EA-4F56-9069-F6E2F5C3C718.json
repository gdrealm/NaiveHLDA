There are many conditions that cause acute kidney injury, some of the most common being conditions in which a patient's immune system becomes chaotic and damages cells and organs. In one of these autoimmune diseases called vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), the target organ is the blood vessels (both within and outside the kidney). Many factors lead to the disordered immune response but all involve disruption of the normal regulatory systems that prevent problems in most healthy individuals. We have focussed on one such system in white blood cells, which normally serves to help the immune system respond to infections, but may go wrong in vasculitis;this system is controlled by ATP interacting with particular receptors (called P2X7) on the cell surface and the interaction triggers changes in the way the cells behave. Just as a skin cut can heal completely or form a scar, after inflammatory injury, the kidney can either repair itself or scar, leading to irreversible loss of function. This reduction in kidney function leads to CKD and is accompanied by many other complications including abnormal calcium deposition in blood vessel walls, increasing the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Recent evidence suggests that the same ATP-P2X7 system may be involved in this abnormal calcium deposition. Therefore we want to investigate how ATP and P2X7 are involved in the development of inflammatory kidney diseases and calcium deposition and whether blocking the interaction between ATP and P2X7 could be used as a new target for treatment","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K015249/1","grantId":"MR/K015249/1","fundValue":"391976","fundStart":"2013-09-02","fundEnd":"2016-09-01","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert John Unwin","coPersons":["Jill Tessa Norman","Robert  Kleta","Peter Stewart Gilmour","Alan  Salama","David Collins Wheeler"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
