Nonetheless there is a long tradition of valuing fictional stories, pictures and other &quot;impractical&quot; cultural products for their beauty, for their display of imaginative and other admirable skills, and for their capacity to connect us with other people in our past and present. Thinking about culture in this last way--as a transaction between people over space and time--suggests that these products may have what are sometimes called &quot;cognitive&quot; values, or capacities that enable us to generate and transmit the insight or understanding that goes with various forms of practical and theoretical knowledge. Are beautiful things more beautiful for conveying knowledge? Conversely, if a cultural object spreads ignorance, error and bad judgement, is it thereby less beautiful, less worthy of being called art? These questions form the background of our project.\n\nIts aims and objectives \nThe relations between cognitive and aesthetic values, and their place in our cultural practices are complex and we don't aim, in this brief and preliminary project, to fully explain them. Rather, we will bring together expert researchers from a range of disciplines who will contribute their varied and divergent perspectives on this relationship via close analysis of a few concrete cases. We have chosen these cases deliberately to go some way towards recognising that cultural artefacts come in very diverse kinds, and that their cognitive and aesthetic features are very varied. We take first one of the most ancient examples of proto-artistic activity, the animal depictions discovered at Chauvet cave in the Ard&egrave;che region of southern France in 1994, some of which are reckoned to date from more than thirty thousand years ago. Our second example is a group of Shakespeare's poems in sonnet form meditating on the subject of time and mortality, while our final example brins us to very recent times and perhaps the most global current artistic form: Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner.\n\nIts potential applications and benefits\nOur project is first of all a contribution to the AHRC's large scale research initiative into the exploration of cultural value, which takes as its starting point &quot;the different forms of cultural experience, such as, for instance, the aesthetic and cognitive dimensions of our cultural encounters&quot;. We believe that our research will be of foundational importance for the project and that our results, preliminary though they will be, will connect with and inform the work of many other scholars working on the project. More specifically, our contribution will be to help clarify what is involved in thinking through the relations between cognitive and aesthetic values, and to illustrate how general theories in this area have application to specific and concrete cases like those we will examine. We expect also for our work to inform the thinking of those involved in the artistic and museum worlds who grapple daily with the problem of presenting cultural objects in a context which best illustrates their various forms of value. Through publications in academic journals and in cultural and artistic magazines and through appearances in the media we expect to provoke and inform debate across society on why artistic and more broadly cultural activity should be valued.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L005719/1","grantId":"AH/L005719/1","fundValue":"28471","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2014-05-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Lamarque","coPersons":["Gregory  Currie"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" 1. A clearer understanding of what 'cognitive' and 'aesthetic' values in artefacts are: hence a contribution to a fundamental issue in aesthetics.\n2. Showing how research into a fairly abstract philosophical question (the nature of different kinds of values) can be illuminated by focusing on specific case studies, and that the illumination goes both ways: hence a contribution to research methodology in the arts.\n3. Significant new light shed on each of the case studies--Chauvet Cave, Shakespeare's sonnets, and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner -emerging from the unusual perspective of the framing questions: hence a contribution to art and cultural criticism. We hope that our findings will have an impact in both academic and non-academic fields. Academics working broadly across the arts--in philosophy of art, aesthetics, paleoanthropology, literary criticism, film studies, art criticism--can draw on our detailed exploration both of the case studies themselves and the underlying questions about values. Non-academics working across the education, culture and heritage sectors should benefit from the non-technical clarity of our investigation of the different kinds of values in the arts. Cultural organisations concerned with funding and management of the arts can utilize the deeper and multiple criteria governing values in the arts as explored in our final report.
