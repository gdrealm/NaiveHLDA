{"id":"92D324FD-6E10-4ECC-BDE1-026663117F97","title":"The role of properdin in infection and inflammation","abstractText":"We want to understand more fully the precise role that properdin, a normal blood protein, plays in health and disease. We hope this will clarify key mechanisms and benefit patients with infectious or inflammatory disease. Properdin is an essential component of an amplifying pathway of complement activation, a series of other blood proteins that play a key role in initiating and controlling infection and inflammation. Human deficiency is described and predisposes individuals to meningitis. We are studying mice that are deficient of properdin in models of relevance to public health (bacterial infections and rheumatoid arthritis). We are determining the prevalence and significance of properdin deficiency in human subjects. We are investigating the production of properdin by different classes of white blood cells, and the effects of properdin on some of these cells via certain cell surface receptors, because such interaction may play an important role in regulating white blood cell function in diverse infectious and inflammatory diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400300","grantId":"G0400300","fundValue":"251223","fundStart":"2005-06-13","fundEnd":"2008-06-12","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Cordula  Stover","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
