Texts are durable, and bear repeated analysis. Seminal professional productions are visible, and can be reviewed. Many important plays have been written in response to the Troubles by established playwrights such as Brian Friel, Marie Jones, Christina Reid, Ann Devlin, Martin Lynch and Frank McGuinness. \\n\\nBut there were also theatres which are less well known, which arose from within the nationalist communities of Belfast and Derry, and which performed on less visible stages. Some of these performances were based on texts written by republican prisoners, or by priests and nuns. For the most part participants were amateurs, who saw theatre as one of a range of cultural actions through which communities silenced by the apparatus of state occupation could speak. Some of the theatres, such as Belfast Community Theatre, came organically from within the community. Others, such as Derry Frontline, were facilitated by sympathetic outsiders. Taken together, they constitute an important aspect of theatre's response to the Troubles. The study will offer the first history of these theatres. \\n\\nAIMS\\nMy aim is to write a history which locates these theatres in what the historian R.F. Foster has called 'the local, the actual, the lived experience'. A narrative which conveys how the moment to moment unfolding of the conflict determined organisation, 'texts', performance contexts and reception: and how the theatres operated within the broader nationalist and republican networks. While each theatre was unique in certain aspects, they also display commonalities which are significant, and which can tell us important things about theatre's complex role in situations of war and acute civil crisis. The study will therefore also look at how these theatres related, first to each other, and then to European traditions of radical theatre and to the liberation models which were developing in neo and post colonial contexts in the South.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\\nThe study is aimed at academics, theatre students and a general audience\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000622/1","grantId":"AH/E000622/1","fundValue":"21866","fundStart":"2006-09-25","fundEnd":"2007-01-24","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"William Gerard McDonnell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
