{"id":"662ADAED-C407-406C-90A7-1BF2AB97AF43","title":"Entrepreneurship in Homes and Neighbourhoods","abstractText":"<p>The main aims of this seminar series are to advance knowledge on the roles of homes and neighbourhoods for firm formation and entrepreneurship and to inform/influence enterprise and housing policy and practice. This is important as the lack of research and empirical base in this field has led policymakers to neglect home-based businesses and existing barriers for entrepreneurial activities in homes and their local neighbourhood contexts. By gaining a better understanding of the significance of the embeddedness of entrepreneurship in homes and neighbourhoods, the view will be critically advanced that entrepreneurial activities are local assets that require more attention in enterprise, neighbourhood and housing research and policy and open up new perspectives for economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The seminars are designed to identify key issues and research gaps and to develop a policy and practice agenda. Important aspects of this seminar series will be to engage with policymakers and practitioners and learn from international experiences. Two seminars will therefore be hosted by key government bodies (the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills and The Scottish Government), practitioners will take part in the seminars to discuss the relevance for their work and an international network of researchers will be set up.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L001489/1","grantId":"ES/L001489/1","fundValue":"30412","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Darja  Reuschke","coPersons":["Maarten  Van Ham","Colin Mitchell Mason","Duncan  Maclennan","Stephen Jeremy Syrett"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
