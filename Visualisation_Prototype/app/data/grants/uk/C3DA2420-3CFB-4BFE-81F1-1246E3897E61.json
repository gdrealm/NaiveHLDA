It has built evidence-informed knowledge about the nature of resilience in teachers’ different life and work contexts. In particular, it has pointed to the importance of environmental effects on teachers’ resilience and the role of teacher networks and school leadership practices in sustaining the resilience that enables effective teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The series has developed a socio-culturally-oriented theoretical and methodological framework, which moves beyond seeing resilience as a personal attribute of individual teachers, and which will inform research into teachers’ well-being, professional development and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The outcomes of the series have been turned into outputs which will be of relevance to teachers, school leaders, teacher educators, policy makers and all stakeholders engaged in improving the quality of education.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0668","grantId":"RES-451-26-0668","fundValue":"14276","fundStart":"2010-03-31","fundEnd":"2011-07-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Day","coPersons":["Amanda  Griffiths","Thomas  Cox","Qing  Gu","Anne  Edwards"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":" Teaching is emotionally demanding work, and levels of work-related stress, anxiety and depression are higher within education than within many other occupational groups.\n\nRather than focussing on managing stress, however, we argue that a more productive approach would be to focus on fostering resilience.\n\nResilience is not simply an individual trait, but a capacity that arises through interactions between people within organisational contexts.\n\nTeachers' resilience can therefore be nurtured at various career stages through initial training, continuing professional development and support networks.\n\nMost crucially, school leadership has much to contribute to the development of individual and collective resilience. Findings can be used in Professional Development programmes, for teachers and head teachers. Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
