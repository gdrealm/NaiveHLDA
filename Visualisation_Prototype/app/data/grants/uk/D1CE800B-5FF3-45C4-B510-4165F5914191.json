While such a landmark may appear subtle, it heralds a new era in modern medicine necessary to deal with the increasing prevalence of diseases commonly associated with old age, such as macular degeneration, diabetes and Parkinson!\ns disease. Given that embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the capacity to spawn any one of the 200 or so types of cells that make up the human body, they have been widely acclaimed to be the answer to the shortage of organs and tissues for transplantation, needed to deal with this rising tide of degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, their use poses some of the same problems that have confounded whole organ transplantation over the past 30 years, while raising further problems besides. As is the case for an organ from either a living or deceased donor, tissues grown from ESC will be recognised as foreign and vigorously rejected by the host!\ns immune system. Unlike conventional tissues, however, ESC are closely related to cancer cells and may, therefore, pose an additional risk of turning into tumours once implanted into patients. Furthermore, the intervention required to prevent rejection and ensure survival of the tissue may substantially increase the risk of a patient developing cancer. Our recent research has uncovered a previously unappreciated property of tissues differentiated from ESC: their capacity to actively repel an immune response targeted against them. While these findings are good news for helping to outwit the host!\ns immune response, they may also prevent the immune system from identifying and destroying any cells hidden within the tissue that are on the verge of turning cancerous. The purpose of our current research is, therefore, to quantify the risks involved by constructing tissues for grafting known to contain defined numbers of these rouge cells and investigating whether or not they can be sought out and destroyed by the host!\ns immune system. The outcome of this project will be critical for informing strategies for the use of ESC-derived tissues that will maximise the therapeutic value for patients while minimising the risks involved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802538","grantId":"G0802538","fundValue":"517515","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul Jonathan Fairchild","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
