{"id":"494E4AD1-F7A2-4AD3-B474-FEAC43CA18B8","title":"Making Peacekeeping Data Work for the International Community","abstractText":"Humanitarian and peacekeeping organisations rely on high quality information to ensure their own security and to deliver their mandate. Whether they have access to this information and are skilled in using it, is another matter. A number of UN Peacekeeping missions record the date and location of reported incidents, such as movements of militia and arms, summary executions and abductions, raids on villages, displacements of refugees and threats to UN staff, as well as political affairs such as meetings and treaties. This evidence is compiled in real time by the relevant Joint Mission Analysis Center (JMAC). Although used intensively during the lifetime of the mission, the data are often lost or archived rather than shared with outside agencies and scholars. This project aims to fully exploit the dataset collected by the UN mission in Darfur and for the first time to triangulate it with perceptions held by local communities, and by other data held by NGOs, academic data resources and from media sources. \n\nThe day-to-day pressures on UN operations mean that peacekeeping data collected in real time in the field are often under-exploited. By examining and analysing the data in a systematic way, the proposed project aims to better understand the dynamics of decision-making in a UN peacekeeping operation, the interaction between indigenous and external actors, and the changing dynamics of conflict. The project will bring together qualitative and quantitative scholars who will use innovative methodologies to show the potential of this data to inform policy and tell us about the changing character of violent conflict. \n\nThe underlying research question is whether there is consistency of practice and communality of perception in conflict situations and how this information may be converted into evidenced-based policymaking for peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations. The project will put together a methodology for the quantitative and qualitative interrogation of the UN peacekeeping data from Darfur that can be replicated in other conflicts. \n\nThe project team have had discussions with Herve Ladsous, (UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping) and Valentina Kalk of the statistical offices within United Nations Publications, examining ways we can work together to make the peacekeeping data more widely available to the research and NGO communities, using the Darfur peacekeeping dataset as a test case. One important aspect of this proposed project will be to build on this work to locate and evaluate data produced by other peacekeeping missions. We will also exploit linkages with colleagues at the OP Jindal Global University and the Jamsetji Tata Centre for Disaster Management in India who have engaged in similar work in relation to political violence in the North-East of India. Their experience will be vital in guiding us through methodological issues. \n\nThe project will make its findings available to NGOs, other UN agencies including UNHCR and other researchers. The GIS mining of the Darfur data will also allow the research team to develop spatial and historical understandings of this multifaceted security situation and enable its evolution to be studied in space and time. This in turn will enable the UN peacekeeping data to be correlated and contrasted with existing narratives of violence from local communities, humanitarian agencies and other actors in the region. \n\nThe main aim of the project is to make better use of already-existing information. The data from Darfur is a test case and we hope that the methodology we develop to mine this data can be applied to other cases, and be useful to the UN and other organisations in their mission planning.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L007479/1","grantId":"ES/L007479/1","fundValue":"807953","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2017-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Roger  Mac Ginty","coPersons":["Tanja R.
