This eventually causes them to become completely blocked. When such a blockage occurs in the brain, there is poor supply of oxygen to the brain causing a stroke. However, homocysteine levels can be effectively lowered using vitamins, which means we may be able to prevent stroke by taking vitamins. As yet, no one has proven that vitamin treatment prevents stroke and other forms of blood vessel disease. The VITATOPS study has been designed to answer this question. \nVITATOPS is an international study designed to determine whether or not vitamins prevent stroke and other forms of blood vessel disease. People who have had a stroke are treated daily with either a multi-vitamin tablet or a placebo (a ?dummy? tablet). At the end of the study patients taking vitamins will be compared with those taking the placebo to determine whether vitamin treatment is beneficial or not. \nWe intend to extend the study, recruiting approximately 1500 patients instead of the 750 patients for whom we already have funding. All of our patients will also be kept under observation for an extra two years. This will enable sufficient numbers to be obtained to be able to determine whether vitamins prevent stroke and other vascular events.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0200583","grantId":"G0200583","fundValue":"893231","fundStart":"2003-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kennedy  Lees","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
