At present, achieving this sort of information in a routine clinical setting is not practical. The proposal here is designed to exemplify a new technology that will ultimately satisfy the clinical need for this type of information. It is anticipated that the general use of the technology to be developed will impact broadly on the application of diagnostics to clinical decision making. The key contribution will be to defining which patients should receive which drugs - the personalised medicine agenda.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1000736","grantId":"G1000736","fundValue":"222444","fundStart":"2010-08-17","fundEnd":"2012-05-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Parker","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
