Early versions of this paper were presented in a work-in-progress session at Keele University during Karaian's visiting fellowship, and a session at the PECANS 2010 'Transgressing Power(s)' workshop in London. Social impact on the issue of transphobia resulted from Jemma Tosh's work, presented at the PECANS 2011 'Interrogating (In)equality' workshop in Vancouver. As a result of her work on the criminal law response to teenage sexting Karaian was asked to be the keynote of the Elizabeth Fry Society of Ottawa's (EFS) annual General Members meeting. EFS offer a variety of different programs and services to provide women with confidential and supportive living and learning environments. Since Karaian's talk, the Elizabeth Fry Society has gone on to inform youth groups on the issue of 'sexting' and its legal regulation.
