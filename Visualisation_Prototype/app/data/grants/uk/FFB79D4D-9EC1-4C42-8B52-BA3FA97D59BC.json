Traditional computer models are relatively slow because the spatial dependence of relevant physical variables (e.g. temperature) at fixed radius are represented by somewhat complicated mathematical functions, the so-called 'spherical harmonics'. A new, simpler representation has been found in a new coordinate system and this work is concerned with exploiting this representation in the development of new computationally efficient methods for simulating these systems in a spherical geometry","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/C000811/1","grantId":"NE/C000811/1","fundValue":"30791","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The results of this research have been applied to the study of magnetic field generation in the Earth's core dynamo.

The core dynamo system thus can evolve from a principally non-magnetic state into one where the magnetic field plays a significant role in the dynamics. research on magnetic dynamo and field generation is actively continuing Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
