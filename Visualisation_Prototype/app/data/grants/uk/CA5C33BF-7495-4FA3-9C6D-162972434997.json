{"id":"CA5C33BF-7495-4FA3-9C6D-162972434997","title":"Deciphering the epigenetic code","abstractText":"As every cell of our bodies contains every gene it follows that for cells to perform different functions some genes much be switched off and others switched on in a given cell type. These studies will examine how cells remember to keep some genes on and others off. We will do this by examining the way genes are packaged and labelled as on or off by directly looking at the packaging surrounding active and inactive genes. When these mechanisms go wrong this can lead to diseases, by understanding this process we hope to work out better ways to treat such diseases in the future.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0301153","grantId":"G0301153","fundValue":"938762","fundStart":"2005-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard J Festenstein","coPersons":["Robin  Allshire","Luis  Arag√≥n"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
