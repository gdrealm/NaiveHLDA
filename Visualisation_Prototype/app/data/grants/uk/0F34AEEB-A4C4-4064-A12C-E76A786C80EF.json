Some tendons are more likely to be injured than others, e.g. the human Achilles is highly prone to injury. This is partly due to its function. While most tendons are involved in limb placement for movement, some, including the Achilles have another function; they act as a spring, stretching to store energy then recoiling to return it, decreasing the body's energy consumption. To achieve this, they have a specialist structure. All tendons are composed of collagen molecules, grouped together to form larger subunits, the largest of which is the fascicle. Fascicles are bound together by inter-fascicular matrix (IFM), but we have evidence that this matrix has a unique and important mechanism in energy storing tendons and is responsible for allowing these tendons to act as springs. This has exciting implications; some individuals are able to use their tendons heavily without injury occurring whilst others are very prone to injury. We believe this may occur as a result of variations in the IFM, reducing the tendon capacity to extend and recoil. If we can quantify IFM structure and function and relate this to tendon properties, we may be able to predict the likelihood of injury in specific tendons, and develop methods to increase resistance to tendon injury and prevent disability.\n\nRacehorses also suffer from tendon injuries. These are one of the most common reasons horses used for athletic purposes are retired and is a cause for considerable economic loss. The energy storing superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in horses is functionally equivalent to the human Achilles and is injured the most often. The characteristics of tendon injury are similar between horses and humans, so we can use the horse as a model to better understand the role of the IFM in human tendon injury. In horse tendon, our previous work shows that the SDFT has a less stiff IFM than the non-energy storing common digital extensor tendon (CDET), which enables the SDFT to extend further before failure. We also have evidence that SDFT fascicles have a better recoil mechanism, indicating that lower IFM stiffness is critical for increasing damage resistance and protecting tendons from injury. Further, we have evidence that the IFM becomes stiffer with age, which may explain why tendon injuries increase in older people and animals. We intend to compare the structure and mechanics of the IFM in different tendons and different aged horses to see if we can identify the specific molecules that are key in influencing IFM mechanical properties. \n\nWe will determine how the composition of the IFM influences its mechanical properties in both the SDFT and CDET. Firstly, we will look at the different proteins in the IFM, and establish how they are organised. We will then measure IFM stiffness and determine how this is influenced by different IFM components. Once we have identified structural differences in the IFM between tendon types, we will focus on the damage resistant SDFT for the rest of the project. We will perform several mechanical tests on the SDFT, which will allow us to establish which IFM components control the ability of the tendon to extend and recoil, and provide damage resistance. We will also identify any age related changes in IFM composition and structure, and link these with ageing changes in mechanical properties. \n\nIn this work, we will focus on horse tendon. However, our findings will be applicable to humans and other species. The outcomes of this work will be the identification of components that are important in preventing tendon injury. The resulting data will allow us to understand the role of the IFM in normal tendon function, and how this changes with age and injury. This work will help researchers to develop treatments targeted at the IFM, and even improve training plans to promote appropriate IFM development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K00672X/1","grantId":"BB/K00672X/1","fundValue":"13180","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-11","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This project has been active for 17 months, and has recently begun to produce published output. We have had two papers published from the project already, with a further paper in submission, and we anticipate that these will lead to impact over the coming year.\nWe have already developed educational impact, providing a range of research opportunities for undergraduate and postgraduate students, including an ERASMUS exchange student, and have also engaged school children, with the PDRA undertaking STEM ambassador training and participating in an outreach event.\nWe are also currently planning the tendon research meeting outlined in our impact plan, which is to be held in September 2015. We have ensured contributions from scientific, industrial and clinical speakers, and included a series of special workshops to support multidisciplinary research. Importantly we have also timetabled a specific workshop and network event focused on collaborating with industry. We have also secured further practical and financial support through having the meeting adopted as a satellite meeting of the British Society of Matrix Biology\nFinally, we have developed the tendon website we proposed in our impact plan, targeted at both a scientific and lay audience. We are currently in the process of training team members to ensure they can update the text and keep the website content current.

We have shown that in young individuals, tendon cells are able to respond to tendon injury and attempt to repair the damage. With increasing age, this ability to repair damage decreases, and we see multiple protein fragments in old tendons which are not present in young tendons, suggesting that damage may be accumulating in the tissue over time. This novel information is an important first step towards understanding how our tissues break down as we age, and will help guide the development of treatments to stop tissue breakdown occurring, and encourage increased cell repair activity in old tendons.\nThe second paper, accepted for publication in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in sports, investigates the immediate response to tendon injury, in order to try and understand the process more fully. We took pieces of tendon and subjected to them to high loads, before staining the tissue, to investigate how the tendon was damaged and to look for inflammation. We found that damaged tendon had higher levels of various markers of inflammation, as well as increased levels of tissue breakdown, all indicating an early inflammatory response from the tendon cells, leading to injury. This new understanding is particularly important, as it is contrary to previous theories which suggested a lack of inflammation in tendon injury, and may thus require scientists to reconsider treatment options. It may be possible to treat tendon more effectively if we target the inflammatory period in the future. \nAnother manuscript has been submitted to the Journal of the Mechanical Behaviour of Biomedical Materials. In this study, we investigated how the tendon interfascicular matrix responds to cyclic loading. We have discovered that the interfascicular matrix is able to resist and recover from cyclic loading, something that has not been demonstrated before. Further, we have shown that the interfascicular matrix is more elastic in energy storing tendons than in positional tendons, and that elasticity decreases with ageing in energy storing tendons specifically. These data highlight the important role of the interfascicular matrix in facilitating the high strain characteristics of energy storing tendon, and provide important information allowing us to further understand structure-function relationships and ageing mechanisms in tendon.\nWe have assessed the composition of the interfascicular matrix using a range of techniques, including histology, immunohistochemistry and proteomics. We have discovered that protein distribution differs between energy storing and positional tendons, with greater elastin content in energy storing tendons. Proteomic analysis of the fascicular and interfascicular matrices has revealed a different protein profile between the matrix compartments, discovering several proteins previously unidentified in tendon. Further, we have identified ageing changes in the protein profile of both the interfascicular and fascicular matrices. These data are currently being prepared for publication.\nWe are currently developing techniques to allow failure and fatigue testing of tendons. We have designed and manufactured cryogrips and an environmental chamber, which will allow us to grip samples and maintain sample hydration. The data from these experiments will allow us to compare tendon, fascicle and interfascicular matrix fatigue properties, and determine the origins of the superior fatigue properties seen in energy storing tendons. A greater understanding of the response of tendon cells to injury, and how this is altered with ageing, will be of interest to medical and veterinary clinicians as these findings will help guide the development of treatments and preventative measures for tendon injury.\nOur findings will also be of benefit to researchers with an interest in soft tissue structure-function relationships. Indeed, we are collaborating with researchers at Manchester University, providing data generated from our experiments to allow them to develop and validate their computational models of tendon mechanics. Further, our findings are also of importance to tissue engineering and biomaterials focussed academics, as improved understanding of tissue function is key to developing appropriate artificial repairs.
