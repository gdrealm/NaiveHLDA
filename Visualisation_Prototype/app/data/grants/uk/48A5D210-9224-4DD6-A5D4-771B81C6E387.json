Closely related species can sometimes succeed in breeding together, but further genetic mixing is prevented because hybrid offspring are inviable or sterile. An example of a sterile hybrid is a mule, the offspring of two different species, a donkey and a horse. Mules are viable, but sterile and so unable to reproduce themselves. Understanding hybrid sterility can therefore explain how species are kept apart, and how they formed in the first place. There are several theories about the causes of reproductive isolation between species, but one is that genes from one species are incompatible with genes from another. Baker's yeast is a simple single-celled organism that is useful in biology because it possesses most of the biologically fundamental characteristics of larger living things, yet it is much easier to understand and manipulate genetically. It can mate with closely related yeast species, but produces only sterile hybrid offspring. One possible cause of hybrid sterility is that genes from one species are incompatible with genes from another. This incompatibility could occur when the genes are mixed up by the hybrid to make its gametes (sex cells / the equivalent of sperms and eggs). It could make the gametes die, or it could affect the ability of the gametes to fertilise or it could affect the viability or fertility of the resulting offspring. To test whether genetic incompatibilities between the species affect hybrid gametes, a genetic trick is used to transfer individual chromosomes one by one from one species' gametes into another. Some of the chromosomes have already been transferred, but this proposal aims to transfer all of them. Then all the chromosomes can be tested for the presence of genetic incompatibilities that could kill a gamete or the offspring resulting when a gamete is fertilised. If incompatibilities are discovered then the genes responsible can be isolated. If no incompatibilities are found then this will give support to alternative explanations for reproductive isolation that do not depend on genetics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F000979/1","grantId":"NE/F000979/1","fundValue":"76500","fundStart":"2007-11-12","fundEnd":"2009-11-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Duncan  Greig","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
