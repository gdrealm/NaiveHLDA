They have an important role in protection against infection and cancer. \nIt is not well understood how Natural Killer Cells achieve the difficult task of attacking infected tissue but leaving normal tissues alone; it is suspected that receptor molecules on the surface of the cells play a critical role. One set of receptors, called KIR, differ dramatically from person to person. This striking feature provides clues to their functions in immune defence.\nIn view of this, our project has three aims:\nTo investigate the dramatic variation in KIR receptors from person to person.\nTo identify what different KIR receptors bind to on cells that they target; what are they receptors of?\nTo understand how variation in KIR receptors helps some people to be resistant to disease. \nBy understanding how KIR receptors work we hope to be able to harness them to combat cancer and infection.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401569","grantId":"G0401569","fundValue":"1000000","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Trowsdale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
