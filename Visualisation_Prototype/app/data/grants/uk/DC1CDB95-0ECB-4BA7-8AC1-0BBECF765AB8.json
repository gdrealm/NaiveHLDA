{"id":"DC1CDB95-0ECB-4BA7-8AC1-0BBECF765AB8","title":"DISCOTIC LIQUID CRYSTAL-BASED FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS","abstractText":"We seek proof of principle funding for a very short project the aim of which is test whether it is possible to fabricate a Discotic Liquid Crystal based organic field effect transistor of the type use in RF tags and electronic paper. The aim is to use a new method which we have discovered for aligning DLCs in a planar fashion with control over the azimuthal angle. This new method of aligning DLCs is the first for DLCs that one could reasonably imagine being used in the manufacture of ink-jet or contact printed OFETS. Since the last step in the fabrication would require us to deposit the source and drain electrodes onto the DLC film the order and directionality of the conduction within the film needs to be 'locked in' by polymerisation. As a result the first requirement of the project will be to create suitable reactive monomers. Assuming that this is succesful we would apply for follow-on funding to develop OFETS based on the a wider range of high-mobility ambipolar DLC semiconductors","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G032726/1","grantId":"EP/G032726/1","fundValue":"97417","fundStart":"2009-01-12","fundEnd":"2010-06-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard James Bushby","coPersons":["Stephen  Evans","James Robert Henderson","John Benjamin Whitaker"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
