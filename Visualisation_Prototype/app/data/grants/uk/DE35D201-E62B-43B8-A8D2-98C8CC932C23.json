Physical activity can reduce heart problems, and there are many exercise programmes available for people with higher risk for heart disease. Unfortunately, people with rheumatoid arthritis are often not included in these programmes. This is most likely because both the people with arthritis and the people who should be referring the people with arthritis think that exercise will make the arthritis worse. There is a lot of evidence that exercise can be beneficial to arthritis patients. Getting these people to exercise is an important issue, however, keeping them physically active after the supervised exercise programme has stopped is also another important factor. In this study proposal we will design a psychological intervention to help people with rheumatoid arthritis to start exercise, and more importantly to motivate them to keep on exercising when the 3-month programme will stop. The exercise programme will be developed specifically for each participant. We will compare this exercise plus psychological intervention with a programme that will involve exercise only. We will then test if those who have the a 3-month supervised exercise programme combined with the psychological intervention, have better physical and psychological health over 1 year, compared to those who follow the same exercise programme but without the psychological intervention. We are specifically interested to see if there are any differences in the amount of physical activity and psychological well-being at 6 months and one year after the start of the study, and what the effects of the (hopefully increased) levels of physical activity are on the risk for heart disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802121","grantId":"G0802121","fundValue":"316827","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joan Lynne Duda","coPersons":["Jet J.C.S.
