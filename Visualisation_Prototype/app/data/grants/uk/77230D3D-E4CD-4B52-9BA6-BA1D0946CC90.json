{"id":"77230D3D-E4CD-4B52-9BA6-BA1D0946CC90","title":"A new simulation and optimisation platform for marine technology","abstractText":"The coastal zone plays a crucial part in addressing two of the most pressing issues facing humanity: energy supply and water resources. Marine renewable energy and desalination are both characterised by the deployment of relatively small-scale technology (for example, tidal turbines, or desalination plant outfalls) in large-scale ocean flows. Understanding the multi-scale interactions between sub-metre scale installations and ocean currents over tens of kilometres is crucial for assessing environmental impacts, and for optimisation to minimise project costs or maximise profits. The vast range of scales and physical processes involved, and the need to optimise complex coupled systems, represent highly daunting software development and computational challenges. Geographically, the UK is uniquely positioned to become a world leader in marine renewable energy, but adequate software will be a key factor in determining the success of this new industry.\n\nTo address this need, this project will re-engineer a unique CFD to marine scale modelling package to provide performance-portability, future-proofing and substantially increased capabilities. To motivate this we will target two applications: renewable energy generation via tidal turbine arrays and dense water discharge from desalination plants. Both are characterised by a common wide range of spatial and temporal scales, the need for design optimisation and accurate impact assessments, and a current lack of the required software.\n\nThis project will build upon several world-leading open source software projects from the assembled multi-disciplinary research team. This team already has a long and successful track record of working together on the development of high quality open source software which is able to exploit large-scale high performance computing and has been used widely in academia and industry. In addition, the project has assembled a wide range of suitable project partners to aid in the delivery of the project as well as to promote longer term impact. These include complementary centres of excellence in cutting-edge software development, industry leaders in the targeted application areas, marine consultancies, and those contributing to environmental regulation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M011054/1","grantId":"EP/M011054/1","fundValue":"434711","fundStart":"2015-03-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Matthew David Piggott","coPersons":["Paul  Kelly","Gerard  Gorman","David Anthony Ham"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
