{"id":"0AA76286-99EC-4A05-9DBF-808972562108","title":"Rocket Car Derby","abstractText":"<p>Rocket Car Derby was a hands-on activity in which families designed, built and tested a rocket-powered car. Rocket Car Derby was held on 15 March as part of the Cambridge Science Festival 2008. The activity was designed for children aged 7-13 and was hosted in the University Centre, which is centrally located in Cambridge. The activity was supported by a large team of Cambridge University engineers (staff, students and alumni) who assisted the participants with their design and construction. More than 1200 people participated over the course of the day.<br /><br />The cars were constructed around a simple rolled paper tube capped at one end. They were propelled up and off a ramp using an electrically-controlled compressed air launcher. Participants were able to investigate the variables which affect the distance travelled; these include wheel types, bearings, body design, car weight and ramp angle.<br /><br />All participants were able to take away a 'Home Challenge' kit which contained ideas to optimise and test their car at home. Teams were invited to send in pictures of the car they completed at home. These pictures were displayed on our Outreach website. Prizes were awarded for the most innovative and successful designs.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0163","grantId":"RES-168-26-0163","fundValue":"1966","fundStart":"2008-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey Thomas Parks","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
