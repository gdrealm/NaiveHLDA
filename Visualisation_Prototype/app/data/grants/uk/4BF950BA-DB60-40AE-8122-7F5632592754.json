Specific objectives are:\n1. To exchange expertise, specifically methodology and knowledge of the two crop systems\n2. To exchange molecular, culturing and physiological methodology applicable to bacterial endophyte research\n3. To compare the diversity of bacterial endophytes in tropical sugarcane and temperate Miscanthus\n4. To compare nitrogen fixation by bacterial endophytes in the two grasses\n5. To determine which bacteria may be exploited as biofertilizers to promote growth in both tropical and temperate energy crops on land unsuitable for primary food crops\n6. To develop a responsive mode grant proposal and ensure long term collaboration between the two groups\nThe proposal therefore contributes directly to BBSRC Priority areas 'Bioenergy' and 'Industrial Biotechnology'. We aim to generate a co-authored publication, and if our proposal is successful, we will determine the nitrogen fixation and plant growth promotion of the endophytes for agricultural application.
