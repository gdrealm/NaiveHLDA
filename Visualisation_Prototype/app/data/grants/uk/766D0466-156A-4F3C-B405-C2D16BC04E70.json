{"id":"766D0466-156A-4F3C-B405-C2D16BC04E70","title":"Issues in modal epistemology","abstractText":"We have very many modal beliefs - beliefs about what might and must be - and those beliefs are philosophically perplexing. So how can we form justified beliefs about what might have been the case but isn't so when our senses only ever tell us about how things are? I know that there are crows and I know that there are stripy things, for example, having seen items of both kinds. But what justifies my belief that there could be stripy crows even though none really exist? Why shouldn't stripyness and crowhood be as incompatible as squareness and roundness?\\n The puzzles deepen when one considers how we in fact arrive at modal beliefs. Many of those beliefs derive from our imaginative abilities: if I were asked why I believe that there could be stripy crows, I would cite my power to imagine them. But why think that our imaginations provide us with reliable information about how things might be? It's not as though our imaginings involve encounters with merely possible things just as our sensings generally involve encounters with real ones.\\n Despite the pressing nature of the philosophical issues raised by our modal beliefs, the philosophical study of modal knowledge - modal epistemology - is relatively undeveloped. It is therefore a very fertile area for new research on fundamental questions. My own work will investigate issues arising from the roles which our imaginations play in generating beliefs about what's possible. For instance, one strand of my research will examine the view that our imaginations, like our sensory powers, generate appearances of distinctive types, while another will investigate the philosophical consequences of our apparent ability to imagine situations featuring fictional characters.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F002394/1","grantId":"AH/F002394/1","fundValue":"22471","fundStart":"2008-02-11","fundEnd":"2008-06-10","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  They haven't yet had any demonstrable forms of impact of the sorts specified, in the few years that they have been publicly available: of course, it typically takes a while for highly abstract philosophical ideas to filter out of academia (the same is true of many areas of, say, mathematics), and it sometimes never happens. (This last is true of many of the most important areas of philosophy and also of, say, mathematics.)

(We spend plenty of time mulling over ways that events might have unfolded differently, for instance.) And these sorts of beliefs are integral not just to everyday life, but also to e.g. scientific investigations: we think that laws of nature tell us about how things must transpire, in some sense. My work investigated foundational aspects of our knowledge in this area, and in particular it investigated the roles of certain sorts of imagery within our mental lives. My work during this period of research leave lay the foundation for a much broader investigation of the nature of the information expressed by a huge variety of representations including pictures, sensory mental images, and many other 'distinctively sensory' representations. I then advanced those findings myself, in the course of a subsequent award.
