We characterised the termination-reinitiation signal of feline calicivirus (FCV) and demonstrated a role for initiation factor 3 in the process of reinitiation. This mechanism of reinitiation after translation of a long open reading frame (ORF) revealed why such events do not generally occur in mammalian mRNA translation.\n2. We characterised the primary sequence and mRNA secondary structural requirements for efficient termination reinitiation in FCV, influenza B virus (BM2) and murine norovirus (MNV). We demonstrated that an interaction between a viral mRNA primary sequence and helix 26 of ribosomal 18S RNA is essential for termination-reinitiation in FCV, BM2 and MNV. We also showed that the 18S rRNA complementary region is presented as part of a metastable stem-loop structure.\n3. We were able to demonstrate that reducing the frequency of reinitiation of the influenza BM2 ORF was detrimental to influenza B virus replication. These studies outlined the basic signals for translation termination-reinitiation and have aided the subsequent identification of novel examples of the phenomenon. Ultimately, the knowledge may prove useful in targeted antiviral therapy. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
