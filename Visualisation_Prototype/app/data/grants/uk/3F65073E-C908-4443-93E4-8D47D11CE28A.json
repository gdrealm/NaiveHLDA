Concerns about the geographies of science and technology feature prominently in the activities of government, industry and civil society, at many scales. There are questions around the production and implications of global knowledge economies, the spatial contexts for technological innovation and regulation, and the changing boundaries between public and private scientific enterprise. These issues are simultaneously reflected in efforts to create new spaces for publics to engage with the production of scientific knowledge and applications in diverse contexts. </p>\n\n<p>Such questions are the focus of recent academic research in different disciplines, with increased interest by Human Geographers in social studies of science and technology, whilst the Science and Technology Studies (STS) community has begun to address spatiality as a crucial aspect of the study of technoscience. However, despite this 'trading zone' for ideas and approaches, there has been surprisingly little sustained interaction between scholars in the two disciplines. This two-year ESRC seminar series aims to bring together researchers working from Geography and STS perspectives, alongside practitioners interested in the geographies of science, to develop shared insights and create new theoretical perspectives on the role of space in the practices of technoscience.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4166","grantId":"RES-451-25-4166","fundValue":"14318","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gail Frances Davies","coPersons":["Brian Leslie Balmer","Charles Robert Thorpe"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
