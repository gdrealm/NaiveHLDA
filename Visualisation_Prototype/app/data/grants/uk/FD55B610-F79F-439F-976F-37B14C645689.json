Within this broad scientific field, nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are especially interesting. NLO effects allow the manipulation of laser light beams and can therefore be used in electro-optical data processing, and also revolutionary all-optical technologies. We propose to use directed synthetic chemistry to prepare a range of new strongly coloured molecular salts designed to show very large NLO effects. The active molecules in these salts have 2D or 3D shapes and contain complexed metal ions such as iron or ruthenium which introduce extra potentially useful features. Adding or removing electrons (and/or protons in some cases) will allow us to reversibly control the optical properties of the dyes we prepare. The project will involve collaborative studies with a number of leading research groups in Europe, Australia and the USA, allowing us to both measure and understand by computer modelling the optical properties. Our work is driven primarily by scientific curiosity, but the long-term goal is to create new materials which may be useful in future optical data processing devices.Keywords describing areas of proposal: Synthetic Chemistry, Coordination Chemistry, Nonlinear Optics, Stark Spectroscopy","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D070732/1","grantId":"EP/D070732/1","fundValue":"285007","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Benjamin John Coe","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
