A typical example would be inferring the position and the velocity of a moving object using imperfect measurements from a radar or an optical sensor. The measurements are typically the distance between the sensor and the object and the angle with respect to a reference direction. New measurements are received periodically which are used to update the location and the velocity information. This problem of estimation of unobserved variables from the observed data is not unlike the problem of estimating current and future weather patterns from observed atmospheric data, or predicting the market implied volatility from the observed prices of financial instruments. In fact, similar 'state estimation' problems arise in many other branches of physical science, where one has to deal with equations describing the dynamics of a system involving randomness and a problem of inferring the values of unobserved variables from the values of the observed ones. A recursive procedure to infer unobserved variables by combining model predictions with observations is called a 'filter'. If the measurements occur at uniform time intervals and the dynamics of the system is linear, a recursive Bayesian inference procedure, called the Kalman filter, is well established in the academic literature and in practice in various fields. However, the linearity assumption about the system dynamics is invalid for many practically relevant time series models. Even simple filtering problems, such as that of dynamically inferring the position of a moving object in Cartesian coordinates from noisy measurements in polar coordinates, have severe nonlinearities. Further, the measurements may not occur at uniform time intervals in practice, e.g. measurement updates for position of a moving object from an optical sensor and from a satellite may arrive at a different rate. In some applications, such as modelling volatility of a financial asset which is traded at irregular time intervals, sampling measurements at a non-uniform rate may actually be advantageous. Currently, nonlinear time series filtering under variable sampling rate is handled by a procedure of local linearization of time series dynamics. Depending on the severity of nonlinearity, linearization procedures can lead to very poor estimates of the unobserved variables. Linearization also requires the existence and evaluation of gradient of the system dynamics, which is a major constraint.\n\nIn the last few years, several nonlinear filtering heuristics have emerged in the literature which do not rely on linearization of dynamics of the nonlinear system. The aim of this research proposal is to adapt some of these new filtering methods, which were originally developed for uniform sampling rate, to the variable sampling rate case. Support is sought for a one month visit of the principal investigator(PI) Dr Date to Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India, for collaborative research with Dr Bhaumik. Both PI and Dr Bhaumik are experienced academics who have contributed to development of nonlinear filtering methods which do not rely on explicit linearization, in different application domains (PI in financial modelling, Dr Bhaumik in tracking). The two researchers will work together to develop generic filtering algorithms for nonlinear filtering under variable sampling rate and test them on simulated as well as real experimental data. The research collaboration will continue after the end of the visit and will include externally sponsored doctoral students of both the academics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L019477/1","grantId":"EP/L019477/1","fundValue":"8774","fundStart":"2014-06-01","fundEnd":"2014-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paresh  Date","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
