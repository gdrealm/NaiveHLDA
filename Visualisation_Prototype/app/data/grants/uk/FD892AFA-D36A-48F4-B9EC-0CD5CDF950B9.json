Thus an explosion of interest in their study mirrors a pivotal role in diseased states. In order to manipulate biological systems effectively, there is a pressing need for small molecules that inhibit these interactions through strong and selective recognition of the interacting surfaces. The internal 'lock and key' type enzyme-substrate molecular recognition model has led to a good understanding of how to design small molecule inhibitors. However, it is not clear how the external 'hand gripping a ball' type recognition that occurs in protein-protein interactions, can be replicated using small molecules. Protein-protein interactions involve complementary large shapeless surfaces with multiple non-covalent contacts. In this work we will use small, easy to make, building-blocks that can be brought together using either a template directed synthesis, or self-organisation, to make 'protein surface mimics'; molecular entities that possess the molecular information necessary to recognise a protein surface and block the interaction it makes with its partner. Template- directed synthesis and self-assembly are methods used to assemble complex architectures from smaller components. They use the information within the components as an instruction set for the construction of the complex architecture. Methods that can do this are essential to the development of new strategies to understand and combat disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F039069/1","grantId":"EP/F039069/1","fundValue":"331528","fundStart":"2008-09-08","fundEnd":"2011-09-07","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The objective of this collaborative project (EP/F039069 and EP/F038712) with Queens University Belfast (QUB) was to demonstrate that functionalized metal tris(chelate) complexes can (a) be used as specific and selective receptors for protein-surfaces (b) be used to perturb protein-protein interactions. We were able to illustrate that functionalized ruthenium tris(chelate) complexes can act as potent and selective sensors for solvent exposed surfaces (Chem. Eur. J. 2010, 16, 100-103) and that the projection/ arrangement of protein binding groups from the ruthenium tris(chelate) complexes plays a significant role in determining the affinity of interaction with target proteins (Chem. Commun. 2011, 559-561 - collaborative publication with QUB). A thorough biophysical study on the molecular recognition properties of these ruthenium complexes has been undertaken, demonstrating they can be used to perturb protein-protein interactions (cyctochrome c- cytochrome c peroxidise), providing insights into the thermodynamic bases of protein-surface recognition and illustrating that the complexes perturb the stability of target proteins (Org. Biomol. Chem., 2013, 11, 2206-2212). These results illustrate that it is indeed possible to identify specific and selective receptors for protein-surfaces. In addition, we have illustrated that analogous iron tris(chelate) complexes which are labile can be used for protein surface recognition - in principle this is advantageous because several ligands in the presence of iron can form a virtual library inter-converting iron tris(chelate) complexes and upon addition of a template protein the library &amp;quot;natural selection&amp;quot; of the highest affinity receptor for the protein will take place.
