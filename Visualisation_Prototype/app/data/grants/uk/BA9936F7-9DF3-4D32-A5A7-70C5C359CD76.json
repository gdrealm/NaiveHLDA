Despite the relevance and applicability of this topic, there is surprisingly little known about the infant brain, and many fundamental questions remain. In this Co-operative group we intend to use several techniques to investigate the functional development of the brain in typically and atypically developing infants and toddlers. One method involves measuring the length of time that babies look toward different visual pictures, such as faces. Another method involves measuring small changes in voltage on the scalp as groups of nerve cells are active within the brain (ERP, EEG). A third method we intend to use involves measuring tiny changes in light as it passes through the baby?s head (NIRS). With these methods we will conduct experiments to discover how healthy babies and toddlers process information about their social and physical world. These experiments are designed to be enjoyable for babies, so their interest is maintained for some time. In addition, we will conduct similar studies on toddlers with developmental disorders (e.g. autism and Williams Syndrome) that effect their interaction with the social and physical worlds. The applicants will continue to present their research to the general public through media interviews and articles, and by writing and consulting on popular books and TV programmes. We will issue press releases when important scientific papers appear.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300025","grantId":"G0300025","fundValue":"5482","fundStart":"2003-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark H  Johnson","coPersons":["Clare Elizabeth Elwell","Denis  Mareschal","John Stephen Wyatt","Annette Dionne Karmiloff-Smith","Simon  Baron-Cohen","Martin  Eimer"],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
