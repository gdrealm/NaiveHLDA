This debilitating condition affects about 20% of adults in Europe and in the USA, i.e. more than 8 million adult patients in the UK alone, wrecking individual lives and causing huge economical damage, predominantly in terms of lost working days. One key issue is the fact that the symptomatic medication currently available is effective only in about 40% of chronic pain sufferers and even these patients struggle to maintain the balance between adequate pain relief and their ability to cope with the substantive drug-induced adverse effects. This creates a vicious cycle of insufficient analgesia and unbearable side effects ultimately leading to discontinuation of treatment. Despite these problems growth in the neuropathic pain market alone is forecasted to rise to over $6.3 billion by 2017. \n\nThe Concept:\n\nAs regards understanding the pathophysiology of chronic pain there is evidence that loss of inhibitory neuronal transmission within the spinal cord plays a key role. This reduced capacity to inhibit nerve activity, comparable to defective dampers inside a piano, contributes to a functional dysequilibrium state of the central nervous system referred to as central pain sensitisation. The loss involves a particular type of cell membrane-spanning protein channels operated by distinct messenger molecules, mainly glycine. Thus, enhancement of glycinergic neurotransmission should compensate for this loss. \n\nOur Proposal/Solution - A First-In-Kind Causal Treatment: \n\nConsequently, we propose to develop a novel class of compounds which do enhance glycinergic neurotransmission effectively and selectively at the spinal cord level, thereby achieving the intended effect while avoiding unwanted and dangerous side effects, e.g. deep sedation/loss of consciousness. By the end of this project we should to be ready for development into a drug that will be taken orally for a limited period of time in order to reset the proper equilibrium state of the patient's central nervous system. Our ultimate aim is allowing chronic pain patients to regain a dramatically improved quality of life.\n\nWhat has been achieved so far: We have successfully progressed to the discovery/synthesis of a novel class of compounds with selective enhancing effects at strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, which do not mediate sedative effects. We are confident that this feature makes our development program highly competitive, viable and significant and have protected the Intellectual Property by filing a composition of matter patent. Moreover, we have obtained proof-of-concept for one key compound in a rat model of neuropathic pain. \n\nWork Plan: The project is currently in the hit-to-lead stage development stage, i.e., we do already know that our concept works but we need to further improve chemistry features of our compounds in preparation for our ultimate aim, i.e. generating drugs which are safe/effective and can be taken orally, e.g. 3 times/day. We plan to achieve such optimised leads within two years. \n\nImpact:\n\nIn view of the huge numbers of patients worldwide whose lives are wrecked by chronic pain, the fact that current treatment options are clearly insufficient and the dramatic toll on economies caused by millions of lost working hours, it is safe to say that our first-in-kind causal treatment option has the potential to have a dramatic beneficial impact on individuals and societies.\n\nOur Solution Has Potential To Be A Platform-Technology:\n\nWe are confident, that our proposal can provide a platform technology addressing further medical conditions, e.g., opioid-withdrawal, alcoholism and anxiety. \n\n\nPlanned Route-to-Market/Exit Strategy: \n\nTwo pharmaceutical companies, Grunenthal and B.Braun have confirmed their desire to collaborate with our group, and each other, in the event of a successful completion of this programme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J014826/1","grantId":"MR/J014826/1","fundValue":"1144370","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Leuwer","coPersons":["Jeremy John Lambert","Paul  O'Neill","Stephen Brendan McMahon","Brian Kevin Park","Delia  Belelli","Neil Graham Berry"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
