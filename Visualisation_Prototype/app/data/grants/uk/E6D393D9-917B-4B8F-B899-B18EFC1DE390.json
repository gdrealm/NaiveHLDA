This research project explores the experiences; issues and needs of children aged 11-16 living in the Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) Growth Area. It will study children's sense of belonging to their community and implications for their 'citizenship'. </p>\n\n<p>There is significant evidence that young people are seldom meaningfully involved in urban planning and policy making. An aim of the project is to investigate opportunities and barriers for children and young people's participation during rapid urban change. The research explores the knowledge transfer methods that best ensure children can participate in such planning and design. The mobility patterns of children participating in the project will be explored through a range of innovative technologies including GPS navigation systems, text messages to specially provided mobile phones about their daily activities, and web-based electronic forums where they can meet and debate issues online. These methods are combined with interviews and participant observation of children's everyday activities.</p>\n\n<p>The research brings together researchers from the University of Warwick, the University of Leicester and the University of Northampton. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1549","grantId":"RES-062-23-1549","fundValue":"647681","fundStart":"2009-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Pia Haudrup Christensen","coPersons":["Peter  Kraftl","John  Horton"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
