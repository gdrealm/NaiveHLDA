Psychological models of psychosis have suggested that it is the meaning or interpretation given to such experiences that determine whether or not they develop into a diagnosable mental illness.\n\nOur research has shown that specific types of interpretations are important in differentiating between people who stay well and those who become ill. However, these studies are based on interviews, and we now need to investigate more systematically people?s interpretations of different types of experiences using experimental tasks. \n\nWe know that some psychological (e.g., specific reasoning styles) and social (e.g., social deprivation) factors make people more vulnerable to developing psychosis. However, we do not know whether these factors are linked to developing unusual experiences, or to their unhelpful interpretations. \n\nWe will carry out two studies to look at these issues. The first will compare the interpretations of healthy people with individuals reporting unusual experiences, both with and without a diagnosed mental illness, on tasks inducing unusual experiences. The second will look at which psychological and social factors are linked to unhelpful interpretations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100568","grantId":"G1100568","fundValue":"547659","fundStart":"2012-02-22","fundEnd":"2016-02-20","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Emmanuelle  Peters","coPersons":["Philippa  Garety","M C Jackson"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
