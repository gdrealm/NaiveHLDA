Early detection of the cancer has sufficient benefits to the patient because the treatment is less complicated and can be performed without having a significant effect on fertility. The research in this study will provide a new way of achieving early detection in a non-invasive manner. The principle is to use ultrathin gold wires (approximately one hundred thousand times smaller than a human hair) to electrically sense the presence of small quantities of specific biomarker proteins (HCG). The sensor works by simply flowing a current through the ultrathin gold nanowires. After the attachment of the HCG protein onto the specifically biofunctionalised nanowire, we will be able to detect a change in the electrical current flowing through the wire. This will be the first time ultrathin metal wires have been used in this manner to detect proteins. Once proven successful we will study the ability of these nanowires to sense other important biomarker proteins. During the course of this research I will be performing four-probe transport measurements on chemically synthesized ultrathin gold nanowires to determine the effect the nanoscale dimensions have on the resistivity. In addition to the experiments, we will be generating computation models to provide us with a detailed fundamental understanding of the sensing capability of ultrathin NWs. Beyond this research program, we plan to extend the biosensing capabilities of the NWs to detect other cancers and diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01513X/1","grantId":"EP/J01513X/1","fundValue":"99998","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2013-10-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  We have develop methods for synthesizing ultrathin aold nanowires.

","person":"Kevin  Critchley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" We have developed techniques for fabricating ultrathin gold nanowires in organic solutions. The range of size is in the order of 3- 10 nm in diameter and several hundred nanometers to microns in length. We have established a route for producing mg's of nanowires within a few hours in a batch process. We have been able to measure the conductivity using two-probe STM. We also demonstrated that we could perform thiol-based ligand exchange which enables us to modify the reactivity of the gold surface. We hope that this will enable us to use the nanowires as sensors in the near future. We also demonstrated that the nanowires could self-assemble between gold contact pads enabling us to fabricate devices on chip.\n\n\n\nWhilst exploring this technology we also studied techniques for polymer coating nanoparticles. This was found to be useful for coating quantum dots. We also expolred the interactions of nanoparticles with cell membrane mimics (phospholipids) It is too early to be applied in the non-academic context. Once we have established that the gold nanowires respond as sensors we envisage developing a reproducible fabrication technique for making devices on chip (combining traditional lithography with nanowire synthesis). Once this is demonstrated in practice we will collaborate with local SMEs that have established biosensing technologies. Electronics,Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
