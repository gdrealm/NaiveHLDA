This energy-requiring process is driven by the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cells' molecular fuel. Muscle cells specialise in converting this chemical energy into movement and mechanical work with their precisely dimensioned and aligned filaments to maximise power output, speed, fatigue resistance and efficiency of movement. At the molecular level, the movement is brought about by a cyclical change in conformation in one of the main protein, myosin. The details of the changes in protein conformation and their link to the steps in the ATP breakdown process are not known. In this project, we intend to develop advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques to measure changes in protein conformation during force production. To do this, we intend to attach fluorescent molecules to specific regions on the myosin molecule and make use of an energy transfer process to measure distances in the nm range. The process of energy transfer implies that the fluorescence emission of one molecule is affected by the fluorescence mechanism of the other, in a distance-specific manner. The regular arrangement of filaments into sarcomeres allows spatial averaging over dozens of functionally equivalent segments, thus giving rise to an improvement in the signal/noise ratio that is not available in other living cells. With this novel method, we plan to investigate changes in the distance between the fluorescent molecules specifically attached on myosin during force development and during perturbations of the muscle length. The result will be a map of the movement of these parts of the myosin molecule, and the determination of the time-course of these movements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I019448/1","grantId":"BB/I019448/1","fundValue":"371765","fundStart":"2011-08-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Alan Ferenczi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
