In order to undertake the proposed survey, a US-Europe-China collaboration has come together with the aim of constructing a 5000-fibre spectrograph that will be deployed on the Mayall 4m telescope at the Kitt Peak Observatory in the US. A wide range of additional science is possible using the 5000 fibre multi-object spectrograph required for this experiment, including studying galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy cluster surveys, the structure of the Milky-Way galaxy and Galactic archaeology.\n\nThe UK has internationally regarded expertise in several key areas of the proposed instrument, in particular being involved in the the optical corrector (consisting of six nearly metre sized optics), and the fibre system that takes the light from the focal plane to the spectrograph. The proposed research enables the UK to be involved in the optical and mechanical design and development work leading to the full instrument specification.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L00299X/1","grantId":"ST/L00299X/1","fundValue":"33205","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-04-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Peter Doel","coPersons":["Ofer  Lahav","Filipe Batoni Abdalla"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
