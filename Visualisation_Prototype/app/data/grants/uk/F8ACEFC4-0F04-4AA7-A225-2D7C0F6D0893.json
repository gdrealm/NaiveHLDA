{"id":"F8ACEFC4-0F04-4AA7-A225-2D7C0F6D0893","title":"Quantum spintronics using donors in isotopically engineered silicon","abstractText":"The exquisite control over materials fabrication and spin control techniques has reached a maturity where spintronics can go beyond purely classical effects and begin to fully exploit the unique quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. Potential applications arising from quantum spintronics range from quantum information processors, including the transmission of quantum information via itinerant electron spins, single microwave photon storage within spin ensembles, and new generation of sensors exploiting entanglement to yield fundamentally enhanced precision. Key ingredients for quantum spintronics include the preservation of spin coherence and the generation of high-purity entanglement. Through this collaborative research project, we propose to address both of these challenges using both the electron and nuclear spin of donors in isotopically engineered silicon. Our preliminary experiments show that such materials offer the greatest potential for high-purity entanglement and long coherence times, and their potential integration within conventional electronics is a further advantage.Through our initial collaboration, we have already demonstrated 'psuedo-entanglement' between the electron and nuclear spin associated with a P-donor in silicon at X-band (0.3 T) and 6K. We have used the fidelities which we achieved in those experiments to calculate thresholds for generating pure entanglement by this technique: for example moving to higher magnetic fields (&gt;3.5T) and lower temperatures (&lt;4K). We possess the major instrumentation to meet these requirements, and will demonstrate the controlled generation of pure spin entanglement within silicon as part of this project. We will then develop methods for preserving entanglement and understand the effect of spin transport.The isotopic purification of silicon to 28Si yields dramatic improvements in the donor electron spin coherence to tens of milliseconds. However, the nuclear spin is a powerful resource into which the coherent electron spin state may be temporarily stored and retrieved. We have demonstrated the use of the nuclear spin as a quantum memory in this way, yielding coherence times up to several seconds. We will understand the mechanisms for spin decoherence and, using materials refinement and active techniques such as dynamic decoupling and error-correction, we will push the limits of the longest spin coherences times in the solid state. The spin ensembles which we will be studying are capable of storing multiple bits of information in distributed states, analogous to holographic information storage. We shall build on our initial work, in which we stored and retrieved 100 coherent weak microwave excitations within an ensemble, to establish multimode quantum memories working i) at low applied magnetic fields ii) down to the single photon level iii) capable of storing coherent quantum states for several seconds.Throughout this project we will be performing an iterative development of instrumentation and materials: longer coherence times enabled by the isotopically engineered materials will push us to the limits of our instrumentation, and by improving the instrumentation we can then extract and understand intrinsic properties of the materials so that they may be further enhanced.At the end of the project we shall have established donor spins in isotopically engineered silicon as the forerunner material for quantum spintronics and demonstrated the essential components for a quantum spintronics device.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H025952/2","grantId":"EP/H025952/2","fundValue":"11845","fundStart":"2012-12-31","fundEnd":"2013-07-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The collaboration with Kohei Itoh's group at Keio University, supported by this grant, began demonstrating the key advantages of isotopic engineering of silicon to obtain the longest possible spin coherence lifetimes and control fidelities. \n\nThis has had a major effect in the direction of research around the world, with a much greater focused placed on isotopically enriched silicon-28, both for donor- and quantum-dot -based approaches to silicon quantum technologies. This has affected research directions in academia (e.g. UNSW in Australia), and private and government labs (e.g. Sandia National Labs, Hughes Research Labs). More and more groups are now focusing on ways to obtain isotopically enriched 28Si precursor gases and grow isotopically enriched material. \n\nThere have also been indirect impacts in areas such as the Avogadro project, which seeks to create a new standard for the kilogram using isotopically enriched 28Si. By making excellent use of this material, the results from this grant have helped make the case for an new Avogadro project providing 28Si both for metrology and for quantum technologies.\n\n(Note: This is the same summary as for EP/H025952/1 as this is the same award which was moved from Oxford to UCL when I changed my appointment)  ","person":"John Julian Morton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" Our key *Objectives* of the grant have been met:\n\n1. &quot;To pursue ultra-long spin coherence times of donors in silicon&quot;, including developing control and measurement instrumentation, refine silicon materials, and assess bismuth for nuclear spin quantum memory. These goals have been achieved and presented in many of the publications listed (including Tyryshkin et al., Nature Materials (2012), Steger et al., Science (2012) and Saeedi et al., Science (2013)). In particular, they have led to world-record spin coherence times - the longest out of any spin in the solid state - and also initiated many studies on bismuth donors in silicon in international labs.\n\n2. &quot;To exploit donor electron and nuclear spins of donors in silicon for multimode microwave memories&quot; starting by optimising spin coherence in Bi-doped 28Si (e.g. using atomic clock transitions), and ultimately transferring the state of a superconducting qubit, via a single microwave photon, into an ensemble of Bi donors. The first of these goals was presented in Wolfowicz et al., Nature Nanotechnology (2013) and showed for the first time that atomic clock transitions which were inherently insensitive to small changes in magnetic field could be accessed for donors in silicon, leading to dramatic enhancements in the coherence time of donors in either natural silicon, or enriched 28-silicon material. The ultimate goal of this workpackage (to transfer the state of a superconducting qubit to/from an ensemble of Bi donors) is still being actively pursued and we have very recently obtained the breakthrough result of coupling Bi donors to a superconducting resonator in a dilution fridge at low magnetic field.\n\n3. &quot;Spin entanglement using donors in silicon&quot; was fully demonstrated and reported in Simmons et al. Nature (2010). This received much attention in the popular press (including the New York Times) and also highlighted the power of global control in accurately manipulating 10 billion entangled spin pairs. The result was the first on-demand demonstration of entanglement within an ensemble of spins.\n\n4 &amp;amp;amp;amp; 5. &quot;To understand the spin coherence properties of donors at very low applied magnetic fields, and to transfer the techniques and materials developed into single- or few-donor devices, exploiting established collaborations&quot; was realised, most notably through collaborations of both the UK and Japanese teams with UNSW in Australia, presented in papers such as Pla et al. Nature 2012 and 2013.\n\n6. &quot;Theory of spin decoherence mechanisms and mitigation and the controlled removal of an electron spin on nuclear coherence and entanglement&quot; has also been presented in several of the publications listed, including for example Schaffry et al Phys Rev Lett (2010).\n\nFinally, the overarching aim of this grant to foster collaboration between groups in the UK and Japan has been fully realised, with many bilateral exchanges between the UK groups and Keio group and a particular emphasis on early career researchers such as PhD students and post-docs. We organised a joint international workshop in London on February 2013 to mark the end of the official grant, but the collaboration, exchange of researchers and joint publications are ongoing.\n\n(Note: This is the same summary as for EP/H025952/1 as this is the same award which was moved from Oxford to UCL when I changed my appointment) The results of this award have been very actively presented in publications (including many high-impact journals aimed a broad readerships) as well as invited talks.

This has profound importance for the compatibility and integration of quantum and classical technologies. Our results informs choices about what materials infrastructure to invest in to accelerate the development of quantum technologies, so that companies and/or countries can look to maintain or achieve a leading position in developing such technologies.
