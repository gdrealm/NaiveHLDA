One of the most important yet most intractable problems is to understand how the magma reservoir beneath ridges generates the lower crust, especially at fast spreading rates. Gabbroic rocks from fast-spread lower crust are normally inaccessible; only in the Hess Deep rift valley (E Pacific) is a substantial section known to be exposed. We propose to survey this unique section using a remotely-operated vehicle in order to satisfy site survey requirements for the highly-ranked IODP proposal #551. In addition we plan to conduct our own sampling programme using the British Geological Survey's 'BRIDGE' seabed rock drill to obtain large numbers of short (1 m) orientated cores in transects through the gabbro section. Constraining heat and mass flux from the Earth's mantle to crust and crust to ocean, and testing conflicting models for the functioning of mid-ocean ridge magma chambers, can only be tested by direct observation and sampling. Fully oriented cores are imperative to address many of the outstanding questions and these capabilities of the BRIDGE drill remain unique. This survey will not only augment the IODP proposal but will in its own right also answer many critical questions that IODP operations cannot tackle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/C509023/1","grantId":"NE/C509023/1","fundValue":"332992","fundStart":"2008-01-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher John MacLeod","coPersons":["Damon Andrew Teagle"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" (1) Collected essential site survey data that allowed Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Proposal 551 to be scheduled for drilling and subsequently drilled on Expedition 345.\n(2) At the same time, made the first sampling of an essentially complete section of in situ fast-spread lower ocean crust, and by so doing directly test conceptual models for mid-ocean ridge magma chamber processes. Our results are key for all IODP Expedition 345 participants. Our scientific models, when all are finally completed, will form the basis for a new paradigm for understanding mid-ocean ridge magma chamber processes.
