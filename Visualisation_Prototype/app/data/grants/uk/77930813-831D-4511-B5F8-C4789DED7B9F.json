It will provide direct access to widely scattered research resources (dictionaries, corpora of texts, images of original documents etc.), to computing power needed to enable the researcher to work with them, and in collaboration with other researchers in remote locations, in a fully integrated environment. Early indications of an extensive user requirements survey carried out by the 'Building a Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities' (BVREH) project has detailed a desire for such a tool and that there are clear needs to be addressed.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E005365/1","grantId":"EP/E005365/1","fundValue":"36233","fundStart":"2006-09-06","fundEnd":"2006-12-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Charles Vollgraff Crowther","coPersons":["Matthew David Mascord","Alan Keir Bowman"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
