{"id":"B10FFACD-84F4-4D99-95D3-35FD10B96961","title":"Physics-Life Sciences Interface C-DIP Fellowship Fund, EPSRC Leadership Fellowship Dr. Paola Borri","abstractText":"As a physicists appointed to the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University I have direct experience of the benefits but also of the challenges associated with working at the interface between physics and the life sciences. While at Cardiff University there is growing interest in this cross-disciplinary research, an organised mechanism is missing to create awareness of the available expertise, to connect researchers from physics and the life sciences both within UK and internationally, and to initiate new cross-disciplinary research.I propose to make use of the C-DIP fund to overcome this shortfall and support organised activities which will promote and stimulate cross-disciplinary research at the physics-life science interface at Cardiff University and in the wider scientific community. These activities will comprise:i) a series of one-day topical meetings held at Cardiff University covering research subjects at the physics-life science interfaceii) a mini-symposium to provide a forum in which leading scientists and early-career researchers can meet and interactiii) visits from/to outstanding overseas scientists working at the physics-life sciences interface iv) seed corn funding to complete a piece of research or to carry out initial research at the physics-life sciences interface.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I016260/1","grantId":"EP/I016260/1","fundValue":"77905","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Paola  Borri","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
