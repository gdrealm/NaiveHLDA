GECAFS aims to determine strategies to cope with the impacts of global environmental change on food systems and to assess the environmental and socioeconomic consequences of adaptive responses aimed at improving food security. ESRC funding supports a Science Officer to develop and coordinate international research on the vulnerability and adaptation of food systems to environmental change. The research bridges both natural and social scientific understandings of food systems and stresses collaboration with field research to refine and elaborate analytical frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Methods include:</p>\n\n<p>Leading a process of research synthesis arising from collaborative research activities on key issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Understanding food systems;</li>\n\n <li>Assessing the vulnerability of food systems to global environmental change;</li>\n\n <li>Identifying potential adaptation options to increase the resilience of food systems to GEC while ensuring that food security is achieved;</li>\n\n <li>Using scenarios and other tools to assess the feedbacks from food system adaptations, to try to mitigate negative social and environmental consequences.</li>\n\n <li>That the research frameworks and findings on the vulnerability and adaptation of food systems are relevant and applicable to decision-making and policy processes.<br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-344-25-0001","grantId":"RES-344-25-0001","fundValue":"126348","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Diana  Liverman","coPersons":["John  Ingram"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
