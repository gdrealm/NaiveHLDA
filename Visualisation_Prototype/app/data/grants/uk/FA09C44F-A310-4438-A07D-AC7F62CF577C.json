Worldwide, every year there are 200 million people at risk of fragility fractures and over 1.6 million hip fractures, which have a mortality rate of more than 20% in the first year alone. Accelerating the repair of these fractures will reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable group of patients. Yet there is currently no approved therapy to achieve this. Furthermore, orthopaedic implants used to fix the fractures to restore functional anatomy and enable early mobilisation tend to not attach to or cut out of the weakened osteoporotic bone. \n\nUsing tissue discarded at surgery from patients with severe open leg fractures, we found that pro-inflammatory cytokines normally released at the fracture site attract the body's own stem cells and induce them to make bone. This exciting observation provides a simpler, safer, quicker and cheaper alternative repair strategy to cell-based therapy, which involves growing and genetically manipulating stem cells in the lab and reintroducing them back into the patient. Using an established animal model, we showed that local addition of the cytokine, TNF, during the early phase of fracture healing, leads to significantly faster healing. We have gone on to demonstrate that this is also the case for fractures of fragile osteoporotic bone. We have also developed a murine model using a screw implant that is routinely used in clinical practice to assess whether local administration of TNF improves implant attachment in weakened bone. \n\nThis grant proposal will enable the development of a safe, reproducible delivery strategy for therapy to accelerate repair of weak osteoporotic bone. The collaboration between the Kennedy Institute, University of Oxford, UK, and Halozyme Therapeutics, USA, will allow us to produce a formulation to accurately deliver TNF at the fracture or orthopaedic implant site. The formulation, comprising constituents already approved for clinical use, will be injectable and tested on cells followed by animal studies that are specifically designed to mimic the problems found in the clinic, including various types of fragile bone. By the conclusion of this work, we will have all the results necessary to proceed to clinical trials for accelerating the healing of fractures and improving implant adherence in osteoporotic bone to deliver clinical benefit to needy patients.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K007939/1","grantId":"MR/K007939/1","fundValue":"418706","fundStart":"2013-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jagdeep  Nanchahal","coPersons":["Marc  Feldmann","Nicole  Horwood"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
