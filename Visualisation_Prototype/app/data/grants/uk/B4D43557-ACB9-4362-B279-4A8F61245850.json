It follows therefore that in diseases that are spread by contact, infected individuals are more likely to contact other individuals that are close by or within certain social groups with whom they interact more. The disease therefore spreads spatially through the populations. There has been a number of computer models that show that this spatial spread can have a major effect on the disease dynamics, but our work has shown that this spatial structure can have important implications to the evolution of parasites. In particular if they tend to spread locally, they are selected for lower transmission and virulence. \n\nBut how do we test this kind of theory? One way is experimentally where we artificially manipulate the range of transmission and examine the impact on the evolution of the parasite. We have previously developed an insect virus system in which we can manipulate how locally the hosts move. and our recent work using this system has confirmed the predictions of the theory; virulence was lower in the more viscose population. This is a good experimental test of the theory, but we now propose to see whether this theory is relevant in an important real world disease system. We propose to examine the role of structure created by different rearing practices in the honeybee on the virulence of their parasite, the varroa mite. \n\nHoney bees are under threat from a wide range of parasites of which the varroa mite is one of the most important. We will manipulate transmission of the mite in a replicated experimental design. The transmission will range from local between nearest colonies to global over large differences. With this manipulation we will see whether local transmission does indeed allow less virulent mites to persist. We will develop new theory that is tailored to the honey bee system and examines how different bee rearing practices are predicted to impact on the virulence of the parasites. \n\nIn addition we will develop new theory on how variation in susceptibility within host populations impacts on parasite virulence and test the predictions of the theory within the established honey bee system. The overall aim is to gain a better understanding of how to virulence evolves in order to improve the management of disease with a particular focus on a major disease of honey bees.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L010879/1","grantId":"BB/L010879/1","fundValue":"314082","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2019-03-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Boots","coPersons":["Andrew  White"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The grant has just started The grant has just started Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
