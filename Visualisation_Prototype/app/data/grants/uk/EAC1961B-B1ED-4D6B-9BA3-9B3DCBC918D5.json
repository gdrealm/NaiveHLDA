{"id":"EAC1961B-B1ED-4D6B-9BA3-9B3DCBC918D5","title":"Pathogenetic Mechanism and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Fatigue in Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)","abstractText":"The chronic liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which affects up to 20,000 patients in the UK, is characterised by profound, often life-altering, fatigue. At present we neither understand why PBC patients get fatigue nor have any effective treatments for that fatigue. The aim of this project is to explore the mechanisms which are responsible for fatigue in PBC in order to identify potential new avenues for treatment. We intend to use new technologies to study brain function, peripheral muscle function (including the effectiveness of muscle when undertaking exercise) and the function of the autonomic system (the part of the nervous system that prepares the body for every-day function including exercise). Fatigue is a difficult symptom for patients, and one that generates much controversy. This study is unique in that it systematically studies a series of potential aetiological factors in the same patients, whilst including a control group of patients who suffer from the same underlying condition, but who do not experience the symptom. The ability to diagnose the disease in the absence of the symptom provides unique opportunities in the study of fatigue which are not available in conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, where the presence of the symptom is required for disease diagnosis. PBC could therefore potentially represent a useful human model for the study of fatigue.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500020","grantId":"G0500020","fundValue":"198422","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Emrys Jones","coPersons":["Julia  Newton","Simon  Bamforth","Roy  Taylor"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
