{"id":"5E00A206-7109-4EE2-A3F2-E7EEE6B82FE8","title":"Developing Media Literacy: From Research to Practice","abstractText":"<p>This project is a programme of knowledge exchange activities following on from a recently completed ESRC-funded research project ‘Developing Media Literacy: Towards a Model of Learning Progression’. Researchers are working with some of the teachers and developers of educational materials who have been involved in the earlier research, in order to generate a set of outcomes that will maximise the impact of the research on educational practice. These outcomes focus specifically on the primary school age range, and include: <br /><br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>teaching materials for use in classrooms</li>\n\n <li>professional development resources for teachers</li>\n\n <li>curriculum plans that will facilitate the development of media literacy education in schools.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The work is centrally informed by the key findings of the research in relation to learning progression, and build on existing materials developed in the course of the earlier research, which are being revised and developed in light of further piloting in the schools. The outcomes will be published online by the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education and the English and Media Centre (the project partners), and disseminated through a series of professional development activities, conference workshops and articles in professional and academic journals.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J010308/1","grantId":"ES/J010308/1","fundValue":"99363","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Impact report and key findings contained in final report submitted in April 2013 Education Societal","person":"David  Buckingham","coPersons":["Andrew Nicholas Burn"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":" Please see final report submitted in April 2014 Please see final report Education","dataset":"gtr"}
