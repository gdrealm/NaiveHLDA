The activity will involve poster displays, hands-on exhibits and demonstrations and discussions with active young researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The project will take place at Durham Science Festival held at Durham University Science Site in the week of&nbsp; 26 March 2007. The target audience are Year 9 and Year 10 science students from secondary schools in the North East. The expected attandance is about 500 pupils. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-168-26-0095","grantId":"RES-168-26-0095","fundValue":"1450","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This was a small grant (?1450) under the National Science Week awards scheme, to purchase items for the Amazing Materials demo/display for the Durham Science Festival.\nDue to the nature of the award (not a research grant), there were no data or findings generated.
