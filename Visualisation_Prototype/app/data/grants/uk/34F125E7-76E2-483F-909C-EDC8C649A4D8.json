We know a substantial amount about how motor areas in the cerebral cortex contribute to bimanual movements but several other structures in the brain are also involved. One such structure is the spinal cord, as it has a strong bilateral anatomy, but its contribution in bimanual movements is far from clear. \n In this project, I will study the bilateral organisation in the spinal cord firstly by recording in monkeys the responses in muscles from weak electrical stimulation of the two main descending pathways responsible for arm movements - namely the corticospinal tract, which carries information from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, and the reticulospinal tract, which carries information to from the brainstem to the spinal cord. By recording the responses in muscles from both arms it will be possible to assess how these structures can activate muscles bilaterally. The stimulation will be performed while the monkeys are at rest but also during raching and grasping movements with either or both hands together. This will tells us whether the bilateral context of a movement has an impact on these effects. In a similar fashion, sensory nerves in one hand will be stimulated at rest and during movement - the responses in the muscles of the other hand will be measured. This will tell us how sensory information can affect movements of the opposite arm and whether this depends if both or either hand is being used.\n In the second part of the project, direct recordings of spinal activity will be made during arm movements. The activity of neurones during the same task as above will be recorded and subsequently the cells will be tested to see what bilateral sensory and descending inputs they receive. This will provide two types of information - firstly, it will tells us about the convergence of bilateral descending and sensory inputs - how many cells receive both, either or none, and secondly we can look at how the response of these cells during different movements relates to their inputs e.g. do cells that receive bilateral descending inputs fire differently from those that do not?\n Previous studies in man have shown that perturbing one arm can cause a response on the other arm and these 'crossed effects' tend to be stronger during bilateral movements. Very little work has been done on crossed effects in hand muscles. In conjunction with the experiments in monkeys above, stimulation studies will also be carried out in human volunteers. These will assess how spinal circuits controlling the hand muscles can be modulated by sensory stimulation from the opposite hand. Subjects will perform a variety of movements that require use of the intrinsic hand muscles with either or both hands. By stimulating sensory nerves on one arm I will assess how crossed effects in hand muscles depend on the bilateral context of the movements. The expectation is that crossed effects will be stronger during bimanual movements compared to movements with one hand only.\n The data collected in this project will provide information on how descending and sensory information can affect spinal circuits and muscles bilaterally and how bilateral movements can modulate these interactions. This has implications for patients with stroke or incomplete spinal cord injury.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K023012/1","grantId":"MR/K023012/1","fundValue":"512796","fundStart":"2013-05-06","fundEnd":"2016-11-05","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Demetris Soteris Soteropoulos","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
