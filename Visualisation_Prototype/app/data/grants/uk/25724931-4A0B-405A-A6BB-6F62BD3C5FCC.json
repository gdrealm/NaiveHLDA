Despite this, a recent review by three world-leaders in the field of environmental turbulence [Ivey et al 2008] emphasises that our sampling of this phenomenon 'does not begin to approach' a reliable representation of its magnitude or spatio-temporal structure. As a result, there remain very large, untested areas of our understanding of problems ranging from the global-scale cycling of heat in the oceans, to the patterns of nutrient cycling in small lakes. This problem is so persistent because of the highly variable nature of turbulence, and the fact that current instrumentation can only measure it at a very limited number of points for any significant time, or for a short time (a quasi-instantaneous snapshot) at any significant number of points. The aim of this project is to investigate whether existing turbulence profile data can provide us with a detailed and reliable history of turbulent activity and thus allow us to expand the extent to which we can sample it. The approach focuses on the apparently ubiquitous (and hitherto not analysed) presence of small-scale layering that is revealed in micro-scale temperature profiles of thermally-stratified water bodies. While some (e.g. MacIntyre, pers. comm.) argue that they are caused by internal wave motions which locally squash and stretch the isotherms, thus distorting vertical temperature profiles, there is also the strong possibility that at least some are the result of local turbulent mixing. The current approach to analysing microstructure profiles for turbulence data considers only the evidence of active turbulence within the profile. It either identifies statistically stationary segments, from which it determines measures of vertical turbulent diffusivity, or it identifies turbulent patches. This project will compare the turbulence distributions identified through those methods with the fine-scale stratification structure. From this, relationships will be identified between measures of turbulent overturn characteristics and the underlying stratification, and distinctions made between regions of fine-scale stratification structure which are actively turbulent and those which are not. We will test the hypothesis that we can use the former to develop stratification-turbulence relationships that would allow use of the fine-scale stratification data as a proxy for turbulent activity, and then apply that relationship to the latter to quantify the historical turbulent activity evidenced in these footprints of now-decayed turbulence. We hypothesise further that this would, at least, give us an upper limit on the historical turbulence intensity (i.e. it would assume that all the fine-scale stratification structure was caused by now-decayed turbulence), and would provide pump-priming for further investigation of this phenomenon that would (a) investigate ways of distinguishing turbulence footprints from internal wave footprints; and (b) compare this physical fine scale structure with that in chemical and biological parameters and allow us to infer its biogeochemical and ecological relevance. The project addresses an issue - turbulent mixing - that is central to biogeochemical and thermal cycling in lakes, and thus efforts to enhance the quality of lakes and research into the role of lakes in global nutrient cycles and climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/G010498/1","grantId":"NE/G010498/1","fundValue":"50752","fundStart":"2009-08-17","fundEnd":"2010-08-16","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  They haven't.

Education Cultural","person":"Andrew  Folkard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" The project developed computer code for analysing high-resolution (mm-scale) vertical temperature profiles of lakes in terms of their stratification structure - the extent to which layers of well-mixed water separated by temperature-stratified layers can be discerned at all scales. The layering structure of these profiles from several different lakes was found to be fractal, with a fractal dimension of approximately 1.4 common to all profiles measured. Discrepancies from this general relationship at certain scales were identified as indicating that these scales had less structure than expected (if the number of layers is less than that predicted by the fractal curve) or more structure than expected (if the number of layers is greater than predicted by the fractal curve). This allows us to identify dominant scales of layering, and scales at which layering is relatively &quot;quiet&quot;, the latter being thought of as boundary scales between distinct smaller and larger scale regions of activity. These dominant and boundary scales are found to be different between profiles from different lakes, between profiles from the same lake at different times, and between different sections (depth segments) of the profiles. The layering may be caused by either turbulence or internal wave motions within the lakes. By applying this new analysis to models of these processes in idealised stratified water columns, we intend to understand the significance of these dominant and boundary scales, and their implications for predicting the effects of lake mixing processes on lake biota and water quality. Limited - the outcome is more an analytical procedure that can be used in analysis of temperature profiles of lakes. This may turn out to be of value in a non-academic context once I have been able to understand how best to use the procedure and exactly what its outputs mean, but it is not at that stage at present. The project did not get as far as was hoped, but has provided a crucial springboard for work in this area, as well as enabling a clear analytical procedure to be developed and the many snags in it ironed out. Work is till ongoing to get it to the point where it can be publicised and exploited. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
