{"id":"9C4B8BBD-4E98-44B1-8835-C948A48E21A5","title":"HIV-Host Interactions","abstractText":"As adult, paediatric and adolescent HIV infections continue to spread worldwide, the need to augment anti-retroviral treatments remains of the utmost importance. This is illustrated by the lack of an effective HIV vaccine, and the economic, compliance, toxicity and viral resistance concerns that accompany current therapies targeted against the viral proteins reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR). Accordingly, considering other HIV (or human) proteins as potential targets for new generations of anti-virals is a crucial goal of current AIDS research. Through laboratory-based studies, we discovered that an HIV protein, called Vif, is essential for virus growth because it blocks the activity of two human cell proteins, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, that otherwise prevent virus infection. Importantly, the APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F proteins work by inactivating the genome of HIV by a process termed hypermutation. Thus, a logical therapeutic strategy is to unlock the natural anti-HIV function of the APOBEC proteins by suppressing their negative regulation by Vif. For this approach to be pursued rationally, the biological principles that underpin all aspects of APOBEC protein function must be understood with greater precision. Specifically, we will investigate the details of how the APOBEC proteins mutate the HIV genome, how this process is regulated, and how HIV itself is selected as a target for hypermutation. We aim to define which elements of the APOBEC proteins are essential for anti-viral activity, and how they are recognised and suppressed by Vif. We will also undertake experiments to define the molecular structures of Vif and the APOBEC proteins in three-dimensions, since this will be essential for future efforts to design useful drugs. Finally, we will search for additional human cell proteins that influence Vif or APOBEC protein function, and whose manipulation may also be therapeutically exploitable. The Public Relations Dept of KCL is primarily responsible for communicating our work to the public; and a ?Directory of Experts? is maintained that enables members of the general public to identify academics willing to discuss their specialist area. For instance, Prof Malim has given numerous interviews to members of the press, has appeared on television and has been consulted by the BBC on the content of future AIDS-related programming. He will also be an Associate Editor of a planned public access journal, PLoS Pathogens, has given overview seminars on the value of basic science research at Community Liaison Meetings, and helps organise Conferences attended by members of the HIV/AIDS community.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401570","grantId":"G0401570","fundValue":"1400000","fundStart":"2005-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Henry Malim","coPersons":[],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
