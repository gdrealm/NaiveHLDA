{"id":"FBE17889-0DAE-4BB5-849B-A45D014CAA32","title":"Modelling 'journey to crime': Separating and quantifying the influence of offender-specific factors from offence-specifi","abstractText":"<p>In many crime studies there is a consistent observation that short crime trips from home are much more common than long trips and has led researchers to comment that most offenders commit crimes at short distances. However these assertions usually ignore the fact that offenders contribute multiple crime trips to the sample data, so the degree to which offenders differ in their travel patterns will obscure patterns at the aggregate. Comments about the aggregate distribution with respect crime trips (most trips are short, long ones are rare) may be valid, but some researchers have gone further and made inferences about offenders (most offenders don't travel far to offend). It is unclear yet, whether comments of the latter are valid.</p> \n<p>This research seeks to investigate for a large dataset whether the nesting of crime trips within offenders has an influence that is masked when crime trips are aggregated. The novel aspect of this study is that by employing multi-level models it will be possible to control for the influence of factors that operate at two levels (the crime and offender) at the same time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E021700/1","grantId":"ES/E021700/1","fundValue":"48309","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Kenneth TownsleyRuth Mary Morgan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
