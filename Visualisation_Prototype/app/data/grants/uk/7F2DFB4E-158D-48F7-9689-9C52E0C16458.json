It will use longitudinal qualitative methods to explore the experiences and motivations of individuals who gamble in a range of different locations, from casinos, betting shops, fruit machine arcades and bingo halls, to the Internet and the lottery. In-depth interviews will examine the ways that factors such as social class, gender, age, ethnicity and geography influence individual experiences of gambling as well as the formation of distinctive gambling careers.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of three years, the research will explore the pathways through which individuals begin and continue gambling, enter problem behaviour and perhaps move out of it again, and the relation of these stages to broader social and cultural factors, attitudes and self perceptions. In doing so, it will seek to uncover the different meanings that gambling has for individual players, and to build up a picture of gambling as a dynamic social activity that is embedded in local cultures and that changes over time.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-164-25-0006","grantId":"RES-164-25-0006","fundValue":"146037","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerda  Reith","coPersons":["Simon  Anderson"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
