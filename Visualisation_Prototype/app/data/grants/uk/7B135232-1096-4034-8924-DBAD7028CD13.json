A lot of\nevidence exists to indicate that this brain damage is due to an inflammatory process involving the\nproduction of a chemical called interferon. Interferon is normally produced by cells in response to\ninfection by a virus, and some children with AGS are initially misdiagnosed as having a viral-related disease because of the close clinical overlap of these states. In contrast to the production of interferon\nsecondary to virus, in AGS an excess of interferon occurs due to a primary genetic defect. Because of\nthe severity of the condition there is an urgent need to develop new treatments for AGS. We think this\nshould be possible if we better understand how the responsible genetic changes drive interferon\nproduction.\nWe intend to use the very latest genetic and cell technologies to understand how brain cells are\ndamaged by inflammation in AGS. AGS is rare, and few parents feel able to agree to post-mortem if\ntheir affected child dies. However, a family with affected twin girls has generously donated the brain of\none of their very recently deceased daughters. This almost unique resource will allow us to study\nhuman neurological tissue in more detail than ever before, and using new techniques which have not\nbeen available previously. Additionally, we are going to make use of state-of-the-art methods for\nproducing 'brain cells' in a test-tube - derived from cells of patients with AGS, so that we can study\nbrain tissue in the context of several different genetic sub-types of AGS. We also intend to analyse a\nstrain of mouse which has changes in one of the AGS-related genes as another approach to trying to\nunderstand the human disease.\nAlthough AGS is rare, the study of the genes and the proteins related to the disease has become of\nvery high scientific importance - partly because of the involvement of these genes / proteins in how\nthe body reponds to infection byHIV-1 (the virus that causes AIDS), and also because of an overlap\nwith diseases where the body attacks itself - so-called autoimmunity. Thus, not only will our work be relevant to the children and families affected by this dreadful condition, it may also have relevance for a much wider set of human medical disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M501803/1","grantId":"MR/M501803/1","fundValue":"279556","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Yanick  Crow","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
