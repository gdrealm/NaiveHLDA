There are a large number of diseases including stroke, brain trauma and tumours in which the permeability of the BBB is increased. Conversely, many drugs are unable to cross the BBB to reach the brain making the BBB one of the major obstacles in the treatment of the brain diseases. Proper regulation and maintenance of BBB is, therefore, essential for effective drug delivery to the brain to cure brain diseases and preventing its further damage. In this project we aim to develop a three dimensional in vitro BBB model using the Kirkstall Quasi-Vivo system which allows multiple cell types to be cultured in inter-connected culture chambers and a method of assaying the passage of of potential drugs across the BBB by electrochemical and laser bio-sensors. This in vitro model will be an important tool for investigation of different aspects of BBB function and testing potential drugs for their permeability and toxicity and reducing animal usage in this area. Human cell based models should be more accurate and predictive than animals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M013111/1","grantId":"BB/M013111/1","fundValue":"82377","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sikha  Saha","coPersons":["Gin  Jose"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
