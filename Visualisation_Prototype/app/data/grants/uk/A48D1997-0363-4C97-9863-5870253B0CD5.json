The group was founded over 20 years ago as the Money Study Group and quickly established itself as a key national forum for monetary economists in the UK. It was the first of the study groups to be funded by the Social Science Research Council. It has broadened its focus and its label - The Money, Macro and Finance Research Group - reflects this. Membership is open to all interested parties in the UK and around the world. </p> \n<p>The MMF/WFRI seminar series focuses on the frontiers of finance.&nbsp;It brings leading academics from Europe and America to present their work in the UK and provides an open forum for UK academics to discuss their own research in finance. In doing this it provides a substantial stimulus to finance research within UK universities.</p> \n<p>The intention is to provide a series of 8 seminars - 4 in each year - focusing on the separate areas of finance, ranging from behavioural finance to pensions reform. Each seminar normally involves&nbsp;four or more papers with a lead paper presented by a leading overseas speaker.&nbsp; </p> \n<p>More details can be obtained from the MMF website: <a href=\"http://www.essex.ac.uk/afm/mmf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.essex.ac.uk/afm/mmf/</a></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4159","grantId":"RES-451-25-4159","fundValue":"15326","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Panicos  Demetriades","coPersons":["Mark Howard Salmon"],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
