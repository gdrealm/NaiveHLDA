Yet, there have been no real attempts to understand the mechanistic basis of this result. TREMOR will use a combination of forest inventory data analysis and process-based modelling to investigate several hypotheses that could explain the increases in mortality. These hypotheses include (i) increasing wind disturbance, (ii) increasing drought frequency, (iii) increasing liana abundance, (iv) increased competition and (v) faster senescence. Finally, we hope to scale-up the impacts of increasing tree mortality on Amazon-wide carbon storage by using a dynamic global vegetation model.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/N004655/1","grantId":"NE/N004655/1","fundValue":"657775","fundStart":"2015-10-01","fundEnd":"2019-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"David Robert  Galbraith","coPersons":["Emanuel Ulrich Gloor","Oliver  Phillips","Roel  Brienen"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
