Specifically, Dr Flaxman will offer detailed training in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to a selected group of mental health professionals, who will then be supported as they cascade the training to their own staff and client groups. As well as offering mental health support to the target employees, the project is designed to generate impact by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>enhancing the project partners’ service provision</li>\n\n <li>by having this evidence-based approach to mental health promotion integrated into current occupational health and rehabilitation initiatives and policies. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact of the project partners’ interventions will be evaluated with a battery of mental health measures administered pre- and post-intervention and at follow-up, and by collecting qualitative data from the staff and client groups who attend the partners’ training. At the end of the nine-month project, impact will be disseminated at a stakeholder event held at the host institution (City University London).</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/J020575/1","grantId":"ES/J020575/1","fundValue":"18464","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2013-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Paul  Flaxman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
