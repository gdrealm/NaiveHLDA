The PolySyn project will take the results of two previous projects and combine them to maximum effect. </p> \n<p>The first project is the PolyLex project, which developed highly structured lexicons of closely related languages, concentrating on aspects of lexical knowledge that are particularly similar in related languages, namely phonology, morphology and orthography. </p> \n<p>The other is the GREG project, which developed a cross-linguistic approach to syntactic subcategorisation and semantic roles (valency) in relatively unrelated languages, namely English, German, Georgian and Russian. </p> \n<p>The primary aim of the PolyLex project was to exploit the similarities of closely related languages. In this project the techniques developed in that project will be taken one step further, to show that the techniques can also be usefully employed for certain aspects of the lexical knowledge required for unrelated languages. The idea behind this is that, while phonological, morphological and orthographic information is only likely to be significantly similar in closely related languages, syntactic subcategorisation information is likely to be much more similar, as it is inherently related to the number of semantic arguments.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018130/1","grantId":"ES/E018130/1","fundValue":"78955","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lynne Julie Cahill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
