{"id":"03C8D1DC-BBBF-43CF-A40D-E89B0C9CDAEA","title":"Structure-Property Relationships: Enabling a faster Commercialisation of Organic Solar Cells","abstractText":"The first electronic devices using organic semiconductors have just entered the market: many displays of mobile phones consist of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, these OLED-displays are considered only the first wave of organic electronic (OE) products, with organic solar cells and organic lighting expected to follow soon. Organic solar cells are currently a very active field of research, because they have the potential to become a very cheap, large area, and flexible photovoltaic technology. They furthermore can have unique properties like custom-made shapes, semi-transparency and different colours, considerably expanding the potential market to areas where current technologies are struggling. Records for conversion efficiencies have reached values above 10% and lifetimes exceeding 10 years in the laboratory, i.e. passing important milestones that are often considered as minimum requirement to become viable for commercial applications.\nHowever, one major challenge for industry trying to commercialise this technology is: for any kind of device using thin organic semiconducting layers, its electrical and optical properties strongly depend on molecular arrangement in the organic layer, in particular for organic solar cells. To a large extent, the interdependencies between molecular structure, processing, morphology in the thin organic film, and the device properties is a black box. The current approach for improving solar cells is to make more new molecules and to run an extensive process optimisation and device testing, but there are nearly unlimited options of organic chemistry and many degrees of freedom in process parameters. This nearly trial-and-error process is consuming time and money, as well as carrying the risk that the best organic semiconductors are discarded due to wrong processing. Our project will look into this black box in a close collaboration of four industrial partners (Merck Chemicals Ltd, Kurt J. Lesker Company Ltd, Eight19 Ltd, Oxford PV Ltd) and three academic partners (ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, Diamond Lightsource, University of Oxford) and subsequently develop ways to optimise the manufacturing of organic solar cells. This involves optimisation along the complete value chain, from the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors, the development of manufacturing equipment, to the final production of organic solar cells. If successful, this project will lead to a faster market introduction of thin film solar cells that have the potential to transform the way we use solar energy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/L006294/1","grantId":"ST/L006294/1","fundValue":"374640","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Moritz  Riede","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
