The other chromosomes are being sequenced by groups in other countries. Potato, the world's fourth most important food crop, is the most important member of the Solanaceae, which also includes tomato, pepper, aubergine and many medically relevant plants. The potato genome is very similar to tomato and, as the UK is also sequencing tomato chromosome IV, we will be able to perform a highly detailed comparative sequence analysis of these two crop species. Moreover, by studying gene and genome sequence data we will be able to create a 'genetic marker' system, based on small DNA variations between different varieties. This will allow us to readily examine a large number of genes and to see how they vary between varieties with different characteristics. This will be extremely useful for efforts to breed potato crops that can be grown in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. All of the data generated will be placed in the public domain in a user-ready format with the identification of putative genes and their function. The project will also be used to bring the UK research community working on Solanaceous plants together each year for the purposes of communicating the results of their research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F013280/1","grantId":"BB/F013280/1","fundValue":"29388","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gerard James Bishop","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
