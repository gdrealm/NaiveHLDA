This research innovates by focusing on another way in which Chinese firms can capture value in the global economy: Branding. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The main objectives of this project are to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Assess the attainment of branding capabilities in Chinese firms by focusing on its most exported sectors: Garments and Home Appliances. </li>\n\n <li>Contribute to debates on how China is developing its capabilities beyond production and how this is changing their power relationships with firms from the UK and other developed countries. </li>\n\n <li>Develop ways of collecting branding capabilities data thus 'pushing the frontier' of measuring branding capabilities in emerging economies. </li>\n\n <li>Create a methodological basis for future comparative studies wishing to explore the broader research agenda 'Global Brands from the South' (China, Brazil, India and so on) as part of contributing to better industrial development programme formulation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using a combination of qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative (surveys) methods this research will explore these issues by analysing self-reported data obtained from firms along the value chains where Chinese producers operate plus externally observable data from secondary sources.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-25-0355","grantId":"RES-061-25-0355","fundValue":"159747","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Lizbeth  Navas-Aleman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
