{"id":"9F8C3B2A-8FAB-4BB5-8E2B-362C0EA69395","title":"Reactivation of declarative memory during sleep","abstractText":"<p>Recent research has shown that some declarative memories (for facts and events) can be strengthened or consolidated during sleep. Less is known about which kinds of declarative memories are affected by sleep, why there is selectivity, and how this operates. Several models of memory consolidation involve two stages: an initial acquisition and storage phase, followed by sleep-associated consolidation. We test the predictions of one highly influential model, the complementary learning systems model.</p>\n\n<p>This model has been applied to sleep and declarative memory only in broad descriptive terms, so it is difficult to determine whether it is a good model of how sleep affects declarative memory. Yet in other domains, most notably psycholinguistics, the connectionist principles on which the model is based have been thoroughly explored.</p>\n\n<p>The current proposal brings these two areas together with the intention of furthering understanding in both fields. In the sleep and memory domain we wish to provide a comprehensive and detailed test of the model to examine whether its principles explain effects of sleep on declarative memory. In the psycholinguistic domain we wish to add a new dimension to existing key debates in the field, determining whether and how sleep influences language learning and consolidation. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I038586/1","grantId":"ES/I038586/1","fundValue":"302383","fundStart":"2012-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Gareth Gaskell","coPersons":["Shane  Lindsay"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" not applicable this year not applicable this year Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
