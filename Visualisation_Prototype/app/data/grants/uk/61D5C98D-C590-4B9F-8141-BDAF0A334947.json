{"id":"61D5C98D-C590-4B9F-8141-BDAF0A334947","title":"CERN LIVE event at the Gravity Fields Festival 2014","abstractText":"The CERN LIVE event at the Gravity Fields Festival will bring the science and work at CERN LHC, and knowledge about related science activity across the world, to a science and arts festival in Lincolnshire to allow schools and general/family audiences to learn more about CERN and its associated science, through a mix of display, audio visual exhibits (which this grant would support) and through the programming of speakers related to the topic (which will be supported by the festival).\n\nThe Gravity Fields Festival celebrates Sir Isaac Newton's close relationship with the area of south Lincolnshire and the town of Grantham through a biennial festival which was staged for the first time in 2012 with an overall audience of 37,000. The festival is aspirational in nature and designed to appeal to a broad cross section of the general public.\n\nThe festival's aims include bringing an understanding of the physical sciences to the general population of the area and to visitors from beyond the area.\n \nThe proposed event will run for two of the five days of the festival, Friday 26th and Saturday 27th September. The event will take place at one of the main festival venues in the town centre of Grantham. \n\nThe aim for all audiences is:-\nTo foster better understanding of the CERN LHC facility, who works there, how it works and the international partnerships\nTo understand the areas of science studied at CERN LHC and its outcomes and potential future outcomes\nTo gain a greater understanding of the applications of particle physics both at CERN and in facilities worldwide\n\nAnd for young people in particular:-\nTo inspire young people to work in science and particularly interest them in physics\nTo inspire young people from the area to believe in their potential to study and work at a high level in any field\n\nTarget Audiences\n\nFriday 26th September \n\nMorning - Primary Schools audiences to attend exhibition, interactive and audio visual display elements with short talk from science educators. Aims - introductory understanding of the impact of physics on our lives and understanding and what the CERN LHC is and does.\n\nAfternoon - Secondary schools, particularly sixth form science students, will be invited alongside the general public to specifically programmed talks to learn more about CERN and related science\n \nAfter School/Early Evening - The exhibition elements will be open for the general public \n\nSaturday 27th September\n\nAll day - the general public will be invited to view the exhibition and to attend related talks during the day at the same venue, An additional aim of the Saturday opening will be to add the extra dimension of looking at future areas of development in this field in facilities across the world.\n\nFollowing the festival the display elements of the event will be offered to and available for other science festivals and institutions to build CERN LIVE events into their events around the country.\n\nThis event will continue to develop the Gravity Fields Festival's partnerships with scientists. \n\nThe event has been suggested by the Festival Patron, Professor Valerie Gibson, Head of High Energy Physics at the University of Cambridge and formally UK Spokesperson for the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. She also originally comes from Grantham and attended school locally. She will speak at the festival and Dr Harry Cliff, her research associate and the content curator of the Science Museum Collider exhibition, will support the event with research and his presence and a talk at the event.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M002314/1","grantId":"ST/M002314/1","fundValue":"10000","fundStart":"2014-07-07","fundEnd":"2014-11-06","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Rosemary  Richards","coPersons":[],"organisation":"South Kesteven District Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
