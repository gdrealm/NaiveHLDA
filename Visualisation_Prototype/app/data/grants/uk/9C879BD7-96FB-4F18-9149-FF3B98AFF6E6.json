{"id":"9C879BD7-96FB-4F18-9149-FF3B98AFF6E6","title":"GerManC Plus: A representative historical corpus of German 1650-1800","abstractText":"<p>The aim of this project is to compile a corpus of German (“GerManC Plus”), covering the period 1650-1800. This is a crucial period for the development of a single modern standard German language, and during it competing regional norms were finally eliminated. The structure of this corpus will parallel that of similar English corpora and thus form a basis for comparative studies of the development of the grammar or vocabulary of the two languages. A pilot study (“GerManC”), which involved assembling a sample corpus of 100,000 words from newspapers, was completed in 2007. GerManC Plus will build on this by adding sample texts from seven further text types; the finished corpus will thus have about a million words. Computer tools will be developed to analyse the corpus, identifying the grammatical features of each word, and for ‘lemmatisation’, ie compiling a dictionary of all the words in the corpus. The corpus will be fully ‘annotated’, ie all linguistic features will be marked throughout and significant references indicated, classified and indexed. This project will ultimately contribute to and complement a more extensive historical corpus of German, and the team is working in close collaboration with colleagues in Berlin and Mannheim.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F035004/1","grantId":"ES/F035004/1","fundValue":"551772","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Martin  Durrell","coPersons":["P  Bennett"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
