{"id":"9EFC0657-484A-4FBC-841B-D89612A4019E","title":"SAMULET Project 1 - High Efficiency Turbomachinery","abstractText":"The project aims to reduce the environmental impact of gas turbines by improving their efficiency. It also aims to reduce their lifecycle cost. Air transport demand is predicted to double in the next 10 - 15 years and triple in 20 years time. In order to enable sustained growth, whilst limiting the environmental impact of air transport in the future, the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) has set challenging targets for emission levels from gas turbines. Improvements in efficiency and increased operating temperature capability are required to address these issues. The reduction in fuel burn anticipated from the project can be converted to a reduction of 836 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per aircraft per year. To achieve this large reduction a multifaceted approach is necessary. Hence, the project is split into a number of work packages (WP) covering cooling, aerodynamics, aeromechanical interaction and materials. The latter facilitates a wider design space for the former packages and hence all packages are interlinked. The project forms part of the larger SAMULET programme. The cross-disciplinary approach being taken, in this programme, is expected to deliver greater technical capability when compared to previous more narrowly defined research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G035245/1","grantId":"EP/G035245/1","fundValue":"1287830","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  -The experimental high speed testing and corresponding computational analyses have revealed for the first time that there is a qualitatively different characteristics (opposite trends of variations) in turbine blade tip heat transfer between an engine representative high-speed condition and the conventional low speed conditions.

This new finding is believed to have made an influence on the selection/de-selection of new blade tip configurations in the industrial partner.\n\n- A novel blade cooling simulation method, Immersed Mesh Block (IMB) has been developed as part of the project supported by the grant. The method has been implemented, tested and demonstrated in a major industrial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, HYDRA, to be applied in a real design environment for future turbine blade heat transfer and cooling designs.\n\nAs part of a DPhil project supported by the grant, the feedback of convection heat transfer on aerodynamics was investigated. As the result, an extra term is introduced to the commonly known Newton's law of cooling (i.e. the convection heat transfer equation), leading to a new 3-point working method for heat transfer coefficient. This new 3-point method has been published in a learned journal, and more relevantly, integrated to a practical turbine heat transfer and cooling design system. \n\n- A major transonic turbine research facility (Oxford Turbine Research Facility (OTRF) has been relocated and upgraded. This is a very unique facility in UK, and a marker of the leading position of Oxford in high speed turbine aerothermal instrumentation and testing.
