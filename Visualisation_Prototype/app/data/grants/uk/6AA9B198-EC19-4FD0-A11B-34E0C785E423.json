{"id":"6AA9B198-EC19-4FD0-A11B-34E0C785E423","title":"Pig genome annotation and analysis","abstractText":"We propose to provide state of the art analysis and annotation of the pig genome sequence being generated by the International Pig Genome Sequencing Project. We will make the annotated genome sequence accessible on the Web through the Ensembl site at http://www.ensembl.org . The pig genome is the entire DNA sequence of the pig which defines all the biological molecules that make up a pig. By acquiring, managing and annotating the pig genome sequence one accelerates research for both pig biology and for mammalian biology. Impact on pig biology: Because of the extensive selective breeding which has occurred during domestication, there are a considerable number of breed or line-specific features, from fat/muscle ratios, litter size to skin colour. These features can be mapped genetically into broad regions of the genome, but the final identification of the genes responsible and the causal genetic variation is very complex. The availability of a well-annotated pig genome sequence with links to other data sources, especially those on phenotypes such as growth, carcass composition or responses to infectious disease would provide a dramatic boost to the identification of these causative genes. Impact on Human biology: The pig genome, as with all mammals has diverged relatively recently from the human lineage. This allows us to look for the effect of evolution in the genome. In comparing genome sequences both the similarities and the differences are informative. Sequences that are conserved across multiple species probably represent essential coding or regulatory sequences. Sequences that differ across species and show evidence of rapid evolutionary change can be important determinants of species survival, including reproductive fitness and the ability to respond to infectious disease. Thus, the comparative genome sequence analyses that we will perform will help us understand mammalian - and hence human - biology, including disease processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E010520/2","grantId":"BB/E010520/2","fundValue":"211211","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2010-05-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alan  Archibald","coPersons":["Andrew Stephen Law"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":" 1. Assembly the low coverage pig genome sequence to provide an effective platform for annotation and research\n\nThe current assembly (Sscrofa9) was generated from a data freeze in Apr'09 by the Sanger partner and has proved to be an effective platform for annotation and research. A new assembly (Sscrofa10) which will form the basis of the pig genome sequence paper will integrate Illumina short read data (~30x coverage) to improve contiguity and coverage - due Sept 2010.\n\n\n\n2. Annotate the pig genome sequence to provide high quality protein coding gene set and high quality RNA gene set\n\nIn addition to the annotation of the SScrofa9 assembly using the Ensembl automatic gene prediction pipelines manual annotation has also been undertaken. Sets of both protein coding and non coding RNA genes have been generated. The manual annotation is accessible as a DAS track.\n\n\n\n3. Compute comparative genomics alignments between pig and the major mammals (human, mouse, cow) and other key vertebrates\n\nSee reports of Ensembl partners at Sanger and EBI.\n\n\n\n4. Associate pig specific resources, including QTLs, microarray probes, SNPs and clones with both the genome and genes \n\nCross references to the Affymetrix Porcine micro array have been generated. SNPs from dbSNP have been remapped from the NCBI Sus scrofa build 1.1 to make them available.\n\nThe sequences of the SNPs on the Illumina Porcine 60K SNP chip have been mapped to the Sscrofa9 assembly and are accessible as a DAS track.\n\n \n\n5. Provide a user friendly web site of this information\n\nWhile the sequencing was in progress, Ensembl Pre sites containing alignments of proteins from other species were made available. Once the gene set was completed on the Sscrofa9 assembly, pig was made available in the main Ensembl site (http://www.ensembl.org/Sus_scrofa). This provides detailed genomic location, gene, comparative genomic and variation displays of the data available for pig.\n\nTraining workshops (2 in the UK at Hinxton and 1 in the US) were organized for manual annotation using the Otterlace system.
