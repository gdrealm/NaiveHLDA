{"id":"B27FF538-8F06-4DCC-816F-2FF5CF4FC6F4","title":"Verification of resource-bounded multi-agent systems","abstractText":"A multi-agent system is a system which is comprised of multiple interacting agents. An agent is an autonomous entity that has the ability to collect information, reason about it, and perform actions based on it in pursuit of its own goals or on behalf of others. Examples of agents are controllers for automatic devices such as satellites, health care systems, non-driver transport systems such as UAVs, and even nodes in sensor networks.\nMulti-agent systems are ubiquitous. Many distributed software and hardware systems can be naturally modelled as multi-agent systems. Such systems are by nature of their components extremely complex, and the interaction between components can lead to undesired behaviours that are not easy to detect. Hence, automated verification of multi-agent systems is a very important and thriving research area. We propose an important advance in this area, namely producing verification tools which allow users to specify which resources the agents need for their actions. Current tools do not offer a systematic framework for modelling resource requirements for agents' actions. However, such an ability is very important for specification of many systems, for example sensor networks where the nodes have very limited resources, e.g. energy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K033921/1","grantId":"EP/K033921/1","fundValue":"31421","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2016-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Franco  Raimondi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Middlesex University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
