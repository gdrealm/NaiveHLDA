As conditions become more favourable for plant growth, most models predict that high latitudes will take up more carbon during the 21st century. However, vast stores of carbon are frozen in boreal and arctic permafrost, and warming may result in some of this carbon being released to the atmosphere. The recent inclusion of permafrost thaw in large-scale model simulations has suggested that the permafrost feedback is potentially so significant that it could reduce substantially the predicted global net uptake of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems during the 21st century, with major implications for the rate of climate change.\nLarge uncertainties remain in predicting rates of permafrost thaw and in determining the impacts of thaw in contrasting ecosystems, with many of the key processes missing from carbon-climate models. Firstly, the role that different plant communities play in insulating soils and protecting permafrost is poorly quantified, with key groups such as mosses absent in most models. In addition, fire disturbance can substantially accelerate permafrost thaw, and hence the ability of permafrost-protecting plant communities to recover from fire may play a key role in determining permafrost resilience. Secondly, different ecosystems may respond differently to thaw with contrasting effects on release of greenhouse gasses. In free-draining ecosystems, thaw may result in the net release of carbon due to increased decomposition of previously frozen organic matter. On the other hand, when thawing takes place in peatlands, soil subsidence can effectively raise the water table, which could result in carbon accumulation. However, this potential negative feedback may be offset by enhanced release of the more powerful greenhouse gas, methane. Importantly, the full range of feedbacks to permafrost thaw in these contrasting ecosystems is not currently reflected in process-based models. \nTo address these issues, we will undertake directed fieldwork campaigns to determine (1) the role that different plant communities play in protecting permafrost within different soil types, and in unburned and fire-disturbed ecosystems, and (2) the impacts of permafrost thaw on fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane in free-draining versus peatland systems. Through links to Canadian partners, data will be collected from a range of field sites where permafrost monitoring is ongoing, including: (i) two contrasting boreal peatlands differing in permafrost extent, and where there is permafrost degradation; (ii) burnt and unburned sites within three important forest types in boreal Canada. Data will be provided from burnt and unburned moist acidic tundra within the continuous permafrost zone in Alaska by our US partners. The spatially variable vegetation recovery at the fire sites allows relationships between vegetation and permafrost to be tested in detail, while comparisons between the tundra, forest and peatland sites provide insights into the impacts of permafrost thaw in contrasting ecosystems.\nCritically, these data will be used to develop, parameterise and evaluate a detailed process-based model of vegetation-soil-permafrost interactions. The in-depth representation of vegetation-permafrost linkages will improve predictions of rates of permafrost thaw. The model will be the first to simulate the full range of biogeochemical feedbacks (methane and carbon dioxide) in free-draining versus wetland ecosystems. Furthermore, through links with Met Office scientists, our model will be coupled to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES), allowing regional simulations to be run, coupled to a climate model. Ultimately, our project will improve predictions of both the rates and consequences of permafrost thaw, and help determine the potential impacts on 21st century climate change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K00025X/1","grantId":"NE/K00025X/1","fundValue":"271292","fundStart":"2012-08-20","fundEnd":"2015-08-19","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Gareth  Phoenix","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":" Permafrost, ground which remains at or below 0 &ordm;C for at least two years, is globally important because it stores approximately twice as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. As the temperatures rise in northern regions permafrost will thaw and the active layer, which is the seasonally thawed layer of ground between the permafrost and the surface, will thicken. Permafrost thaw will not respond in a uniform way to temperature changes but will be controlled by a range of factors including vegetation and soil characteristics. Understanding which soil and vegetation characteristics are affected by climate change, and what the consequences of vegetation change are for carbon cycling is crucial if we are to assess the impact permafrost thaw will have on the global carbon cycle.\nWe have found that moss plays a strong role in protecting permafrost from thaw by insulating the ground from heat during summer. We also demonstrated that as the ground become wetter the importance of this insulating effect of mosses becomes greater, because moisture increases the rate at which heat is conducted down through the soil. We have also shown that organic soil can play a similar insulating role to mosses when it is dry, but that wet organic soil may promote permafrost thaw, perhaps because by retaining moisture it remains conductive to heat for longer periods of time than free-draining mineral soils would. The ability of plants to prevent heating of the ground by providing shade has also been revealed. Our uniquely detailed fine scale survey has allowed the quantitative relationship between thaw depth and these important soil and vegetation characteristics to be determined.\nOur carbon flux measurements have shown that CO2 uptake by understory plants is similar sites which have experienced fire and those which have not (fire is a major disturbance factor in the boreal forests where this research focusses). This was contrary to what we expected as we predicted that the increased nutrients that are liberated during fire and the decrease in competition for light from the tree canopy would have increased rates of photosynthesis in the post fire regrowth. However, we did see increases in productivity of the ground covering vegetation in wetlands that form after permafrost thaw, which may partially offset the loss of CO2 uptake by trees which die during wetland formation. These results can be used by the modelling community to improve predictions of the consequences of future temperature changes on permafrost thaw. Our work already feeds directly into the SPA model as part of this consortium, and his will then go on to inform JULES. This will refine our understanding of the influence that permafrost thaw will have on the global carbon cycle. Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
