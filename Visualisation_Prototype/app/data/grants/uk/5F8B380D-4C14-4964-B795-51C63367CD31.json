{"id":"5F8B380D-4C14-4964-B795-51C63367CD31","title":"Making Bad Jobs Better: Practice and Policy","abstractText":"<p>Even before the recession, bad jobs&nbsp;- characterised by low skill and poor pay and prospects&nbsp;- were entrenched in the UK economy and more numerous than in other EU countries. </p>\n\n<p>The UK Government now recognises that these jobs need to be addressed to improve social inclusion, social mobility and economic prosperity. However government lacks an appropriate research-led evidence base from which policy might be developed. The aim of this seminar series is to use the existing research to generate policy proposals and identify a new research agenda to address any remaining gaps in both evidence and policy development. </p>\n\n<p>The seminar series draws together UK and international researchers and stakeholders from government, business and the third sector. The first three seminars focus on the nature of bad jobs and the two main strategies for dealing with these jobs - making bad jobs more bearable and providing exit routes out of these jobs. From this evidence base policy ideas will be developed and their feasibility tested with stakeholders at the fourth seminar. Thereafter, in addition to the usual academic outputs, a public interest report will be produced to disseminate knowledge about practice and policy that can make bad jobs better.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H001646/1","grantId":"ES/H001646/1","fundValue":"18490","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher  Warhurst","coPersons":["Ewart John Keep","Caroline  Lloyd","Johanna Charmian Commander","Patricia  Findlay"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" See ESRC End of Award Report Development of policy initiatives by government to ameliorate lower quality jobs; use of seminar series outputs as teaching materials.
