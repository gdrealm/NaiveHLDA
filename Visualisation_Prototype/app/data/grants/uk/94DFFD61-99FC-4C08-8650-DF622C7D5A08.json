Migration-(In)Security Dilemmas Ten Years After 9/11","abstractText":"<p>This seminar programme aims to critically review and analyse:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>migration agendas, policies, implementation while focusing on the securitisation of migration</li>\n\n <li>the consequences, for migrant communities and majority societies, of ‘managing’ migration from a security angle. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>It will use this review and analysis to recommend policy alternatives for the future. To achieve these aims, seminar participants will examine the impact(s) of the securitisation of migration, over the past decade, on asylum seekers and refugees, labour and family migrants, undocumented migrants and also on established (but not always accepted) ethnic minority communities. They will assess whether or not, and/ or to what extent, human security and community safety needs are being met/compromised. Where relevant, participants will propose alternative policy approaches for the protection of human rights, advancement of civil liberties and preservation of democratic principles.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar programme will promote continuing collaboration between academics and practitioners and encourage the exchange of knowledge about theoretical and empirical research and of ideas about the connections between doing research and using its results effectively. In the long term, the seminar programme will have contributed to a better understanding of migration within the context of security concerns and to better informed public debates.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I003088/1","grantId":"ES/I003088/1","fundValue":"15116","fundStart":"2011-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Khursheed  Wadia","coPersons":["Gabriella  Lazaridis"],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
