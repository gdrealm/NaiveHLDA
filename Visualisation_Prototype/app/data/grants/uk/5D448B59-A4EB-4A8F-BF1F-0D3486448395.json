To advance its genetics and utility, our key objective is to deploy novel Synthetic Biology tools to improve the production of its native enzymes and those from other sources so as to improve the economics of using B. licheniformis for exploitation by commercial end users such as detergent manufacturers, food processes etc. Technologies will be developed for modifying the genome of this bacterium so as to amplify genes encoding useful enzymes, targeting them to specific locations (genomic landing pads) that are validated for high-level and predictable expression, overcoming issues associated with non-targeted integration. Novel tools for genome editing will a) address aspects of the bacterium's metabolism that limit enzyme yield of under conditions found in industrial bioreactors, as identified using systems biology techniques and b) capitalize on in situ protein engineering to improve functionalities of industrial enzymes, including thermotolerance and optimal activity under operating conditions, that important for end users. Success in these areas will reduce the cost and improve the versatility and efficiency of industrial enzyme production by B. licheniformis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010469/1","grantId":"BB/N010469/1","fundValue":"359933","fundStart":"2016-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Colin Robert Harwood","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
