{"id":"0CB9345F-2F14-4B07-B99B-9204C3C6058B","title":"Arabidopsis.info","abstractText":"Arabidopsis.info at NASC is a resource that emerged consensually out of the community and which has continued for nearly 20 years based on hundreds of thousands of donated stocks and datasets from a vigorous worldwide Arabidopsis community. This centralisation of biological resources has proved crucial to the Arabidopsis community and has maximised access to these resources for researchers worldwide. We distribute nearly 100,000 stocks per annum globally. Our primary remit has therefore been to locate, capture and produce public genomic, mapping, array and germplasm data describing Arabidopsis and integrate them into a form that makes our data, array and seed services more accessible and useful to the Arabidopsis community. NASCarrays currently holds data from several thousand Arabidopsis Affymetrix Genechips. We have also provided a universally accessible version of Genespring workgroup for those Arabidopsis / plant community users who may not have local access to commercial analysis tools. All of the NASC services were developed centred around sample standardisation, data collection and curation, rapid data output, and open external dissemination. In this grant we will Incorporate ~100,000 additional stocks into the centre and distribute stocks at an increased level of demand (100,000 per annum). For array work we will take our GeneChip service into immediate full cost recovery including service contracts, analysis software and machine upgrades and bring array prices down by 40% for both Arabidopsis and Human chips. In parallel we will: Improve throughput to increase public data coverage for systems analysis; expand GeneChip species coverage (specifically targeting orphan crops, bioenergy and animal health for cheap diagnostics and trait discovery); Provide services for Tobacco, Brachypodium and Brassica GeneChips and; Develop a new Arabidopsis GeneChip (ATH2) with greatly superior gene coverage and other capabilities (from our cost recovery budget). We will also develop a specific impact strategy relating to transcriptomics for food security and crop outreach, and will develop new outreach interactions with relevant UK resources including sequencing centres, especially in the area of user training and access to analysis tools. To improve our outreach we will increase our postgraduate and group leader training workshops and for the future stability of the service we will develop distributed data capacities such as cloud computing services in the public domain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I001271/1","grantId":"BB/I001271/1","fundValue":"780792","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-09-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Sean Tobias May","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
