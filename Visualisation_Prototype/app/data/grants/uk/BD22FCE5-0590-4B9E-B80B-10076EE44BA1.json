The current project aims to disseminate the findings of this research programme using film. As well as 'talking through' academic papers on the subject using diagrams, graphs and tables, the film will also incorporate interviews with seafarers, footage onboard ship and case studies to help bring the subject alive to people unfamiliar with this world. </p>\n\n<p>Those who watch the film will learn about research methods, psychology and ergonomics in addition to gaining a fuller understanding of the seafaring industry which underpins much of what we take for granted in modern life. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H043586/1","grantId":"ES/H043586/1","fundValue":"9950","fundStart":"2010-07-08","fundEnd":"2011-06-07","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The fatigue film has been viewed over 14,000 times, included on 8 training courses, been presented at 3 industry meetings, and featured in 2 news articles and 3 papers.

In addition to being viewed c.7,500 times in less than a year on YouTube, the Fatigue at Sea film has been incorporated into four training courses, two fatigue awareness campaigns and has been presented at three industry meetings and two academic conferences. The reach of the original Cardiff University research project has therefore been considerably increased. It is important to note that the use of video media will not be suited to all research areas, will applied research likely to benefit most from this form of dissemination as a ready audience already exists. The importance of high production values was also highlighted as a poorly made film will reflect negatively on the quality of the research being discussed. The use of the film in industry training courses, along with invites to present at maritime events is strong evidence of the use of the film in non-academic contexts. Over 30 feedback comments have been received through the website which give testament to the fact that the largest audience for the film is active seafarers working in the industry. The film is already being used by the industry in four training courses and two fatigue awareness campaigns. Having the film available online also acts as a central resource for anyone interested in the topic. YouTube statistics show the film has been viewed nearly 7,500 times in over 20 different countries. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
