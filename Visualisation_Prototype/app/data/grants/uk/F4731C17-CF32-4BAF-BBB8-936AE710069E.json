{"id":"F4731C17-CF32-4BAF-BBB8-936AE710069E","title":"Architecture of the bacterial divisome.","abstractText":"All cell types need to grow and to divide in order to survive. Bacteria, one of the most primitive and ancient of all life forms, divide by a relatively simple mechanism, but nonetheless in a process that is tightly controlled and co-ordinated. The key steps include the replication of the cell's DNA, so that each copy of the cell has an identical copy of the genome, the blueprint of life. The two copies of the genome then have to be separated so that they are not entangled when the mother and daughter cells finally separate to become discrete entities, each with an identical copy of the genome. The division process normally takes place at the centre of the dividing cell and a molecular machine called the Z-ring acts as a belt, constricting tighter and tighter across the middle of the cell until it closes completely, pinching off the daughter from the mother cell. Imagine a small balloon, grasped between thumb and forefinger. As the forefinger bends like a pincer against the thumb, air is squeezed into the two halves of the balloon. When there is no gap between forefinger and thumb, each of the balloon halves, one in the palm of your hand and one above your fingers, are the same volume. As the Z-ring tightens, a protective layer called peptidoglycan, made of strands of carbohydrate cross-linked by short peptide fragments, has to be made afresh and deposited on the surface of the cell. This action must be co-ordinated with all aspects of the division process, otherwise the cell membrane is left uncovered and is prone to rupture, causing death of the cell.\n\nThis proposal concerns how the regulation of the closure of the Z-ring is co-ordinated with peptidoglycan synthesis, and the precise role played by a key protein known as EzrA. These activities are co-ordinated by a multi-protein assembly called the divisome, which links the Z-ring to peptidoglycan synthesis, but in a manner that is not yet understood. We have recently solved the structure of EzrA, which is surprisingly similar to a class of proteins called spectrins that, in animals, are used to link membrane-embedded proteins to the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a shape-defining structure found on the inside face of the cytoplasmic membrane in many cell types, including bacteria, comprising different proteins including actin and tubulin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also comprises actin and tubulin-type proteins, the latter of which is the key component of the contractile Z-ring. EzrA is therefore a structural and functional homologue of spectrin, as it acts to link the cytoskeleton to membrane-embedded proteins that synthesise peptidoglycan, and other membrane-embedded cell division regulators. \n\nIn this proposal we will ascertain the molecular mechanisms used by EzrA to interact with the cytoskeleton, other members of the divisome, including the enzymes that generate peptidoglycan, and key regulators of cell division. The research program will enable for detailed comparisons to be made between the cytoskeletons of bacteria and of animals, which is currently focussed on one or two proteins. A greater understanding of the relationships and the differences between the two cytoskeletons will also provide a greater understanding of the evolution of multicellular life forms from their simpler, single-celled predecessors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M001180/1","grantId":"BB/M001180/1","fundValue":"424322","fundStart":"2015-02-21","fundEnd":"2018-02-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard  Lewis","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
