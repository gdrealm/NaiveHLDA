{"id":"4AC798B5-475F-48CA-9E3F-8B44F3C458F9","title":"ClearfLo: Clean Air for London","abstractText":"Poor air quality, particularly in urban areas, has a demonstrable effect on human health, but the processes responsible for producing the main pollutants, namely particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and heat are not well understood and are poorly predicted. The ambition of ClearfLo is to provide integrated measurements of the meteorology, composition and particulate loading of London's urban atmosphere, made at street level and at elevated sites, complemented by modelling, to improve predictive capability for air quality. This ambition will be addressed by establishing new measurement capabilities in London, which will be used for long-term measurements and intensive observation periods, and by analysis and modelling of the measurements to establish key processes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H00324X/1","grantId":"NE/H00324X/1","fundValue":"488654","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  We have published papers, including an overview paper in the high profile journal Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. We have held special sessions at the European Geophysical Society. Contact with policy makers around air quality includes:\n1) meeting with Transport for London to discuss impact of new measurements on emissions inventories\n2) ongoing contact with Greater London Authority Air Quality Manager, and wider dissemination through the Air Pollution Research in London knowledge exchange network to local authority and government policy makers/practitioners\n3) discussion with Prof Ian Boyd, Chief Scientific Advisor at DEFRA\n4) dissemination of project findings at International level through invitation to Hong Kong, and CSIRO in Australia - influencing policy makers and professional practioners on air quality as part of policies for healthy cities\nDissemination is ongoing beyond project end date.

The new measurements have produced data at an unprecedented level of detail which will allow careful analysis of the drivers of poor air quality The basic science developed in this project will form the basis of improved air quality models Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
