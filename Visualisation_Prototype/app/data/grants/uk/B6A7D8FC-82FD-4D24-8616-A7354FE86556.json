Previous research by the grant holders in 2011 produced three results of great relevance to the present political situation. First, Egyptian public opinion appeared overwhelmingly supportive of democracy. Second, differences between supporters of different parties were minimal. A third feature of public opinion, however, illustrated clearly the nature of the country’s current democratic cross-roads because in 2011 there were strong levels of support for a ‘guardian army’ among supporters of all parties.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, Egyptian public opinion cannot now hold on the lines of 2011. But, in what directions is it breaking? The answers may be crucial to the democratic future and governability of the country. The project will conduct two nationally representative samples of Egyptians, and using the data, the project will inform beneficiaries about the democratic commitments of Egyptian citizens and will create a new and unique publicly-accessible survey database that can be a basis and anchor for further academic research on Egypt.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L008092/1","grantId":"ES/L008092/1","fundValue":"121555","fundStart":"2013-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  POLICY and PUBLIC SERVICES:\nBoth British and Egyptian governments have engaged actively with our research results. Representatives from the FCO, DfID, the Egyptian Embassy in London and the Egyptian military participated in a 2 day seminar entitled 'Egypt and Democracy'; on 17-18 September 2014. The seminar showcased our new data relating to changing democratic attitudes in Egypt from 2011-14, as well as providing an opportunity for research beneficiaries (from academia, the public and private sectors) to present and discuss similar and alternative perspectives. Subsequently, our data presentations were sent to the British Embassy in Cairo at their request.\nCULTURAL and SOCIETAL:\nWe have submitted and are in the final stages of approval for an article entitled 'Media, Cultural Consumption and Normative Support for Democracy in Post-Revolutionary Egypt'. The article currently has the status of resubmitted after a request for revisions in the international journal Political Studies. The article takes a highly original approach. Rather than empirically recounting and analysing cultural production that allegedly inspired, or was inspired, by Egypt's recent revolution, it attempts to quantify the impact of cultural production on support for democracy in Egypt. This analysis, even prior to publication, has also played a supportive role (via citations and comparative analysis) in two further publications that interrogate current research approaches in the fields of literature and counter-terrorism: Kendall, 'Does Literature Matter?';; (eds. Ostle, Allen, and Mustafa Badawi, Modern Arabic Literary Studies, EUP 2015); Kendall, 'Yemen's al-Qa'ida'; Poetry as a Weapon of Jihad; (eds. Kendall and Stein, Twenty-First Century Jihad, I.B.Tauris, 2014).

In 2011, democracy was most strongly supported by the educated, young people, living in urban areas, and there was no gender gap in attitudes; by 2013, exactly these sorts of people had become less supportive of democracy than others, and a large gender gap (women supporting less than men) had opened. In 2011, support for democracy was aspirational in economic terms: those who had done relatively badly in the past but who had higher hopes for the economy in future were the more likely to support; this is no longer the case by 2013. Interestingly, support for democracy in 2011 was also more likely among Islamists, who saw the possibility of achieving their agenda through the ballot box; again, this is no longer the case. The findings have clear implications for the stability of democracy in the country. We have been active in disseminating our results via a large conference and through responding to specific requests for our analysis from UK government agencies, including the FCO, Department for Defense and DfID. We intent to continue and widen our dissemination activities. Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy","dataset":"gtr"}
