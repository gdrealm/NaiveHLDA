In particular, to assess whether providing information feedback on team rankings or strengthening incentives via tournaments affects team composition and productivity. </p>\n\n<p>When workers are rewarded according to the productivity of their team, they face a trade-off between sorting by ability and sorting by social connections. On the one hand, high ability workers prefer to work together to achieve higher joint productivity and higher earnings. On the other hand, workers prefer to form teams with socially connected workers both because it might be easier to cooperate with friends and because she might derive utility from the company of friends. </p>\n\n<p>Changing the information provided to workers and the strength of team incentives changes the terms of this trade-off and hence allows to estimate the causal effect of social connections on team composition and productivity.</p>\n\n<p>The productivity effect of providing information and incentives is theoretically ambiguous as both factors can motivate fast teams while discouraging slow teams. Assessing the relative strength of these effects has important consequences for the development of incentive theory and the design of workersâ€™ compensation systems.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1859","grantId":"RES-000-22-1859","fundValue":"80224","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Oriana  Bandiera","coPersons":["Iwan  Barankay"],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
