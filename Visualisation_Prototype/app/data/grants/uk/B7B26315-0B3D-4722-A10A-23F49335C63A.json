It involves four technical tasks:\n(1) development of the cooler design and optimization tool and determination of cooler performance data (Month 1-6, led by\nHull, with Tsinghua and ebm-papst); (2) construction and testing of a 4 kW rated cooler, and identification of associated\nmanufacturing machines/tools (Month 7-14, led by Hull, with ebm-papst and Sinogreen); (3) development of a\nmanufacturing process with a computerised energy management system, and production of a 20 kW rated cooler (Month 7-\n18, led by Sinogreen, with Tsinghua, ebm-papst and Hull); and (4) installation, real-time measurement, public\ndemonstration and marketing preparation of the cooler (Month 19-24, led by Sinogreen, with Tsinghua and Hull).\nIt is expected that (1) a combination of the energy management system and modular/numerical manufacturing\nmachines/tools will reduce energy use of the manufacturing process by around 20%; (2) the new cooler will achieve around\n25% higher cooling efficiency and 40% higher COP, compared with existing dew point air coolers. This exciting leapforward\nin technological development could create a new type of air cooler that has comparable price/size to traditional\nvapour compression air conditioners but significantly higher COP over the traditional ones (7 to 8 times higher). This\ndistinguished technological advance should open up an enormous new global business in the air conditioning sector, thus\ncreating considerable impact on the economy, industry and the environment within the UK, China and beyond.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507830/1","grantId":"EP/M507830/1","fundValue":"381235","fundStart":"2015-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xudong  Zhao","coPersons":["Kevin Stephen Fancey"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
