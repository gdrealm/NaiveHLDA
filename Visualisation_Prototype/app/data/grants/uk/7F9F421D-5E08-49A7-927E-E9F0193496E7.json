How do these compare with those found in the USA?</li>\n\n <li>How do life course factors influence these late career transitions?</li>\n\n <li>How is the idea of ‘extended working life’ being constructed within the workplace?</li>\n\n <li>What is the impact of late-career transitions on work place practices, re-training, human resources and occupational health policies?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>A multi-disciplinary consortium of researchers from seven Universities, the Institute of Occupational Medicine and the International Longevity Centre UK will undertake the research.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002949/1","grantId":"ES/L002949/1","fundValue":"593237","fundStart":"2014-01-21","fundEnd":"2017-03-20","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah  Vickerstaff","coPersons":["Andrew Keith Weyman","David Richard Lain","Benjamin  Baumberg","Mark  Robinson","Christopher  Phillipson","David  Wainwright","Charlotte Elizabeth Clark","Joanne  Crawford","Wendy Anne Loretto"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
