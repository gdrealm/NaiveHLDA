Each presents a potential threat to their safety and security. Such threats may be related to an older person’s well-being, home, environment or other people that they come into contact with, and events such as crime, falling, illness, isolation, abuse etc., which if they happen require additional support for the older person and can reduce their quality of life. </p> \n<p>The aim of the <em>Keeping Individuals Safe and Secure</em> network is to form a multidisciplinary team to identify, assess and prioritise threats relating to safety and security that occur during the day-to-day lives of older people and how such threats can affect their independent living and quality of life. The network is actively engaging older people so the priorities&nbsp;They identify can inform and shape the research agenda. A major deliverable of this network will be a Collaborative Research Proposal to develop multidisciplinary solutions to minimise the highest priority threats identified.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-351-25-0140","grantId":"RES-351-25-0140","fundValue":"13771","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2007-10-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Rachel  McCrindle","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
