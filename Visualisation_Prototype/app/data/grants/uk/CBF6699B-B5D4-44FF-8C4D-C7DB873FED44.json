Comparable systems have been documented for pain, emotions and sensations (eg touch).&nbsp; This has been linked to empathy, conceptually, because it suggests that there is a common system for dealing both with our own current state and those of other people. We may, in some literal sense, share the feelings of others because of a shared neural circuitry for self and other.&nbsp; For a small number of people, seeing touch does trigger conscious tactile experiences on their own body - 'mirror touch synaesthesia'.&nbsp;&nbsp; This appears to be linked with heightened empathy.&nbsp; This ESRC-funded research project will investigate the cognitive, affective and neural mechanisms of the tactile mirror system.&nbsp; The operation of this system will be explored in the normal population and those with mirror-touch synaesthesia.&nbsp; The research will consider the following: how different spatial frames of reference map between self and other; how the tactile mirror system is affected by touch to different people/objects; how individual differences in this system are linked with measures of empathy; and what distinguishes conscious from unconscious ‘mirrored’ percepts.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F036248/1","grantId":"ES/F036248/1","fundValue":"288279","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jamie  Ward","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
