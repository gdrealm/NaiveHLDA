{"id":"CD72EB6A-E3D1-4B75-BF75-B4B04D54509B","title":"Metaphysical Indeterminacy","abstractText":"This project is an investigation of metaphysical indeterminacy. We encounter the phenomenon of indeterminacy everywhere: from abstract puzzles to crucial ethical questions debated by doctors, politicians, and the public. When, for example, does a foetus become a person? Could we ever pinpoint the exact instant to the day, minute or second? Engaging the question at such a level of detail looks foolhardy at best. Instead, it seems that there is simply 'no fact of the matter' as to when the transition occurs. Yet if there is no determinate answer to such questions--if they are indeterminate--we must consider the broader implications.\\n\\nIndeterminacy is widely discussed by philosophers, but the dominant thought is that it must have one of two distinct sources: our ignorance of hidden facts or imprecision in how we use our words. Yet neither model fits the foetus case well. It is hard to believe that the indeterminacy here arises from ignorance--even knowing everything there was to know about embryonic development wouldn't solve the puzzle. Likewise, the case seems different from examples of indeterminacy that dominate the specialist literature-for example, how many hairs a man can have and count as 'bald'. Such cases show that we lack the required conventions of language--we just haven't decided the exact specifications of our term 'bald'. But it seems that mere linguistic conventions should not bear the weight of such morally significant matters as personhood. The puzzle, then, is that we could know everything about these cases, and decide exactly what we mean by the terms involved, yet still find indeterminacy. We argue that best diagnosis of this is that the indeterminacy here is due to what the world is like, not limitations in our knowledge or representation of the world. That is, the indeterminacy is metaphysical.\\n\\nAnd such metaphysical indeterminacy is not unique to personhood. We might think the future, for example, is indeterminate--there is no fact of the matter about what will happen 100 years from now. Similarly persistence: it may indeterminate whether my car is the same one that I bought from the shop after having so many parts replaced. Recent science even suggests that indeterminacy lies at the heart of fundamental physics. \\n\\nMetaphysical indeterminacy, however, has been unduly ignored--and as a result debates in the subject have been distorted by the apparent need to accommodate all cases of indeterminacy, no matter how intuitively unsuitable, to ignorance-based or linguistic accounts. Thus our primary goal is to develop a clear theory of metaphysical indeterminacy, specifically one which does not force philosophers to give up key logical or semantic principles. \\n\\nThe first stage of the project asks: What does it mean to say that indeterminacy is metaphysical? We will challenge the widespread scepticism of the very notion by providing a detailed account of metaphysical indeterminacy, deriving fresh perspectives on the debate from other areas of metaphysics (e.g. time and possibility). We will compare our theory to its rivals, especially to positions which maintain that indeterminacy must be due to our own thoughts and practices.\\n\\nWe will develop a detailed formal theory to model these ideas. Our previous work on indeterminacy's relationship to formal theories of possibility and time, and conditionality, shows great promise for creating a theory that, crucially, is compatible with classical logic.\\n\\nThe final stage applies these investigations to cases which motivate the project. The investigators will each examine areas for the application of metaphysical indeterminacy: beginning and end of life puzzles (Williams); the 'unsettledness' of the future (Barnes); and metaphysical explanation (Cameron). These theoretical reflections have direct relevance to key moral problems - helping explain, for example, what it means when we say there is 'no fact of the matter' as to when a foetus becomes a person.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H036520/1","grantId":"AH/H036520/1","fundValue":"160395","fundStart":"2010-09-30","fundEnd":"2014-01-15","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  No identifiable impact has yet been realized, though the PI is exploring whether follow-up work on ethical decision-making in contexts of indeterminacy can be developed with interested parties.

In some cases, it is possible to inquire further and gain that knowledge---the facts are out there; we are just ignorant of them; and with enough time and ingenuity they can be uncovered. But in some cases the ignorance goes deeper---it is a reflection of there being no facts to be learned. A simple illustration: consider whether a wall coloured in a shade borderline between red and orange is *really* red. No amount of detailed inquiry can resolve the question---this is indeterminacy. \n\nThis project explored the hypothesis that not just superficial phenomena like colour categories, but also the most basic and fundamental structure of our world could give rise to these questions-without-answers. \n\nSuch &amp;quot;metaphysical indeterminacy&amp;quot;---indeterminacy in the world itself, independent of how we think and talk about it---is widely viewed with suspicion in our field. Part of the project was in laying out and defending the very notion (critically evaluating the introductory gloss above, for example, which already makes some substantive theoretical presuppositions), and developing formal tools to model our subject. \n\nThe other half of the project was to explore applications---specific areas of independent interest in which indeterminacy appears to arise at a metaphysically basic level. These included time (indeterminacy in how the future will unfold); survival through time (cases where it is indeterminate whether you yourself survive an episode); and states of affairs (the basic building blocks of reality, according to one influential philosophical account). Our defence of the coherence and formal structure of metaphysical indeterminacy legitimizes it as a theoretical resource. A common form of argument one meets is that some otherwise attractive philosophical theory is problematic because it is committed to metaphysical indeterminacy. The work we have done in this project removes that roadblock. \n\nThe formal tools that we developed in this project include a generalization of probability theory and decision theory to non-classical settings, and a novel account of distinct patterns of decision making under indeterminacy even when classical assumptions are not disrupted. These should be of broad interest to the formal modelling of rational belief and decision, within philosophy and cognate disciplines, since they explore how standard models of rationality need to be altered or generalized when the idealizing assumption of determinacy is dropped. Williams, together with other researchers in the field, is currently working on extensions of this work to cases where fundamental moral principles are at stake, but where there is indeterminacy in what one ought to do. \n\nFinally, in published and forthcoming work the investigators have evaluated accounts of indeterminacy in future facts (Cameron, Barnes and Cameron), in states of affairs (Barnes) and in survival (Williams) which will inform ongoing research in those metaphysical debates.
