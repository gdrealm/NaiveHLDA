{"id":"CEEC0AC4-AA3A-4AAF-A218-3DE8794A66E6","title":"Attitudes to the role of government in Northern Ireland","abstractText":"<p>There has been much discussion in the last decade about whether citizens of liberal democracies are apathetic about politics, and distrustful about politics and the conduct of politicians. One symptom of this - decline in electoral turnout - is particularly evident among young people. This is worrying to public bodies as well as theorists, since an initial decision not to vote often becomes a pattern for later life. </p> \n<p>Research into attitudes to the role of government and interest in politics was undertaken in Northern Ireland in 1996. However, the political framework in Northern Ireland has changed significantly since then, especially since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. It is therefore timely to measure attitudes to government and politics, and assess any changes in the intervening years. </p> \n<p>This research will be based on a module of questions in the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey which is an annual survey of a random sample of adults aged 18 years and over living in Northern Ireland. The module will explore attitudes to the role of government in Northern Ireland and will incorporate the 2006 International Social Survey Programme Role of Government module, as well as associated questions related to political attitudes.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E013023/1","grantId":"ES/E013023/1","fundValue":"24556","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Katrina  Lloyd","coPersons":["Paula  Devine"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
