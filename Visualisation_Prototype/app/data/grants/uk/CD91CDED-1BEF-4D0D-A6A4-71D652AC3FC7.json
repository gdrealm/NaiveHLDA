CTA is much more sensitive and precise than any previous gamma-ray observatory and is expected to provide discoveries on topics as diverse as the detection of dark matter, the origin of cosmic rays and the nature of gamma-ray bursts. This grant would provide support for UK scientists to travel to CTA meetings and participate in the design of the CTA observatory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J000876/1","grantId":"ST/J000876/1","fundValue":"8000","fundStart":"2011-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-12-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Anthony Hinton","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
