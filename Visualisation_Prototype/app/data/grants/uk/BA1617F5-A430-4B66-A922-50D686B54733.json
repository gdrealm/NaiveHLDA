However, this work has proceeded more or less in a piecemeal fashion, and there is a need to carry out a systematic investigation of factors that may be influential in tasks measuring infants' ability to keep track of objects and their identity.</p>\n\n<p>This project provides that investigation, in a programme of experiments evaluating the numerical interpretation against lower level perceptual accounts based on single and multiple object tracking. The work will mainly use infant looking time as indication of violation of expectation. Specifically, we will measure infant looking time in response to object addition and subtraction manipulations involving:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>violation of the numerical outcome</li>\n\n <li>violation of object location(s)</li>\n\n <li>violation of object identity.&nbsp; </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These studies will be supplemented by precise eye tracking in cases in which different accounts predict different looking patterns. It is anticipated that the results will provide clarity regarding the bases of infant ability in this key area of enquiry.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000934/1","grantId":"ES/K000934/1","fundValue":"556940","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Bremner","coPersons":["Alan Michael Slater"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
