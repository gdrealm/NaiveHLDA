{"id":"4A1437AA-F790-4C5B-86D3-5C763D0F2649","title":"2012 Consolidated Grant Supplememt","abstractText":"This grant is to continue the groups programme of investigation into the properties of elementary particles and the fundamental forces of nature. One of the main objectives of this grant will be to support the exploitation of three new experiments which will be taking data during the period of this grant. The CMS experiment will break new ground in studying the constituents of matter and their interactions, hoping to observe the Higgs particle and understand the origins of mass, as well as searching for new phenomena, such as finding evidence of potential dark matter candidates. The LHCb experiment will offer complementary tests of the Standard Model with the ability to look for extremely rare decays in flavour physics which are sensitive to contributions from new physics, as well as measuring CP violation in the decays of B mesons. Both these experiments will make extensive use of Grid computing which the group will continue to develop and exploit.\nThe T2K experiment will allow us to expand our understanding of the masses and mixings in the neutrino sector, and should provide a key measurement which will guide us as to whether we ultimately could see evidence of CP violation in the neutrino sector. Follow on experiments looking to measure CP violation in neutrinos would require a dedicate neutrino factory, and the group is heavily involved in understanding the issues in preparing an accelerator for such a facility. One of the other missing pieces of the neutrino puzzle is whether the neutrino is its own anti-particle. This grant will support preparation of a future experiment to attempt to determine if the neutrino is a Majorana particle.\nThe universe may be largely composed of Dark Matter which until now remains un-detected. The group will continue is activity in searching for direct evidence of a dark matter candidate.\nAccelerators which are used in particle physics also have potential applications for energy, and healthcare, and the group will continue its research into how to apply techniques which have benefit for future research accelerators as well as applied use of accelerators.\nThe group will also be active in preparing the next generation of detectors for future facilities, both at the high luminosity upgrade of the LHC, as well as for other future colliders.\nIn addition the group will be collaborating on preparing a space based experiment designed to search for evidence of gravitational waves, as well as a new accelerator based experiment to look for charged lepton flavour violation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001369/1","grantId":"ST/M001369/1","fundValue":"11280","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Jordan  Nash","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
