Osteoarthritis is the main cause of restricted activity in the everyday life of older people, and as the numbers of older people increase in Western societies, so the influence of chronic joint pain on the quality of life and the costs of health and social care will increase. We plan to follow a large group of older people with and without lower limb joint pain, and with and without mobility limitations, over time, and investigate what causes the onset and progression of restricted activity. This will help to inform better primary care and preventive programmes for this very common problem.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501798","grantId":"G0501798","fundValue":"930194","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Croft","coPersons":["Bie-Nie  Ong","Clare  Jinks","George  Peat","Kelvin  Jordan","Peter  Jones","Christopher  Phillipson","Elaine  Thomas","Umesh  Kadam","Elaine  Hay"],"organisation":"Keele University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
