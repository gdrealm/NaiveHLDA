{"id":"2DF6B2CF-87D6-42AE-AAC2-FCFB0C13FDA4","title":"Measurement of Risk and Time Preferences in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging","abstractText":"<p>Many choices in life depend on how willing people are to take risks, or to forgo current pleasures for greater future rewards. Examples include how much to save or whether to undergo a risky medical procedure. We will study how willingness to take risks or to delay reward varies across individuals, and how these attributes change with age and changing circumstances. Past has shown that a good way to measure these attributes is to ask people to play simple games in which they choose between options that are associated with small but real prizes. </p>\n\n<p>The English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing collects detailed information on the choices and economic outcomes of individuals over 50 years of age in England. This includes details of income, wealth, saving and debts. It also collects information on their expectations and cognitive abilities. The goal of this research is to supplement this information with new measures of willingness to take risk and willingness to delay reward. Having such measures will immediately provide a much more complete picture of the factors that shape choices relating to savings and borrowing, choices about health behaviours, and decisions in other domains. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4264","grantId":"RES-000-22-4264","fundValue":"86530","fundStart":"2010-12-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Thomas Fraser Crossley","coPersons":["James  Banks","Syngjoo  Choi","Sule  Alan","Aldo  Rustichini"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
