{"id":"F510946C-7357-4C54-82AF-A68BF11E9DF7","title":"Degenerate Oscillatory Integral Operators","abstractText":"In recent years, Fourier Analysis on Euclidean Spaces has become an extremely active research area in the USA and Europe and many of the centralproblems in this area can be reduced to understanding various oscillatory integral operators. The underlying geometry of the problemoften makes the corresponding operator degenerate in a certain sense. In thisproject we aim to explore and understand degenerateoscillatory integral operators which arise in keyresearch areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D03289X/1","grantId":"EP/D03289X/1","fundValue":"154388","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"James  Wright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
