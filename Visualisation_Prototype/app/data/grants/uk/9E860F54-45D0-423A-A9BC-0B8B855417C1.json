This proposal concerns an 18-month experimental study into the application of surface plasma actuators as an active boundary layer and wake control technique with the aim of reducing the drag and Trailing Edge self-noise of aerofoil. Two configurations will be investigated: (1) an aerofoil with blunt trailing edge - which characteristically combines a superior lift performance with high drag and significant tone noise radiation; (2) an aerofoil with a sharp trailing edge - which typically produces broadband self-noise in high Reynolds number flow. The main technology under investigation here is the relatively new, though rapidly expanding, surface plasma actuators. The usage of surface plasma actuators for flow control is very attractive for industrial applications because this technique is highly energy efficient, has a fast response, a simple structure, can be used for both steady and unsteady actuations and creates no profile drag when not in operation. The proposed research aims to simultaneously optimise the aerodynamical and aeroacoustical performances of aerofoil with blunt as well as sharp trailing edges. The expected outcome of this research is an extensive validation of the effectiveness of surface plasma actuator as a relatively novel technique for the reduction of drag and noise generated by aircraft components such as the turbofan engine and airframe. The outcome of this research is also transferable to the wind turbine industry and fan-based home appliance sector.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K002309/1","grantId":"EP/K002309/1","fundValue":"97827","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the Government has committed to significant year-on-year greenhouse gas cuts towards an 80% reduction (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050. At a time of heightened sensitivity regarding the economic cost of government policies, the technological maturity of wind power is an attractive option. Onshore wind capacity is set to double by 2020, with offshore set for a four-fold rise, which will result in increased pressure to find suitable onshore and offshore sites. The drive for greater energy yield and technological developments are producing turbines of increasing size that are more likely to result in intrusive low-frequency noise. It is highly likely that in future the UK will see higher numbers of larger turbines affecting increasing numbers of neighbouring residents. Wind turbine noise is a high concern for communities, resulting in planning obstruction and operational complaints. \n\nThe new technology of plasma actuator developed in this EPSRC project will address this issue, by seeking to preserve the quality of life for nearby residents of existing and proposed wind turbine developments, and helping to ensure that the politics of wind turbines does not impede the critical issue of developing more sustainable means of energy generation. In 2014, the Energy Scientific Advisory Committee ranks wind power technology of high importance due to current wind power deployment plans and the substantial UK wind resource (the best in Europe). The target of increasing public acceptability of wind power technology is an urgent requirement.\n\nThis EPSRC project concerns an experimental study into the application of surface plasma actuators as an active boundary layer and wake control technique to reduce the trailing edge self-noise of aerofoil. Using the plasma system, this project aims to: (1) suppress wake vortex shedding produced by a blunt trailing edge, thereby reducing tonal noise; and (2) suppress boundary layer turbulence level on a sharp trailing edge, thereby reducing broadband noise.\n\nSome encouraging results concerning configuration (1) has been achieved, whilst work on configuration (2) is still ongoing. An in-house plasma system has been developed well within the set deadline. The experiment was performed in the state-of-the-art aeroacoustic wind tunnel at Brunel University (designed by the PI), where narrowband tonal noise reduction of up to an unprecedented level of 20 dB can be achieved by the plasma actuators. This result has already been disseminated in the 20th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustic Conference (also called Aviation 2014) in Atlanta, USA on 16-20 June 2014. Presenting the result in this conference has exerted considerable impact because it is regarded as the premier international forum that attracts the world's best scientist, engineers, industrialists and academics. The result is also being documented in the Journal of Sound and Vibration, and will be made open access for dissemination to a wider audience.\n\nThe Mechanical Engineering subject area of Brunel University offers its course with an optional Monitored Professional Development Scheme (MPDS). Students who choose the &quot;with MPDS&quot; courses will secure a 1-year industrial placement with companies including the GE Aviation, Rolls Royce, DSTL and Alstom Power. The PI, being the Industrial Placement Officer at his department, has the opportunity to visit these companies. The visits offered the PI opportunities to communicate his research activities, including this EPSRC project, to relevant industrial beneficiaries, expand his network of collaboration and pursue further work in the area as well as the commercialisation of the project outcomes.\n\nThe university open days offer another opportunity in which the PIs can inform the general public about the innovative research conducted in the area of aerofoil self-noise reduction by plasma flow control. The PIs will organise a poster exhibition event to raise public awareness regarding the impact of aircraft noise on the airport capacity and UK economy, and most importantly to provide information on the most up to date research efforts in reducing the aircraft noise. Given the close proximity of Brunel University to Heathrow Airport and the noise-sensitive areas that are under the flight paths, this event has a high potential to achieve significant social impact because it is expected to attract a wide audience who are genuinely concerned about the aviation noise. \n\nA half day technical workshop will be organised at the end of the project for the dissemination of the major results to academics and industrial project partners.

This project validates the effectiveness of plasma actuator as a relatively novel technique for the simultaneous reduction of drag and noise generated by aerofoil with blunt and sharp trailing edges. \n\nA new &quot;hybrid&quot; approach has been developed during the course of the project to combine plasma actuator (active control) and non-flat plate serration geometry (passive control) together. The latter is inspired by owl's wing through profiling the trailing edge of an aerofoil in a serrated pattern. However, it is different with the conventional flat plate type because the serration pattern is cut directly into the aerofoil body. The plasma actuators are then applied at the vicinity of the exposed blunt roots to suppress the vortex shedding. Preliminary experimental data at low Reynolds number suggests that the hybrid control method is effective in reducing noise over a broadband of frequencies, but crucially avoids unwanted vortex shedding noise and maintains the aerodynamic performance and structural integrity. The result has been disseminated in the 20th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustic Conference (also called Aviation 2014) in Atlanta, USA on 16-20 June 2014 (JH Kim, L Al-Sadawi, A Vathylakis and TP Chong, &quot;Trailing edge noise reduction by passive and active flow controls&quot;, AIAA-2014-3300, 2014, 10 pages). Further test is needed at higher Reynolds number to determine the versatility of the hybrid devices.\n\nThe research work will soon be entering the next phase of the project, where the plasma actuator will be investigated in the reduction of trailing edge broadband noise. The results will be updated in this site as soon as they become available.\n\nWhen an aerofoil encounters gusty wind, high level of freestream turbulence impinges on the aerofoil's leading edge. This interaction is extremely effective in radiating broadband noise with a sound pressure level significantly higher than the trailing edge self-noise. So far the only mitigating technology is to use leading edge tubercles. Some successes in noise reduction have been demonstrated by this, but the drag is also increased which causes a degradation in the aerodynamic performance. This particular issue was not part of the original EPSRC proposal, but it represents an avenue for further research of the plasma actuator because it offers the benefits of light weight, controllable actuations and most importantly no extra profile drag will be inadvertently produced. It is envisaged that the plasma actuator can be a better solution for the reduction of leading edge-gust interaction noise. An expert in the aeroacoustic field (Prof. PF Joseph) from the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at University of Southampton has been invited to collaborate on this research. The plasma system developed in this ESPRC project is based on aerofoil operating in a relatively uniform smooth flow where trailing edge self-noise is the dominant noise generation mechanism. The plasma system can easily be extended to aerofoil subjected to gusty flow, thus making it effective in suppressing the leading edge-gust interaction noise. The technology developed in this EPSRC project could be further developed, and the areas where the plasma system is likely to have most impact are on aero engines, wind turbine, Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC), open rotor aircraft, power generation gas turbine and cooling fan of home appliances including personal computer. \n\nThese high tech manufacturers are naturally conservative and new technology is adopted only after very extensive testing and in-depth studies are undertake of the economic in terms of balancing the advantages of noise reductions against the manufacturing costs, maintenance costs, safety, and any possible degradation in aerodynamic performance. Some of these companies, such as the wind turbine companies are more likely to introduce trailing edge serration and/or leading edge tubercles in the short term as these can be retro-fitted onto existing wind turbine blades and easily removed should problems arise. The adoption by these companies of the plasma actuators developed in this EPSRC project would require it to be incorporated at the manufacturing stage. The eventual adoption of plasma technology by them is therefore foreseeable in the longer term. \n\nThis EPSRC project provides scope for academic extension and further research involving multiple disciplines. The design of the surface plasma can be further improved such that higher ionic wind speed can be produced. Most importantly, a reliable insulation system should be developed to allow the plasma actuator operating in hazardous environments. Another area that could be improved is the reduction of high frequency noise produced by the plasma actuators. All these require contributions from researchers of different background, such as smart materials, electrical engineering and environment sensing. The results of this project will open up new and exciting avenues for the promotion of both active and passive flow control techniques, which could include synthetic jets, compliant surfaces and vortex generators for the reduction of the aerofoil self-noise.
