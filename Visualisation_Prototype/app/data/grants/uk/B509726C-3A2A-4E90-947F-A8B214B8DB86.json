The gap in life expectancy between the rich and the poor in the UK is some eight years, or 10% of average life span. The life expectancy gap, which has increased since the 1970?s, reflects similar social differences in disability and ill-health. We show that social inequalities in health are not confined to the poor. They follow a stepwise social gradient, even in office-based Civil Servants. Two types of long-term stress associated with work were linked with an increased risk of heart disease. These are (1) low levels of control and high levels of demand, and (2) high levels of effort expended together with low levels of reward (respect, salary and career prospects). Although there is a widespread perception that stress is known to cause heart disease, the link has not been proved without doubt. We need to exclude the possibility that increased heart disease risk in those reporting stress is due to smoking, diet and exercise, and other risk factors linked with low social class position. We are studying the biological effects of stress, in order to show the processes that link stress with the development of heart disease. For example, we show the stress hormone (cortisol) is higher in women reporting financial insecurity, and that high cortisol is linked to higher risk of diabetes in our study. We show also that depression is associated with poorer blood vessel function. We will continue to follow participants? health, physiological and biochemical changes in order to collect more evidence for these processes. Most participants are now retired, and there are large social inequalities in several measures of physical and mental health in this group, which we will study as participants grow older. With MRC support we will also compare social inequalities in health in similar longitudinal studies in France, Finland, Japan and USA, and other studies in the UK. During 2003 the Health and Safety Executive published draft guidelines to reduce stress in the workplace, based partly on our research. Stress is blamed for over 10 million days per year of sickness absence. We will evaluate this pilot scheme in private and public sector organisations in order to see if employees report lower stress levels after introduction of the scheme.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G8802774","grantId":"G8802774","fundValue":"12209000","fundStart":"1989-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Gideon Marmot","coPersons":["Archana  Singh-Manoux","Eric John Brunner","Martin John Shipley","Jennifer Anne Head","Tarani  Chandola","Annie Rebecca Britton","Jack  Guralnik"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
