{"id":"0C70D8CD-E3FA-4BE1-BCCC-397324FF2A93","title":"Choice and Inequality in Public Service Access and Outcomes: The Case of Healthcare","abstractText":"<p>Over the past decade, the government in England has increased the choices available to patients about where they receive care by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>offering patients a formal choice about where to receive hospital treatment</li>\n\n <li>expanding the set of hospitals patients can choose between by allowing privately owned hospitals to treat NHS patients. </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This programme of research will examine how increasing patient choice has affected inequalities in the access to and use of the NHS, and the implications for subsequent health outcomes. The research will be organised around three projects:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Responses to the choice policy by patient type or characteristics. Is there any evidence that some patient groups have benefitted more than others?</li>\n\n <li>Childbirth: <br />\n\n  <ul>\n   \n\n   <li>A case of repeated choice, where private providers do not deliver NHS funded care.&nbsp;</li>\n\n   <li>Does choice operate differently when private providers do not enter the market? </li>\n\n   <li>Do women use their own experiences of childbirth when making decisions about subsequent pregnancies?</li>\n\n  </ul>\n</li>\n\n <li>The potential effects of future choice reforms on equity. A structural model of patient behaviour will be developed to illustrate the potential effects of potential policies that could affect patient choice.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009060/1","grantId":"ES/K009060/1","fundValue":"246545","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Elaine  Kelly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
