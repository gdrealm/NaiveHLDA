This research focuses on the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), a growth promoting protein that is present at high levels on the surface of cancer cells, enabling them to survive and spread through tissues. Our research shows that depleting cells of IGFR, using a molecular technique called gene silencing, makes cancer cells easier to kill by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This effect has proved to be associated with impaired function of a large nuclear protein called ATM, which orchestrates the response to DNA damage. It is unclear how the IGFR at the cell surface can influence ATM function, although it probably involves one or more of the signalling proteins that are activated by the IGFR. Preliminary studies have identified two such candidate mediators, and this research is investigating how these are linked to the function of ATM. Understanding this process will reveal how cancer cells coordinate growth and DNA repair, and will enable us to use more effectively the IGFR inhibitors that are becoming available as novel cancer therapeutics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601061","grantId":"G0601061","fundValue":"477784","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"V  Macaulay","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
