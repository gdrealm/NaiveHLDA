{"id":"63B33673-535B-4BC8-B605-F9CF9ED04782","title":"Advanced numerical techniques for characterising obstructions in sewer pipes","abstractText":"The underground sewer system in the U.K. is approximately 300,000 km long, for which the replacement costs are estimated to be 104 billion. The sewer system is owned by the privatised water companies who have a legal duty to maintain the structural and operational conditions of their sewer systems, and this includes reducing flooding incidents. In approximately 80% of cases, flooding incidents are caused by obstructions arising from the deterioration of a pipe wall, or from large deposits of sediment and/or fat. The detection and removal of obstructions should form part of any maintenance programme, although the ability to do this is currently restricted by the lack of a fast and reliable method. This project will focus on using sound waves to detect and characterise obstructions in sewers. Here, loudspeakers generate a pressure pulse that travels down a sewer pipe; this pulse is normally strongly reflected by any obstruction it encounters and by using microphones to capture the reflected energy information about the obstruction may be captured quickly and easily. Accordingly, this method offers a fast and objective way to monitor large sewer systems.The proposed research aims to deliver a step change improvement to a prototype acoustic device developed in a previous (experimentally based) EPSRC project (EP/D058589/1). The current device relies on cross-correlation between new acoustic intensity measurements and measurements stored for known sewer defects; however, this methodology is limited by the number of experimental studies it's possible to undertake and difficulties when interpreting measured intensity data. Furthermore, the current method can say nothing about the geometry, or surface characteristics, of an obstruction, and there is no proof that a unique link exists between the measured data and the properties of the obstruction. The proposed research seeks to address these issues by using mathematical models to aid in the development of a new measurement methodology that treats the acoustic intensity as a complex quantity rather than using the traditional real valued representation adopted in the current device. Here, complex acoustic intensity has the potential to uncover significantly more information from scattered sound fields when compared to a real valued intensity representation, and it is the measurement of complex intensity in acoustic waveguides that forms the focus of this proposal.Although complex intensity measurements have the potential to deliver significantly more information, they are not well understood, especially for scattering from obstacles in an acoustic waveguides. Accordingly, to gain a better understanding of complex intensity it is desirable to develop mathematical models and here both frequency and time domain models are proposed. The frequency domain model is based on the finite element method in order to accommodate those irregular geometries typically found in sewer systems; the time domain model is based on taking an inverse Fourier transform of the frequency domain calculations and will also utilise an inverse analysis in order to address issues such as the uniqueness of measured data. Theoretical predictions will be compared with time-averaged and instantaneous complex intensity measurements obtained under laboratory conditions. In this way, a more general understanding of complex intensity will be developed before this knowledge is applied to the development of a new measurement methodology for sewer systems. Furthermore, to maintain relevance to real sewer systems problems known to affect the accuracy of field measurements, such as manholes, cracks, joints and pipe surface roughness will also be studied. Accordingly, the understanding developed with the mathematical models and laboratory measurements will be used to develop a new prototype experimental methodology suitable for reconstructing the geometry and surface characteristics of obstructions in real sewer systems.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H015280/1","grantId":"EP/H015280/1","fundValue":"247447","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The grant allowed the development of new modelling techniques suitable for studying the propagation of guided waves in large systems. The work was applied specifically to air-borne sound propagation in large ductwork; however the techniques developed have application to all areas of wave propagation. What was important about the work was that it developed fast and efficient modelling techniques, as well as delivering new and efficient methods for particular problems. This means that the models can be used commercially, for example in an iterative design procedure, or in the development of new processes or products. The models can also be applied to a range of wave propagation problems and so it is expected that they will find use in many different research areas in the future.\nThe immediate impact of this work was on the commercial product SewerBatt, which is used to detect blockages in sewer systems. This product has recently received considerable external investment and is now being sold in a number of countries. This grant developed new results and techniques that delivered an improved version of SewerBatt. This product will permit the more efficient study of sewer systems and enable water companies to gain a better understanding of the state of their sewer network. Ultimately it is hoped that this will deliver less pipe leakages and so improve the customer experience.\nThe modelling techniques have also been applied in other areas. They helped in the development of new theoretical models for gas turbine exhaust silencers. These models are currently being used commercially and helping to improve the commercial competiveness of a collaborating company. The modelling techniques were also applied in the design of a new silencer and a patent application has recently been filed. This new design is now being marketed commercially and Brunel University London will receive a royalty payment for each silencer sold.\nFinally, the modelling techniques have been applied to ultrasonic wave propagation in oil and gas pipelines. This grant enabled the researchers to go on to quickly develop new, industry leading, computational models in a related area. These new methods are currently being integrated into the commercial product Teletest through collaboration with TWI, which focusses on the non-destructive testing of oil and gas pipelines. This will improve our ability to detect cracks and corrosion in pipelines and to fix these before the pipes rupture.

These models were significantly more advanced than current commercial software because we were able to accurately capture the boundary conditions of the problem as well as efficiently study large problems. This enabled high levels of accuracy to be obtained and large complex problems to be studied.\nThe model was used to investigate new methods for interrogating blockages and it was found that complex intensity has the potential to reveal significantly more information about blockages. This is true only in regions of high modal scattering and so to take full advantage of this approach it is necessary to work above the plane wave region of the duct. However, it was found that multi-modal sound propagation inside a duct is very sensitive to the boundary conditions inside the duct and it was found to be very difficult to get good agreement between prediction and experiment when using a small number of acoustic sensors. This was a significant new finding because it demonstrated the limitations of this type of approach when using a small number of sensors, or if one has access only to small regions of the pipe.\nThe findings on acoustic intensity prompted investigations into alternative techniques, and a new method was developed to find the length and area of a blockage in a pipe using one or two microphones. This new method was fast and efficient and is currently being integrated into the commercial product developed as part of an accompanying award.\nThe discovery that complex intensity cannot readily be interpreted with a small number of sensors revealed that if we are to gain more detailed knowledge about blockages and/or defects in piping systems then we are likely to need to use significantly more sensors. Towards the end of the project the use of large numbers of axial sensors was investigated theoretically and it was observed that dispersion curves are potentially more reliable and robust when it comes to interrogating piping systems. This result has generated a new line of research and this finding is currently being used on a project examining the non-destructive testing of defects in pipelines.\n\nThis award also generated a brand new method for modelling sound radiation from a flanged and unflanged pipe. This is a classic wave propagation problem and the new method proposed is fast and efficient and offers an alternative to traditional techniques such as perfectly matched layers and infinite elements. This technique has the potential to be applied more generally to any wave propagation problem and we view this new technique as one of the significant achievements of the project. This method is currently being extended to include the effect of mean flow to enable its use in the sound radiation from aero-engines. The academic outcomes lie in new theoretical models developed for wave propagation. These models are currently being extended to the propagation of ultrasonic waves in oil and gas pipelines. This enabled the development of fast and accurate time domain solutions for long pipe lengths, and we are the first researchers to do this. Furthermore, the understanding developed in this project has informed the development of new methods for NDT inspection of oil and gas pipelines and we aim to integrate these methods into the commercial product Teletest through collaboration with TWI.\nThe theoretical techniques have also been used in the development of new software for use in the design of gas turbine exhaust silencers. This software is now being used commercially. We also developed a new silencer design that used some of the modelling techniques developed in this award, and a patent application has recently been filed. This new design is currently being marketed commercially and Brunel University London will receive a royalty payment for each silencer sold.\nThe outputs from this project have also been integrated into the commercial product SewerBatt. This product is being developed by other members of the research team and so the details behind this commercialisation will be discussed in their response.
