A key question is in human causal learning is, to what extent are such judgements based on associative learning, or the product of controlled reasoning?</p>\n\n<p>This project seeks evidence to dissociate these two accounts, by testing the extent to which participants can recall cue-outcome pairings under a variety of task conditions. Participants will be instructed to work out which cues cause an outcome. </p>\n\n<p>Analyses will examine whether cue-competition occurs under conditions in which participants are not given any direct instruction to learn about the cues in the task. In these tasks any learning about cue information is tangential to the participants' task goal. Evidence for cue-competition effects in these incidental learning conditions would therefore be inconsistent with a reasoning-based account. </p>\n\n<p>To summarise, the novel methods laid out in this research proposal will permit examination of the conditions under which human learning is governed by associative or reasoning processes. This research will advance our understanding of these fundamental cognitive functions.&nbsp; <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G029180/1","grantId":"ES/G029180/1","fundValue":"169587","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David Robert Shanks","coPersons":["Thomas  Beesley"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
