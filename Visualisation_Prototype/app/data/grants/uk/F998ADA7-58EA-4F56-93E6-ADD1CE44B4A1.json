{"id":"F998ADA7-58EA-4F56-93E6-ADD1CE44B4A1","title":"2010 Grant Balance - University College London","abstractText":"UCL has decided to use this year's Grant Balance award in conjunction with the Shaping Capability: Bridging the Gaps element of the 2010 EPSRC Additional Sponsorship award. We have a particular strategic emphasis on cross-disciplinary research at the moment, seeking to realise the benefits of UCL's broad spectrum of research excellence. The interface between EPSRC's remit and medical research is already large, fairly effectively networked, and well-supported, hence we have chosen to focus this funding on other interfaces that we feel are more in need of this kind of &quot;start up&quot; funding.\n\nThe areas selected for this year's Bridging the Gaps activities are: Digital Humanities, Algae Biotechnology, Sustainable Cities, and Venture Physical Sciences.\n\nWithin Digital Humanities, we will be building on the collaborations formed through our newly established Centre for Digital Humanities and supporting collaborative activities on: The Future of Reading; Text-Mining and Visualisation; and Archaeology, Museums and Imaging.\n\nWithin Algae Biotechnology, we will build upon the activities of an existing cross-disciplinary collaboration Algae@UCL, and in particular looking to link some of the emerging algae-based approaches to biotechnology to issues and relationships identified through the IMRC in Bioprocessing, evolving that research programme in wholly new directions.\n\nWithin Sustainable Cities, we will be supporting a range of small cross-disciplinary projects identified through our annual call for UCL Grand Challenges small grants, and a two-day sandpit (and resulting projects) on &quot;Big Data in the City&quot; as a collaboration between the Sustainable Cities UCL Grand Challenge and the FuturICT FET Flagship activity. A research associate will be supported working to support community building, in particular around sustainable mobility, sustainable resources and architecture and retrofitting.\n\nWithin Venture Physical Sciences, we will be supporting 3-4 highly adventurous Physical Sciences projects, looking to explore new avenues that cross existing divisions within Physical Sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J022179/1","grantId":"EP/J022179/1","fundValue":"149662","fundStart":"2011-07-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The 2011-2012 EPSRC Strategic Award and 2010 EPSRC Grant Balance Award to UCL were combined to support a large range of smaller-scale institutionally focused activities to: (1) increase the impact of EPSRC supported research to industry, policy makers and the general public; (2) widen the pool of researchers involved in research; and (3) generate novel, creative excellent research at the borders of traditional disciplines ('bridging the gaps').\n\nNotable impacts include:\n\n(1) The aim of an policy engagement activity by the Energy Institute (P. Ekins) was to extend UCL's knowledge base on energy efficiency (U-value) range of solid walls found in UK dwellings and summarising research findings in a form suitable for communicating the findings to policy makers. Major outputs included the development of a revised calculation of the impact that changes in solid wall U-value have on energy use in the UK, and a number of brief policy reports aimed at policy makers, particularly within Dept. of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).\n\n(2) R. Downes (UCL Mathematics) undertook a 3-month internship within BIS. He supported the newly created e-Infrastructure Leadership Council, set up in early 2012 by the Minister for Universities and Science, David Willets, to advise the government on all aspects of e-infrastructure (comprising computer resources and associated hardware, networking, software, training and skills).\n\n(3) Arising from a 'bridging the gaps' sandpit in 'Big Data in the City', and using Internet-enabled smartphones, this project aimed to seamlessly and comprehensively log activity - especially travel- and exercise-related activity - undertaken by people suffering from non-communicable health conditions for which patient inactivity is a contributory factor. By automatically measuring trip mode and distance, and by offering feedback in the form of the graphing and sharing of activity with other study participants (a positive and gentle 'push' to the user), the ultimate aim is to promote healthy choices through the creation of an effective peer support group. Work has shown that there is a clear gap in this field, and UCL Hospitals (UCLH) has shown real interest in supporting a full trial. Funding from the SA supported the involvement of the research team, and purchase of 5 smart phones.
