Although the vast majority of ice on Earth is stored in Greenland and Antarctica, it is important to keep in mind that 70% of the cryospheric contribution to 20th century sea-level rise was attributed to the retreat of mountain glaciers and ice caps. Arctic ice masses are an important component of global change, especially as Arctic temperatures are increasing at almost twice the global average. This project focuses on Vestfonna Ice Cap in northeast Svalbard. This Arctic ice cap is of particular interest because its northern ice margin terminates on land while the southern margin contains a series of tidewater outlet glaciers, comparable to those draining the Greenland Ice Sheet. Airborne radio-echo sounding data collected in 1983 and 1986 by Scott Polar Research Institute showed that the volume of Vestfonna Ice Cap was about 500 km3. Aerial photographs and satellite imagery subsequently showed that flow speeds on the southern tidewater glaciers were several hundred metres per year. This was an order of magnitude faster than the surrounding ice and more than double the calculated balance velocities. It was suggested that this negative state of mass balance was a result of short-lived glacier surges. However, the interior ice plateau on Vestfonna Ice Cap is today experiencing widespread progressive thinning, either as a result of changing regional climate dynamics or enhanced discharge from outlet glaciers. This project proposes glaciological investigations on Vestfonna Ice Cap with the aim to quantify the link between climate dynamics and ice flow. The proposed investigations include the collection of radio-echo sounding data in a traverse across the ice cap and in two designated study areas, one on the northern ice margin and one on a southern tidewater glacier. The radar data provide a means to measure ice thickness and examine the nature of the bed, e.g. the distribution of melting and freezing and the presence of water, which serves as a lubricant. We will install two digital cameras near the terminus of Frazerbreen, which is a tidewater glacier, so that we can monitor the position of its calving ice front. A total of six GPS receivers will be installed on the ice to monitor horizontal and vertical motion on a sub-hourly timescale during an 18-month period. By combining GPS data with digital time-lapsed imagery, and output from an automatic weather station, we will be able to understand how forces are balanced in the ice cap and this will enable us to examine how the ice mass behaves under different climatic and oceanographic conditions. With the application of a 3D numerical ice-flow model, we will be able to study the response of the ice cap to global warming and predict its contribution to sea level change.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/F011466/1","grantId":"NE/F011466/1","fundValue":"52789","fundStart":"2008-03-19","fundEnd":"2009-09-18","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The research in this project was carried out as a part of the multinational IPY-Kinnvika initiative, which formed a contribution to the International Polar Year in 2007-2008. With financial support from the Nordic Council of Ministers, an industrial partner and environment funding agencies including the Natural Environment Research Council, scientists from Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, UK, Germany and Poland were allowed access to the remotely positioned and environmentally restricted natural reserve of Nordaustlandet in northeast Svalbard. \n\nThe work in this project were able to resolve the flow and basal condition of the little-studied and extremely positioned Vestfonna Ice Cap on Nordaustlandet. Using ice-penetrating radar, the team was able to make the first complete dataset for ice caps flow, thickness and basal topography. These datasets are now stored on the IPY portal on the NASA Global Change Master Directory (http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\n\nBefore the project commenced, scientific study of the Vestfonna Ice Cap only featured in six peer-reviewed articles. Today, there are more than 20 articles, three of which were direct outputs from this NERC small grant. The research in this project is also featured in the book 'Kinnvika 80 degrees North' by Mikko Lensu and Paula Kankaanpaa, which was published in 2013.

The project was also the first to install GPS receivers on the ice cap's fast-flowing outlet glaciers, and thereby obtain records of ice flow in high temporal resolution over the course of a year. \n\nThe topographic datasets produced in this project were, after their official publication, used as boundary conditions for a 3-dimensional, Full Stokes ice-flow model of Vestfonna Ice Cap. Numerical modelling included inversions of surface velocity maps produced by satellite remote sensing, and these inversions provided crucial new insight to the basal conditions of the ice cap. Discoveries made in this project are of public interest, as there have been only very few previous attempts to observe Vestfonna Ice Cap and its fast-flowing outlet glaciers. Before this project was funded, there were only half a dozen articles about Vestfonna Ice Cap in the peer-reviewed literature. With the outcomes from this project and those by collaborators in IPY-Kinnvika, this body has now grown to more than 20 articles. \n\nThis project has also established new and complete datasets for the ice cap's thickness and basal topography . These new data were instrumental in setting up and developing a state-of-the-art ice flow model, with outcomes explaining why the flow of ice in outlet glaciers is fast. The datasets are freely available to all potential users. Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice","dataset":"gtr"}
