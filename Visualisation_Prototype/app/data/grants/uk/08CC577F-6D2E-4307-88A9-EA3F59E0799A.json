{"id":"08CC577F-6D2E-4307-88A9-EA3F59E0799A","title":"The Vocal Iso(n): The Preservation of Traditions in North East Mediterranean Practice","abstractText":"The primary output of this research is its publication. In the past I have collaborated with Prof. Martin Stokes and Prof. Philip Bohlman from the University of Chicago and thanks to their expertise and guidance I have been able to publish a book and a chapter in another book for Scarecrow Press, Inc. I intend to invite Prof. Stokes to be my Nominated Assessor in order to support my application for the AHRC Small Grants.\nDuring the running of the project I will devise a strategy for: transcribing the oral traditional and liturgical material; making recordings and systematizing them in suitable form; attracting a variety of assistance (both financial and practical), identifying, collecting, copying, storing, cataloguing and disseminating material (some or all of my research output) in a format appropriate for an academic and non-academic audience; publishing material, using a variety of methods including CDs and World Wide Web; providing musicologists, students of Balkan and Byzantine music, and curious readers with a discussion of a much overlooked but richly rewarding musical tradition. My personal experience of living in Albania and being affiliated with the traditional south Albanian music has affected my interests in this particular research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119335/1","grantId":"119335/1","fundValue":"5000","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Eno  Koco","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
