{"id":"1EFDE866-700C-4739-AE81-7A592B2548DD","title":"Wegner estimates and universality for non-Hermitian matrices","abstractText":"In the theory of probability the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) explains why the distribution of the mean of random variables from any distribution follows the Gaussian curve. Although the first observation of this behaviour is due to de Moivre in the 18th century, it was only in the 20th century that the CLT was rigorously proven. A similar phenomenon appears in the theory of random matrices and is called universality. In this context, the universality conjecture asserts that the eigenvalue statistics of large random matrices depend only on the symmetries of the matrices, and are independent of the precise probability densities that govern their stochastic behavior. Furthermore, in the limit of large dimension, the eigenvalues are distributed as if the entries were drawn from the Gaussian distribution. This conjecture is akin to the CLT and has deep philosophical and practical consequences. It is observed in numerics and experiments that many physical systems demonstrate the same behavior independently of the precise details of interactions among their constituent elements. This property of random matrices is conjectured to hold more generally. In particular, it fulfils one of the central objectives in mathematical physics: the derivation of macroscopic properties of large systems, despite unknown or random specifics of interactions. So far, it has been proven only in a few specific cases, such as the Wigner ensemble.\n\nThe goal of this project is to prove universality of various eigenvalue statistics for ensembles consisting of non-Hermitian random matrices. Such ensembles have been studied in both mathematics and physics literature and despite far-reaching applications in various fields of study, are not very well understood. By looking at the work on Hermitian random matrices, we can postulate which theorems should be true in the non-Hermitian case. Despite the slow and steady progress in the area, we see that several difficult and important problems yet remain to be solved. In particular, the study of eigenvalue correlation functions still falls far behind its Hermitian counterpart.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L010305/1","grantId":"EP/L010305/1","fundValue":"272934","fundStart":"2014-05-01","fundEnd":"2017-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Francesco  Mezzadri","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
