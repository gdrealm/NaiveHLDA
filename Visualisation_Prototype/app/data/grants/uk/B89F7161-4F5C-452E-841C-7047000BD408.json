Biominerals such as bones, teeth and seashells provide an ideal inspiration for this approach, as illustrated by Nature's ability to manipulate mechanically weak engineering materials such as calcium carbonate to produce hard skeletal materials that exhibit excellent fracture toughness and unique morphologies. One key feature of these composite materials, which is an essential feature of their superior mechanical properties, is their structures involve strong intercalation of organic molecules within the mineral host. Here organics can not only be located between crystalline units as for materials such as nacre, but also within single crystals, as found for example in sea urchin spines. Indeed, single crystal biominerals often occlude up to several weight per cent of macromolecules, which is perhaps surprising given that crystallization is traditionally considered to be a method for purifying solids. \n\nWe will investigate the application of this biogenic strategy - the encapsulation of &quot;inclusion materials&quot; within single crystals - to create novel composite materials. Although the potential for synthesizing composite materials based on this approach is enormous, our lack of fundamental understanding means that progress in this field remains largely based on trial-and-error experiments. In this project, we have assembled an international team of researchers uniquely positioned to fill this gap, and by doing so we will develop a comprehensive understanding of 1) the mechanisms by which &quot;inclusion materials&quot; are occluded within a crystal lattice; 2) the internal micro- and nano-structure of the resulting single crystal composites; and 3) how the resulting structures ultimately dictate the mechanical properties of the resulting composite material. Our research strategy is based on a systematic study of the incorporation of a broad range of &quot;inclusion&quot; materials - ranging from molecules to microscopic polymer particles, and from compliant to stiff frameworks. We will design and synthesise bespoke molecules, particles and gels with appropriate chemical structures to promote intercalation, and in doing so develop the first truly unified understanding of how additives are occluded within crystals. It is also expected that novel syntheses of polymeric particles and gels will also result from this approach.\n\nUnderstanding the strategies by which biominerals form, and how their design leads to superior properties is clearly a complex, multidisciplinary problem, encompassing fields such as crystal growth, materials characterisation, polymer chemistry, and analysis of mechanical properties. This joint NSF-EPSRC research grant involves an international collaboration between a consortium of world-leading research groups based in the USA and the UK, who by working closely together seek to combine the multidisciplinary expertise of each team to address this complex scientific problem and hence enable the rational design of novel biomaterials. Our ultimate goal is to create for the first time a truly unified understanding of how additives - ranging from molecular, to polymeric, to particulate, to compliant and ultimately stiff frameworks - can be incorporated within single crystals, and to determine how this strategy can be applied to the design of new materials with specific mechanical properties. This integrated approach will provide a general methodology for synthesizing composite crystals, contribute to our understanding of the biological systems from which the inspiration came, and will ultimately provide the basis for synthesizing next-generation materials such as artificial bone and tough synthetic dental enamel.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J018589/1","grantId":"EP/J018589/1","fundValue":"947914","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research has already shown that occlusion of small molecules within calcite crystals leads to composite crystals with mechanical properties that are superior to those achieved by occlusion of macromolecules.

As a major focus of the project, we are also performing the first systematic study of the structure and mechanical properties of these composite materials. \n\nKey outcomes to-date:\n\n(1) We have carried out extensive investigations into the incorporation of small molecules - and particularly amino acids - within calcite crystals. These have shown that extremely high amounts of aspartic acid and glycine can be occluded without a change in crystal morphology and that the composite crystals formed have mechanical properties at least as good as biominerals.\n\n(2) We have synthesised polymer-functionalised gold nanoparticles that are occluded at high quantities. This polymer is being used to \n\nWe will synthesise and characterize single crystals with composite structures with the aim of creating a unified model of how &quot;inclusion materials&quot; can be incorporated within single crystals, and determining how such additives affect the structures and mechanical properties of the crystals. This overarching goal will be achieved through the three principal objectives of the project: \n\nObjective 1: Synthesis of calcite single crystals incorporating &quot;inclusion materials&quot; ranging from small molecules to polymers, nano- to micro-scale particles, and stiff to compliant templates, and evaluate the growth mechanisms involved. This work will generate a comprehensive understanding of how the size and shape, chemistry, topology and mobility of additives can be used to control incorporation. (Meldrum, Estroff, Armes, de Yoreo) Objective 2: Characterization and modeling of the structural and mechanical properties of the composite single crystals to establish synthesis-structure-function relationships. (Baker, Estroff, Meldrum) Objective 3: Using the understanding gained to re-evaluate structures from biomineralization to gain insight into the mechanisms leading to their formation as well as their structure-function-property relationships.
