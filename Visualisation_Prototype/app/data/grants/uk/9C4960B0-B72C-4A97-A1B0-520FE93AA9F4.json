{"id":"9C4960B0-B72C-4A97-A1B0-520FE93AA9F4","title":"Tomographic Imaging","abstractText":"Computed Tomography (CT) is a powerful non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for producing 2-D cross-sections and 3-D images of an object from a series of 2D projections (shadowgraphs). Critical to the process is the computer algorithms that are able to reconstruct the 3D images from many (often over a thousand) shadowgraphs. There are two critical steps to obtaining useful information from tomography i) the reconstruction of a 3D image from 2D projections and ii) the analysis and quantification of features in the 3d object. While the techniques is rapidly growing in popularity, most users have fairly limited options when trying to recover the 3D image and are able to write only fairly primitive computer programs to extract key features from the images. The aim of this Collaborative Project is to establish a toolbox within which different reconstruction algorithms, artefact reduction codes, and image analysis procedures are made available to all.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J010456/1","grantId":"EP/J010456/1","fundValue":"469584","fundStart":"2012-02-29","fundEnd":"2015-09-11","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Philip  Withers","coPersons":["Manuchehr  Soleimani","Peter David Lee","Cathryn  Mitchell","William Robert Lionheart"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
