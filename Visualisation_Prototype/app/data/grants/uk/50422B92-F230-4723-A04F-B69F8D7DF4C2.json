Surface plasmon resonance is a technique that allows interactions between biological molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids to be assessed quantitatively and allows insights into how these interactions regulate biological processes. The BIACORE T100 instrument will be a powerful tool for this cutting edge research and will support not only the seven applicants but other groups in the Schools of Biological and Physical Sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01130X/1","grantId":"BB/F01130X/1","fundValue":"242368","fundStart":"2008-04-16","fundEnd":"2009-04-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas John Gay","coPersons":["Ben  Luisi","Richard William Farndale","Richard William Broadhurst","Matthew Kenneth Higgins","Kevin  Brindle","Ernest Douglas Laue","Peter Anthony  McNaughton"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
