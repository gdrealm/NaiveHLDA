This book on 'Crisis and revolution' offers a new interpretation that draws upon debates and insights from Sociology but rests firmly in the context of recent historical research both in the archives and on the important pamphlet publications of the time. It argues that crisis rather than being a precipitant of revolution had a vital transformative effect upon the issues, producing an unmanageable situation for the baroque state.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112903/1","grantId":"112903/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-06-05","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Campbell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
