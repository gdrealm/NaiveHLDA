Solar cells provide valuable renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity. Silicon currently dominates solar cell technology, although it is an intrinsically poor absorber of light. On the other hand thin-film solar cells utilise strongly absorbing materials so that the material volume is reduced to a thin layer a few micrometers in thickness, thereby lowering cost. Examples include CdTe and CIGS, the former being commercially produced with an annual output exceeding 1 Giga Watt.\n\nA common feature of thin-film solar cells is the high density of crystal defects known as 'grain boundaries'. A grain boundary demarcates the region where two crystals (i.e. grains) of different orientation impinge on one another. They typically reduce the overall solar cell efficiency and need to be passivated for optimum device operation. Indeed in CdTe solar cells a 'chlorine activation' step is used post-deposition where the device is annealed in a chlorine-rich environment leading to a ten-fold improvement in efficiency. It is thought that chlorine segregates to the grain boundaries thereby passivating them, although the precise mechanism is unknown.\n\nIn this project we will use state-of-the-art measurements of carrier lifetimes at individual grain boundaries to explore the fundamental mechanism(s) behind chlorine activation. The carrier lifetime is an important parameter specifying the electrical activity of a given grain boundary and its effect on device operation. In order to carry out such measurements a high spatial resolution (few nanometres) must be combined with excellent temporal resolution (a few picoseconds) the technical demands for which have only recently been overcome. We will carry out the very first measurements of grain boundary carrier lifetimes in CdTe thin-film solar cells using the new Attolight scanning electron microscope recently installed at EPFL, Switzerland. This is the only scientific instrument of its kind in the world capable of carrying out such analyses. We will also explore the relative effectiveness of different chlorine activation routes (i.e. standard activation using solid CdCl2 and gas activation methods) for passivating grain boundaries. This has important long term commercial benefits such as the production of efficient CdTe thin-film solar cells as well as reducing the environmental impact of the chlorine activation process.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K001620/1","grantId":"EP/K001620/1","fundValue":"25424","fundStart":"2012-11-09","fundEnd":"2014-01-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The PI delivers a bi-annual tutorial on electron microscopy characterisation of solar cells to PhD students in solar organised by the EPSRC SuperSolar Hub.

This is a difficult parameter to measure, and conventional techniques such as time resolved photoluminescence give a value that is averaged over a large volume of material. This makes it impossible to determine the effect of crystal defects (e.g. grain boundaries) on the local carrier lifetime. For example, grain boundaries are known to degrade the efficiency of a solar cell and their passivation through various treatments (e.g. doping) is essential for producing high efficiency devices. \n\nRecently a time resolved cathodoluminescence technique was developed in a scanning electron microscope which promised high spatial (~10 nm) and temporal (~10 ps) resolutions required for local carrier lifetime measurements. The technique relies on measuring the decay of radiation emitted by the material when stimulated with an electron beam. Successful results had been obtained for radiation in the visible wavelength range (e.g. LED materials such as GaN). For solar cells however the emitted wavelengths are in the near infra red part of the spectrum and the detection sensitivity of the experiment is insufficient for time resolved experiments. However, a new high brightness electron gun has since been developed by the instrument manufacturer and initial measurements have shown considerable promise. The new instrumentation has only recently become operational and will be tested on real solar cell devices in the near future.\n\nAlthough carrier lifetime measurement is still awaiting successful trial we have obtained a number of other important results using standard cathodoluminescence. This includes sulphur diffusion along grain boundaries in CdTe during chlorine activation, chlorine segregation to CdTe grain boundaries (through the donor-acceptor peak in the spectrum) and red shifting of the luminescence at grain boundaries in CZTS and its similarity to CIGS as well as the presence of a buried wurtzite phase with different band gap in CdTe nanowire solar cells. Repeat measurements of carrier lifetime will be carried out using the high brightness electron source in the near future. If the initial experimental difficulties are overcome then the technique would be useful in virtually any type of solar cell material and could be used by a large number research groups.
