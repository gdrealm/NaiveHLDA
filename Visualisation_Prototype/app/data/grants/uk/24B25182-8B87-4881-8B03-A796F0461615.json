N2O is perhaps most commonly known as the anaesthetic 'laughing gas'. However in global terms emissions of N2O is no laughing matter as it is a potent green house gas that can persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. The global emmissions of this gas are rising yearly and much of this is from biological sources. This is of great concern due to the involvement of this gas in global warming and the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Thus it is vital to understand the enzymatic processes that underlie N2O release, the regulation of these processes and the nature of the microorganisms responsible for the nitrous oxide release during bacterial ammonification. It will then be possible to propose appropriate management of the soil-plant system to mitigate emissions and to improve existing models. This is important as appropriate mitigation strategies for ammonification are likely to differ from another bacterial process called denitrification that can also lead to N2O emmission. Here we will encompass the whole picture of N2O emission in ammonifiers from the purified enzymes that produce the gas to complex communities that harbour these enzymes in soil. We will use enzyme analysis and stable isotope techniques to determine ammonification rates and N2O production during this process, and will use molecular techniques to investigate ammonifying populations in soil.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D012384/1","grantId":"BB/D012384/1","fundValue":"221869","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Elizabeth  Baggs","coPersons":["David  Richardson","Julea Nicole Butt"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":" The conditions under which ammonifying bacteria produce nitrous oxide were established. \nThe metabolic pathways that lead to nitrous oxide production were elucidated.\nNitrous oxide production was found to be common feature of ammonifying bacteria and laboratory strains were shown to serve as good models for environmental soil isolates Increasing awareness of this process' contribution to N2O emissions from soils, and the conditions under which it is prevalent.
