Liverworts occupy the\npivotal position in the land plant evolutionary tree with a wide variety of\nevidence supporting these non-vascular plants as the most basal terrestrial\nphotosynthetic organisms and amongst the earliest colonizers of the land ca.\n475 Ma. Recent molecular genetic evidence supports the view that\nmycorrhiza-like associations in liverworts are a basal and ancestral trait,\nand land plants evolved from a single common ancestor that formed symbiotic\nassociations with fungal partners before roots evolved. \nFor at least the past 30 years, the prevailing paradigm has been that AM\nfungi are the ancestral form of all plant-fungal symbioses co-evolving with\nthe earliest land plants. AM associations are the most common type of\nmycorrhiza, and are currently found in over 70% of land plant species\nincluding simple and complex thalloid liverworts. However, new evidence\nreported by members of the project team (MB, JGD, SP) has revealed that the\nmost basal extant groups of liverworts, the Haplomitriopsida, exclusively\nform associations with the most basal group of plant-symbiotic fungi - the\nEndogonales. For the first time, we now have evidence pointing to the\nidentity of the fungal group at the dawn of their nutritional symbiosis with\nland plants. This opens a remarkable new window for functional\ninvestigations into how the symbiosis facilitated the emergence of the\nterrestrial biosphere.\n Our proposal exploits these findings by addressing three fundamental\nevolutionary questions relating to the initial phase of plants 'greening of\nthe Earth':\n(1) Are the associations between liverworts and species of Endogone\nfunctionally equivalent to those formed with AM fungal partners? \n(2) Was the switching of fungal partners from facultatively saprotrophic\nEndogone to obligately biotrophic AM fungi through the evolutionary advance\nof basal liverworts driven by increasing mutualistic benefits to the plants\nand fungi?\n(3) Did the accumulation of soil organic matter favour obligately biotrophic\nAM fungi over facultatively saprotrophic Endogone in supplying mineral\nnutrients to the plants?\nWe have carefully selected 7 liverwort species with fungal associations that\nprovide a powerful spectrum of model systems amenable to experimentation and\nquantitative functional analyses of C exchange, nutrient relationships and\nfungal specificity. All of our target organisms can all be cultured either\nfrom spores or gemmae to provide plants with and without fungal symbionts.\nThis provides a robust approach for enabling quantification of fungal\ncolonization on gametophyte growth, nutrition and reproductive output within\na 3 yr project.\nOur experimental programme will be conducted on (1) mature field-collected\npopulations (and (2) symbiotic vs. asymbiotic plants grown from\ngemmae/spores. Field collected populations will be used for functional\nstudies of C-allocation from liverworts to their fungal partners and\nreciprocal uptake of nutrients into the plants via the fungi. Populations\nfrom gemmae/spores will be used for investigating the net costs/benefits of\nthe fungal symbionts on the growth and reproductive output of the liverworts\nand the biomass and extent of the fungal partners. Molecular identification\nand ultra-structural studies will be undertaken on both sets of plants to\nestablish the identity of the fungal endosymbionts, the nature of the\nplant-fungal interfaces, and how these relate to function and host\nspecificity.\nOverall, this project will contribute fundamental knowledge and\nunderstanding to the dawn of an ancient symbiosis between land plants and\nfungi that played a founding role in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems\n- a topic closely aligned to NERC's Earth System Science Theme high-level\nchallenge &quot;improving current knowledge of the interaction b","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/I027193/1","grantId":"NE/I027193/1","fundValue":"131956","fundStart":"2012-02-06","fundEnd":"2015-02-05","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  We have discovered a new plant-fungal symbiosis, demonstrated it is widespread globally and that is ismutualistic, and we have inferred that it was responsible for allowing plants to conquer terrestrial ecosystems.
