We have invented a simple, one-step method to an important subclass of these compounds, namely 5,5-disubstituted hydantoins. Chemical libraries of this type are rather inaccessible and appear underrepresented in commercial compound collections. Hence, there is scope to produce and market them to these industries. To develop this business opportunity, we must first establish if highthroughput techniques can be applied so that many saleable compounds can be made quickly and cheaply. Herein, we will explore both parallel synthesis methods and microwave acceleration. This project will also investigate the conversion of hydantoins into other important building blocks such as a,a-disubstituted a-amino acids. We aim to establish a company to exploit this technology and the work funded herein will produce the vital results needed to secure seedcorn funding and establish a sustainable business.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E501184/1","grantId":"EP/E501184/1","fundValue":"64021","fundStart":"2006-09-27","fundEnd":"2007-07-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  Shipman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
