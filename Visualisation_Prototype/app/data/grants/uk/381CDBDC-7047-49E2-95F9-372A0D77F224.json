Bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) is the model of the group and the consequences of disease (interference with suckling, milking and breading), has a significant economic impact worldwide. The highly related human viruses (HPV) cause cancer and therefore also have a negative impact on quality of life. The mechanisms of viral replication are consequently of significant interest as the viral replication proteins are important therapeutic targets. The survival and continuity of an organism, be it a virus or man, requires duplication of its genetic material- its DNA- and this is performed by specialized proteins. The first important step in this process is the recognition of specific 'origins of DNA replication' by proteins that separate, or &quot;melt&quot;, the two otherwise paired strands of the DNA ('the DNA double helix'). In higher organisms like man, the timing and physical precision of this 'initiation' event is crucial to avoid the catastrophic consequences that may result from any loss of genetic material (for example, cancer). After the initial melting of the DNA at localized site, complete separation of the two helical DNA strands is performed by 'helicase' proteins. DNA strand separation by initiator and helicase proteins is generally poorly understood in simple organisms like viruses as well as higher species like man. However, the process appears to be highly conserved, suggesting that mechanism may be generally similar in all systems. We propose here to explore and characterize these replication processes in BPV-1. The advantage is that all the viral DNA replication activities are performed by a single protein called E1, thus simplifying the study. We will use powerful microscopes to take snapshots of different steps of the process and biochemical techniques that will help to define mechanisms. These studies will therefore contribute significantly to the understanding of the papillomavirus replication protein that is an important therapeutic target. Modeling these replication events in this simplified viral system will also help us understand the process in man. These studies will therefore assist in disease management and improving human and animal health.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006920/1","grantId":"BB/J006920/1","fundValue":"315279","fundStart":"2013-01-04","fundEnd":"2016-10-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The findings have been used for chemical to produce samples for electron microscopy, to fund two postdocs who are involved into experimental studies, to attend GRC conference and the Student retreat.

Hexameric replicative helicases form rings around DNA and this topology is likely to favour stable DNA substrate binding, permitting long stretches of DNA to be unwound. The observation that the DNA replication fork strands in the E1 hexamer are entering and leaving via well-defined openings that are fixed for the duration of translocation has significant consequences for understanding the mechanism of DNA unwinding. To date we have engaged the beneficiaries through presentations at national and international meetings and publication of research outcomes in refereed international journals. Sharing of the data is driven by the perceived scientific benefit and is conducted in a timely and responsible way . In dictating the time course for the release of data we will be sensitive to the need to protect intellectual property and patentable data, but this will not over delay release of data. We will consolidate existing links (collaboration with X-ray crystallographers at university of York, Dr. A Antson) and are currently building new links with groups with related expertise in molecular imaging (small angle x-ray scattering, single molecule biophysics).
