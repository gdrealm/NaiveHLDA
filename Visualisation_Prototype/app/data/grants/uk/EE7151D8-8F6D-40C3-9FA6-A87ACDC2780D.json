That is, people can use knowledge without being aware of that knowledge. We investigate this phenomenon in an artificial grammar learning (AGL) task.</p>\n\n<p>The first sequence of six experiments sets out to determine whether unconscious learning requires consciously perceived stimuli by presenting both training and test stimuli subliminally. </p>\n\n<p>Five further experiments explore the basis of the transition between conscious and unconscious knowledge that is observed in AGL. The higher order thought (HOT) theory of consciousness, holds that a state is conscious only when we are aware of being in that state; that is, there is a higher order representation of being in that state. </p>\n\n<p>Experiments first assess if the emergence of conscious knowledge can be delayed artificially by changing the feedback people receive to block awareness of having knowledge. An imaging study then examines if differential brain activity for responses made with and without conscious awareness is consistent with regions previously associated with higher order representations. Finally, transcranial magnetic stimulation is used to temporary inhibit those regions, permitting an evaluation of whether their activity is a necessary prerequisite for conscious knowledge. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1975","grantId":"RES-062-23-1975","fundValue":"278177","fundStart":"2009-06-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Zoltan  Dienes","coPersons":["Jamie  Ward"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
