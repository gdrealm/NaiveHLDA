The Centre had built up an extensive archive of valuable archive of tissues from patients and unique animal models that were kept in the core histology facility with information on their provenance held in a variety of databases. The project involved design and implementation of a new database that was based on industry-standard software providing a robust and scalable repository for the information previously held in different source databases. A pilot project was run to ensure search terms were fit for purpose. In the final phase all datasets were imported and human tissues coded and linked to ethical approvals ensuring full compliance with best practice and the human tissue act even though this is not legally binding in Scotland. The primary project was scaled up to include datasets for antibodies, viral vectors and other resources promoting shared resources and reduction in expenditure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/K500951/1","grantId":"MR/K500951/1","fundValue":"21280","fundStart":"2012-08-20","fundEnd":"2012-11-19","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Carlson","coPersons":["Peter  Wilcock"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
