In parallel with this growing understanding about anaesthetic action, rapid progress has also been made towards understanding the neuronal mechanisms responsible for natural sleep. It now appears that there is a direct connection between sleep and anaesthetics because of mounting evidence that anaesthetics cause their sedative effects by recruiting natural sleep pathways. The central aim of this project is to investigate the link between the sedative actions of general anaesthetics and some of the neuronal pathways underlying natural sleep. Different anaesthetics appear to act on these pathways in different ways, and it is possible that some will provide a state that more closely resembles natural physiological sleep than others. Understanding the molecular actions and neuronal pathways involved presents a major intellectual challenge for basic neuroscience, and research into anaesthetic mechanisms and sleep pathways and how they are related can be expected to provide fundamental information which has broader applicability. It is widely recognised that the anaesthetic drugs presently used in clinical practice are far from satisfactory. Currently used anaesthetics are relatively non-specific, mostly act at high concentrations and affect a variety of different targets. As a consequence, a large number of patients suffer from undesirable side-effects that may be attributed to the anaesthetic and analgesic drugs used for their perioperative care. Serious morbidity can be provoked in already compromised patients, which is an issue of increasing concern in an ageing population. If certain specific neuronal pathways can be selectively targeted, then it may be possible to provide anaesthesia that not only has fewer unwanted side effects, but that is actually restful, and hence beneficial for the patient, particularly in the intensive care setting. Sleep deprivation, which may occur with certain anaesthetic regimens, is known to be harmful, and can, for example, compromise the immune system. In addition, our work should provide fundamental insights into natural sleep pathways, information that is likely to aid in the treatment of a growing number of sleep disorders, which are increasingly prevalent in our society.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501584","grantId":"G0501584","fundValue":"450351","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nicholas  Franks","coPersons":["Mervyn  Maze","Stephen George Brickley","William  Wisden"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
