Human Embryonic stem cells (hESc) have great potential for use in clinical therapies but current hESc lines have not been generated under conditions suitable for clinical use. We will exploit our successful TSB-funded feasibility study to generate suitable immortalised human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) for derivation of cGMP hESc lines. We will immortalise 2 primary (clinical grade) hDF lines, already shown to support culture and derivation of cGMP hESc lines in a unique media system, using a method shown by us to generate hESc-supportive feeder cells at the research level. The immortalised cells will be tested for derivation of new cGMP hESc lines and will provide a supply of marketable cGMP feeder cells for use in generating hESc for therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J021636/1","grantId":"BB/J021636/1","fundValue":"142037","fundStart":"2012-04-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan Jane Kimber","coPersons":["Daniel R Brison"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
