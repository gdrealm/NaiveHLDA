India's economic growth has been matched by rapid urban development in recent years; the urban landscape is being significantly re-modelled in line with the principles of New Urbanism - the creation of 'walkable,' diverse, inclusive, sustainable spaces where people will want to live both now and in the future. New large scale developments such as the case study community, Lavasa, are emerging to meet the demand for housing in the Indian context (c.300,000 residents). Future plans include the replication of Lavasa, providing homes to hundreds of thousands of families and individuals across the country, a move to attract individuals away from the clogged metropolitan cities of Delhi and Mumbai, to new urban environments. \n\nThis research is a unique opportunity to gather empirical evidence of the day-to-day experiences, issues and needs of residents (children, young people and adults) living and moving through this new urban environment. The research is of international significance; current research into the lives of families in large scale, inclusive, sustainable communities is lacking, particularly in the context of an emerging superpower. The research predominantly uses qualitative research methods; however, an innovative mobile 'app' will be developed to further explore and map family mobility within the community. There are three interlinked strands to the research:\n\nInternationalising New Urbanism: \nPrimarily, this strand aims to create a dialogue of exchange between those engaged in sustainable urbanism in the UK context (primarily those involved in the creation of 'sustainable communities', albeit on a smaller scale) and those creating new communities in India. What lessons can be learnt from applying the principles of New Urbanism (essentially American and European informed), are there specific design features and points of best practice which can be transferred between these communities and contexts? \n\nSustainable design and mobility - everyday routines, transport and access: \nThis strand will explore family mobility in the context of this new urban environment; a landscape which has been designed in line with principles of sustainability and effective transport use. How are residents moving through and interacting with their environment during their everyday routines? Given that its design has been planned so that 'all components of essential city life are located within walking distance,' is car use minimised within this context? Given the plethora of services and amenities Lavasa provides, how are these connected and used in the rhythm of everyday life? Efficient connectivity is a key principle of the urban infrastructure in Lavasa. This strand aims to explore the successes and limitations of Lavasa's connectivity.\n\nNature and green space in a planned city: \nFollowing on from the previous objective, this strand aims to explore the impact of green and public space on the lives of children, young people and their families living in the community. Nature and green space are important and educational; they are interactive elements of the planned city. How are these spaces being used in the everyday life of residents? Are children and young people free to explore the nature and open space which has been planned into their neighbourhood?","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K00932X/2","grantId":"ES/K00932X/2","fundValue":"222330","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2016-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sophie  Hadfield-Hill","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
