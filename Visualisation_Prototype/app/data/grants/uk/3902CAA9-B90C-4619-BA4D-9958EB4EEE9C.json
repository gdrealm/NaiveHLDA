These addresses how in spite of the theoretical analysis of the difference between vision and the lens based outputs, there is still slippage in their replacement/substitution for vision. The work questions the problems of the understanding of lens based mediums and the influence of perception over their analysis. Previous artwork has involved the process of the artist becoming a camera: the new work involves the artist becoming a projector, in actions that redefine the parameters of the theoretical discourse being explored.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112995/1","grantId":"112995/1","fundValue":"7006","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2006-07-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lindsay  Seers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
