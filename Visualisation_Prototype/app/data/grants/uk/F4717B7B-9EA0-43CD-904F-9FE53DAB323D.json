In exchange for their eggs, women will receive cheaper IVF treatment.\nStem cell research promises much for the treatment of diseases. Such treatments will be improved if the problem of a patient rejecting stem cells from an unrelated donor can be solved. A technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT: also known as ‘therapeutic cloning’) will help to overcome this difficulty. \nMore research is required to improve SCNT techniques but there is a shortage of human eggs. Therefore this ‘egg sharing’ scheme has been proposed. This scheme has been approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. \nHowever, concerns have been raised, including: objections to embryo experimentation; fears that therapeutic cloning will lead to reproductive cloning; views that reduced IVF fees constitute an inappropriate inducement to egg sharers; questions whether egg sharers understand the research to which they are contributing. Therefore it is vital that SCNT research is accompanied by evaluations of its potential benefits and costs. \nThis study will provide such an evaluation and supply vital evidence to inform the deliberations and practices of policymakers, stem cell scientists, fertility clinicians, and the wider community, worldwide.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701109","grantId":"G0701109","fundValue":"296300","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Erica  Haimes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
