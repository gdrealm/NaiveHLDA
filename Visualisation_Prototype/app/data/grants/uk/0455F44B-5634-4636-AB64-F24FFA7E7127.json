Each gene in a genome is used to direct the synthesis of a specific protein. It is the proteins that are the functional agents in a cell, for example acting as catalysts to speed individual chemical reactions within the cell. Information in the gene, coded as different sequences of the bases A, T, C and G, is used to make a protein in a two-stage process. First, the gene information is copied into a similar chain of bases in the form of a messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA, a long chain-like molecule, is then used as an information store to direct the assembly of a protein, consisting of a chain of amino acids, in a process called translation. The precise sequence of amino acids (directed by the mRNA base sequence) determines the eventual function of the protein. The amino acid sequence is defined by the mRNA sequence, which in turn is defined by the gene sequence, thus linking gene to protein. The process of translation forms the focus of this research proposal. During translation, small particles called ribosomes (themselves made of RNA and protein) travel along the mRNA, sequentially adding amino acids to make the final protein. This production line process is stopped (terminated) in response to a specific sequence of bases in the mRNA, causing the release of the completed protein. Termination is crucial for ensuring the protein made is of the correct length. It is now known that following termination, ribosomes are directed back to the beginning of the mRNA, effectively recycling them on the mRNA chain. This makes the translation process more efficient, but generates very complex ribosome traffic flow on the mRNA production line. For this reason, mathematical modelling of ribosome flow will be used in this research alongside the biochemical experimentation to help unravel the mechanisms by which translation is controlled. This proposal seeks to study translation termination for two important reasons. First, in many human genetic diseases, the affected gene (e.g cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) is mutated because it contains an additional stop codon early in the gene sequence. This has the effect of prematurely terminating translation, resulting in a shortened, non-functional protein. There is increasing interest in developing drugs that would make translation termination less accurate. This would allow the ribosome to bypass the early stop codon and reach the natural stop codon to make correct length protein. Research into the molecular mechanisms of termination, as this proposal describes, can provide crucial insight used directly in the development of drugs to treat some forms of human genetic disease. Termination is also important because associated with this process is the recycling of the ribosomes on the mRNA. After termination at the end of the message, ribosomes are actively returned to the beginning of the mRNA to make a new protein from the same template, forming a type of circular ribosomal race track; each circuit of the track results in a new protein being made. The recycling process is very poorly understood, and yet it is key to protein synthetic efficiency. By understanding how recycling works, it may be possible to boost the efficiency of protein synthesis in cells, which is crucial for the manufacture of drugs like hepatitis B vaccine and insulin, to name but two. In summary then, the process of translation termination is crucially important in the expression of genes in every cell, and thus has fundamental 'pure' research interest. It is however also a key to understand how proteins can be made efficiently in biotechnological processes important in drug manufacture, and is also an attractive target for drugs that can treat a range of extremely debilitating human genetic diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I020926/1","grantId":"BB/I020926/1","fundValue":"298845","fundStart":"2012-03-15","fundEnd":"2015-03-14","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The research on this project, dealing with the optimisation of protein synthesis. has led directly to the development of a research interaction with an SME biotechnology company, Ingenza Ltd., which then led directly to the successful application for a Technology Strategy Board grant with that company.

The integrated model is now being used to predict the effect of alternative stop codon positions within the mRNA to replicate the effect of premature termination.\n\n\n\n At this interim stage in the research, we have begun to establish the decay rates for a series of yeast PGK1 mRNAs that have either normally positioned stop codons, or premature stop codons engineered at various codon positions.\n\n\n\nWe have developed a system of regulating tRNA expression using regulated tetR expression to control tRNA gene transcription. Doxycycline can thus be used to titrate tRNA expression. Using this system, we have varied expression of a suppressor tRNA to give between 0 and 3% readthrough on mRNAs with early stop codons to examine the effect on mRNA stability.\n\n\n\nWe are now integrating model predictions and experiment. The TASEP model with recycling has been used analytically to show that there are counterintuitive relations between initiation rate, and translation rate. This prediction can be tested experimentally, by varying the translation initiation rate, to either switch recycling on or off. Optimisation of translation is of considerable interest to biotechnology. We are applying the knowledge gained during this proposal to understand how best to optimise gene expression and translation through interactions with a biotechnology company, now the subject of a successful TSB proposal.
