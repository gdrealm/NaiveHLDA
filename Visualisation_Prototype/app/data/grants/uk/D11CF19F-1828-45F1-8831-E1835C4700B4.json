This will be undertaken by Drs\nWynne and Jackson in collaboration an Advanced Metallis Systems Centre for Doctoral Training PhD Student, who will be\nfinancially supported by Sheffield Forgemasters International Limited. Thus the aim of the project in its broadest sense is:\nDevelopment of a novel test methodology for the rapid assessment of the suitability of materials and heat treatment\nprocesses for large scale, structure critical forged components. This will be achieved by the following four work packages.\nWork Package 1: Validate large scale heat treatment machine within the capability of the industrial plant.\nThis includes optimisation of temperature uniformity, temperature control and identifying heating and cooling rate\nconstraints inclusive of how sample size may influence this sensitivity. Furthermore material type sensitivity will be\ninvestigated from low carbon steels through to medium NiCrMo steels. (Wynne, Jackson, PhD student, Sheffield\nForgemasters)\nWork Package 2: Validate linkage between simulation and actual component. (PhD Student, Sheffield Forgemasters)\nThis work package will compare and contrast simulated results, both mechanical and microstructure, with an actual\ncomponent. Extreme areas of the as-forged component will be investigated to ensure good variability coverage.\nMicrostructure at levels above optical, i.e. precipitation density, will be taken thus requiring advanced characterisation\nmethods such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy.\nWork Package 3: Property prediction models (PhD Student)\nThis work package will focus on developing property prediction models inclusive of the process windows of the plant by\ncombining thermodynamic modelling and transformation modelling with the data obtained from the machine.\nWork Package 4: Alternative materials and process routes (Wynne, Jackson, PhD Student, Sheffield Forgemasters)\nThis work package focuses on suggesting alternative material and processing strategies leading to enhanced forging\nproperties at reduced cost and energy used.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L50466X/1","grantId":"EP/L50466X/1","fundValue":"171384","fundStart":"2013-05-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This TSB project has built a world unique heat treatment simulator for the simulation of local areas of a large scale forging.
