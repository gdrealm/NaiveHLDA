One of the most important questions in the field is to understand how these neurons establish connections with each other to form functional circuits in different areas in the brain with distinct functions. Sensory organs send information they receive from the environment to the specialised visual, auditory and somatosensory cortical regions in the brain through a relay centre called the thalamus. How are the connections linking these regions formed? To understand this mechanism we must study early stages of development and look for the factors and elements that control their correct formation. Recent studies on genetically modified mice have identified families of molecules that are involved in early stages of thalamic development. Using these mice major recent advances have been made, implicating genes in the direct control of area identities in early stages development. We will use advanced techniques to test other candidate molecules and examine the influence of thalamic input on the development of the cortical cells. Moreover, we shall further investigate the mechanisms by which specific thalamic nerve fibres connect to a particular cortical area. It has been suggested that in addition to these factors, how neurons communicate with each other is also crucial for a correct formation and maintenance of connections. Several mutant mice lacking specific proteins involved in neural communication are also available. We are planning to study these mutant mice in order to elucidate the precise role of neuronal communication in generating a correctly assembled mature brain. This research is important to establish how environmental factors interact with genetic information to produce a correctly wired brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300200","grantId":"G0300200","fundValue":"682418","fundStart":"2004-02-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Zoltan  Molnar","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
