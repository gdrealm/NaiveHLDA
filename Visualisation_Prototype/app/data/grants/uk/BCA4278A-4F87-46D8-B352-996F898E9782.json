{"id":"BCA4278A-4F87-46D8-B352-996F898E9782","title":"Sanctifying Matter: Some Medieval Theories of the Eucharist","abstractText":"Worldwide religions feature material cultic rites to mediate human traffic with supernatural spiritual power(s). I examine some thirteenth and fourteenth century explanations of how this can be so. Roughly speaking, my authors see sacraments as a Divine accomodation to hybrid (body/soul) human nature, and sacramental participation as infusing human beings with spiritual qualities that make their souls more Godlike. Regular participation intensifies these qualities, and--since 'like is known by like'--prepares participants for their post-mortem destiny of seeing God. The eucharist is 'queen of the sacraments' because the real presence of Christ's Body and Blood under forms of bread and wine is an interim anticipation of that ultimate union with God for which human beings were made.\\n\\nMy book will be written in such a way as to give readers easy access to the parts that interest them. Philosophers and historians of philosophy may want to focus on the analyses of causality offered to explain how a material rite could contribute to the production of spiritual qualities (ch.2), and on the metaphysics and physics of bodies and their placement mounted to explain how Christ's Body and Blood could be really present where the forms of bread and wine still appear to be (chs.4-9). Because the medieval analyses both use and transform the technical conceptuality of Aristotelian philosophy, I will provide an introduction (ch.3) that specialists can skip, readers at the intermediate level can consult, and undergraduates can devour with profit. Chapter 10 will lay out the systematic changes in physics and metaphysics provoked by my authors' consideration of the data of sacramental theology and draw methodological morals. Historical and systematic theologians will also want to read the first and the last two chapters, which set the discussions of causality and real presence in the context of sacramental theology and of anthropology. If material rites are apt for conveying spiritual benefits on essentially embodied persons, will and/or how will human bodies participate in our ultimate destinies beyond the grave? I thus intend the book to service many audiences at once: philosophers and theologians; specialists, medievalists in other fields, and undergraduate and post-graduate students.\\n\\nMy cast of thirteenth and fourteenth century authors--principally, Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Scotus, and Ockham; secondarily, Bonaventure, Henry of Ghent, and Godfrey of Fontaines--was chosen because they bring highly developed philosophical conceptuality to bear in their extensive analyses of the sacraments. All of the relevant works are in printed editions, which I own. My method here--as in my two-volume study William Ockham ('87) and ca 45 medieval articles--focuses on analytical interpretation of the philosophical and theological ideas in these works. Other recent work in this genre includes John Wippel's invaluable The Metaphysical Thought of Thomas Aquinas: From Finite to Uncreated Being (2000), Mark Henninger's Relations: Medieval Theories 1250-1325 (1989), and Richard Cross's four books--The Physics of Duns Scotus (2000), Great Medieval Thinkers: Duns Scotus (1999), The Metaphysics of the Incarnation (2002), and Duns Scotus on God (2005). Allan B. Wolter's and Stephen Dumont's many articles on Scotus and Calvin Normore's writings on fourteenth century logic and metaphysics are also invaluable.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F013663/1","grantId":"AH/F013663/1","fundValue":"30371","fundStart":"2009-01-13","fundEnd":"2009-04-12","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Marilyn McCord Adams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
