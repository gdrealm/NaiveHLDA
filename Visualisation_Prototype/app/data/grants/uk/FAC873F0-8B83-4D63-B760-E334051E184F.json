The research will answer questions such as: Do the assumptions about the nature of measurement error typically made by analysts hold? Does measurement error lead to misleading conclusions, for example, about the average duration of benefit receipt or about characteristics predicting the duration of receipt? Does dependent interviewing, where survey responses from previous interviews are used in the questionnaire scripting, reduce measurement error? Does it alter the nature of errors? Which statistical methods can be used to adjust for measurement error? </p>\n\n<p>To address these objectives, the project uses survey data on benefit receipt from four interviews (1999 to 2003), matched to administrative records from the Department for Work and Pensions. Errors will be identified by matching the survey reports for each sample member to their administrative records, where differences in the survey data will be defined as error. Testing the effect of errors on estimates will involve replicating existing analyses with both the survey and the administrative data. The impact of errors will be visible as a difference between the survey and record based estimates.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000111/1","grantId":"ES/F000111/1","fundValue":"78262","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Annette Elisabeth Jackle","coPersons":["Peter  Lynn","Stephen  Jenkins"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
