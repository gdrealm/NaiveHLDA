Through a detailed study of the &quot;cuisine of sacrifice&quot;, ritual procedure, and classifications of ritual gestures and paraphernalia {clothing, music, implements}, it argues that sacrificial religion provided a body of practices and ideas upon which early Chinese masters of philosophy drew to develop theories about human sensory perception. By focusing on religious practice rather theory about ritual in the received canon, this study seeks to bridge a hitherto perceived gap between religion and philosophy in early China. By refraining from interpreting Warring States and early imperial texts through the filter of intellectual history --or more accurately the history of philosophy-it suggests a thoroughly new approach to the history of ideas in early China.\n\n\nPeriodization:\n\n\nIn Chinese and Western historiography, &quot;early China&quot; is understood to cover the period stretching from the late Bronze Age or Shang period (ca. 1700- 1050 BC) to the early imperial period (Qin and Han dynasties, 200 BC-200 AD). A core moment for the history of ideas within this time-span is the States and early imperial period {fourth century BC to second century AD), a time which roughly coincides with the Classical Age of Plato,\nand Alexander the Great in ancient Greece, and which ends at the time of the Late Republic and dawn of the Augustan period in Rome. This is the period during which China evolved from a confederacy of feudal states into a unified empire (221 BC), this period, also known as pre-Buddhist\nChina was pivotal to the socio-political and intellectual development of China in many ways: we witness the emergence of bureaucracy, philosophy, the birth of popular and anecdotal literature, and the development of historiography and administrative record keeping. Our understanding of this formative period in Chinese history has been revolutionsed by the excavation of an increasingly accreting corpus of bamboo and silk manuscripts over the last three decades. These new materials prompt a through re-examination of the received texts and the scholarly conclusions based upon them (cf. the attached &quot;Case for Support&quot;).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E502342/1","grantId":"AH/E502342/1","fundValue":"18882","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Roel  Sterckx","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
