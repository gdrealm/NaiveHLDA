She will make an initial investigation of the Migrants Association, its activities in Athens, its fund-raising activities for projects on the island, and its relationship with the recently formed organisation for preserving island traditional customs founded by returnee migrants on the island.</p> \n<p>Interviews, archive research, and participant-observation are the main methods for acquiring this information, and data from previous research provides the basis for comparison. Differences in adherence to ‘traditional’ practices between the island and migrant communities are anticipated to be less than they were in the 1960s and 1980s, the decades when two major studies of the island and migrants were undertaken.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1641","grantId":"RES-000-22-1641","fundValue":"2852","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2006-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Margaret Elizabeth Kenna","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
