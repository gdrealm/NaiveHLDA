The funding will be used to support the operating costs of the high energy physics group as they participate in the running of the ATLAS and LHCb experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and in the R&amp;D to upgrade those experiments for the future programme. The work is exploring the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions and aims to build on the success in finding the Higgs boson by exploring further the physics of the TeV energy range.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M001431/1","grantId":"ST/M001431/1","fundValue":"12736","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  Small supplementary grant.
