It is used every day in hospitals around the world, and is particularly good at highlighting diseased tissue (e.g. cancer). It works by placing the patient into a very strong magnetic field. This causes the magnetic hydrogen atoms in water molecules to line up along the magnetic field. When a burst of weak radiowaves is applied, some of the energy is absorbed and this causes the hydrogen atoms to flip round in the magnetic field. After a time delay (called the &quot;T1 relaxation time&quot;) the atoms revert to their original orientations and re-emit the radiowaves in the form of a &quot;signal&quot;, which is picked up by the scanner. The process is repeated hundreds of times over the course of a few minutes, and the signals are then analysed by computer to produce an image (picture) of where the signals came from in the body. The delay time (T1) between receiving and re-emitting radiowaves is very sensitive to the type of tissue (e.g. the T1 of kidney is different to the T1 of leg muscle) and also changes if the tissue is diseased (brain tumour has a longer T1 than normal brain). Therefore, the T1 relaxation time is used to introduce &quot;contrast&quot; into MR images, which radiologists use to diagnose disease.\nThrough experiments done outside the body on small tissue samples, biomedical scientists have discovered that the T1 relaxation time also depends strongly on the strength of the magnetic field used (thus, the T1 of liver is longer when measured in a 1.5 Tesla magnet than it is at 1.0 Tesla). Furthermore, the way in which T1 changes with magnetic field is different in different tissues, and can also change in disease. The manner in which T1 changes as a function of magnetic field is called &quot;T1 dispersion&quot; and a graph of T1 versus magnetic field strength is called a T1 dispersion curve.\nT1 dispersion could be of great use in diagnosing disease, but hospital MRI scanners cannot measure T1 dispersion, because each scanner operates at a single magnetic field strength (e.g. 1.5 Tesla or 3.0 Tesla) and cannot be changed. In a previous research project at the University of Aberdeen, we have shown that it is possible to design and build special MRI scanners in which the magnetic field applied to the patient can be changed very rapidly, while the scan is in progress. This method is called &quot;Fast Field-Cycling MRI&quot; (FFC-MRI). We have produced methods of measuring T1 dispersion curves, linked to MR images, and our research has also shown the potential for improving diagnosis, in diseases as diverse as osteoarthritis and deep-vein thrombosis. The potential also exists to use FFC-MRI to detect diseases which involve protein malformation and malfunction, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and many more.\nAt the moment, only two human-sized FFC-MRI scanners exist, both of them in our research laboratories. Hospitals cannot buy FFC-MRI scanners, because the companies that sell scanners do not yet build them for sale. However, there is a potential way in which some types of hospital MRI scanner (called &quot;open&quot; scanners) could be retro-fitted with additional hardware and software to allow them to perform FFC-MRI scans, and therefore enhance diagnosis of their patients. The upgrade &quot;kit&quot; includes additional magnet hardware that can be moved in or out, depending on whether FFC-MRI or standard MRI is being used, together with control and analysis software.\nThe purpose of this project is to create preliminary designs for add-on hardware and software for FFC-MRI, and to develop the technology so that it can be demonstrated to companies which manufacture MRI scanners. The hope is that the technology would then be manufactured by the medical imaging industry and would then be purchased by hospitals and research institutes, making FFC-MRI much more widely available.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01379X/1","grantId":"EP/J01379X/1","fundValue":"199618","fundStart":"2012-01-04","fundEnd":"2013-01-03","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Potential Impact\n\nWho will benefit from this research? \n\n* Large medical imaging companies which manufacture and supply MRI systems. \n\n* Smaller companies (SMEs) supplying components to medical imaging companies. \n\n* Hospital radiology departments. \n\n* Patients with a range of medical conditions. \n\n* Universities and research institutes conducting research into MRI. \n\n* The food and drink industry. \n\n* Veterinary medicine. \n\n* Research staff working on the project. \n\n\n\nHow will the beneficiaries benefit from this research?

Proof-of-principle of this concept was demonstrated using a prototype offset coil capable of 60 mT offset over a 5cm diameter spherical volume, in conjunction with a 60 mT, vertical-field MRI scanner. Design criteria for field-offset coils that could be used with other types of MRI scanner were explored. The research could be used to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of hospital MRI scanners. It could be used in the food industry to enable NMR relaxometry-based quality-control measurements. Manufacturers of MRI equipment could exploit this research to design and build offset magnetic field-offset coils for a range of existing and future MRI scanners. The research could potentially lead to the increased use of field-cycling NMR relaxometry and field-cycling MRI in clinical diagnosis. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
