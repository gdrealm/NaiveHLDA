The project aims to make a major contribution to the debate as to how architectural practice needs to evolve in order to meet the changing economic, social and environmental contexts in which contemporary architectural practice is situated. The pressing need for consideration of alternative models of practice has been identified by many others, but few proposals have been made. This project aims to address that need by identifying clear models of alternative practice that others can draw on.\\n\\nWHAT? Alternative architectural praxis is initially defined as a praxis that focuses critically on the processes of architectural production rather than the product. An alternative praxis generally pushes at the boundaries of social, professional, organisational and ideological engagement and is thus often conceived by the general public and / or the architectural profession as 'on the edge' of so-called mainstream architectural practices. Alternative models of architectural practice have been largely overlooked; this project aims to bring them to the surface.\\n\\nHOW? The project will first examine the concept of an alternative form of praxis by means of a thorough analysis of historic examples of alternative architectural praxis. From this a more precise definition of alternative architectural praxis will be developed. The project will then bring this definition to a discussion and evaluation of contemporary examples of alternative praxis. The proposed outcomes of the research include a book and a conference.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D001447/1","grantId":"AH/D001447/1","fundValue":"189452","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2010-04-13","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy  TillTatjana Claudia Schneider","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
