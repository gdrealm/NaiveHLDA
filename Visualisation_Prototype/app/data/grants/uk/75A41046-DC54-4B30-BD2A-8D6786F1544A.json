{"id":"75A41046-DC54-4B30-BD2A-8D6786F1544A","title":"EPSRC/VCE Strategic Partnership: Green Radio","abstractText":"There is a need on environmental grounds to reduce the energy requirements of radio access networks. From an operator perspective, reduced energy consumption translates directly to the bottom line - lower Operating Expenditure (OPEX). These are the key drivers of the Green Radio programme. Both wide area public networks (traditionally cellular ) and local area private networks (traditionally wireless LAN ) will be considered, recognizing that the structure of a Green Radio Network may differ from today's radio networks. Thus in essence, the specific objective of the Green Radio programme is to investigate and create innovative methods for the reduction of the total power needed to operate a radio access network and to identify appropriate radio architectures which enable such power reduction.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G062420/1","grantId":"EP/G062420/1","fundValue":"368699","fundStart":"2009-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Hamid  Aghvami","coPersons":["Mohammad Reza Nakhai","Vasilis  Friderikos"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":" * intra operator cross band spectrum management improves the power efficiency ands capacity of cellular systems considerably\n\n* multi-antenna co-operative communications improves the energy efficiency in cellular networks \n\n* delay tolerant traffic management techniques (with multi hop support) to increase the overall energy efficiency of cellular networks as well as the spatial capacity Through our publications (journals and conferences) and through mobile VCE industrial members Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
