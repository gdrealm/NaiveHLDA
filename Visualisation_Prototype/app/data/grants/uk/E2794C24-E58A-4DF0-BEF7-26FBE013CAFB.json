{"id":"E2794C24-E58A-4DF0-BEF7-26FBE013CAFB","title":"Memory and the self in ageing","abstractText":"<p>&nbsp;The changes in memory that are associated with ageing have a range of impacts on individuals and their families. When we lose our memory, we do not just miss appointments. Autobiographical memory (memory for personal events) is vital for supporting a sense of identity. Thus memory impairments can lead to more than mere forgetfulness; they can affect our sense of self and identity.<br /><br />This research project aims to examine the relationship between memory and identity across the lifespan. It will explore what changes take place in ageing and have implications for the understanding of dementia. The central methodological tools used will focus on collecting autobiographical memories that are particularly relevant to the self and exploring the features of these memories. Ethical approval will be obtained prior to commencement of data collection.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K000918/1","grantId":"ES/K000918/1","fundValue":"139301","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Clare Josephine Rathbone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
