Strategies for SS control are needed to protect human health andto reduce dependence of pig production on antimicrobials. This project aims to identify control points for the prevention of SS related disease in pigs and humans. Longitudinal studies in UK and Chinese farms and abattoirs (intensive and traditional systems), with whole genome sequencing of isolates, will provide guidance to new control points for disease prevention by shedding light on strain diversity, fitness, and antimicrobial resistance along the supply chain. Sequences will be compared to those obtained from pig meat products and those available from human isolates. Risk factors for carriage of SS on consumer-ready pig-meat will be investigated. We will identify avenues for environmental control of SS using transposon directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) to explore the genes that underpin environmental survival of SS in the farm, abattoir and meat product context.All partners (Cambridge University, Huazhong Agricultural University (HAU), and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)) have strong track records in SS research. CU and HAU hold a China Partnering Award, and all 3 work together within the existing BBSRC Longer and Larger funded consortium, 'A single platform diagnostic and multivalent vaccine approach to bacterial respiratory diseases of pigs'.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L003902/1","grantId":"BB/L003902/1","fundValue":"157032","fundStart":"2013-06-21","fundEnd":"2015-11-20","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dan  Tucker","coPersons":["James  Wood","Duncan  Maskell"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
