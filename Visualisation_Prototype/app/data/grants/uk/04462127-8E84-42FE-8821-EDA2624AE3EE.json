{"id":"04462127-8E84-42FE-8821-EDA2624AE3EE","title":"Genetic modifiers in a model tauopathy","abstractText":"The formation of abnormal inclusions made of only a handful of proteins is believed to be central to the vast majority of cases of neurodegeneraive disease in man. Of these proteins, tau is implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick s disease, argyrophilic grain disease and familial forms of frontotemporal dementia. The development of robust transgenic mouse models for these so-called tauopathies has made it possible to dissect the pathway leading from normal, soluble to abnormal, insoluble tau protein. We propose to identify proteins that modify (enhance or suppress) neurodegeneration in mouse models of human tauopathy. This may in turn lead to novel insights into possible prevention and treatment of these so far incurable diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600724","grantId":"G0600724","fundValue":"539737","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Michel  Goedert","coPersons":["Maria Grazia  Spillantini"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
