In particular, the applicants will focus on the development of improved models for understanding and managing hypoxaemia and apnoea, which can be validated across representative patient populations, thus significantly enhancing their clinical applicability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E056431/1","grantId":"EP/E056431/1","fundValue":"50726","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan Grant Hardman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
