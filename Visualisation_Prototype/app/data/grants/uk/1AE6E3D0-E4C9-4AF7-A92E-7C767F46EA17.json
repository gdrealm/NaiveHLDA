{"id":"1AE6E3D0-E4C9-4AF7-A92E-7C767F46EA17","title":"Climate-controlled chambers for the study of physiology and behaviour.","abstractText":"Wild birds experience a broad range of temperatures. These fluctuations have a profound influence on their lives. However, studying this influence is not an easy task, because in the field, variation in temperature is not independent of other variables (such as the day length), and in the laboratory, experimental manipulation of ambient temperatures over the natural range requires specialist equipment. We are applying for money to purchase such equipment that will allow us to vary temperature and day length independently from each other and from other factors. This equipment will consist of four chambers in which we can house birds either in cages, or in free flight. The four chambers will be independently controlled, so we can simultaneously have different groups of birds in different conditions. This equipment will then be used to ask a number of scientific questions. Some of these questions relate to the role of temperature in preparing animals for the changing seasons. We know that day length is an important signal in this preparation, but the role of temperature (which changes in concert with day length in nature) is still very much unknown. Other planned studies will address questions about how an animal responds to being in a situation where its energy reserves are limited. When it is colder, more energy needs to be spent on staying warm, and therefore more energy is required. We will study how this increased need for energy influences decisions animals make about what to eat and when. Understanding how animals respond to differences in temperature is also very important if we want to understand the potential impacts of global climate change on animal behaviour and therefore on their populations. This equipment will be unique in the UK and will allow us to ask questions that we have not been able to answer before.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F011229/1","grantId":"BB/F011229/1","fundValue":"136000","fundStart":"2009-02-24","fundEnd":"2010-02-23","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This award was for a piece of equipment.
