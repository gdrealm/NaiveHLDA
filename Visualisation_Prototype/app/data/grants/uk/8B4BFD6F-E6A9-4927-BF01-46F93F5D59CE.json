{"id":"8B4BFD6F-E6A9-4927-BF01-46F93F5D59CE","title":"What citizenship do we want?","abstractText":"Young people from communities with strong religious/cultural identities have sometimes found it hard to engage with or be welcomed into an inclusive British citizenship (McGhee, 2005); some feel there is little sense of one national identity or of a citizenship which comfortably embraces Europe, and that an inclusive citizenship and more participatory democracy is needed (Ofsted, 2006).These concerns and anxiety about political engagement with the state have prompted changes in education policy; Concern about youth alienation from democratic processes has led, at least in part, to the introduction of citizenship education in schools. This has stemmed, in part, from angst about the low levels of voter participation by young citizens in the 18-24 age bracket, in particular. (MacFarlane, 2005).This move to promote a sense of British citizenship has had limited success. The intentions for citizenship education are contested and unclear; its delivery often makes little reference to significant local and national issues and in many schools provision is inadequate. Teachers find it problematic to teach; attainment is generally poor; and its curriculum is ambiguous, incoherent and unmanageable (Ofsted, 2006). There has been criticism that citizenship education is the worst taught subject in secondary schools (Independent, 2006) and it remains fragile in many (Chief Inspectors Report, 2008).The legacy of colonialism, the growth of a multicultural UK and the emergence of trans-national political structures have increased concerns about entitlement to and the nature of British citizenship. International tensions are increasingly reflected in local communities. Particular anxieties have been raised about the disengagement and marginalisation of groups such as Muslims (Osler &amp; Starkey, 2003), heightened by economic globalisation, international terrorism and high-profile extremist events. Media reports can compound concerns, as with young Muslims' reported views on the desirability of Sharia law (Daily Mail, 2007), but fears of the radicalisation and disengagement of some minorities are not reflected in public opinion surveys (Gallup, 2009). There is a growing view that citizenship education needs to be more about empowerment and 'performativity' (Braidotti, 1994) and less about academic content, duties, government institutions, 'the rule of law' (Ofsted, 2006) or the coercion of social compliance seen elsewhere (Martin &amp; Feng, 2006). This project allows young people to explore, develop and practice citizenship in a safe environment reflecting real-world contexts dealing with issues relevant to them in a pluralistic democracy through novel use of an immersive virtual technology they find appealing (Second Life). Evidence suggests that ICT can change long-held, deep-rooted views (Martin &amp; Vallance, 2008) and that immersive environments can be effective in developing self-perception and identity (Bers, 2001).This research uses an imaginative, practical, engaging solution to develop and study citizenship identity. It will identify what motivates individuals to engage with citizenship education; promote more engagement with public and political life; encourage debate and understanding of the concerns and values of others; and promote greater social inclusion.Educational institutions will use the project's work to benefit teaching of citizenship, politics and general studies and increase young people's engagement with political concepts and issues. The research will promote social cohesion by promoting cultural understanding and more empathy for others and more engagement with democratic processes. It will contribute knowledge of how young people understand citizenship and how more engagement with citizenship education may be developed. Research in education, psychology, sociology and computing will benefit from learning how innovative technology can be used to study values, identity and citizenship.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H043047/1","grantId":"EP/H043047/1","fundValue":"194966","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-02-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This was the first phase of the project from which further progress has since been made.

The environment included terrain to be explored and featured a town where dwellings could be designed, built and furnished and a 'debating space' where formal or informal discussions could be held. The environment also included a range of incidental animations and sound effects to suggest a realistic setting, such as weather, wind effects, resident wildlife, etc.\n\nWithin this environment young people played the role of an imaginary character that existed and moved in the created environment (an 'avatar') alongside others created by other young people at the same time. Each avatar could have its appearance customised in terms of its ethnicity, gender and attire so as to reflect the characteristics of any of the main cultural and religious heritages within the UK today, or a mixture of these or none at all.\n\nYoung people were then asked to build and furnish a 'home' for their avatar to represent the values, activities and objects that were of most importance to them as real people in the physical world in their daily lives. Periodically avatars would be summoned to the debating area for group meetings. These meetings would be presented with typical scenarios taken from the mass media (TV news and newspapers) that were about topical and contentious issues of citizenship identity, such as gay (or arranged) marriage, the voting rights of prisoners, limitations to rights of protest, different cultural or religious views about family life, justice and human rights and so on. They were asked to discuss each scenario and say what they thought should be done to resolve any conflicts or inappropriate behaviour, or address any issues that were felt to conflict with 'being British'.\n\nDuring these discussions, the environment offered young people the option to attach particular cultural, religious or moral 'values' to their statements, to show why they believed their comments should be taken seriously by others. Their comments and values (and their definitions of each 'value') were visible to all others taking part in the debates. Groups working together in the environment were asked to try to achieve a consensus view for each scenario.\n\nYoung people completed questionnaires about their cultural and religious attachments and took part in interviews about their experiences in the virtual environment and their thoughts about what they had learned and the implications of this for them. Their views were also sought about the value of using of such environments for learning.\nThe project is ongoing and so the findings are expected to continue to develop. So far the outputs from the project have been used to:\n\nExtend and significantly develop the impact of citizenship education in UK schools\n\nEnhance the effective use of ICTs in mainstream schools involved to provide teachers with skills in technology use\n\nTo change the existing pedagogy within schools involved, especially with regard to technology use, but also with regard to moving away from a 'top down' delivery approach to one featuring more experiential learning\n\nTo create professional practice that has been praised by the government's Ofsted inspectors\n\nTo raise the awareness of young people (especially those approaching the age at which they may vote) of the ethical and moral nuances of citizenship-realted issues and in particular those normally associates=d with particular cultural or religious elements in society \n\nWHAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED\nWhat has been discovered by this research is that the young people who have taken part in this study to date (over 450, roughly equal numbers of male and female aged between 14 and 19, from a mixture of different religious and cultural backgrounds):\n\n1. Do not generally hold views about 'Britishness' or common moral and ethical standpoints that are derived from or heavily influenced by any particular cultural or religious affiliation.\n\n2. Do feel that social norms and acceptable behaviours within society should be judged primarily on the basis of humanistic values of 'goodness', 'fairness', 'kindness', 'consideration for others', and the prevention of unnecessary or gratuitous harm to other living things.\n\n3. Do not subscribe to radical values, are not sympathetic towards those who advocate extremist religious or cultural practices, irrespective of their own personal attachments (if any) to a particular cultural heritage or religion and associate extremist practices with feelings of revulsion and fear.\n\n4. Found the virtual environment highly attractive as a means of learning about things and enjoyed the immersive experience much more that their usual technology use or experiences in more traditional citizenship-type lessons.\n\n5. The appropriate use of technology can be a powerful way to explore, understand and influence the religious, cultural and humanistsic values, beliefs and understandings of individuals.\n\n6. The current project's specialist use of technology appears to be a powerful means of educating individuals to be more aware of religious and culturally extremist and radical views and appears to encourage a more critical and unaccepting attitude towards these.\n\nIt is also clear from this research that with the exception of a few enthusiasts, the educators who have been involved in the study so far (over 40, mostly males working in secondary education or FE colleges) make limited use of digital technology as part of their teaching and that this has little to do with the possession of specialist expertise or training, which most teachers who were involved felt should not be necessary and for which they had no time and little interest in acquiring.\n\nFrequently these teachers pointed out the ease of use and lack of training needed to use social networking, media consumption, online purchasing and the internet as examples of the kind of well-designed 'easy' technology that is needed by schools.\n\nAll the teachers who have been involved found the technology motivated and engaged their students and that there was much more informed subsequent learning and engagement of young people with regard to citizenship-related, moral and ethical issues. They also felt that the young people involved had become more socially involved and were now more interested in social and political events and were therefore more likely become politically and socially engaged in such things as voluntary work and voting in general elections. 1. Repeating similar experiments to establish how generalisable these findings are with regard to moral and ethical issues and 'Britishness'\n\n2. Broadening the application of the use of virtual worlds into other subject areas to determine whether such applications offer greater benefits that more traditional and established ways of learning and teaching\n\n3. Engaging more educators with the present project and subsequent developments of its approach that are planned for future extensions of thee work to create a national data set.
