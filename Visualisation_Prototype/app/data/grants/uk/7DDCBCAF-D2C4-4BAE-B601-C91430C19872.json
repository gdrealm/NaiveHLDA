{"id":"7DDCBCAF-D2C4-4BAE-B601-C91430C19872","title":"Trajectory perception by young infants: conditions for perception of continuity","abstractText":"<p>When an object passes behind another object it may go totally out of sight for a period. Yet, as adults, we perceive it as moving on a continuous trajectory. We know from previous research that from 4 months, infants perceive his form of trajectory continuity, but only when the gap in perception is short, either in temporal or spatial extent. </p> \n<p>In this research, infants are familiarised with an event in which an moving object goes out of sight during part of its trajectory, and are then presented with test displays designed to identify whether or not infants perceived the trajectory as continuous. The focus of investigation will be on a number of different factors likely to affect trajectory perception. These include the nature of the information specifying the moving object, the occluding object, and the way the object disappears and reappears relative to the occluding object. </p> \n<p>The work has the promise of providing further clarification of the bases of early perception of object trajectories and object disappearance events. Additionally, the findings should inform theories regarding the development of object knowledge in infancy. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-23-1341","grantId":"RES-000-23-1341","fundValue":"280132","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gavin  Bremner","coPersons":["Alan Michael Slater"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
