The study forms part of the International Self-Report Delinquency Study, covering some 25 to 30 countries, mainly in Europe but also from other continents. Four of the five applicants are members of ISRD's Central Coordinating Team (CCT). The study's overall aims are to chart variations in self-reported offending and experience of crime as victims, to test the relative value of different theoretical perspectives for explaining these variations, to develop and test more integrated theories of youth offending and to draw out the implications for youth justice policy in the five countries. In order to do this, surveys of school-children will be mounted in a sample of cities across the five countries The study will contribute to the development of an integrated theory of youth offending, and will trace the implications of this for youth justice policy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L016656/1","grantId":"ES/L016656/1","fundValue":"118848","fundStart":"2014-02-24","fundEnd":"2016-08-23","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The fieldwork for this project has only just begun (October 2014) and there are no findings to be used at present Government, Democracy and Justice Policy & public services","person":"Mike  Hough","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":" The fieldwork for this project has only just begun (October 2014) and there are no findings to be used at present.
