{"id":"53023C38-6288-4B2B-8659-E6AE302638D7","title":"KMOS Contingency Payment","abstractText":"KMOS is an advanced imaging spectrograph being constructed by a consortium of UK and German institutes as one of \na suite of second generation instruments for the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope (ESO VLT) in \nChile. KMOS uses a technique known as integral field spectroscopy to dissect the images of astronomical sources and \nproduce individual spectra for different regions within a single target. KMOS will operate in the near-infrared part of the \nspectrum (1-2.5 microns wavelength) and will offer a multi-object capability to observe up to 24 sources simultaneously \nwithin a 7 arcmin field of view, which will be unique at these wavelengths. The primary science drivers for KMOS are to \nobserve the evolution and mass assembly of distant galaxies in the early universe and to study resolved sites of star \nformation in low redshift galaxies. Durham will provide the Principal Investigator for the project, the pickoff module which \nrelays the light from selected targets within the telescope field of view, and the integral field module which uses micro- \nmachined image slicers to dissect the light from each selected target.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/J003034/1","grantId":"ST/J003034/1","fundValue":"110021","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ray Martin Sharples","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
