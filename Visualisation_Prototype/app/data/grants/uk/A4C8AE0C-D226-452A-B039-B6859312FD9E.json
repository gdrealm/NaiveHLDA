Until lately, researchers working on the early modern period have concentrated almost exclusively on what biographies of canonical writers reveal about the facts of their subjects' lives. Scholars have entirely neglected how biography articulated the biographer's own professional ambitions. My book on the monograph Life of the French man of letters will be the first to examine the important cultural and social function biography held in the early modern period. It aims to contribute a new understanding of the cultural significance of this form of writing as a means of self-promotion. As biographer, the humanist man of letters situated himself within the same cultural field as his subject, thereby accrediting himself as a fellow man of letters by his own display of humanistic competence. I am interested in identifying the ways in which biography in France during the years 1540 to 1630 provided a vehicle for the advancement of the biographer's own career. By using the life narratives of their subjects to pre-script their own careers, early modern biographers blurred the boundaries between biography and autobiography. A more general objective of my work is to investigate the contribution of early modern biography to defining the field of literature. My book further examines biography's role in canonizing the literary author. Scholars commonly date the emergence of the literary field in France rather later, so my research raises important problems of literary history and cultural theory. My proposed book examines a very specific corpus: lives of five French men of letters composed between 1540 and 1630. This specificity allows me to make precise claims about the role of such biographies in the culture of the period. Although the biographers themselves are not well-known, the subjects of the biographies my book examines are important: Ronsard; Ramus, one of the most original thinkers of the century; Bud&eacute;, one of France's great humanists; Pibrac, whose 'Quatrains' were one of the most frequently reprinted texts on practical moral philosophy both in France and in other European countries until the middle of the seventeenth century. The one autobiography I discuss is by a major poet of the century, d'Aubign&eacute;. To illuminate these texts, my research draws on a variety of cultural material, including medical writing, letters, political pamphlets, and treatises on historiography, diplomacy and civility. My approach, while mainly historical, is theoretically informed by the work of new historicists like Stephen Greenblatt and Lisa Jardine. The genre of biography has attracted increasing scholarly interest, as attested by several recent collections of articles. France and St. Clair, eds. 'Mapping Lives: The Uses of Biography' (2002) devote only one essay to the early modern period and Mayer and Woolf, eds. 'The Rhetorics of Life-Writing in Early Modern Europe' (1995) do not focus on the French cultural context. My book on the monograph life of the French man of letters will complement existing scholarship on the biography collections by Giovio, Thevet and B&egrave;ze, such as Eichel-Lojkine's 'Le si&egrave;cle des grands hommes: les recueils de vies d'hommes illustres au XVI&egrave;me si&egrave;cle' (2001). The five chapters of my book each comprise a case study of a biography of a man of letters chosen to reveal the diverse ways in which such texts operated as negotiations in the world. Each chapter develops a major theme which contributes to our understanding of biography's cultural function: the relationship between biographical narrative and humanist historiography; the intersection of biography, courtiership and diplomacy; the early modern conception of poetry; the application to biography of medical expertise and dialectic; and thenotion of the court as theatre.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E00069X/1","grantId":"AH/E00069X/1","fundValue":"24598","fundStart":"2007-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Katherine Margaret MacDonald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
