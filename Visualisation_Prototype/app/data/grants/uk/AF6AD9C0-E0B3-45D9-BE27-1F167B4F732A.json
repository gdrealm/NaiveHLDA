{"id":"AF6AD9C0-E0B3-45D9-BE27-1F167B4F732A","title":"Institute for Plasma Science, Technology and Fusion Energy","abstractText":"The Plasma Physics and Fusion Group in the Physics Department at the University of York has an international reputation for its research into fusion energy and laser-plasma interactions/high energy density physics. We propose to expand this activity (with three new academic appointments) to include technological applications of plasmas, which will bring both scientific and strategic benefits. Scientifically, we will be well-placed to exploit the synergies between our existing research activities and technological plasmas. Strategically, technological plasmas are of direct interest to industry so the proposed expansion provides a closer relationship with a range of industrial partners, benefiting the new research activity and helping industry engage with the multi-billion pound international fusion programme. A strength of our proposal is that the three research activities (laser-plasma interactions, fusion energy and technological plasmas) will be integrated into a single Institute for Plasma Science, Technology and Fusion, in a purpose-designed institute, to create a flagship centre for plasma research, training and exploitation in the UK.The creation of the Institute is particularly timely as it coincides with a 500M expansion of the University's activities. This expansion provides an innovative infrastructure that enables companies and other external organisations to co-locate alongside University Departments to ensure maximum impact from teaching and research, as well as providing new opportunities for identifying commercially relevant projects and collaborative funding opportunities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I500987/1","grantId":"EP/I500987/1","fundValue":"1787000","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our fundamental research into low temperature plasma research has had an impact in sectors such as biomedicine (eg potential plasma cures) and advanced manufacturing (eg semiconductor industry, packaging, chemicals, etc).\nOur laser-plasma research has explored the fundamental properties of high energy density physics; laboratory astrophysics, and manufacturing processes.

We have won major research grants from a number of funders, as well as an EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training. Our research has expanded into a wide range of plasma fields from low temperature plasmas for biomedical and technological applications (including advanced manufacturing), through high energy density physics for fusion energy, QED plasmas and laboratory astrophysics, to magnetic confinement fusion. We work with industry in all areas, and continue to seek to grow our portfolio of industry partners to ensure high impact. Bringing together world-class critical mass under one roof, together with state of the art equipment, creates huge potential for research and training. Our growing network of academic and industrial partners provides strong pathways to impact.
