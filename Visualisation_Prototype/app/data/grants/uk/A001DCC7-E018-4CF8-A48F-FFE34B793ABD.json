{"id":"A001DCC7-E018-4CF8-A48F-FFE34B793ABD","title":"Next Generation of SBLI Code","abstractText":"This project aims to re-engineer a code for direct and large eddy simulation of transitional and turbulent flow. The original code was developed by the applicants for simulation of shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) problems and has become known as the SBLI code. Since its development the code has proved to be a flexible research tool and has been applied to a wide range of research problems including subsonic airfoils and aero-acoustics. With more geometrically-challenging applications and new algorithmic improvements, such as non-reflecting boundary conditions and sub-grid scale models for turbulence, the code has split into several variants. The present project will undertake a comprehensive re-engineering of the code, aiming to add capability and bring the various elements back together, while retaining the flexibility of the original code as a research platform. Well-developed code elements will be modularised and removed from normal user access. A suite of validation cases will be programmed and used during the code modification, which will include an update to current language version and incorporation of a version control system for parts of the code. The utility of the new version will be demonstrated by a new state-of-the-art direct numerical simulation of transition due to oblique shock wave impingement, including more flow physics than previous simulations. A formal code release will be made during the project, with users consulted throughout.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F011180/1","grantId":"EP/F011180/1","fundValue":"124511","fundStart":"2007-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Yufeng  Yao","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
