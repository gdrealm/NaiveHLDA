However, the challenge is now to continue to develop the science while at the same time engaging with the national and international stakeholders, the key policymakers and the local communities.\n\nWe recognise that this cannot be achieved in isolation and the key to success will be through international collaboration. Therefore, this programme will be delivered through close collaboration between the University of Exeter, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the UK Met Office. The PULSE-Brazil project consists of three inter-linked Work-packages (WPs):\n\nWork-package 1 (WP1) - will coordinate the exchange of scientists between the UK and Brazil, organise and run international conferences and stakeholder engagement activities, and manage the overall PULSE-Brazil project. The ultimate aim of this WP is to integrate the results and discussions between the cross-disciplinary research team and policy makers to propose strategies for mitigation and adaptation (Leader: Luiz Aragao)\n\nWork-package 2 (WP2) - will focus on building the climate, environmental and human-health datasets for assessing the Impacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil, based on state-of-the-art climate change projections from he regional Eta model and the MBSCG global model. The climate and environmental data will be delivered by INPE of Brazil, while the health data will be delivered by Federal University of Minas Gerais - both funded by a related proposal to FAPESP- FRPGCC (Leader : Jose Marengo).\n\nWork-package 3 (WP3) - will develop a 'user friendly' decision-support system (PULSE) that will allow both academic and non-academic users to visualise the impacts of Climate Change on ecosystems and human health the Brazilian region, using relevant outputs from pre-existing model projections. This will be subcontracted to the UK Met Office (Leader: Richard Betts).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J016276/1","grantId":"NE/J016276/1","fundValue":"240803","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The PULSE-Brazil project is a somewhat different research project in the sense that its main focus is not generating new science and new findings but rather using current data and understanding of climate and ecological systems to build a data visualisation tool that facilitates the understanding and use of these informations for human health and environmental decision making in Brazil. The impact of PULSE on this in these first two years of project was the official request to use the PULSE tool as a central information platform of climate and environmental data in several Climate Adaptation Plans namely:\n- Acre State Climate Adaptation and Risk Management Plan\n- Interministerial Commission on Climate Adaptation of the Federal Government\n- 2040 National Adaptation Plan of the Secretary of Strategic Affairs of the President's Office Environment,Healthcare Policy & public services","person":"Peter  Cox","coPersons":["Luiz  Aragao"],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":" The PULSE project advanced the understanding of the ways science and policy can work together to improve society preparedness to deal with the effects of climate change. In more practical terms, the PULSE team also contributed to generated a new range of climate, ecosystem and human health data that now can be easily visualised through the PULSE tool (www.pulse-brasil.org/tool) and be used for research, educational and policy information purposes. These findings and data visualisation possibilities can be widely used by different groups of research, for education in schools and universities and by environmental advisory teams for policy making as complex data is made accessible and easily understandable by non-expert groups. The next step for PULSE would be to improve the usability of this information by further engaging different stakeholders with the data and working on generating new data, particularly on impacts, risk and adaptive solutions of climate change. This needs to continue to be done for ecosystems and human health but also other new sectors could be considered such as agriculture and the climate-food security nexus.
