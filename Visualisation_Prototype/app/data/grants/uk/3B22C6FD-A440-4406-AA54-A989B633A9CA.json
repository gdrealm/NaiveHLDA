The two previous meetings in this series have attracted internationally leading speakers to talk about aspects of nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing. It is essential that early career stage researchers and PhD students are exposed to such internationally leading researchers, especially in a rapidly moving field such as is the focus of the meeting. The meeting will also give them an opportunity to present their work, which is an important part of their professional development.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F020295/1","grantId":"EP/F020295/1","fundValue":"11048","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant paid for PhD students to attend an international conference on nanotechnology.
