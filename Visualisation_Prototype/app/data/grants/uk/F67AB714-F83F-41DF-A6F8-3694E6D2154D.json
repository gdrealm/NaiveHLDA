Uniform beam polarisations are invariably used in MOKE measurements, whether as a parallel beam for thin film measurements or a focussed beam for measurements of small magnetic structures. Observing MOKE from in-plane magnetisation requires an oblique angle of incidence, with higher signals generally obtained with larger angles of incidence. This leads to a compromise being reached between spatial resolution and signal. Tightly focussed light beams are not purely transverse and can have a component of longitudinal electric field in the vicinity of the focus. Radially polarised light beams can significantly increase this effect and have a much reduced focal spot size for the longitudinal field component. We propose to use the longitudinal electric field associated with tightly focussed radially-polarised laser beams to perform normal-incidence MOKE measurements on materials with in-plane magnetisation. This will allow exquisite spatial resolution of magnetic thin films and nanostructures, plus the unprecedented ability to depth-resolve magnetisation. Optimising this will require a new framework to relate the relevant physics of MOKE with non-uniform optical polarisation. The three advantages of radial-polarisation MOKE (R-MOKE) are:1. An order of magnitude increase in the longitudinal component of electric field (which couples to the in-plane magnetisation to generate a Kerr signal)2. A reduction of the transverse spot size affording higher spatial resolution3. The unprecedented ability to depth-resolve magnetisation in MOKE measurements.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H044922/1","grantId":"EP/H044922/1","fundValue":"149064","fundStart":"2010-09-01","fundEnd":"2011-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Inspired novel optical analytical systems for characterisation of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials.

It is understood in terms of linearly polarised light beams reflected from a magnetic surface having a reflected polarisation state that depends on the magnetisation of the surface. MOKE magnetometers are extremely popular systems for characterising magnetisation changes in magnetic thin films and nanostructures.\n\n\n\nThis project sought to use knowledge of modern optics to improve the sensitivity and resolution of MOKE systems. In particular, we were interested in tightly focussing 'radially polarised' light beams to generate a large axial electric field at the sample surface.\n\n\n\nOur findings were:\n\n\n\n- Focussed radially polarised light is very sensitive to surface magnetisation, via the magneto-optical Kerr effect.\n\n\n\n- The spatial resolution is improved over the use of linearly polarised light.\n\n\n\n- The traditional route of linearly polarised light analysed with a quadrant detector senses magnetic behaviour in two positions of the film at once, rather than the single point sensitivity assumed previously. This adds to our knowledge of optics and magneto-optics. It is most likely to be exploited by academic and industrial research groups in magnetic nanotechnology to improve the characterisation methods avialable.
