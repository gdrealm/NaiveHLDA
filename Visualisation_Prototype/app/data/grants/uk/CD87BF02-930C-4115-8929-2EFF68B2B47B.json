{"id":"CD87BF02-930C-4115-8929-2EFF68B2B47B","title":"System Identification and Information Processing for Complex Systems","abstractText":"The main aim of this Platform Grant proposal is to build upon the expertise of the Sheffield team in signal processing and system identification for nonlinear and complex systems to develop new research themes and application areas. The applicants developed the narmax methodology, a theory for nonlinear systems in the frequency domain, and a class of algorithms for the identification and analysis of spatio-temporal systems. Recent developments at Sheffield mean we are now in a unique position to develop new multi-disciplinary research themes to exploit and build upon this expertise. The new multi-disciplinary research directions that we plan to develop as part of this research proposal include studies of drosophila brain, stem cell dynamics, diffuse optical tomography of brain, space weather systems, and crystal growth phenomena. Each of these offers unique challenges in signal processing and system identification and each requires scoping or feasibility studies to establish the potential to develop each new research area into a core research proposal. The core theme of this Platform Grant proposal is therefore to provide funding to conduct initial scoping research studies into each of these new multi-disciplinary projects with the objective that this will allow the development of each theme to the point where a responsive mode application can be submitted to take the research forward.Career development for members of our group including RA's is a core part of our strategy. The Platform Grant will provide stability for the collaboration by our research team with other disciplines, and should provide a critical mass of researchers and a longer term stable environment around which the career development of outstanding young researchers can be nurtured. The Platform Grant will enable the group to maintain the momentum that has been generated by the formation of two new research centres, and to build upon and exploit the multi-disciplinary partnerships that have been developed to date. The opportunity to take risks, try out completely new approaches, and completely new application fields produces an excitement in the research, enhances moral and longer term strategic research planning and development, allows flexibility, creates opportunities, and provides support for everyone in our group.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00453X/1","grantId":"EP/H00453X/1","fundValue":"1210660","fundStart":"2010-01-02","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The results from this research have been used in very wide range of multidisciplinary applications including space weather, econometrics, Drosophila visual system, stem cells, EEG and Alzheimer's diagnosis, Greenland icebergs, neuroimaging and many other fields.
