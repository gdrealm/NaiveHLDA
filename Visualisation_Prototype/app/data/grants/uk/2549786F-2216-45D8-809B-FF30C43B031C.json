Mouse models for ALS have been generated to test therapeutic interventions but many of these are not robust systems. We propose to make stem cell like cells from skin cells of ALS patients from which we can make Motor neurons. These motor neurons will provide a model more akin to the human disease and therefore serve a good model to understand the disease process as well as to test drugs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0900786/1","grantId":"G0900786/1","fundValue":"297347","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-12-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Vasanta  Subramanian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bath","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
