I belong to this diaspora, having been born in Former Yugoslavia with a Kosova father and British mother and come to Britain when I was 5. In an environment where cultures are merging and blurring, my research will reveal the universality and trans-national nature of my experience. My photographs will explore issues around the Kosova war and peace, personal identity and family relationships.\n\nWorking from my personal experience, I will link images to wider social and political issues on migration. I will take as my starting point some observations by V. Flusser in his book The Freedom of the Migrant: Objections to Nationalism. Flusser says that migrants are the avant-garde of the future as their otherness disturbs our everyday ideological perceptions and their presence disrupts the basis of our lives. However, he downplays the poignancy of suffering and of the migrant's existence, which my work recognises as central; and to that extent my work develops out of his theories rather than simply illustrates them.\n\nBy presenting my personal history over time in a 'high art' context I hope to deepen the way people understand migration and identity. Where the project focuses on the Albanian communities in London and Leicester, issues such as housing, discrimination and integration will be addressed. The work is of significance as the Albanian diaspora is an under&shy; represented and little understood minority. An estimated 100,000 ethnic Albanians are living in the UK, many of them from Kosova. Their complicated history makes it hard for British people to understand them, especially as a troubled minority has become involved with the darker side of society. They form a close-knit community, with a network of relationships that can be dificult to penetrate; but as I have unique access to them I am able to produce work that will illuminate their lives; and by capturing striking images of these lives in an artistic way I hope to engage audiences with the plight of the refugees.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E506321/1","grantId":"AH/E506321/1","fundValue":"16554","fundStart":"2006-08-11","fundEnd":"2007-08-10","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Lala  Meredith-Vula","coPersons":[],"organisation":"De Montfort University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
