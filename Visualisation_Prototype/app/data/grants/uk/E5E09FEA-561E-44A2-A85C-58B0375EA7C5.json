{"id":"E5E09FEA-561E-44A2-A85C-58B0375EA7C5","title":"Cultural Memory and British Cinema-going of the 1960s","abstractText":"I will investigate and interrogate the cultural memories of a diverse group of British sixties cinemagoers in order not only to shed light on the social and cultural history of cinema but also to contribute to a wider reappraisal of British society and culture of the time. Interpreting the 1960s, historians have traditionally seen them as a pivotal era, associated with a cultural revolution in which family, sexual, gendered, racial and class relationships all changed as old conventions were discarded (Jonathon Green, 1998; Arthur Marwick, 1998). Yet the assumption on the part of both politicians and historians that the sixties were an era of radical change has been challenged by Dominic Sandbrook (2005), who argues that there were strong elements of continuity with post-1945 Britain and that the changes that did occur were slow, painful and often controversial. Instead of embracing radicalism and experimentation, much of British society remained conventional and conservative. I will aim to shed light on this debate by analysing the memories of cinemagoers. Not only was cinema in many respects representational, portraying the class, gendered, sexual and cultural changes of the time, it was also believed by many writers on film to have emblematic qualities, embodying a wide range of society's hopes, myths, fears and fantasies. Moreover, it was still a mass entertainment, bringing together people from varied social and cultural backgrounds. The analysis of memories of cinemagoing offers the possibility of contributing new perspectives on 1960s social and cultural history by engaging with memory and lived experience. \n\nThe project's methodology will be based on the collection of individual memories of 1960s cinemagoing through questionnaires, individual interviews and focus group discussions. In the beginning, subjects will be self-selected: they will volunteer to complete a detailed questionnaire on the project website in the main because they have seen advertisements or letters announcing the project in a range of newspapers and periodicals (some may alternatively hear of the website because of the publicity surrounding its launch). Once the questionnaires have been completed and analysed, the project team will decide which respondents will also be invited to personal interviews or to become members of focus groups. Those decisions will be informed by the need to have a sample that is balanced in gender terms and as wide as possible in terms of age, social class, and ethnicity. In terms of scholarly output, the project will result in three conference papers, two scholarly articles, and a book.\nIn addition to the academic rationale for the project, a major priority will be the engagement of a wider public. This will be achieved for the most part through a programme of screening major 1960s films (e.g. Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Victim, A Kind of Loving, Darling, Alfie) at 11 venues across the UK. 9 of these screenings will be followed by a discussion on the film and the 1960s themselves moderated by the Principal Investigator and Research Assistant. Two screenings in the final year of the project will be at larger venues and followed by a debate on the memory and legacy of the 1960s involving historians and film scholars. Moreover, given the enthusiasm of many people for the cinema, it is probable that the book based on the project will have a broader circulation than most scholarly books. For the same reason (considerable public interest in cinema and cinemagoing), it is possible that the project will give rise to radio and television documentaries.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000446/1","grantId":"AH/K000446/1","fundValue":"324850","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Melvyn  Stokes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" At the beginning of this project, little was known about what it was like to attend cinemas in 1960s Britain. Through the many questionnaires we have collected and interviews conducted, we are tracing the different experiences of those who went to cinemas belonging to the two major chains, independent cinemas (referred to affectionately if sometimes accurately as 'fleapits'), publicly-funded houses (the National Film Theatre and the three Regional Film Theatres), and film clubs run by university students and particular local communities. We are uncovering evidence of cinemas used for other purposes than showing films (for example, pop music concerts). Respondents are also sharing with us memories of attending children's matinees and clubs for minors on Saturdays, when largely unsupervised children seem to have run wild.\n\nThe experience of going to the cinema in Britain in the 1960s was influenced by a variety of factors. One was class. One respondent recalls always going to the more 'posh' and expensive seats in the circle of her local cinema 'because I was posh.' Others, coming from a poorer background, were very impressed by the apparent luxury of the chain cinemas: one notes how much she admired the plush carpets because 'we had lino at home.' The size of the community was also a significant consideration: many cinemas in rural areas were saved from closure by the 1960s boom in car ownership. This was important since in many villages and small towns, cinemas help perpetuate a sense of local community.\n\nWith relatively few exceptions (for example, some respondents remember watching The Graduate, 1967, with its emphasis on the 'generational gap,' and talking about it with their friends because they believed it somehow reflected their own lives), what our respondents remember is less the films themselves than the social aspects of cinema-going. For those who mainly attended chain cinemas, film directors are rarely noted or remembered. The opposite, however, we have discovered, is true amongst members of local and university film clubs, and those who attended some independent or publicly-funded cinemas. Many of these specialist audiences have strong recollections of discovering and greatly admiring the work of European directors of the time whom, looking back, they perceive as offering a broader perspective -- what one respondent terms 'windows on the world.'\n\nMany of our respondents recall cinemas as places for courting and youthful sexual experimentation. Some remember with nostalgia double seats in the back rows (referred to as 'chummy' seats in Scotland). Yet we are also uncovering a darker side to 1960s cinema-going. Many women recall being harassed by men if they went to the cinema on their own. The censorship rules, intended to protect young people, at times had the opposite effect: children, wishing to see films requiring that they be accompanied by an adult, sometimes accosted strangers (with all the attendant risks) and asked to accompany them into the theatre. At the same time, however, many respondents remember ushers as actively supervising the behaviour of cinema-goers. \n\nIt seems clear from our researches that patterns of audience behaviour changed considerably during the course of the decade. At the beginning of the 1960s, aided perhaps by the fact that audiences were more mixed in terms of age, most audiences seem to have been quieter and better behaved. As the 1960s moved on, audience behaviour became less respectful and deferential. One symptom of this was the attitude to the national anthem, played at the end of most performances. At the start of the decade, most people stood and some sung the anthem; by the end, there was often what one respondent described as an 'unseemly scramble' to leave the cinema before the national anthem started.\n\nInterviews are also revealing a complex pattern of cinema-going among ethnic minorities living in Britain in the 1960s, particularly amongst the Indian, Pakistani and Afro-Caribbean communities. It was not until the late 1960s and early 70s, for example, that 'Bollywood' films began to be programmed at mainstream cinemas in areas of Britain with large Asian communities. Before that, there was a network of film clubs and societies that screened Bollywood films privately. As we are discovering, this viewing experience was sometimes very different to that in chain cinemas: at the Scala cinema in London, for example, screenings were often attended by Bollywood stars who introduced the films, conferring great cultural significance and value upon them for local Asian communities. We are also discovering that some members of the Indian and Pakistani communities consciously watched British films as a means better to understand the culture of the country that had become their new home. Interviewees discuss what they recall as the 'educational' value of such cinema-going for first-generation immigrants. \n\nIn these and other ways, the project is making discoveries that shed considerable new light on the social and cultural history of Britain in the 1960s. The project findings will be made available to scholars in modern British history, film studies, and memory studies initially through the book and articles that make up the academic output. In the final year of the project, the findings will be discussed at seminars (e.g. at the University of East Anglia) and the two major events outlined in the original timetable. Once project work is completed, the questionnaires, together with transcripts of interviews and focus groups, will be deposited in a major library for the use of subsequent scholars.\n\nA crucial means of communicating with non-academic audiences, as proposed in the original 'Pathways to Impact,' has been the series of film screenings of sixties films we have arranged across the country. We have shared our findings with these audiences and audience members have responded by contributing their own memories. In the final year of the project, we shall organise further screenings of this kind and, in collaboration with local groups such as U3A, arrange additional events to discuss our findings.\n\nWhat little was known about 1960s cinema-going in Britain before the project focused on the white population. The project is uncovering the untold cinema-going history of black and Asian minorities living in Britain in the 1960s. This will offer a considerable stimulus for the development of educational resources for black and Asian history projects (we have already participated in a Black history month event organised by Haringey Council at the Asian Centre, Wood Green, on 31 October 2014). There is also potential to develop links and collaborations with these groups and others we have worked with, such as the South London Black Elderly group in Tooting.\n\nFinally, in terms of more general dissemination, the project has prompted considerable public interest and it is likely that the book summarising our findings will reach a general as well as scholarly audience. The producer of the Film Programme on Radio 4 has expressed an interest in the work we are doing and, during the final year of the project, we will work -- as proposed in 'Pathways to Impact' -- to increase the impact of our findings through coverage in the mass media.
