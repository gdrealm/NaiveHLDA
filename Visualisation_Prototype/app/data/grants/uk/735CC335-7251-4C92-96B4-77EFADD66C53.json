{"id":"735CC335-7251-4C92-96B4-77EFADD66C53","title":"Characterisation of the United Kingdom thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patient cohort","abstractText":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute, sudden onset, life threatening illness, affecting females: males 3:1, typically 30-40 years, but can present at any age between birth and 80 years. The true incidence is unknown, but values of 4-6/million of the population are quoted. Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) with platelets acts to prevent bleeding. VWF is broken down by ADAMTS 13. ADAMTS 13 is missing in TTP. This results in widespread, small vessel thrombosis, affecting all organs, but a variable clinical phenotype. The main treatment is plasma exchange, the removal on a special cell separator machine, of blood plasma and replacement with large volumes of donor plasma, which is a replenishing source of ADAMTS 13. \n\nThe South East (SE) England TTP group have identified TTP subgroups. Cases of congenital TTP, in adults and children require individually based treatment programmes depending on their clinical phenotype. The majority of cases are acquired idiopathic TTP, the majority ( 90%) have antibody, mainly IgG, against ADAMTS 13 and prevent its action. Patients with recurrent or unresponsive TTP episodes were treated with Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against B-lymphocytes, important in antibody formation. With standard therapy (plasma exchange and steroids) patients have had excellent responses clinically, increases in ADAMTS 13 enzyme levels, decrease in IgG antibody levels and significantly reduced relapses. Approximately 15% of cases have defined precipitating causes, such as HIV, pregnancy or pancreatitis. Some pregnancy cases present as adult congenital TTP and HIV patients require antiretroviral therapy with plasma. \nThe aim of the grant is to organise a UK wide TTP registry, to determine the incidence, important epidemiological data regarding patient characteristics and mortality/morbidity in different areas. Baseline ADAMTS 13 assay, repeated in remission, to define if specific antibody levels are associated with related clinical characteristics. Further work on other antibody subtypes/groups within a larger cohort may highlight characteristics in patients not evident from clinical presentation, such as risk of relapse. DNA analysis, in all cases, to determine if mutations or polymorphisms in the ADAMTS 13 gene may be responsible for precipitating subtypes of TTP, or alter responsiveness to therapy. Ultimately, randomised clinical trials, to improve time to remission, by turning off the thrombotic process and improve mortality, using monoclonal antibody therapy. Genetically engineered ADAMTS 13 will be available for congenital TTP.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800671","grantId":"G0800671","fundValue":"485455","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Marie  Scully","coPersons":["Ian James Mackie","Samuel John Machin"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
