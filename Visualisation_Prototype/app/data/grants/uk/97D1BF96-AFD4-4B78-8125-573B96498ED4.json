{"id":"97D1BF96-AFD4-4B78-8125-573B96498ED4","title":"Genetic and environmental causes of psychotic experiences: A twin cohort study","abstractText":"In adolescence, people sometimes see, hear, or feel things that are not there (hallucinations), and commonly feel paranoid. These are examples of ?psychotic experiences?. They are often transitory but research has shown that having a lot of psychotic experiences is a predictor of later mental health problems, such as schizophrenia. The proposed project aims to identify the causes of these adolescent psychotic experiences. A sample of 4000 identical and fraternal twins, who will be aged 15- to 18-years-old at the start of the project, will be assessed on psychotic experiences over three years. The twin design will measure the genetic and environmental effects on psychotic experiences. We will also investigate whether other common problems in adolescence, such as depression, anxiety and drug use, share genetic and environmental causes with psychotic experiences. In the final year of the project, we will conduct clinical interviews on twins who show persistent high levels of psychotic experiences. We hope that by understanding the causes of psychotic experiences in 15- to 18-year-olds this knowledge can inform the development of prevention and early intervention strategies. The long-term goal is to alter an individual?s path for the better by reducing their risk of having psychotic experiences. In sum, the research is trying to achieve a clearer picture of what causes psychotic experiences, and what causes them to become so debilitating that medical help is required.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1100559","grantId":"G1100559","fundValue":"475588","fundStart":"2012-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Angelica  Ronald","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
