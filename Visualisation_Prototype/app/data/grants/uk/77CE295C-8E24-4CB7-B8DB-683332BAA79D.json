{"id":"77CE295C-8E24-4CB7-B8DB-683332BAA79D","title":"Exploring mechanisms regulating expression of the amyloid-degrading enzyme neprilysin","abstractText":"Alzheimer s disease is the most common form of senile dementia in the ageing population and puts a significant burden on families, carers and National Health Services in the UK and worldwide. Recently it was found that amyloid deposits in the brain which cause AD, can be cleared by some enzymes, namely peptidases, whose activity in the brain declines with age. One of them, an enzyme called neprilysin, was found to be regulated in the brain by amyloid metabolism itself. Understanding the mechanism of this regulation might lead to a new strategy of regulation of this enzyme at the level necessary for healthy functioning of the cells in the brain and prevention of accumulation of toxic amyloid deposits. Moreover, this research will also generate new basic knowledge about mechanisms of regulation of genes involed in pathology of the brain.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0501565","grantId":"G0501565","fundValue":"350879","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Anthony John Turner","coPersons":["Natalia N  Nalivaeva","Nikolai  Belyaev"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
