{"id":"A65B11D4-75B2-46B7-9F98-EFBBB5DBC95E","title":"Neurocognitive Endophenotypes of Stimulant Drug Dependence","abstractText":"We know that about 15% of people who try cocaine will become dependent on it within 10 years of their first use. The likelihood of developing cocaine dependence is further increased for people who have a family history of substance use disorders. Thus the addictive potential of cocaine is magnified by genetic risk factors but we currently know little about how the risks for drug dependence are inherited.\n\nWe aim to discover more about the genetic basis for cocaine dependence, by using brain imaging and cognitive testing to assess people with a clinical diagnosis of cocaine dependence and their non-dependent first degree relatives, as well as healthy normal volunteers. In this way, we aim to identify heritable traits or endophenotypes in brain organization and cognitive processing that may mediate the genetic predisposition to develop drug addiction. \n\nIdentification of such endophenotypes would make an important contribution to understanding of drug addiction, by clarifying the distinction between those brain and cognitive abnormalities that are the effects of long-term drug abuse, versus those that represent predisposing causes of drug abuse. Delineating the neurobiological causes and effects of stimulant drug dependence will be fundamental to future development of more effective therapeutic and preventative interventions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0701497","grantId":"G0701497","fundValue":"645783","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen D Ersche","coPersons":["Trevor William Robbins","Edward  Bullmore"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
