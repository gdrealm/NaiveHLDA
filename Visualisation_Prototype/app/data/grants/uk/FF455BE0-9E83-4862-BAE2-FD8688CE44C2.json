{"id":"FF455BE0-9E83-4862-BAE2-FD8688CE44C2","title":"Brain-Computer Interface for Monitoring and Inducing Affective States","abstractText":"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) allow for modification of subject's environment or control of external devices by the power of thought alone. They achieve this by analysis of small electrical potentials generated by the subject's brain while its owner is thinking. Emotions involve specific mental states hence also involve particular patterns of brains electrical activity. The proposed research will build innovative intelligent BCI systems that can monitor our emotions, and modify them automatically and adaptively via controlled computer music generation system. Creation of such systems would advance our understanding of fundamental relationships between the subjective emotions, corresponding brain states and characteristics of music that can induce very vivid and powerful emotions in humans. Such systems can be used for treatment of emotional/mood disorders such as depression so are of direct benefit to society and NHS. In addition, they are of interest for healthy subjects as means of relaxation or perhaps by enhancement of gaming experience. Thus the proposed project could also lead to interesting developments in the entertainment industries such as the gaming industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J003077/1","grantId":"EP/J003077/1","fundValue":"509002","fundStart":"2012-08-31","fundEnd":"2017-03-01","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Slawomir Jaroslaw Nasuto","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
