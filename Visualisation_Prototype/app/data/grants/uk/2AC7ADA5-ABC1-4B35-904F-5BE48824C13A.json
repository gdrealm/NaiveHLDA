{"id":"2AC7ADA5-ABC1-4B35-904F-5BE48824C13A","title":"Exploring shape co-existence in 202,204Rn","abstractText":"One of the striking features of the atomic nucleus is its ability to adopt different deformed shapes for small changes in the total energy of this system. We wish to examine this behaviour in the light radon nuclei where coexistence between a spherical ground state and intruder configurations is expected. We have already successfully carried out a Coulomb excitation study on 202Rn and 204Rn using REX-ISOLDE at CERN. What this study has shown is the importance of internally converted transitions in these nuclei, and, in particular, the likely existence of low-lying 0+ states. The purpose of this grant application is to allow a follow-up experiment to be conducted at the University of Jyvaskyla using the unique SAGE apparatus where we will be able to detect electrons and gamma-rays in coincidence, thereby building up a complete picture of low-lying states in 202Rn and 204Rn and the transitions which connect them. We can then use this information to extract matrix elements. This experiment is scheduled to take place in May 2010. We request travel funding for 3 people to attend the experiment and be involved in its set-up. We also request running costs for one week's use of the germanium detectors at the University of Jyvaskyla.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/I000380/1","grantId":"ST/I000380/1","fundValue":"12985","fundStart":"2010-04-26","fundEnd":"2010-08-25","funder":"STFC","impactText":"  An experiment was successfully carried out.
