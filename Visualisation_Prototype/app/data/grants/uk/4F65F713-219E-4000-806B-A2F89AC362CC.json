They have also helped generate a body of high quality scientific outputs that can be more directly tied to SERCs activities over the past year. We have published over 150 discussion papers and a dozen policy papers describing the research that we have undertaken. It is always hard to identify specific examples from such a diverse body of work, but we would highlight the following examples:\n\nThe primary channel through which SERC aims to achieve scientific impact is through publication in top ranked, peer-reviewed international journals. We have published in a range of fields spanning economics, economic and human geography as outlined in Part 3. \n\nMethodology was not an explicitly defined SERC objective. However, advancing methods for understanding causal mechanisms in spatial research has always implicitly been a goal, because of its importance in informing policy decisions. SERC has led the way in spatial research in developing and applying such methods to the analysis of spatial problems and has become a focal point for quantitative research of this type. Many of our discussion papers, exemplify best practice in identification of causal mechanisms from observational data. SERC researchers through their close involvement with PhD students in the department of Geography and Environment at LSE, and through our annual conference, have sought to transfer expertise in this area to new generation of researchers and build scientific capacity in empirical spatial economic research. Gibbons and Overman outlined some aspects of the general scientific position that has underscored the SERC style of research in relation to previous spatial econometric methods in DP0061, which was published in the Journal of Regional Science in 2012. The argument in this paper was that traditional 'spatial econometrics' do not pay close enough attention to issues of causality, and questioned the approach of the burgeoning body of applied economic research that proceeds with mechanical application of spatial econometric techniques. Instead we argues the case for greater adoption of the 'experimentalist' methods adopted in other fields such as labour economics, which puts issues of identification and causality at centre stage. This article has had a big impact on the spatial research community (as the editor remarked in personal communication, 'your ... paper has created quite a stir') and has received 66 google scholar citations in the two years since publication. This paper has led to Gibbons and Overman writing (with Eleonora Patacchini) the chapter on 'Spatial Methods' for the forthcoming Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics Vol 5 (Elsevier) in which we expand on the issues discussed in Gibbons and Overman 2012, link into the literature on identification of peer and neighbourhood effects from network data, and discuss the crucial role played by spatial weights matrices in identification of causal parameters in spatial models.\n\nQuestions around the magnitude and nature of agglomeration economies have played a central role in SERC's research from the outset, because of the tension between the evident benefits of spatial concentration for economic performance, and the disparities that spatial concentration can create. Evidence on the magnitude of the impacts of agglomeration on outcomes such wages and productivity was already fairly well established at the beginning of SERC funding, and our research has focussed on more nuanced questions. SERC has made a number of important contributions in this area, including the impact of agglomeration on wage dynamics (DP0135), residual productivity differences between cities (Gibbons, Overman and Tucci 2009 for MIER), the potential role of improved transport (Overman et al 2009 for the Northern Way), the importance of agglomeration for FDI location (DP0089), agglomeration in peripheral rural areas (DP0080) and micro scale agglomeration effects in university departments (DP0133). Our most recent and exciting work on agglomeration (Faggio, Silva and Strange, DP0152) leads the field in terms of empirical analysis of the micro foundations of agglomeration economies and promises to make an outstanding contribution in its field. The paper builds on Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr in the AER in 2010. However, our work recognises that not all firms agglomerate for the same reasons and considers the interplay of classical agglomerative forces (proposed by Marshall) with alternative theories that emphasise the adaptation, accidental and organizational aspects of agglomeration. We use patterns of heterogeneity in the importance of knowledge spillovers, labour-pooling and input-output sharing across industries to shed light on the interplay of these different theories, revealing that different industries agglomerate for different reasons. These findings have not previously documented in the literature despite their obvious relevance for policy making and for our understanding of industry co-location. The analysis also exemplifies SERC's approach to data analysis, creating an incredibly rich dataset from multiple datasets: administrative micro data on firms, wages from the Labour Force Survey, input-output tables, European Patent Office data.\n\nSERC is not only interested in spatial interactions between firms, but between individuals in communities, schools and other institutions. An important output in this respect is our recent Economic Journal publication, Gibbons, Silva and Weinhardt (2013) - previously SERCDP0063 - on the influence of 'neighbourhood effects' i.e. the influence of neighbours on children's educational achievements (the second of our nominated outputs). A long line of international research has investigated this question, but the field has struggled to distinguish between the causal influence of neighbours from the sorting of different types of people into different neighbourhoods. In the absence of any randomised experiment in the UK (like the Moving to Opportunity in the US), our study approaches the problem by using highly detailed data on the 4 cohorts of the population of state school children in England (from the National Pupil Database), and tracks what happens to the test scores of students who stay in a neighbourhood as the composition of their neighbours changes, due to in migration and out migration of their peers. Using these data we are able to successfully control for unobserved pupil and fixed neighbourhood factors and trends to show that changes in neighbour composition have no effect on a child's test scores (although some effect on attitudes and behaviour at school). These findings suggest that previous claims that neighbourhood plays an important role in child outcomes, and policy that attempts to engineer neighbourhood composition to address individual disparities (e.g. 'mixed communities' policy) are misguided.\n\nWe also have outstanding science from our programme on housing and planning, best exemplified by Hilber and Vermeulen, DP0119 which is currently in the final stages of review for the Economic Journal (the third of our nominated outputs). This paper tackles deep questions about the role of housing supply in determining differentials between areas in terms of house prices. In many basic theoretical spatial models of housing prices, housing supply has only limited role to play in determining area house price differentials, because free movement of people between areas tends to equalise price differentials in the long run. This paper demonstrates empirically that this perception of the role of housing supply in determining local house prices can be misleading. Assembling and analysing 35 years of data on Local Planning Authority prices and characteristics, the authors show that prices respond more to labour demand shocks in areas where there are constraints on housing supply, either through planning restrictions, the amount of developable land or due to area topography. The effects of supply constraints are greater during boom than bust periods. This research makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the way in which spatial housing markets function.\n\nOur work on the impacts of public sector relocation discussed in Part 3 (DP0111, published in Journal of Urban Economics and our fourth nominated output, and DP0155) also makes an important scientific contribution to our understanding of the multiplier effects of local employment (linking into the wider scientific literature on this question e.g. Moretti 2010). High quality scientific output and capacity building in relevant research fields has helped underpin another key SERC objective - informing general debates and policy making. As an ESRC venture part funded by government, SERC has always placed a very strong emphasis on the practical application of its research. We have put in place a number of initiatives to ensure that our work (and research in the broad field of spatial economics, more generally) influences policy locally, nationally and internationally. Substantially the largest group of users are practitioners and policy makers working at different levels of UK government. Users also include community and non-governmental organisations and development partnerships, think tanks and business and the wider policy community internationally. . SERC has always undertaken a mix of proactive outreach activities and more responsive engagement mechanisms, tailored to these different audiences. The Centre has benefited from the fact that many of its staff has have extensive experience of engaging with many of these non-academic beneficiaries and users. Users and beneficiaries of SERC outputs have included: Central government (BIS,DCLG, Cabinet Office, DfE, DfT, WAG, DWP, Treasury); Local Government (LEPS, the forme RDAs Manchester City Council, GLA, other LAs; think tanks (Policy Exchange, Centre Forum, Demos, IPPR and the Centre for Cities).
