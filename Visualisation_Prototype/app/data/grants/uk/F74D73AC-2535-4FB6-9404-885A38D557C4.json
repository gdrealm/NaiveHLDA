In doing so this study will examine how the adjustment to capital account liberalisation depends on the development of the domestic financial market and will address the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>How does the direction of international capital flows depend on the level of domestic financial development? \n</li>\n <li>How does international financial liberalisation influence the allocation of resources in domestic production? Does financial integration redirect resources efficiently even when domestic credit market is not sufficiently developed? \n</li>\n <li>Who gains and who loses from capital account liberalisation? Under which conditions is government policy able to mitigate the distortions created by the presence of credit frictions? <br /></li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H004963/1","grantId":"ES/H004963/1","fundValue":"238758","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2012-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  There is some evidence on the acknowledgment of our findings based on citations of the output produced in this research and also on the interests expressed by conference organizers in international institutions in inviting papers belonging to this research project.

This research proposes a different perspective by focusing on the role of allocation of capital flows within an economy that opens to international financial markets. We find that when an economy as a poorly developed domestic financial system, capital account liberalization could be harmful in terms of future growth performance since capital flows tends to be directed towards less productive projects. Similarly episodes of abundant capital inflows caused by low interest rates could be associated with stagnant productivity growth and misallocation of resources towards sectors in the economy where the scope for productivity gains are limited (e.g. construction sector). We expect to contribute to the debate on policies related to the managing of the capital account. In fact in the past two years there has been a renewed attention towards policies aimed at controlling capital inflows (i.e. capital control). \nContrary to the common view that has emphasized the overall quantity of capital flows as critical, our analysis would like to shift the debate towards the allocation of capital flows as more relevant for determining the costs and benefits of capital account liberalization. In fact our study shows that capital controls are dominated by policies aimed at improving the allocation of resources across different sectors. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
