{"id":"C555FDE7-4458-4A2E-89EB-6C897897DB80","title":"Gastrointestinal Pathogens in the Environment. GIP-net","abstractText":"In the UK it is estimated that everyone will suffer from a stomach bug every five years. The disease can range from being merely an inconvenience, through to bloody diarrhoea, through to life threatening conditions in some cases, particularly in the already ill, the very young and the elderly. The costs to the economy in absence from work and medical care is considered to be over #750M per year in England alone.\nThese bugs grow and multiply in farmed and wild animals. They can be caught by a number of routes such as direct contact with animals and their faeces or from contaminated water or food. The bugs can be transmitted between people ? for example in nurseries or care homes, but the main source is animals which often do not show any signs of disease. \nNew bugs appear from time to time and changes in climate and agriculture may increase the threat of disease from existing bugs.\nTraditionally governments in developed countries take the approach of dealing with one part of the agricultural system (eg water, waste, crops, food) but a more integrated approach is required. This should include all interested groups from farmers and farming organisations, to recreational users of the countryside, to regulatory and policy makers such as DEFRA, FSA, Local Councils, etc. Further we require information about the loads and types of bugs in the environment, how they get there, how well they survive and how they move around . Also, we need to find out what key information is missing and so needs to be collected. From a social perspective we need to find out who is responsible for these pathogens, who should pay for cleaning up the environment and what effects these clean-ups would have on the agricultural systems. \nIt is very important to develop new policies for dealing with these bugs but it is vital that this is acceptable to all. By bringing together the three groups of natural and social sciences, users of the environment , regulatory/policy makers in workshops it will be possible to plan a way forward and formulate a plan for a Phase II proposal through which the findings of the workshops can be implemented.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0902438","grantId":"G0902438","fundValue":"49957","fundStart":"2010-05-14","fundEnd":"2011-03-13","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Norval  Strachan","coPersons":["Colin  Hunter","Ken  Forbes","John Chris Low","David Lawrence Gally","David Robert Chadwick","Alan  Renwick","Paul Howard Everest","Robert Matthew Christley","Sarah Jane O Brien","Davey Leonard Jones","Iain  Ogden","Paul  Cross"],"organisation":"University of Aberdeen","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
