The memristor is a non-volatile memory because the specific resistance is retained until the application of another voltage. A memristor implements a material version of Boolean logic and thus any logical circuit can be constructed from memristors. We propose to fabricate in laboratory experiments an adaptive, self-organized disordered network of memristors. This practical fabrication will be backed up by rigorous computer simulation experiments. The memristor network is comprised of a conglomerate of conductive polymer fibres interspersed with particles of solid electrolyte. The conglomerate is placed on a matrix of micro-electrodes capable of recording voltage and generating current sources and sinks. Machine learning techniques will be applied in order to design logical schemes and basic arithmetical circuits.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H014381/1","grantId":"EP/H014381/1","fundValue":"643827","fundStart":"2010-07-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings were used to establish a new paradigm of computing using thin film and polymer based resistors with memory.

The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaption and variable topologies, allowing the number of neurons, connection weights, and inter-neural connectivity pattern to emerge. By comparing two phenomenological real-world memristor implementations with networks comprised of: 1) linear resistors, and 2) constant-valued connections, we demonstrate that this approach allows the evolution of networks of appropriate complexity to emerge whilst exploiting the memristive properties of the connections to reduce learning time. We extend this approach to allow for heterogeneous mixtures of memristors within the networks; our approach provides an in-depth analysis of network structure. Or networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks; results demonstrate that memristive plasticity enables higher performance than constant-weighted connections in both static and dynamic reward scenarios, and that mixtures of memristive elements provide performance advantages when compared to homogenous memristive networks.\n\nResearch publications can be found on arxiv.org and scholar.google.co.uk In the design of novel learning computer hardware Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics","dataset":"gtr"}
