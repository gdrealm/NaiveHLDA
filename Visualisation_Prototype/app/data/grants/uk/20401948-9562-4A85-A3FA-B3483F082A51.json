But even if the recommended procedure and the need for attention is instilled we do not have a direct measure of the ability of&nbsp; children at different ages to judge the approach of a vehicle and make a safe crossing judgments. We will assess the perceptual factors affecting road crossing decisions in typically developing children up to the age of 11yrs. Previous research has also highlighted a relationship between poor physical skills and unsafe road crossing decisions. Approximately 5% of the school population present with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). These children exhibit problems with a wide range of fine and gross motor skills. In addition, these children show specific problems with the utilisation of motion cues to organize action and integrate vision and action (Wilmut &amp; Wann: RES-000-22-1266).&nbsp; This project will also assess the perceptual skills of children with DCD in a road crossing situation.&nbsp; The results of this study will clarify our understanding of road crossing behaviour in school age children.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F017650/1","grantId":"ES/F017650/1","fundValue":"274800","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  This project gave us the time &amp; facilities to explore the equivalent speed processing errors, that we had studied in children, in an elderly driver population. We ran two studies into elderly drivers in collaboration with Transport Research Laboratory. We did not use ANY FUNDS from this project to run those studies, as that was not an original cost that was approved, but we used funds from RoSPA and Royal Holloway to support the study costs. This project kept in place the facilities and methodologies, as well as providing revised versions of our software for testing. A paper resulting from the first study is listed as an outcome.These are the 'highlights' from our older driver paper: o Perceptual thresholds were measured using psychophysical procedures to allow precise measurement of perceptual degradation. o We demonstrate that sensitivity to vehicle approach speed declines by nearly 3 mph for every decade in age. o Older drivers over 70 years old may struggle to differentiate between speeds of 20 mph and 40 mph. o The time available for older drivers to make a manoeuvre such as pulling out of a junction could be reduced by up to 50%  ","person":"John Philip Wann","coPersons":["Kate  Wilmut"],"organisation":"Royal Holloway, University of London","findingsText":" The World Health Organization cites road traffic accidents as one of the world’s leading health concerns. This research has investigated the relationship between fundamental aspects of human visual processing across the lifespan and the scenarios in which road accidents are most likely to occur. This research has been at the heart of a national campaign to lower urban speed limits, particularly where child pedestrians are present. This work is amongst the first to document that the perceptual acuity for judging vehicle approach, in road users, is below what would be optimal given the current range of traffic speeds in everyday environments. This research has demonstrated that children under the age of 11 years are vulnerable to making errors. These patterns align well with statistics on UK road accidents. The findings concerning children provide a clear rationale based upon human perceptual abilities for wider use of 20mph zones outside of high risk areas such as schools. Parliamentary debate: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110316/halltext/110316h0002.htm 16 Mar 2011 : Column 131WH School Crossing Patrols (Dorset) 4.49 pm Annette Brooke (Mid Dorset and North Poole) (LD): It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Weir. I am very pleased to have secured this debate, because parents across Dorset are deeply concerned about the county council’s proposals. It is true to say that my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax) and I will be speaking today on behalf of thousands of parents. I understand that 2011-2020 is the United Nations decade of action for road safety, and that in Great Britain pedestrian injury is the leading cause of accidental death among children. Each year, 5,000 children under 16 are seriously injured or die on Britain’s roads. The incident rate for children peaks between 8 am and 9 am, when they are travelling to school, and again at 3 pm when they are on their way home. Incidents on school journeys account for 14.6% of all five and six-year-old casualties, 21% of all eight to 11-year-old casualties and 23.9% of all 12 to 15-year-old casualties. Although the United Kingdom has the second lowest road death rate in the EU, its child pedestrian death rate is worse than in 10 other EU countries, and eight times higher than in Sweden. Research by Royal Holloway, university of London shows that children are unable to accurately judge the speed of vehicles travelling at more than 20 miles per hour. The study found that children aged six to 11 suffered from speed illusion, which means that they cannot make a reliable guess at a car’s speed if it is going at more than 20 miles per hour, unlike adults, who accurately judge speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. Since 2003, death and injury rates have fallen every year, but road safety groups fear that that trend could end if school crossing patrols were axed...(continued). Changes to planned scrapping of road crossing patrols in dorset: (BBC News 5/10/2011). ' Peter Finney, cabinet member for highways and transport, said: &quot;We have listened to what people had to say, and have agreed to retain all 51 school crossing patrols on sites which meet the national criteria.&quot; Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
