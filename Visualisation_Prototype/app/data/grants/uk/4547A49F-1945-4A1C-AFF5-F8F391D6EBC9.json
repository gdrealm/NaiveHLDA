{"id":"4547A49F-1945-4A1C-AFF5-F8F391D6EBC9","title":"Religious Language and the Realism Problem","abstractText":"Are religious claims in the business of describing the world, or do they rather serve merely to express attitudes? If they aim to state truths, how should we understand the truth for which religious claims are apt? These questions are at the core of the debate about religious realism. Antirealists typically either construe religious claims as expressive, or else give a philosophically minimal reading of religious truth. This research defends a semantic realist thesis - that religious claims are apt for truth of a non-minimal kind, even if they are not actually true - and develops an analysis of the meaning of religious claims.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=113116/1","grantId":"113116/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-02-01","fundEnd":"2006-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Scott","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
