{"id":"3D099A88-8B32-48BF-91E4-8E67773BEF02","title":"Hidden Depths: A Detailed Study of Rape Crisis Data","abstractText":"Sexual violence can lead to a range of individual and social harms, including long-term impacts on physical and mental health and wellbeing. We currently know most about cases that enter the criminal justice system (CJS), but this is a small minority of recent and historic cases - all of whom may have support needs. This project involves access to a unique, and never before available for research, dataset held by Rape Crisis Centres (RCCs).\n\nSystematic data collection and analysis can help identify who is most at risk of victimisation (and most likely to perpetrate), what their needs are, and which interventions best enable them to move on with their lives. These data can inform and improve support services. The government's violence against women (VAW) action plan and various European institutions have called for improved data collection, yet quantitative data analysis on all forms of VAW, particularly sexual violence, is under-developed in the UK and Europe.\n\nSpecialist support services hold a wealth of data on victim-survivors, including many who are hidden from official sources, as they have never reported to state agencies. Support services have historically been reluctant to share their data externally because of client confidentiality. However, new restructuring and commissioning processes mean these services must increasingly evidence their work, though not all have the resources or experience to know how to do this. The Rape Crisis (RC) sector has embraced these developments and is at the forefront of driving forward improvements in recording and monitoring their work. One such advance is their development of a Data Performance Management System (DPMS), which is now used in half of all RCCs nationally.\n\nFacilitated by our non-academic partner, South Essex Incest and Rape Crisis Centre (SERICC), a number of RCCs using DPMS are willing to provide the applicants access to their datasets. They combine to make a total sample of approximately 10,000 victim-survivors who have contacted RCCs since 2008. Three RCCs also hold large historic datasets (around 10,000 cases) they are willing to share and these will be linked with the DPMS-based data. This dataset is unique and its availability now is due to a longstanding relationship between CWASU, SERICC and the national RC Network.\n\nThis project will combine three elements. Firstly, we will conduct in-depth analysis of this previously unavailable dataset, which includes victim-survivors seeking support about recent events and childhood sexual abuse. This will be extended to include data from further RCCs during the project. Secondly, we will build capacity in the RC sector to improve the quality of future data collection and maximise use of findings from data analysis. We will hold three workshops with a working group of RCC staff responsible for data management. These will inform the analysis and reflections on findings, whilst also exploring how RCCs can improve data collection processes and use their own data more effectively in service planning, awareness raising and policy work.\n\nCWASU has a history of collaborating with support services, practitioners and policy makers, including compiling some of the most extensive existing quantitative datasets on sexual violence in previous projects. However, our existing datasets are all limited to cases known to statutory services, especially the CJS, which we know comprise a minority of sexual violence. The project would contribute to the ESRC priority: Influencing behaviour and informing interventions. The research will produce greater understanding of the profiles of victim-survivors, perpetrators and contexts in which sexual violence takes place. We will also explore intersections of age, disability, ethnicity and class with health status and revictimisation. The outputs, alongside traditional academic papers, will include a series of briefing papers, some internal for RCCs and others for wider publics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L014645/1","grantId":"ES/L014645/1","fundValue":"143047","fundStart":"2014-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Liz  Kelly","coPersons":["Joanna Katharine Lovett"],"organisation":"London Metropolitan University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
