{"id":"26E04AAE-8D3D-4DDF-8BAA-01E7A5D5AE2C","title":"DeTOX - Productive whole cell biocatalysis by engineering resistance to toxic products and substrates","abstractText":"Product toxicity is a major problem for many IBBE processes involving production of small molecules by living cells. Toxicity causes yield restrictions &amp; cell lysis, &amp; frequently affects the commercial viability of biomanufacturing. Likewise, small molecules in lignocellulosic feedstocks inhibit bacterial fermentations &amp; ultimately depress product yields. In this CBMNet NIBB-led bid, a team of scientists from four Universities apply their fundamental expertise in systems &amp; synthetic biology &amp; membrane function, to engineer increased resistance to small molecules in the industrially relevant bacteria, E. coli &amp; solventogenic Clostridia. Our innovation is to translate BBSRC-funded research in microbial stress responses, membrane structure &amp; membrane transporters, into the development &amp; commercialisation of innovative applications in IBBE by our 5 commercial partners. A key project output will be a commercial chassis strain, DeTox, with generally increased chemical resistance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/N010493/1","grantId":"BB/N010493/1","fundValue":"339244","fundStart":"2016-01-04","fundEnd":"2021-01-03","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathryn Susan Lilley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
