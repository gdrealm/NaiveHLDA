{"id":"80C76827-F04F-40E6-984B-B1CBFC9F19AC","title":"Languages at war: policies and practices of language contacts in conflict.","abstractText":"In military studies, the role of culture in war is seen as vital. Although foreign languages are often a key part of cultural encounters in war, those who study conflict have traditionally paid little attention to their role. Historians have tended to see languages as an ancillary part of diplomatic relations. Discourse analysts in this context have looked at language in general, rather than at foreign languages. Translation specialists have concentrated on the role of the language intermediary, the interpreter or translator, rather than on the language experiences of non-linguist combatants and civilians. This lack of systematic study of language experience in war has encouraged us to focus on the first hand accounts of soldiers and civilians caught up in conflict, and to examine the relationship of these experiences to official foreign language policymaking for war.\\n\\n 'Languages at War' brings together specialists from two universities in an innovative association with the Imperial War Museum, which has an unrivalled coverage of international conflict since 1914, including some 60,000 hours of sound recordings with participants. The lead investigators have an academic background in cultures of war, as well as in the development of foreign language policies, and their universities, Reading and Southampton, provide a supportive interdisciplinary environment for this research, with specialists in European histories and cultures, strategic and military studies, and transnational contacts.\\n\\n The project will examine two related but contrasting case studies, one on invasion/occupation (Europe, 1944-47), and one on peacekeeping (Bosnia, 1995-1998). Both case studies concern twentieth century joint Allied intervention in continental Europe, but are contrasting in two important respects. Firstly, the nature of the command structure is different in each: in the case of Europe in 1944-47, Allied commanders worked together, but operated in separate theatres of war, whereas in Bosnia, troops were deployed in a multilateral integrated command force. Secondly, the missions in the two case studies pose contrasting sorts of language encounter: the first positions troops as invaders and occupiers of hostile territory, the second places them as peacekeepers between blocs of opposing enemies. Archive and publicly available resources will enable us to study the official language policies relating to the two situations, and these will be set against the extensive witness statements of participants which are held in the Imperial War Museum, and which will be supplemented by additional interviews recorded by the project team.\\n\\n We believe that this project will enable us to develop a framework for analysing the role of languages in war which can be transferred to other war and conflict situations. 'Languages at War' aims to ensure that the relevance of foreign languages to war enters into the public arena in a way which is backed up by robust academic research, and which will serve to inform public debate and stimulate the future thinking of all those concerned. Through the active participation of the Imperial War Museum, the project will raise the profile of foreign languages in future Museum displays, exhibitions and programme planning which address the general public. Through the 'Languages at War' Advisory Group, agencies engaged in the training of personnel for international relations and war, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, will have an opportunity to comment, discuss and share results.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/F009968/1","grantId":"AH/F009968/1","fundValue":"514578","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The research gave confidence to the Imperial War Museum, London, to exploit the languages dimension of its collections, and to look at its collections and public responses to them in a more international perspective.\nThe research was used by the MOD in its internal debates on language policy, especially in relation to the role of locally recruited language intermediaries, and contributed to the 2013 Joint Doctrine note on 'Linguistic Support for Operations'.\nThe professional interpreters' association (AIIC) used the research in its efforts to improve the conditions of interpreters in conflict areas.\nNGOs became more interested in the role of languages in conflict situations Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy Cultural,Societal,Policy & public services","person":"Hilary Ann Footitt","coPersons":["Michael Howard Kelly"],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":" The role of languages in war and conflct had received very little attention from academics, military authorities, or the general public. The tacit assumption seemed to be that most international wars are fought with allies, and against enemies, who obligingly speak our own language. The research revealed the key role which foreign languages play in each stage of war. It pointed to :\n- the need to recognise and problematise the role of languages in intelligence gathering and assessment, in relationships between the military and civilians on the ground, and in the aftermath of war, in peace-making and with refugees.\nIt pointed to the key role of language intermediaries in war (translators/interpreters) and to the importance of planning for their deployment. The research has acted as a catalyst to stimulate interest in languages in conflict situations among language practitioners, the UK's principal museum of war, the Ministry of Defence, the International Association of Conference Interpreters, and NGOs.\n- It gave confidence to the Imperial War Museum, London, to exploit the languages dimension of its collections and is contributing to the next stage of its review of collections in the redeveloped London site.\n- The research contributed to internal MOD discussions and to the 2013 Joint Doctrine Note on 'Linguistic Support for Operations', and continues to contribute to discussions in the MOD.\n- It supported the professional interpreters association in their efforts to produce guidelines to support and protect interpreters in conflict areas.\n- it is stimulating discussion among NGOs about the role of languages in conflict areas.
