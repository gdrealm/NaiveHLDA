Bacteria use protein kinases as sensors of environmental signals. In response to its signal, a kinase transmits information by modifying its substrate protein in a process called phosphorylation. The modified substrate protein then causes appropriate changes in cell behaviour. At the University of Leicester we have uncovered a system where two kinases transmit information by phosphorylating a single substrate 'GarA' and thereby cause a switch in the metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). M. tuberculosis causes the disease tuberculosis (TB). It is able to survive inside the immune cells that kill other bacteria. It is also able to switch between active growth and non-growing forms, depending on whether conditions are favourable. It is estimated that a third of the worlds population may be infected but not show symptoms because the bacteria are non- growing or dormant. We aim to uncover some of the signals that cause M. tuberculosis to alter its metabolism, and deduce how these 'signals' are detected and how they cause appropriate changes in the bacterium itself. We will study M. tuberculosis grown in the laboratory and measure two key parameters: 1. When signaling is active 2. Changes in metabolism under different conditions We will make measurements during active growth, non-growing cultures and the transitions between growth and non- growth. This will allow us to establish when each kinase is active (during growth or dormancy) and which signals might cause kinase activity (nutrients, growth rate etc). M. tuberculosis can be grown in nutrient broth, but its normal environment is the human body - a much more complex system. Human immune cells can be grown in the laboratory and we will use these cells to study the nutritional status and kinase activity of M. tuberculosis growing inside the cells. This research will improve our understanding of information pathways in bacteria, and the differences between growing and non-growing states, as well as how M. tuberculosis survives the immune system to cause disease. Inhibitors of protein kinases might be promising future drugs to treat tuberculosis, but it will be important to know when the kinases are active in order to predict whether such a treatment would be effective in patients who have active or latent disease. What we learn about the protein kinases of M. tuberculosis will also impact on our understanding of the kinases of other bacteria, including environmentally important bacteria and strains used industrially for food and antibiotic production.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H007865/1","grantId":"BB/H007865/1","fundValue":"356008","fundStart":"2010-05-01","fundEnd":"2013-10-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  O'Hare","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leicester","findingsText":" The hypothesis tested in this project is that protein kinases play a role in adaptation of mycobacteria to slow or non-growth by a pathway involving the regulator protein GarA. So far we have produced evidence to support this hypothesis: we have shown that protein kinase G is the main kinase responsible for GarA phosphorylation, and we have deleted the gene encoding GarA and shown that the gene deletion strain has defects in survival in stationary phase. The project is still in progress. The vulnerability of M. tuberculosis to disruption of glutamate metabolism could be exploited to develop new drugs to treat tuberculosis.\n\nThe GarA regulatory pathway is conserved in other actinobacteria, including industrially useful Corynebacterium and Streptomyces species. Knowledge of their metabolism could be applied to improve the use of these organisms. We are collaborating with Prof Riccardo Manganelli's group at the University of Padua to investigate the essentially of GarA in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have discovered that the pathogen is extremely sensitive to perturbation in intracellular glutamate concentration. Healthcare","dataset":"gtr"}
