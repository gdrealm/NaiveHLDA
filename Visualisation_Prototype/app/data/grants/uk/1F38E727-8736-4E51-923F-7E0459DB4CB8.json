{"id":"1F38E727-8736-4E51-923F-7E0459DB4CB8","title":"ENERWATER","abstractText":"This project involves the research and development of novel systems to recover and re-distribute energy in food processing\nand manufacturing premises, especially where there are demands for refrigeration and heating on-site and localised. The\nproject also aims to optimise the production of heated water as a process requirement for heating, cleaning or sterilisation,\nby re-cycling both the waste heat and treating the waste water stream, so that it may be recoverable and re-cycleable.\nThe user industry attraction will be local energy recovery for useful purposes, including water supply streams. Treatment of\nwater itself for recycling is an additional attraction reducing external energy, resource treatments and requirements. The\nproposed developments may be applied within an industrial complex that can provide source and &quot;sink&quot; needs, or interbusiness\nor community to other industrial or domestic premises.\nThis approach therefore minimises the industrial consumption of energy and diverts it to other localised energy users,\nwhich could be a range of uses, such as aligned similar site or other local heat consuming processes or domestic or office\nlocalised heating needs.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M507180/1","grantId":"EP/M507180/1","fundValue":"216275","fundStart":"2015-01-31","fundEnd":"2018-01-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Hunt","coPersons":["Stephen John Burns"],"organisation":"Edinburgh Napier University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
