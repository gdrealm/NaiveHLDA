A large part of the energy flux released in the solar atmosphere travels into interplanetary space and impacts on the Earth's bow shock, energising the magnetosphere and having impact of our daily human life. The generation of energetic events in the convection zone and their propagation through the solar interior-atmosphere-space plasma system will be investigated by using mathematical modelling and the analysis of latest available satellite and ground-based datasets. Our mathematical approach involves rigorous analytical work and the implementation of parallel computing (GRID technology) where results will be tested and verified by making and using space (SOHO, TRACE, Hinode, COROT, SDO) and ground-based (Swedish Solar Telescope, Dunn Solar Telescope) observations. The proposed programme involves three Themes: 1) Structure and dynamics of the solar interior and other stars; 2) Heating and magneto-seismology of the solar atmosphere; and 3) Instabiltities of geophysical and astrophysical flows. We request funding to cover salaries of the RAs, appropriate costs for research management and research time for the Principal Investigator and five Co-Investigators, funding for four special PhD studentship in order to train the future generation experts of the field, funding for our visitor programme, for travel &amp; subsistence, computing equipment and consumables.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/F002327/1","grantId":"ST/F002327/1","fundValue":"609767","fundStart":"2008-07-01","fundEnd":"2011-06-30","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Von Fay-Siebenburgen","coPersons":["Michael  Ruderman","Istvan  Ballai"],"organisation":"University of Sheffield","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
