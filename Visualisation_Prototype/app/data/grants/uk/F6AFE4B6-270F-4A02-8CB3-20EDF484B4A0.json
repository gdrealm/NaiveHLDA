The incorporation of graphene in practical devices will open new technological opportunities in a wide number of technologies such as catalysis, supercapacitors, membranes and multifunctional polymer and ceramic composites. In order to combine optimum functional and mechanical properties, these devices will often have complex structures with characteristic features at multiple lengths scales from the nano to the macro level. For example, foams with open micro-scale porosity to allow gas access and nano-scale pores to enhance surface area, membranes that will combine ceramic supports with graphene layers of controlled permeability or multilayer structures with layer thickness ranging from micro to nanolevels. The scientific and engineering challenge is the development of manufacturing approaches to build these devices in a reliable and cost-effective manner.\nWet-processing techniques based on the use of liquid particulate suspensions, or solutions have made very significant advances in the last years. They are reliable, robust, and efficient. Now they are using to build materials with increasing degrees of precision, down to nano-levels and are having an increasing impact in a wide range of technologies. With the advent of solution processable graphene, we strongly believe that there is an often overlooked opportunity to develop wet processing technologies to build graphene-based devices. However, the development of these techniques will depend on two key issues: establishing a reliable path for the large scale synthesis of powders with controlled size and chemistry and understanding the basic physicochemical parameters that determine the response of graphene suspensions. \nThis project puts together a multidiscilplinary team with the objective to develop new wet-processing manufacturing approaches to build graphene-based 3D structures for selected technological applications. The project will cover basic scientific and engineering aspects such as powder synthesis and the basic analysis of the physicochemical parameters that control the response of colloidal suspensions of two dimensional materials. We plan to use a coordinated approach that by simultaneously developing a suite of processing approaches (from emulsification, 3D printing, layer-by-layer deposition, aerogels...) will be able to define and address the many common scientific and engineering issues and generate a synergistic effect that will push technological development. An essential part of our approach is the emphasis on specific technological applications (supercapacitors, membranes, electrochemical devices...). This emphasis will serve to focus the development of our manufacturing approaches towards specific goals, providing clear directions for structural manipulation and enhancing tremendously the technological impact of this project. By systematically analyzing the performance of our structures in these applications we will also define the key principles that should guide the design of graphene-based devices in order to optimize their functional and mechanical response.\nThis project will break new ground and uncover new scientific principles and technologies that will have a lasting impact not only on the implementation of graphene but also for a whole new family of emergent two dimensional materials whose unique properties are poised to change the way we design and build devices for a wide range of fields in the upcoming years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K01658X/1","grantId":"EP/K01658X/1","fundValue":"1914240","fundStart":"2013-02-01","fundEnd":"2017-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  One of the main direct applications arising from our findings is the large-scale availability of high-quality chemically modified graphene.

This system will be used to determine the factors that control graphene synthesis and optimise graphene manufacturing through the exfoliation of graphite. The reactor allows us to produce chemically modified graphene tailored for a variety of applications from the reinforcement of novel polymer-based composites to the development of graphene inks for 3d printing or the manufacturing of graphene three dimensional networks.\n\nWe have developed a versatile technique to build ultralight (density &gt;=1 mg cm-3) graphene cellular networks based on the use of soft templates and the controlled segregation of chemically modified graphene to liquid interfaces combined with ice templating. These novel structures can be tuned for excellent conductivity, large accessible porosity, high thermal conductivity, versatile mechanical response (elastic-brittle to elastomeric, reversible deformation, high energy absorption) and organic absorption capabilities (above 600 g per gram of material). We have also shown that these networks can be heated by direct resistive heating. Efficient heating can be achieved at comparatively low voltages. These characteristics should enable quick and uniform temperature control of the permeating gas within the porous nanocarbon network or of functional particles supported on the graphitic framework. The combination of these excellent Joule heating characteristics with other, well-established benefits (e.g., light weight, high-surface area, chemical inertness etc.) makes these graphene networks highly interesting candidates for energy-efficient and homogeneous flow-through heating systems in catalysis and solid adsorbent regeneration.\n\nWe produced highly organized layered graphene/ceramic (SiOC) composites, with good structural control at the nanometer and micrometer length scales. In our approach we combine the highly organized graphene 3D structures obtained through ice-templating with a pre-ceramic polymer (inorganic polymer backbone, such as Si atoms with organic side groups). Preceramic polymers present the advantage to be formed with &amp;amp;amp;quot;plastic&amp;amp;amp;quot; processes. Once the shaping step is done the polymer can be converted to a ceramic through a heat treatment (above 800 C). Here a polymethysiloxane (Si-O-Si backbone) is used to infuse the graphene foam and subsequently pyrolized in an oxygen-free atmosphere. We successfully showed that infusion and heat treatment led to the formation of a highly organized, layered silicon oxycarbide/graphene composite that retains electrical conductivity.\n\nWe have demonstrated how graphene functionalization with a branch copolymer surfactant can be used to formulate graphene inks with the viscoelastic response needed to build practical three-dimensional structures with precision and reliability using an additive manufacturing technique: robotic assisted deposition. The rheology of the inks could potentially be tailored for other processing technologies such as extrusion, gel or tape casting. In parallel we have also developed the technique to build graphene-based membranes on porous alumina substrates. By effectively extending the materials palette of additive manufacturing technologies to include novel 2D compounds it will be possible to create new technological opportunities in the fabrication of devices and nanocomposites on demand for a wide range of applications in energy, environment, health or transportation. Our research is delivering new information required to optimise the large-scale synthesis of graphene. In addition we have developed different methods to produce graphene 3D structures with controlled architectures. This work will enable the design and fabrication of graphene and graphene-based materials specifically designed or different applications. The materials will impact technologies such as electrodes, supercapacitors, membranes, protective composites or light-weight composites, and enable novel, more efficient systems for transportation, production and storage of energy.
