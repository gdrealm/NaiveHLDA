{"id":"972FC471-F592-4326-9041-2864DCEB572F","title":"Qualitative Data Analysis Skills for Social Researchers","abstractText":"<p>The CAQDAS Networking Project, ESRC-supported since 1994, remains the world's only national resource centre for computer-assisted qualitative data analysis, providing hands-on training workshops in qualitative software, and advanced user seminars to support software development. By 2006, CAQDAS will have trained over 4000 participants, and over 500 researchers, methodologists, and developers will have attended seminars. Training is configured to support researchers at relevant stages of their careers. </p> \n<p>For those at the project planning stage, comparative overview seminars are held three times a year, providing awareness-raising outreach to as many potential users as possible both within and outside academia, and across the UK. At an initial hands-on stage, eleven software-specific workshops a year will support use of three leading software packages and periodically showcase new generation software. At a third stage, project-specific follow-up combines practical advanced support and methodological and experiential discussion in four workshops a year, two for each of the leading software packages. The support and training strategy is based on directed hands-on learning in a face-to-face environment at Surrey, or on site at institutions around the UK. Provision via Access Grid Node technology and sophisticated web-based e-learning facilitates access and outreach for selected training and project-specific support requirements. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0040","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0040","fundValue":"112782","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Nigel  Fielding","coPersons":["Raymond  Lee"],"organisation":"University of Surrey","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
