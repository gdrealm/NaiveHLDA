Consequently, this project is concerned with two key issues, namely the cost and power density of the electrical drive system, both of which are key barriers to bringing EVs to the mass market. To address these issues a great deal of underpinning basic research needs to be carried out. Here, we have analysed and divided the problem into 6 key themes and propose to build a number of demonstrators to showcase the advances made in the underlying science and engineering.\n\nWe envisage that over the coming decades EVs in one or more variant forms will achieve substantial penetration into European and global automotive markets, particularly for cars and vans. The most significant barrier impeding the commercialisation EVs is currently the cost. Not until cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is achieved will it become a seriously viable choice for most consumers. The high cost of EVs is often attributed to the cost of the battery, when in fact the cost of the electrical power train is much higher than that of the ICE vehicle. It is reasonable to assume that that battery technology will improve enormously in response to this massive market opportunity and as a result will cease to be the bottleneck to development as is currently perceived in some quarters. We believe that integration of the electrical systems on an EV will deliver substantial cost reductions to the fledgling EV market \nOur focus will therefore be on the two major areas of the electrical drive train that is generic to all types of EVs, the electrical motor and the power electronics. Our drivers will be to reduce cost and increase power density, whilst never losing sight of issues concerning manufacturability for a mass market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I038543/1","grantId":"EP/I038543/1","fundValue":"3154530","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have been written up and published in several journals, and have been disseminated at international conferences to industry representatives and academics. We have showcased results from our technology demonstrators to our 23 industrial supporters at industrial supporters' meetings held every six months, as well as at the annual Cenex Low Carbon Vehicles event. \nEconomic benefits are envisaged in terms of costs reductions in components and integration of functionality, giving rise to increased power density. Societal benefits include reduced greenhouse emissions through the reduced use of internal combustion engines, and therefore a cleaner urban environment (lower carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions) from increased use electric vehicles.\nIn our final year we will continue to focus on reducing the costs of applying power electronics, reducing power density by shrinking the system size and increasing the power in semiconductor devices, passive components, electrical machines and converters, and increasing efficiency in the conversion of electrical energy through improved cooling in order to reduce heat loss.\nWe will continue to look at reliability in the semiconductor technology: for silicon the reliability of the systems is mainly determined by the packaging of the device and not the semiconductor itself, but with new materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, new technologies can be looked at. The reliability of electrical power systems is being improved through Warwick's research into the fabrication of silicon carbide devices, which can withstand higher voltages and temperatures. This is of interest to our semiconductor manufacturers. \nThe group at Newcastle received 49 responses from its online survey into the missing link in multi-physics simulation software, and will feed this information back to software developers to improve the software for power converters and electric drives. \nThe new devices and processes will need to be practically manufactured at a commercial scale if they are to be exploited - the project's industrial supporters, who are from car manufacturing companies; semiconductor manufacturers; component manufacturers; energy suppliers, and consultancies, will be critical in helping the consortium to develop the technology for the market place. Results from our research are being directly communicated to the supporters and ideas shared, with the aim next year to potentially commercialise the final results, where there is a need.

The concept can be easily transferred to fabricating lateral power MOSFET as well. mOhmic contact on nitrogen implanted 3C-SiC surface has been obtained, and the low resistivity values are adequate for power devices requirements. Research on 3C-SiC MOS capacitors and lateral MOSFETs showed the positive effect of N2O post oxidation annealing on the 3C-SiC/SiO2 interface, low interface trap density and channel mobility (136 cm2/Vs) was obtained, which is exceptionally high compared with 4H-SiC values (generally around 50 cm2/Vs nowadays) . The group is now looking at achieving good Schottky contact on 3C-SiC and fabricating the designed lateral power Schottky diode.\nThe research on Design Tools has shown that potting aids heat removal from the windings by encasing the windings of transformers/inductors with an encapsulant (epoxy) combined with thermally conductive filler (aluminium oxide powder). \nCFD simulations of liquid coolers have shown that there is a non-uniform temperature distribution of the coolant in the power device that can lead to failure. To counteract this, the groups are looking at using new liquid metal materials that have better thermal performances, using micro-pumps that have no mechanical parts and which have high operating speed (greater than 1kHz) and high thermal conductivity.\nExperimental measurement of convective heat transfer in rotor-stator systems are being undertaken to create accurate correlations for design of electrical machines. This has been done for forced convection and fills knowledge gaps. CFD analysis has been carried out and compared to the results. \nThe Packaging theme has looked at alternative ways to package chips on a substrate instead of usual wire-bond and solder technologies, e.g. Ag nanoflakes sintering, jet impingement cooling. They have manufactured an inductor on the same double bonded copper type substrate as the semiconductors.\nThe research in motors has shown significant challenges in minimization and replacement of rare-earth materials in permanent magnet (PM) traction motors without compromising the performance. In ferrite PM motors, it has been demonstrated that harnessing reluctance torque and mitigating the demagnetisation of PM has resulted in achieving over 90% of the performance of a rare-earth equivalent.\nOne of the major demerits of the ferrite PM is the demagnetization; the research also has shown that the stator slot and rotor pole combination does have a significant impact on the demagnetisation of ferrite magnets, and comprehensive results have shown that having 36 stator slots is the best one for an 8-pole machine with great demagnetization prevention.\nIn the Converters theme, one of the partners has investigated various solutions for integrated on-board battery charging/V2G operation, where there is no separate charger and the converter and the motor installed for driving mode are re-used instead. All the developed solutions utilize multiphase machines and power electronics and no torque is developed during charging. Simulation and experiments have fully verified novel solutions.\nThermal and electromagnetic behaviour is helping to provide an understanding of the miniaturisation of passive components.\nIn demo 1, rotor construction for an Integrated Non-Rare-Earth High Performance Drive has been optimised. It was determined that de-magnetization of the rotor can be prevented by having a smaller diameter and longer axial length. Stress levels of the high rotational speed rotors have been reduced to an acceptable level of less than 250MPa.\nIn demo 2, all the power electronics from different applications have been brought together into a single enclosure sharing a common cooling circuit. The benefits gained include maximising the re-use of power electronic components, improving electromagnetic compatibility between units; reducing electromagnetic emissions; and maximising the volume and weight savings of the drive.\nIn demo 3, bi-directional power flow using the same hardware for the propulsion, battery charging, and V2G operational modes has been demonstrated using a laboratory prototype based on a nine-phase machine. A high-power-density modular converter based on wide bandgap devices is currently under development, as is the software for the charging/V2G wired/wireless remote control. These will be integrated into a prototype of the integrated on-board battery charger. We believe that the work being undertaken in all the themes will have impacts in the electronics sector, as well as energy, manufacturing and transport.\n\nThere will be an enhanced understanding of the societal and economic impact on all stakeholders in the electric vehicle supply chain. The findings will, for example, help UK car or component manufacturers reduce costs and increase the demand from customers for electric cars and electric vehicle batteries. There could also be opportunities for enhanced grid stability, whereby there is better load management for peak demand, with electric vehicles providing storage.
