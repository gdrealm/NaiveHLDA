Concretely, the research will explore a unique firm-level dataset that links data on production, innovation and exports. </p>\n\n<p>The results of the research aim at improving the understanding of the firm-level learning and innovation processes through which firms introduce new products for production and export. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the team, a variety of different approaches will be tested to understand firm level product diversification from the trade, business, innovation and value chain literature. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the results of this research will also enable other researchers in the UK and Brazil to understand new datasets and possible ways in which they might be used. Ultimately, this will improve the overall understanding about structural transformation in a rising power such as Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H025197/1","grantId":"ES/H025197/1","fundValue":"47131","fundStart":"2010-06-30","fundEnd":"2011-05-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Xavier  Cirera","coPersons":["Anabel Ivana Marin","Paulo N  Figueiredo"],"organisation":"Institute of Development Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
