{"id":"93D94BD0-059C-494A-B4C3-658816158D08","title":"The Enlargement of the Single European Market","abstractText":"<p>The seminar series on the enlargement of the Single European Market is based on a network of academic and non-academic experts who will embark on a thorough long-term analysis of the impact of the enlargement process on the future of the EU Single European Market. The network will attempt to develop an open and transparent dialogue between academic researchers, political elites and representatives from business and other interest groups on the contribution the new member states make towards the reform of the SEM and the development of the parameters of a pan-European Social Model. Special emphasis will be put on the inclusion of participants from Central and Eastern European countries, in order to establish a mutual dialogue on the priorities of Single Market Reform and socio-economic development in the EU. Postgraduates will be particularly encouraged to participate in the seminar series and future activities of the network to ensure that the future generation of academics remains committed to maintain this dialogue. The seminar series will provide the framework for further research in this area and help the network with preparing the application for further collaborative research funding.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0410","grantId":"RES-451-26-0410","fundValue":"10244","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Christian  Schweiger","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
