{"id":"55AAFB0D-5F4A-415A-A09C-FAFDC4986747","title":"Interdisciplinary Italy 1900-2015: Art, Music, Text","abstractText":"Since the early twentieth century, Italian culture has been dominated by polemics against conventional form and calls for an abolition of boundaries between the arts. Italy's most influential artistic movements favoured multiple, reversible, &quot;open&quot; structures, a trend that can be found throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century. Interdisciplinarity has been driven by a desire for transgression and emancipation from obsolete artistic conventions, but also by a belief in the deep-rooted affinity between literature, music and the visual arts. Critics like Bonaddio and Butler have argued that such border-crossings are fundamental to understanding creativity during this period. Yet, so far, no one has attempted to study the developments across the period to assess the complex social makeup of the groups that defied established boundaries, or to explore the implications of their theoretical ideas for the teaching and study of modern Italian culture. Research on interdisciplinarity in the arts in the 21st century is very fragmented and has not been adequately theorised.\n\nIn addition to fostering dialogue about interdisciplinarity in the arts, the network will use questions that arise to explore issues relating to the development of the discipline of Languages and Area Studies: what are the implications of border-crossing in 20th and 21st century culture in Italy on the way Italian culture is researched and taught in the academy? How could interdisciplinarity enable Italian Studies to improve its public engagement profile? This project promotes the creation of instruments, such as a database, website, workshops and panel discussion, that will enable easier communication between academics and non-academics. Policy issues arising from our findings will be discussed with the SIS, and more broadly with Language subject bodies for schools and universities (UCML, LLAS, ALL and CILT) and will be introduced to the US Italian Studies associations (AAIS) as our research will have implications there too. \n\nThe network will run three workshops in London (UCL), New York (NYU), and Rome (RomaTre), and a panel at the Society for Italian Studies conference in 2013. Each of the workshops is dedicated to a separate period: (1) Modernism, (2) Postmodernism and (3) the Internet age. The steering group (Brook, Mussgnug, Pieri) will create and maintain a website and a searchable database, the first of its kind, of academics, museum curators, members of conservatoires and the media with interests in Italian culture. The group will also disseminate results through journal articles and a website. The steering committee will be supported by an advisory panel of experts from within and outside academia. \n\nThis project focuses on the following questions:\n1) Causes: Where do the roots of modern and contemporary interdisciplinarity lie? Why has it taken place in Italy during this period and what contributed to these developments? What is the place of technology, artistic milieus, journals, caf&eacute;s, printing, Internet etc. in the development of cross-fertilisation? \n2) Change and development: Can one map developments across the whole period? Does the idea of working between artistic genres and disciplines change over time?\n3) Philosophical and ideological underpinnings: How do metaphors of borders enable us to understand interdisciplinarity better? What does interdisciplinarity tell us about concepts of facilitating, policing, transgressing? How does the border crossing relate to fragmentation? How do ideas of emancipation and freedom fit in? \n4) Policy Implications: how can interdisciplinarity inspire new patterns of research, teaching, and exhibition organisation in Italian Studies and more broadly in Languages? \n\nThese questions will be addressed by a network that brings together academics, doctoral and post-doctoral researchers, museum curators, members of conservatoires, and cultural practitioners currently working in Italy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000462/1","grantId":"AH/K000462/1","fundValue":"25166","fundStart":"2012-08-15","fundEnd":"2014-08-14","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project from its outset aimed to forge better links with a number of non-academic groups in order to foster new pathways for knowledge exchange. We have worked with teachers in the UK--both representatives of teachers' associations (ALL) and individual teachers who were able to reflect on their interdisciplinary practices in interviews that are available on the project's interactive website. Work in this area has been especially productive and has resulted in direct, and ongoing, invitations from our teacher-partners to collaborate on the delivery of papers to address larger teacher audiences (Language Live Show, October 2014) and teacher associations (ISMLA January 2015). We have also shared our findings and reflections on interdisciplinarity in Italian Studies with a number of national subject associations and policy making bodies, including addressing both HEA and UCML (via its representative for Italian Studies) in March 2013; the SIS during its AGMs in January 2013 and 2014; and LLAS in July 2014. \nWorkshop 1 (NYU) and 2 (UCL) have seen the participation of curators with an interest in modern Italian culture and an understanding of the need for its interdisciplinary contextualisation. This has resulted in a number of invited talks, in gallery/museum spaces, to address non-academic audiences from members of the project, fostering the wider dissemination of our initial findings. Future plans for collaboration on an exhibition are also in place and, if additional funding is found, our ongoing informal partnership with the Estorick Collection will allow us to deliver a much wider programme of public dissemination of present and future research in the areas of interdisciplinary and interartistic exchange in modern Italian culture.\nOverall the network has provided a forum to enable free but structured discussion and thinking about policy and curriculum development; it has helped to bridge the gap and free up dialogue between teachers and lecturers in Italian; and it has enabled project members, contributors to the three workshops, and the wider community which has visited our interactive website to reflect further on the functioning of disciplinary and institutional boundaries in interdisciplinary teaching, learning and research.

The project generated new knowledge about Italian culture in the 20th and 21st centuries, providing some initial sketches of how interdisciplinary practice changed over time, and the place of political institutio(e.g. the government under Fascism), changes in technology (journals, cafes, Internet), and changes in the philosophical and psychological underpinnings which lead to today's focus on interdisciplinarity. The nature of this project, however, means that what was sketched was necessarily preliminary. The project also generated new knowledge about how interdisciplinarity has developed over time within the field of Italian Studies; we traced changes from 1900 to the present, and advised how the increasing interdisciplinary openness might be harnessed by our field and by teachers in schools and museum curators. New methodologies: It is our view that Italian Studies, and other Modern Language disciplines, would make swift progress in exploring the increasingly hybrid artistic objects and cultural practices and practitioners that span more than one art, if cross-disciplinary co-writing of articles was used as a method: this is where two or more academics from different fields pool their knowledge in an open attempt to understand the object of study from divergent perspectives. The importance of this began to become evident as the project developed. We have begun to experiment with this technique and a number of publications are in progress. We will take this forward over the coming years, and intend, if further funding is successful, to use the website as an experimental area for co-writing. Our experience of working with postgraduates during this project, suggests that there is an urgent need to train them in interdisciplinary working practices. Creation of new research resources: The project gave two new resources to the field. One is a searchable database of those working on Italian culture of the 20th and 21st centuries in Italian Studies Departments, but also in Departments of media, film, art, music fashion, theatre studies and so on. It also includes museum curators. This database enables members of the academic and curatorial community to find people working on similar areas to themselves, who they may not otherwise know due to disciplinary boundaries. The database is now housed on the Society for Italian Studies site. The second resource is a website, www.interdisciplinaryitaly.com, on which videos of the 3 workshops, discussions of key issues arising from those workshops, video interviews with teachers, and blog posts on teaching were published, alongside a twitter feed to keep people informed about our work. Over the two years, the website got over 10,000 hits. Particularly noteworthy new research collaborations and networks: the network has created a strong and productive bond between academics and secondary school teachers (the latter continue to bring the project into schools via multiple conference papers) and academics and museum curators, and the intention to work together in the future has been established. Methodological findings will be taken forward by our encouraging - through the website, if funding is found - of co-writing across disciplines, which is a rare, or even unknown practice in our field. The discovery of interdisciplinary research gaps in academic work on Italian culture have been published on our website and may be taken forward by other academics in our field. Our work with secondary school teachers will continue with Pieri's present commitment with SIS; she will facilitate further collaboration between ALL and ISMLA and the SIS Schools Liaison Officer. If funding is found, sample resources for teaching could be developed to share interdisciplinary strategies and practices in the secondary and higher education sectors. Collaboration with museum curators has been productive but remains more challenging without further funding. The links with both Estorick Collection and the V&amp;A resulted in invitations by both institutions to address non-academic audiences via public lectures and gallery talks (both by Pieri, in April and May 2014 respectively) showing great potential for further cooperation between project members and the museum world. The latter examples remain a viable pathway to continue our commitment to knowledge transfer and have stemmed directly by the curators' involvement in our project.
