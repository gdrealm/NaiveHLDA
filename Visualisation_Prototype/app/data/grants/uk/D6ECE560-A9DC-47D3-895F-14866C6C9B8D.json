{"id":"D6ECE560-A9DC-47D3-895F-14866C6C9B8D","title":"Consolidated Solar Research at UCLan","abstractText":"This consolidated grant proposal brings together solar physics research within the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). We will undertake investigations to study the processes that lead to eruptions in the Sun's atmosphere, and how energetic particle released during these eruptions are transported from the Sun to the Earth and beyond into interplanetary space.\n\nThe motion of sunspots in the Sun's photosphere can inject energy into the atmospheric magnetic field. We will study the rotation of sunspots by developing an algorithm to automatically detect and analyse rotating sunspots. This will be used to understand what causes them to rotate, and to determine to what extent rotating sunspots lead to solar flares and eruptions.\n\nThese solar eruptions release energetic particles into the heliosphere. We will simulate the motions of these solar energetic particles (SEPs) in order to study SEP transport from the Sun to the Earth. This will link into a study of the relation between solar eruptive events and SEP transport, which in turn will allow us to make more accurate predictions of space weather effects on the Earth.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M00760X/1","grantId":"ST/M00760X/1","fundValue":"315886","fundStart":"2015-04-01","fundEnd":"2018-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Stephen Brown","coPersons":["Silvia Carla Dalla"],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
