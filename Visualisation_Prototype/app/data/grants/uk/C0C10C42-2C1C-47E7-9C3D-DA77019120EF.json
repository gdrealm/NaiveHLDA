For example, some languages allow contrastive phrases to appear in sentence-initial position, as when one speaker corrects another: \\n\\n(1) Speaker A: Mary bought a new dress for Christmas.\\n Speaker B: No, you're wrong. A new SKIRT Mary bought for Christmas.\\n\\nIn this research project, we use experimental techniques to investigate sentences in which a phrase that contains 'old' information appears in an earlier position in the sentence than it normally would. This very local word-order alternation is exemplified in the Dutch examples below.\\n\\n(2a) Marie heeft gisteren het boek gekocht.\\n Mary has yesterday the book bought\\n\\n(2b) Marie heeft het boek gisteren gekocht.\\n Mary has the book yesterday bought\\n\\n 'Mary has bought the book yesterday.'\\n\\nIn (2a), where 'het boek' (the book) follows 'gisteren' (yesterday), this phrase is interpreted as new information, whereas the order in (2b) requires previous mention of 'the book' in the ongoing discourse.\\n\\nOur primary objective is to uncover empirical evidence that would allow us to choose between two competing analyses of the non-canonical order in (2b). \\n\\nAccording to the first analysis, (2b) is derived from (2a) by a so-called movement operation, which leaves behind an unpronounced copy of the moved constituent, as shown in (3), where '(het boek)' represents the unpronounced copy of the moved constituent '[het boek]':\\n\\n(3) Marie heeft [het boek] gisteren (het boek) gekocht.\\n\\nAccording to the second analysis, (2a) and (2b) are not related by movement, but differ in the way their basic structures are built. In particular, in (2a) 'het boek' combines with the verb to form a constituent after which 'gisteren' combines with that constituent to create a yet larger constituent, whereas in (2b) 'het boek' and 'gisteren' combine with the verb in the opposite order. On this second analysis, there is therefore no silent copy of 'het boek' between 'gisteren' and the verb. \\n\\nPrevious experiments with movement structures of the type illustrated in (1) have established that the creation of a silent copy of movement causes the moved phrase to be 'reactivated' in the hearer's mind. Such experiments are carefully designed to track the moment-by-moment steps in which the hearer constructs a mental representation of a sentence and can reliably identify the locus of a silent copy. In the present study, we make use of this technique to verify whether sentences like (2b) are formed by movement or not.\\n\\nWe supplement this study with a further paper-and-pencil questionnaire that probes the interpretion of sentences like (2b) when they contain so-called quantified phrases, such as 'every man' and 'every Tuesday'. Such quantified phrases interact with indefinites, such as 'a book', to yield ambiguity in sentences like 'John read a book every Tuesday', which may be interpreted as expressing either that John reads the same book every Tuesday, or that John reads a potentially different book every Tuesday. The two analyses of (2b) outlined above make different predictions about interactions of this type between the displaced constituent and the modifier to its right. The planned off-line experiments should therefore be able to provide additional evidence for one or the other analysis.\\n\\nThe results from these experiments will provide us with new types of data to extend and improve our existing knowledge of sentence structure in an area where purely theoretical work has reached a stalemate.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/I017763/1","grantId":"AH/I017763/1","fundValue":"95951","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Johannes  Van De Koot","coPersons":["Claudia  Felser"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
