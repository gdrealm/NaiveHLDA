The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. As one example of these techniques, we are often interested in studying what proteins are present in diseased cells and in what quantities, compared with normal cells, since the identity of the proteins may help us understand the overall disease process, and the search for new drug targets. The set of technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are called proteomics, as the complete set of proteins present in a given cell or sample of interest is described as the &quot;proteome&quot;. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS). MS is essentially a technique for calculating the molecular weight of molecules, and it can also provide information about the abundance of a given molecule in the sample. MS has been available for many decades, but recent years have seen huge strides in the ability to perform high-throughput workflows, studying tens of thousands of molecules in any given sample, and great advances in the instrument resolution, such that molecules of almost identical mass can be differentiated.\n\nThe majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins in the sample become broken up in a predictable manner into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. The set of peptides is then identified and often quantified across different conditions (e.g. disease versus healthy cells). We often know in advance that a peptide was derived from a specific parent protein, and so we can use the identity and quantification of that peptide as a proxy measure for the behaviour of the protein across our samples of interest, and as such these workflows are called &quot;bottom-up&quot;. However, while bottom-up studies dominate the field, they have a significant drawback. Proteins are molecules that tend to exist in multiple different, related forms in the cells, which have been called proteoforms. Proteins may become activated or deactivated by the addition/removal of one or more chemical groups, called post-translational modifications (PTMs). Many important diseases have been shown to be associated with dysfunction of PTMs, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Bottom-up studies have a severely limited ability to study these important proteoforms, since the small pieces of a protein (the peptides), cannot tell us which proteoform we are looking at, only that one of the many possible proteoforms is present. \n\nOur groups are pioneering techniques to study intact proteins by MS, in so-called top-down studies. Recent developments in MS instruments enable much larger molecules to be studied effectively, opening up the possibility to study each proteoform in the state in which it is present in the cell. However, MS produces very complex and often overlapping signals from closely related proteins, which are difficult to interpret. Software for identification and quantification of peptide signals from MS data has been developed for over twenty years, but research for interpreting protein-level data is quite limited. We specialise in developing software for proteomics and we are devising a new algorithm that, firstly, will simplify the complex MS data signal coming from the instrument, and secondly, will confidently identify the proteins present including all PTMs on the different proteoforms we detect. The software will help to advance the field of top-down proteomics, making this a more broadly accessible method, and thus improving our ability to study proteins in cells, for a wide range of applications.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L018462/1","grantId":"BB/L018462/1","fundValue":"110220","fundStart":"2014-07-01","fundEnd":"2015-11-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew Robert Jones","coPersons":["Claire Emma Eyers"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
