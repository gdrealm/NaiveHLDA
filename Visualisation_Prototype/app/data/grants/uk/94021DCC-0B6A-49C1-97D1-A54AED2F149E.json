{"id":"94021DCC-0B6A-49C1-97D1-A54AED2F149E","title":"Spinal inhibitory interneurons that suppress itch","abstractText":"Chronic itch is a distressing feature of many diseases, including conditions affecting the skin, kidneys and blood, as well as certain forms of cancer. It is also a side-effect of certain drugs, such as morphine. Although some types of itch respond to antihistamines, in many cases there are no satisfactory treatments available. At present we have very limited knowledge of the nerve circuits in the spinal cord and brain that transmit itch.\n\nPain can powerfully inhibit itch, which is why scratching produces temporary relief. This inhibition, which occurs in the spinal cord, involves a type of local nerve cell (interneuron) that is activated by painful stimuli and inhibits transmission of the itch signal to cells (known as projection neurons) that convey sensory information to the brain. A recently developed mutant mouse, which lacks a protein called bhlhb5, shows dramatically increased itching, resulting from loss of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. Interestingly, these &quot;bhlhb5 knockout&quot; mice respond normally to most types of painful stimulus, which suggests that the missing interneurons selectively inhibit itch, but not pain. However, because the knockout mouse loses these cells before birth, there may have been compensatory changes, leading to relatively normal pain sensation. One of the main problems with understanding how sensory information is processed in the spinal cord is that there are many different populations of inhibitory interneurons, each with different functions. We have recently found that several populations can be recognised on the basis of the different substances that they contain. In preliminary studies, we have identified two populations that are largely absent from the Bhlhb5 knockout mouse, and it is likely that one or both of these is responsible for the inhibition of itch by painful stimuli.\n\nIn this project we will test whether one of these populations is responsible for the suppression of itch by pain, and attempt to identify the pathway that underlies this phenomenon. We will initially determine whether the loss of nerve cells is restricted to the two populations we have identified by staining spinal cords from normal and bhlhb5 knockout mice with markers to reveal these cells and all other types of inhibitory interneuron. If these interneurons are responsible for preventing itch, then blocking their activity in normal adult mice should increase itch. We will use two different approaches to test this. First, we will inject a chemical to destroy a relatively large number of inhibitory interneurons, including all of those that are absent in the knockout mice. We will then use a more selective genetic method to destroy or inactivate one of these populations. By examining the responses of these mice to stimuli that normally cause itch or pain, we will improve our understanding of the roles played by these different populations of inhibitory interneurons. We will then investigate the underlying nerve circuits by identifying projection neurons that are activated by itch-inducing stimuli in normal and Bhlhb5 knockout mice. We will test the prediction that one of the populations of inhibitory interneurons that is lost in the knockout mice acts directly on projection neurons that signal itch. Although most pain tests are normal in the knockout mouse, these animals do show an increased response following injection of formalin into the skin. We have identified a type of projection neuron that loses much of its normal inhibitory input in the bhlhb5 knockout mouse, and we will test whether these cells are involved in the abnormal response to formalin.\n\nThe project will provide valuable insight into the organisation of nerve pathways in the spinal cord that transmit and modify sensory information. This will improve our understanding of pathological itch and pain states, and should help towards the identification of targets for new treatments for these conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/L003430/1","grantId":"MR/L003430/1","fundValue":"438890","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrew J Todd","coPersons":["John Stephen Riddell"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
