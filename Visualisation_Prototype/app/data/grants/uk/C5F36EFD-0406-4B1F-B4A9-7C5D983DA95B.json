The migration of these plates across the surface of the planet is directly linked to major geologic events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In some regions, two plates collide, forcing one beneath the other in a process called 'subduction'. Subduction zones are responsible for much of the explosive volcanism on Earth, including the infamous Pacific &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Why and how plate subduction starts is a matter of much debate. \n\nIODP Expedition 352 to the Bonin forearc (in the 'ring of fire') aims to recover lavas from the time period when subduction was just starting in the region. These lavas may hold the key to understanding what drives subduction initiation. Furthermore, the chemical changes recorded in the lavas may document how a subduction system evolves through time.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M010643/1","grantId":"NE/M010643/1","fundValue":"21804","fundStart":"2015-03-12","fundEnd":"2015-09-11","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Julie  Prytulak","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
