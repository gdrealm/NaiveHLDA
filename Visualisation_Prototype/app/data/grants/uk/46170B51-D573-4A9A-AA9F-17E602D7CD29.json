This technology is based on well-established biological mechanisms employed by the cell to achieve regulated removal of unwanted proteins. This regulated degradation is mediated by the attachment of degradation signals to the target. Some proteins (degrons), identified in yeast, can induce attachment of these signals to themselves when their structure is disrupted at higher temperatures, thus inducing degradation of themselves and any fusion proteins that they are part of. We and others have successfully shown proof-of-principle that the system can be used in a more complex model organism, Drosophila (fruitfly). However, the temperatures at which degradation of the target is induced in yeast are not well-tolerated by Drosophila, or by other 'cold-blooded' organisms. Therefore, we propose to isolate novel variants of the yeast degron signal, that work better in the normal temperature ranges of Drosophila and of other model organisms widely used by biologists, and to test these in cultured Drosophila cells and in genetically manipulated flies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D019699/1","grantId":"BB/D019699/1","fundValue":"105348","fundStart":"2006-06-01","fundEnd":"2008-01-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Cahir  O'Kane","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":" 1. A random mutagenesis of the Ubc4 component of a Ura3::Ubc4 fusion generated a number of yeast colonies resistant to the suicide substrate 5-FOA; however, none of these turned out to be convincing uracil auxotrophs.\n\n\n\n2. Secondary structure predictions of Ubc4 identified a small number of residues in contact with each other, mutation of which is predicted to affect stability of Ubc4 protein. A PCR library of mutations at two of these residues was generated in preparation for CD analysis of secondary structure.\n\n\n\n3. As a further strategy for achieving functional knockdown of gene function, we initiated characterisation of a phenomenon that we identified fortuitously, of efficient knockdown of a Drosophila macrophage-like line, by phagocytosis of dsRNA-expressing bacteria. This was subsequently published as Rocha et al (2011). Gene knockdown by dsRNA-expressing bacteria could potentially be used for knockdown by renewable libraries of dsRNA Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
