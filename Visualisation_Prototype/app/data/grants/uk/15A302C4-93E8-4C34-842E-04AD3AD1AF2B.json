We posit that one source of variation might be the difference in elicitation methods considered.</p> \n<p>The objective of this project is to evaluate the relative performance of various incentive compatible elicitation methods of time preferences for monetary outcomes, with the aim of providing guidance to the pitfalls of competing time preference elicitation techniques.

This paper (a nominated output for this research), is being received positively, and is published in P. Anand, P. Pattanaik and C. Puppe, eds., Handbook of\n\nRational and Social Choice, Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n\nWe have also engaged in experimental work, focussing on the more widely used elicitation methods. The first is the Multiple Price List (MPL), currently the accepted 'gold standard' for preference elicitation in the time domain. In addition, the so called BDM and the 'sealed bid auction' are the most widely relied upon methods to elicit 'home-grown' values in the goods domain. The BDM has been used in this domain only twice before (once by one of us), and in a paper of these methods for the time domain.\n\nAll these elicitation methods are 'strategically equivalent': from a decision theoretic point\n\nof view there is no difference between them, and a 'rational' decision maker is expected\n\nto behave in the same way in all of them, the differences being simply ones of framing of\n\nthe problem. Contrary to this benchmark expectation, we find that the methods do\n\ndiffer. First of all, our statistical analysis shows that the money discount rate elicited with\n\nthe Tables method tends to be smaller than those elicited with the other methods. These\n\nresults also suggest that changing the stakes does have an effect. The effect of an increase in the stake is to increase the money discount factor for the MPL method (this effect, called 'magnitude effect) has been observed in previous studies using non-incentive compatible methods). However, the magnitude effect is reversed for the other two methods. This reversal appears larger in the case of Auctions: this is interesting, as not only Auctions are strategically equivalent to the other methods, but in the lab they have also been implemented with instructions and layout extremely close to that for the BDM, which is in general a harder mechanism to understand. It suggests that elicitation within a competitive frame (auction) and large stakes makes subjects more willing to give up more in order to anticipate receipt of their rewards, i.e. it makes them more impatient.\n\nSimilarly, it can't be argued that it is the Auction experiment implementation that was\n\nhard for subjects to understand, as exactly the same design was used for small stakes\n\nauctions. Unlike the high stakes auctions, though, the proportion of subjects with a zero\n\ndiscount factor in small stakes auctions is in line with those with all other methods.\n\nFinally, we cannot conclude that those subjects with a zero discount factor did not\n\nunderstand the instructions, as we have a positive percentage of people with such\n\nimpossibly low discount rates also when the Tables method is used, which is the most\n\nstraightforward to understand.\n\nIn summary, our preliminary results show that the MPL method elicits lower money\n\ndiscount factors that alternative methods we have investigated. Since the estimation of\n\ndiscount factors depends on the reliability of the time preference elicitation method, we\n\nhope that our contribution will open up further lines of research in the investigation of\n\nthe relative merits of elicitation techniques other than the (so far standard) multiple price\n\nlist format.
