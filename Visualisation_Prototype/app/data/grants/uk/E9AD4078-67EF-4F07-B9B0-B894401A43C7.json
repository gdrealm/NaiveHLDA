However, survey data typically differ from other data sets in three main aspects: </p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Observations are often intra-cluster correlated due to the use of multi-stage cluster samples;</li>\n\n <li>Sample units are often selected with unequal probabilities which could be related to the outcome variable, in which case the model holding for the sample is different from the model holding in the population;</li>\n\n <li>Survey data are subject to non-response, which may distort the population model if the propensity to respond is correlated with the outcome. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The purpose of this research is to provide researchers and practitioners clear guidance on which approaches they can use for modelling different survey data sets, how they should be implemented, inference possibilities, software availability, and where more than one approach is feasible, to discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of one approach over the others for specific applications. Diagnostic procedures for assessing the goodness of fit of models under the various approaches and for comparing between the approaches shall also be developed. Simulations and three large real data sets will be used for illustrations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H022759/1","grantId":"ES/H022759/1","fundValue":"229284","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Danny  Pfeffermann","coPersons":["David John Holmes","Pedro Luis Nascimento Silva","Patrick  Sturgis"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
