In contrast, relatively little is known about the types of innovation that occur in peripheral, sparsely populated areas.</p>\n\n<p>This research examines how innovation in some sectors may be stimulated by aspects of peripherality. For example, access to natural resources may generate innovation in sectors such as tourism, food processing or renewable energies. Similarly, the constraints of remoteness may promote the development of new methods for overcoming the difficulties and high cost of delivering services in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>A further focus is on the kinds of interactions that underpin innovation in peripheral areas, where linkss are likely to be national or international rather than local. Other aspects to be investigated include the influence of external market and policy factors on innovation in peripheral areas, as well as the effectiveness of policy support for innovation in such areas.</p>\n\n<p>The project involves interviews with policy-makers and business organisations in peripheral areas in the UK and other European countries, as well as a practitioner workshop and an academic seminar aimed at developing further research ideas.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-598-25-0023","grantId":"RES-598-25-0023","fundValue":"39194","fundStart":"2009-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sara Sian  Davies","coPersons":["Jillian  MacBryde"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" Innovation in peripheral, sparsely populated regions is shaped by specific factors relating to regional sectoral structure and the broader regional context for business activity and innovation. The sectoral structure of peripheral regions is shaped by the availability of natural resources and by the additional costs of importing inputs and exporting products and services, so that there tends to be a stronger predominance of sectors such as food/drink, renewable energies and tourism, and a lower share of some types of manufacturing and producer services. The broader context for business activity and innovation depends on the extent and type of public investment in e.g. connectivity (transport/broadband infrastructure and also human networking), higher education and research facilities, and access to business finance.
