{"id":"D12ECA88-3F42-44FF-AFBB-4071C742A9E3","title":"Designed Peptide Gels for 3D Cell Culture","abstractText":"Expectations for biomaterials are enormous, with great hope not only for improved medical devices and enhanced quality of life, but also in rationalising drug discovery and pharmaceutical development. We have recently focused on developing simple, cheap, yet functional peptide materials for 3D cell-culture, ultimately towards long-term applications in regenerative medicine. Using rational design to match specific requirements of a range of cell types, we have been able to apply these biomaterials in three dimensional (3D) cell culture in vitro. The proposed project will enable us to eliminate user variance and undertake independent evaluation trials of these gels with leading academic and commercial partners, prior to launch of a new commercial product for the in vitro cell culture market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G005877/1","grantId":"EP/G005877/1","fundValue":"109022","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Rein  Ulijn","coPersons":["Julie  Gough"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
