{"id":"F0B7B8E6-EBDB-4497-BCE1-0802DC6F87CC","title":"Roles of a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase in steroid receptor function","abstractText":"Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, but their use is limited by side effects, which include fat deposits and impaired use of blood sugar. The protein within tissues, which binds the glucocorticoids is the glucocorticoid receptor, but its interactions with other proteins and how the glucocortcoid receptor complexes regulate cell function are incompletely understood. My recent research has shown that a protein phosphatase, called Ppp5, which removes phosphate from proteins, may be crucial for the normal function of the glucocorticoid receptor in vivo. The aims of this project are to employ tissues from a mouse model that I have made in which Ppp5 does not work. This new mouse line provides an important and unique opportunity to understand how Ppp5 controls the body's response to glucocorticoids.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901221","grantId":"G0901221","fundValue":"325572","fundStart":"2010-07-26","fundEnd":"2013-07-25","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Tricia  Cohen","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Dundee","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
