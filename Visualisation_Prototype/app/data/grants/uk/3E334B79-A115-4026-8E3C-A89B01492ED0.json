Communication and trust issues are routinely cited as the most important aspects of project success, thus it can be hypothesised that an important reason for failure may be the complexity that arises from social interactions within project environments.</p>\n\n<p>This research intends to investigate the propagation of commitment and trust through the social networks in software implementations. In particular, an aim is to understand the role that trust (or lack of) between project team members plays in the successful completion of large software implementation projects, involving multiple vendors distributed over multiple geographies and time zones.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with professional project managers from IT consulting firms. The data will be analysed using both qualitative and computational modelling approaches, including the generation of a network map of social relationships, to test the propagation of commitment and trust along the network. It is envisaged that experimentation on the network map will provide insight into the robustness and fragility of social interactions within large software implementations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002612/1","grantId":"ES/L002612/1","fundValue":"50609","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Alun  Williams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":" &quot;not applicable this year&quot; &quot;not applicable this year&quot; Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
