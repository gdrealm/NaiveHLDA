{"id":"AD44AEDB-79AF-4F2E-8F02-BE447B80DA8B","title":"Managerial storytelling in practice: Dynamics and implications","abstractText":"<p>Storytelling in managerial practice is of contemporary interest to organisational scholars, managers and management consultants. The underlying assumption is that storytelling is an effective means of communication. The role and purpose of spontaneous organisational stories has been researched, but the dynamics of purposive managerial storytelling, its implications on the firm and its limits in daily practice are largely unknown. Recent claims of the power and effectiveness of purposive storytelling in managerial practice may therefore be inflated. This research investigates the use of storytelling in managerial practice as well as its effectiveness and appropriateness in a comparative case study design. The focus is on the use of stories in two UK service organisations, one of which uses storytelling explicitly and one of which does not, in order to establish whether and how coal-face practice differs. The main data collection method of this qualitative, interpretive and inductive study is in-depth interviewing to investigate managerial motives and techniques as well as employee perceptions and reactions. This research will provide a framework for understanding the use of managerial storytelling and will further the current knowledge base by revealing the dynamics and limits of storytelling in managerial practice.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F001738/1","grantId":"ES/F001738/1","fundValue":"39265","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The main non-academic impact of the project has been better understanding of both potential and limitations of purposive storytelling among practitioners. Two professionals have reported a direct impact of the research on their practice. \n\n(1) MELANIE FRANKLIN, MALVERN TRAINING Following the first practitioner workshop, Melanie Franklin has been able to validate storytelling as a communication tool and help an international law firm improve external communication. Specifically, she developed a seven-stage storytelling process to structure her clients' engagement with the story that they seek to tell. Melanie explained in a telephone interview in September 2012 that her work helped the client organisation develop and maintain its customer base. She has since used the same process with other clients. \n\n(2) DARRYL WARDEN, BT SOUTH TYNESIDE Following preliminary reports, Darryl Warden explained how the research has enabled him to understand and express the value of storytelling in managing organisational change. The association of story with a continuing journey towards a better future has had a two-fold benefit for his professional practice. Firstly, talking about an improved future state that the organisation is creating in terms of story allows a conversation among organisational actors about what is happening in the organisation in a more constructive way. Rather than getting unsettled about difficulties, his fellow employees accepted that, metaphorically speaking, most journeys have bumpy stretches and that their current difficulties can and will be overcome. Secondly, when Darryl was asked to talk about the change story of his organisation to a different one, he was able to focus on organisational actors' experiences with change and to present it in such a way that engaged his audience. During a follow-up interview in September 2012, Darryl explained that he has received positive feedback from the organisation in question, of which the PI has a copy.

It sought to understand how and when managers employ storytelling purposively and how employees perceive and react to it. The research was set in two organisations based in England, one of which employs storytelling purposively and one of which does not, to identify if and how grass-root management practice varies. Data were collected through qualitative interviews with managers and employees from both case organisations as well as independent experts and analysed inductively identifying key themes from within the data with an aim to build theory.\n\nThe research has found that:\n\n1. storytelling can be used purposively by managers to achieve a variety of outcomes at the strategic, operational or interpersonal level of the organisation. While purposive storytelling has significant potential to enrich management communication, there is also a risk of cynical reactions by the audience if words are not supported by actions or the wider teller-audience relationship;\n2. spontaneous storytelling is a means of everyday communication and therefore stronger and more prevalent than purposive storytelling. It emerges out of interaction with others and is specifically tailored to meet the audience's needs, such as building professional relationships with other organisational actors and supporting organisational actors' professional development;\n3. the effectiveness of purposive storytelling is mediated by the teller-audience relationship (particularly audience perceptions of credibility and trust) as well as timing and context of the storytelling performance. The findings can be reinterpreted by other scholars to provide differing perspectives on storytelling in management practice. The full data set is available via the UK Data Service. \n\nThe findings can be used by management practitioners to enhance their communicative practice. An impact acceleration project is in planning. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
