The number of cattle infected with bTB has been increasing year on year by 18%, which leads to serious losses for affected farms due to the slaughter of infected animals and the imposition of cattle movement restrictions. Government spending on disease surveillance and compensation to farmers has also been following this upward trend, with spending over 2004-2012 expected to top &pound;1 billion. From these statistics it is clear that the current disease control strategy is not working, yet the reasons for this are not obvious. One possibility is that new forms of the causative agent of bTB, Mycobacterium bovis, have evolved in GB that are able to circumvent the current control measures. Research by the VLA has found that evidence for this latter scenario is supported by the presence of a range of different types of M. bovis circulating in GB that seem to be successful in spreading around the country from their original place of isolation. This proposal sets out to determine whether these diverse types of M. bovis interact with the immune system of cattle in different ways, and so explain their success. To achieve this we will take advantage of the recent availability of the complete DNA sequences of both M. bovis and the bovine host. This will allow us to explore how the host and pathogen interact with each other at the level of individual molecules, and to build up a more detailed picture of how M. bovis causes disease in cattle. The information coming from this project will help government policy makers to develop new control strategies based on the exploitation of epidemiological information, and offers the chance to stop the upward spiral of bTB disease burden and linked expenditure in GB.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E018491/1","grantId":"BB/E018491/1","fundValue":"318666","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen Vincent Gordon","coPersons":["Glyn  Hewinson"],"organisation":"Animal Health & Veterinary Lab Agency","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
