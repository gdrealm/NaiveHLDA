{"id":"D8034C00-E753-4DAC-B0F8-C6B3E151AF1C","title":"Sub-Contracting Risk: Neoliberal Policy Agendas and the Changing Nature of Flood Risk Management","abstractText":"This project explores how our understanding of flood risk in the UK has changed over the past 60 years, and the causes and consequences of the fragmentation of flood risk management. In exploring these issues the project explores changing attitudes to flood risk in Hull, from the 1953 east coast floods through to the present, including the aftermath of the 2007 Hull flood event.\n<br />\n<br />Crucially, privatisation and the contracting out of water management and local government services have altered the manner in which flood risk issues are addressed. This has seen a shift away from retaining local knowledge and the build-up of local expertise in favour of alternative forms of management procedures, oriented instead to global &quot;best practice&quot; and achieving flexibility and cost effectiveness. The research will critically explore the evolving rationales in both past and contemporary flood risk management and infrastructure investment, analysing how this reflects changing ideas about risk, about the public good, and about the roles of the individual, the state and private investors.\n<br />\n<br />Outcomes of the research include a better understanding of failings around the Hull 2007 flood event, contributing to ensuring that better governance arrangements are instituted for the future.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3070","grantId":"RES-000-22-3070","fundValue":"75480","fundStart":"2008-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Graham Francis Haughton","coPersons":["Thomas James Coulthard","Gregory Edward Bankoff"],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
