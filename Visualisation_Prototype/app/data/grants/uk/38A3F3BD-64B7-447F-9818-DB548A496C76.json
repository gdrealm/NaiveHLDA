This well documented operator dependence of quality can lead to\nmisdiagnosis; unnecessary referrals to other imaging modalities; rescans; and results in inefficiencies in clinical workflow\nwith associated added healthcare costs.\nIn order to avoid the resultant delayed or incorrect stratification, sonographers are encouraged to follow standardised\nacquisition protocol guidelines. Clinical studies show the benefit of this. However, no systematic image reviews are\nundertaken. This lack of standardization and monitoring of conformance has implications for the quality of diagnosis and\nclinical decisions made in a health service, and is also a key barrier to wider adoption of US as a cost-effective technology\nfor stratified medicine.\nIn a collaboration between Intelligent Ultrasound Ltd and Oxford University, the AQABUS project proposes to develop and\nevaluate a technology platform for automated quality assessment of US scans. The solution will be delivered as a Quality\nAssurance Service (QAS) to imaging departments, to assess whether scans are fit for purpose. Innovations include\ncreation of the IT infrastructure for delivering such a service; clinical design of QA reporting; and machine learning to\nautomate image QA which is key to the business proposition.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505316/1","grantId":"EP/L505316/1","fundValue":"347905","fundStart":"2014-03-31","fundEnd":"2016-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Noble","coPersons":["Aris Theodosis Papageorghiou"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" Project yet to reach key findings stage.
