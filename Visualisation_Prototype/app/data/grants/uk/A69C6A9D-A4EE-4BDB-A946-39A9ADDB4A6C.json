Infections are common in hospitals where patients treated with antibiotics are susceptible to infection with C. difficile. Infections are difficult to treat and there is no vaccine. The bacterium colonises the gut for many weeks, but how this is achieved is not known. We will use bacteria altered in defined ways to identify the components of the bacterial cell that are required for colonisation. This will be done by infecting mice with the mutant bacteria and analysing how the infection proceeds. We will take the important parts of the bacterium and use them to construct vaccines which we will test in the mouse infection model. Thus the work will not only increase our scientific knowledge of this important pathogen but may be the first stage in development of an effective vaccine against C. difficile disease","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1001721","grantId":"G1001721","fundValue":"569307","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Neil  Fairweather","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
