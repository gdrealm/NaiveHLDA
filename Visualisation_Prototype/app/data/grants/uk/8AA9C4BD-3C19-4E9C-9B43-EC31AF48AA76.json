This will be achieved through research into programme evaluation methods, a range of training and capacity building activities, and a set of substantive applications which will serve as exemplars in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The work of the node will be organised around 5 projects: a Reassessment of the ERA, Improving Inference for Policy Evaluation, Control Functions in Policy Evaluation, Combining Quasi-experimental Methods with Dynamic Behavioural Models, Social Networks and Programme Evaluation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Beneficiaries will include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>researchers who undertake programme evaluations</li>\n\n <li>policy-makers who commission and interpret evaluations</li>\n\n <li>those interested in the labour market</li>\n\n <li>education and health policies that we will study in our substantive applications</li>\n\n <li>&nbsp;the public, who will benefit as the techniques developed and promoted by this Node lead to better policies.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I02574X/1","grantId":"ES/I02574X/1","fundValue":"1539340","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mike  BrewerLorraine Margaret Dearden","coPersons":["Hamish Wallace Low","Constantine Hector Meghir","Adam Michael Rosen","Monica Costa Dias","Andrew Douglas Chesher","Richard  Blundell","Thomas Fraser Crossley","Imran  Rasul","Barbara  Sianesi"],"organisation":"Institute for Fiscal Studies","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
