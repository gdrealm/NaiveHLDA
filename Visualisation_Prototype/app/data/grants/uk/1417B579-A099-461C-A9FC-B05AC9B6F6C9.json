This places an extraordinary burden on the NHS, informal carers and the wider economy. Consequently, ‘expert patient’ initiatives (ie, managing one’s own illness through self-care) have emerged in efforts to make health care more cost-efficient and to improve health. Greater participation in self-care may help to increase patient’s confidence in managing their condition and their overall well-being. These beneficial outcomes stress the importance of providing information in an effective manner so that patients can understand it and apply the knowledge to help manage their condition more effectively.</p> \n<p>Poor communication and lack of understanding are key barriers to patients becoming active in their care. It is widely acknowledged that there is not a lack of information about healthy lifestyles but rather the manner of communication of risk and the level of support for lifestyle change often need improvement. This seminar series brings multi-disciplinary researchers and health care professionals together to examine effective mechanisms of engaging patients in self-care, while considering that barriers and inequalities may exist. These seminars will also address any gaps that exist between patients and health providers.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4310","grantId":"RES-451-25-4310","fundValue":"6132","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sally  LindsayPaul  Bellaby","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Salford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
