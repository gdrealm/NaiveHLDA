{"id":"82F6121E-40A2-4580-9BF2-E380794697A0","title":"Investigating the Power Density of Power Electronics","abstractText":"The power density of power electronics is defined by the power processed in a given volume or mass of converter (volumetric and gravimetric power densities respectively) where the converter is normally defined as the combination of power semiconductor devices, the input and output filters, the thermal management system and control electronics that together provide an interface between two or more electrical systems. \n\nThe power density of power electronics is an important consideration in modern engineering systems as in many applications it has become attractive to use electrical power distribution and actuation in place of mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic systems to reduce overall system mass and complexity, along with improving efficiency and reliability. An understanding of the future capabilities of power electronics as well as the bottlenecks limiting increases in performance of power electronic systems will enable the UK to play a leading role in the development and application of this key technology. \n\nDesigning a converter is a complex engineering task that balances many interacting pressures: A designer must select from a range of possible designs and technologies, finding the optimal allocation of mass and volume for each component and within each component whilst meeting electrical and thermal specifications. It the hypothesis of this proposal that in order to reach a true power density optimum, the design process must consider system-wide electrical, mechanical and thermal problems simultaneously: It is not enough to design each component individually based on their electrical specification alone. \n\nThis research project will produce software that will optimise the power density of a converter subject to a particular electrical and thermal specification by considering all major aspects of the design under a global electrical, mechanical and thermal optimisation framework. By formulating a set of strict rules governing the design and placement of each component within the converter, the effect of basic design decisions and fundamental material properties on the overall power density of a converter can be explored.\nThe project will provide industry and academia with reliable and justified figures for best-in-class power density achievable now and into the future, identify technology bottlenecks into which application of additional resources bring large improvements in achievable power density, illustrate explicitly important trade-offs in modern converter design and provide converter optimisation tools that can be used and extended by academia and industry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K032984/1","grantId":"EP/K032984/1","fundValue":"100395","fundStart":"2013-09-30","fundEnd":"2015-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel James Rogers","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" To-date we have developed thermal and electrical models of two sub-systems of a power electronic converter (the output filter and toroidal inductor). We have also begun development of an overall optimization framework that will link our sub-system models to produce overall converter designs. We have an ongoing engagement with industry, including Rolls Royce, Microsemi and IMV Japan. We will be holding a progress meeting in early December.
