{"id":"5A420687-4F9E-4957-8ED9-BB1E3A90BCA4","title":"The collagen binding integrins: structure and regulation","abstractText":"Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body which provides structural support in connective tissue. Collagen binds to many other proteins, including cell-surface receptors. Important collagen receptors include four members of a family of called integrins, which can bind collagen only when the cell is activated, not at rest. The integrins change shape and can then form tight links with specific regions of collagen. We will synthesise and identify those collagen fragments that interact selectively with the four integrins, alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, alpha10beta1 and alpha11beta1. This will indicate the role of these different integrins in different tissues, where different collagen types may occur. We will investigate changes that occur in the receptor as it is activated, by making purified receptor and studying its structure crystallographically. Specifically, we will make the fragment of the receptor known as its I-domain in different forms and examine their ability to bind collagen, so identifying the active form needed to bind collagen. We will examine the ability of the different integrin-binding collagen fragments to support cell adhesion in a variety of experimental model systems that will give insight into disease processes including thrombosis, tumour cell invasion and wound healing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500707","grantId":"G0500707","fundValue":"880708","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard William Farndale","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
