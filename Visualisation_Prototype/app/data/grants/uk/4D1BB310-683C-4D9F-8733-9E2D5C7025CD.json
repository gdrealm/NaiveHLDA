Using longitudinal studies from the UK, Finland, France and Sweden, the research questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Do cumulative good (in addition to recent) working conditions promote extending working lives?</li>\n\n <li>What impact do modifiable lifetime health behaviours have on working lives?</li>\n\n <li>Do family factors including partnership and fertility histories relate to extended working lives and are they mediated or moderated by workplace predictors?</li>\n\n <li>What are the individual workplace factors that enable people to remain in work if they have a chronic health condition? Or if they are caring for ill family or grandchildren?</li>\n\n <li>Are there differences in how workplace, family factors and chronic health conditions influence extending working lives by gender, socioeconomic background, birth cohort or country?</li>\n\n <li>Are there local area characteristics, for example related to the local labour market structure, that promote extended working lives and does their impact differ for workers with low skills or poor health?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L002892/1","grantId":"ES/L002892/1","fundValue":"1000280","fundStart":"2014-03-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jennifer Anne Head","coPersons":["Stephen  Stansfeld","Hugo  Westerlund","Charlotte Elizabeth Clark","Paola  Zaninotto","Kristina  Alexanderson","Mai  Stafford","Diana Jane Kuh","Nicola Jane Shelton","Gareth Edward Hagger-Johnson"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
