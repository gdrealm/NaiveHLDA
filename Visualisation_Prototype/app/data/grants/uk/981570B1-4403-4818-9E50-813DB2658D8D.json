This is because it directly governs the progress of medical imaging and therapeutics for advancing the frontiers of research for improved healthcare. At UCL we have invented new multi-needle, multi-stage electrically-driven devices which can operate simply using applied voltage and flow rate control. These devices, already patented and the work was awarded the 2010 Venture Prize (&pound;25k), are robust and economical and products are made in high yield (several millions a minute). The products are also better controlled and can be made to have unique structural compartments which allow special therapeutic benefits. The work in this follow-on project will concentrate on specific products and process variables so that characterised marketable products can be made in large quantities and their manufacture exploited by putting together a business plan, marketing and licensing opportunities.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01334X/1","grantId":"EP/J01334X/1","fundValue":"99102","fundStart":"2012-09-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Used to generate commercially viable processes and win further funding from EPSRC for a multi-disciplinary project (EP/L026287/1 ) which started in September 2014.

Optimised particles were shown to be spherical with an average size ranging from 320 nm (? 80 nm) to 220 (? 8 nm), which varied with achange in the processing conditions. The surface and internal structure and morphology studies confirmed the presence of a triple-layer structure. The choice of the polymers also had a profound effect on the production of the final structures. The combinations of the three polymers in particles were found to be non-cytotoxic as cytotoxicity was shown to be negligible in an in vitro assay. The ability to fabricate such multilayered particles in a single step, under ambient conditions has considerable potential for a range of applications in particular controlled release drug delivery [1].\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Preparation of novel two-layered capsules containing antibiotics using coaxial electrohydrodynamic technique.\n\n\n\nOutcomes: The polymeric capsules were successfully prepared as a potential future product that could be infused directly into the bladder [2]. Gentamicin was encapsulated inside a polymeric carrier of polymethylsilsesquioxane and killed Enterococcus faecalis, a common chronic uropathogen, in vitro in a dose-responsive, slow-release manner. These results suggest that such antibiotic capsules could prove useful in the treatment of recalcitrant UTI. \n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Preparation of particles (nanoscale) and fibers (micron size) using electrohydrodynamic process in conjunction with a four-needle device for the first time.\n\n\n\nOutcomes: A four needle system is applied for the first time to prepare quatra-layered structures by altering solution properties. The technique/process has shown to be successful by using a range of characterization techniques including transmission and scanning electron microscope (TEM and SEM) combined with focused ion beam milling in addition to the use of confocal microscope. Layers consist of PMSQ, PCL, PLGA and PEG polymers at various concentrations. The viscosity of the solution was increased from particle to fiber formation. This increase in viscosity meant that the processing parameters had to vary from particle to fiber formation such that flow rates and voltage were both higher during processing of fibers. In addition, recent dye release studies look very promising in terms of confirmation of the presence of four-layers. The flexibility of CEHDA means that such capsules could be further optimized for a variety of desired parameters\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: The main focus of this study was to bring about a different way of treating bone disease by the application of tri-layered particle system. The tri-layered system was applied to prepare multi-component system by the application of EHD processing. \n\n\n\nOutcomes: For this study, SEM, TEM, inductive coupled plasma (ICP) and UV-Vis techniques were applied to fully characterize the particles and to show their most suitable medical applications. Within the particles a tricalcium phosphate lies in the core with a polymeric shell (PEG) containing a bone disease treating drug of alendronate and a further outermost polymeric shell (PLGA) for holding the whole structure together. Particles were found to be in around 400 nm in size. The drug release studies conducted using UV-vis showed that on the first day almost all drug is released. This is followed by a release of Ca and P over time, suggesting degradation of TCP over time. It was also found that apatite formation does occur in simulated body fluid (SBF) following the release of ions from the tri-layered structures. These findings contribute significantly to the treatment of various bone diseases and/or defects. For economic growth (manufacturing, innovation), healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
