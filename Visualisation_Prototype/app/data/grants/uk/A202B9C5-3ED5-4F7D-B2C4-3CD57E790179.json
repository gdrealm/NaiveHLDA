It will identify the key factors accounting for the electoral decline of opposition parties in Russia since 1999 and will draw conclusions on the future prospects for opposition forces. In doing so the research will focus on the key obstacles facing Russian opposition parties and the strategies they adopt in order to challenge the pro-regime parties.</p>\n\n<p>In order to conceptualise the conditions in which opposition parties in Russia operate and which determine the type of strategies they adopt, the research will utilise the concept of one-party dominant regimes as an analytical and conceptual framework.</p>\n\n<p>The research will be based on elite interviews with key opposition actors, specifically with those involved in the planning of electoral strategy and formation of party policies, and also with activists on the ground</p>\n\n<p>If democratic consolidation is to take place in Russia then it is crucial that opposition parties exist and are able not only to aggregate interests and channel opinion but also provide a viable alternative to those in power. The research will, therefore, not only draw conclusions about the state of opposition in Russia today but will also tell us much about the nature of Russian democracy.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/G010730/1","grantId":"ES/G010730/1","fundValue":"40116","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2011-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David John White","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
