{"id":"ED04FA8E-111D-48D9-BD89-E4A44DF203D0","title":"Low Cost Solution Processed CIGS Solar Cells","abstractText":"The market for photovoltaic (PV) modules has grown at 35 % p.a. compound over the past 15 years and will exceed 50\nGW in 2014. The drivers behind this extraordinary growth include the rising cost of fossil fuels, concerns over security of\nenergy supplies and worries over climate change. Governments agencies world wide, including the DECC in the UK, are\nencouraging the deployment of PV through incentives. However as the cost of PV reduces many important regions are now\nat &quot;grid parity&quot; which removes the need for subsidies. At this point the market for PV is expected to rocket. This project will\ndevelop a new solution processed thin film photovoltaic (PV) device from a nanoparticle precursor, which offers a cheaper\nroute to producing PV modules. The aim of the project will be to integrate technologies developed by the project partners,\nto improve the efficiency of small area solar cells, then to scale the technology to mini-module dimensions, while\nmaintaining a focus on reducing the cost of the process. The application of the technology to flexible substrates will also be\nassessed. Lower cost processing of modules will develop a lucrative business for CIGS nanoparticle inks and even\ngreater growth of solar energy deployment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/N508457/1","grantId":"EP/N508457/1","fundValue":"206293","fundStart":"2015-07-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Mike Walls","coPersons":["Jake  Bowers"],"organisation":"Loughborough University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
