Such a transformation has particularly significant implications for women who in such welfare states have previously demonstrated low levels of employment and high dependence on a male breadwinner.</p>\n\n<p>This project assesses the degree of influence that women are able to exercise on the current phase of welfare reform in the UK. It identifies examples of concrete policy reforms which aim to </p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Encourage adults into employment;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Make work pay and<br /></li>\n\n <li>Support adults in their roles as carers and workers. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact of women's policy advocates on these reforms is assessed by comparing the gendered discourse of the policy outcome with that of key policy actors who influence welfare policy. The impact is established through an analysis of official documents and interviews with government officials, members of parliament, representatives of business and labour and organisations which promote gender equality, such as the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Fawcett Society.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1615","grantId":"RES-000-22-1615","fundValue":"48753","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-08-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Claire  Annesley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
