We hope to be able to generalise the previously obtained results of this type to new important classes of linkages. \n\nAs part of this research we will also use the methods and results of applied algebraic topology to tackle a well-known classical topological problem known as the Whitehead conjecture. It was raised by J.H.C. Whitehead in 1941 and remains open despite multiple attempts of mathematicians. The Whitehead conjecture claims that a subcomplex of an aspherical 2-dimensional complex is also aspherical. \nOur recent results (2012) prove a probabilistic version of the conjecture. More precisely, we showed that aspherical 2-complexes produced randomly satisfy the Whitehead conjecture with probebility tending to one. In this research we shall try to exploit these probabilistic results hoping to obtain a full deterministic solution to the conjecture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L005719/2","grantId":"EP/L005719/2","fundValue":"236658","fundStart":"2014-12-06","fundEnd":"2017-06-05","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Farber","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
