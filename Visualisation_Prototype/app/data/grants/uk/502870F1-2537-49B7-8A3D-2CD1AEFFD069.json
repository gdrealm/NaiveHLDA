Memory relies on information storage in neurones of the brain. The purpose of this project is to understand the mechanisms of such storage in neurones that are responsible for visual recognition memory. Recognition memory allows us to know that we have seen something previously. We know that recognition memory depends upon the perirhinal cortex, part of the temporal lobe of the brain. Recognition memory mechanisms appear to be similar in rats and humans. Therefore by studying recognition memory mechanisms in rats we hope to better understand what happens in our own brains. We shall investigate how communication between neurones in perirhinal cortex is altered with recognition memory and learn about the cellular mechanisms that control these changes. We shall also investigate which genes are altered in perirhinal cortex as a consequence of recognition memory and allow information to be stored. The results from this study have the potential to impact on understanding mechanisms of learning and memory as well as to inform us about possible underlying causes of memory loss such as occurs in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0401403","grantId":"G0401403","fundValue":"1303130","fundStart":"2005-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Brown","coPersons":["James  Uney","Elizabeth Clea Warburton","Zafar Iqbal Bashir"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
