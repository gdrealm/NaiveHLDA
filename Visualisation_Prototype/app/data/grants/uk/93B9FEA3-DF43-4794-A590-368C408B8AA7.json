{"id":"93B9FEA3-DF43-4794-A590-368C408B8AA7","title":"The Prevalence and Effects of Performance-Related Pay in Britain","abstractText":"<p>This study investigates the incidence and effects of performance-related pay (PRP) in Britain using the latest available firm-level data and data linking employees to firms. The firm-only data come from the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS). The linked employer-employee data are the Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2011 (WERS); and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) linked to the Business Structure Database (BSD). WERS, ASHE and the MWSS will be linked to the Annual Respondents' Database (ARD to obtain measures of firm performance. The study will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>&nbsp;explore the reasons for the incidence and growth of PRP in Britain</li>\n\n <li>establish the relationship between PRP and firm performance</li>\n\n <li>consider PRP's impact on wages and the wage distribution.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The findings will be of value to firms seeking a competitive advantage through changes to their compensation structures. Results will interest policy makers who have promoted employee financial participation via tax breaks, and those concerned with the distribution of rewards from employment.This policy interest has heightened recently with public concerns about the role of bonuses in contributing to both the recent banking crisis and rising wage inequality.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/I035846/1","grantId":"ES/I035846/1","fundValue":"172429","fundStart":"2012-03-31","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alexander John Bryson","coPersons":["John  Forth","Martin  Weale","Lucy  Stokes"],"organisation":"National Institute of Economic & Soc Res","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
