The first goal is to develop and implement methods for statistical estimation and inference in the context of differential equations driven by rough paths (RDEs). Such differential equations are very general and can be used to model a large number of dynamical systems. Our motivation comes from multiscale modelling as we hope the approach we will develop could be useful for important applications, such as molecular dynamics or climate modelling. The second goal is to approximate the slow process of a multiscale stochastic differential equation (SDE) by an RDE at small scales. The final goal would be to use our parameter estimation methods to get some information about the limiting dynamics of the slow process using short paths of the multiscale system.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H019588/1","grantId":"EP/H019588/1","fundValue":"99926","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Anastasia  Papavasiliou","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Warwick","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
