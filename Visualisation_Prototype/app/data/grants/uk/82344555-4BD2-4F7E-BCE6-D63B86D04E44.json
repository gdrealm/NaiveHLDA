But for a cell to divide into two requires that the genetic material within that cell is copied. This allows both daughter cells to inherit a complete copy of the genetic blueprint. Without this blueprint a cell cannot function correctly and will die ultimately. Unfortunately, copying the genetic material of a cell is a very complex process, in part because there is a huge amount of DNA needed to carry the genetic code of even a simple organism such as a bacterium. The complexity of this process, and its critical importance, has led to the evolution of very complex cellular machines that can duplicate the large amounts of DNA found in cells. These cellular machines can copy the DNA very rapidly and very accurately. However, we now know that these machines are not perfect and often break down whilst trying to copy the genetic code. Why do they break down? One major problem is damage to the DNA caused by certain chemicals in the environment and also by radiation such as ultraviolet light from the sun. But another problem might be caused by the cell itself. The DNA carrying the genetic code does not actually exist in isolation within the cell but is completely coated in molecules called proteins. These proteins are essential for nearly every process within the cell and so a conflict exists between the necessity for these proteins and the need to copy the DNA. Our own, and others', work has demonstrated that these proteins can stop the DNA from being copied. We have recently discovered that certain enzymes within a cell (called DNA helicases) might help during duplication of DNA by facilitating the movement of DNA copying machines through protein-DNA complexes. This study aims to establish whether these enzymes do promote copying of DNA and what features of these enzymes are needed for such a function. This will be achieved by studying these enzymes in isolation and also within the context of the cell. These studies may help us to understand how cells duplicate their genetic material in the face of many potential blocks. Blockage of DNA copying is potentially catastrophic for a cell. Failure to copy the DNA prevents a cell from dividing to give two viable daughter cells. But blockage can also lead to errors during this DNA copying process. These errors can cause mutations and consequent malfunctions in daughter cells. In complex organisms, including humans, these malfunctions can take the form of genetic diseases and the onset of cancer. Our work will help understand how these risks might be minimised.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/G005915/1","grantId":"BB/G005915/1","fundValue":"302284","fundStart":"2009-05-26","fundEnd":"2012-05-25","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our findings have informed others' work on how organisms replicate their genetic material.

We now know that one major reason for such mutations is the breakdown of the machines that copy all of the genetic material inside a cell prior to that cell dividing into two daughters. However, the causes of these breakdowns are still unclear. Our previous BBSRC-funded project (BB/C008316/1) demonstrated that proteins unavoidably bound to the DNA can block progress of these copying machines in the bacterium E. coli, a powerful model organism for studying these highly conserved processes. This previous project also demonstrated that two enzymes in E. coli, Rep and UvrD, can each promote copying of DNA that is encrusted with proteins. These enzymes are both helicases, a class of motor enzymes that move along DNA.The key findings of this current project are:1) Rep, not UvrD, acts to promote copying of DNA inside a normal cell. Rep functions in this capacity as an accessory replicative helicase due to a direct physical interaction with a key component of the DNA copying machinery. This component, DnaB, is also a helicase and so our work has demonstrated for the very first time that two molecular motors can cooperate in tandem during copying of the genetic material.2) absence of an accessory replicative helicase attached to the copying machinery results in significant slowing of the copying process inside cells.3) the most significant source of protein roadblocks to the DNA copying machines are complexes associated with &quot;reading&amp;quot; the genetic information. This finding demonstrates that two essential processes, copying and reading of the genetic information, are in direct conflict inside cells. Given the conservation of these two processes in all life on the planet, our work has uncovered a key source of problems in copying of the genetic material.4) a critical requirement for promoting movement of the DNA copying machinery along protein-coated DNA is that two motors cooperate within the copying machinery by moving along opposing DNA strands, a requirement that may be a universal feature of the copying process in all organisms. These findings have revealed how organisms ensure that DNA is copied even when coated with proteins. This work has provided the first mechanistic information on the systems that underpin replication of protein-bound DNA and has also revealed the frequency with which DNA copying machines break down due to proteins bound to the DNA. Evidence is now emerging that these are problems all organisms must overcome, implying that such breakdowns in the DNA copying process may contribute to genetic diseases and cancer. Understanding how organisms avoid these breakdowns, and what happens when these mechanisms fail, will therefore further our understanding of these processes in human disease.\n\nIt is still unclear how the enzymes we have identified in this study promote movement of the DNA copying machines along protein-bound DNA. How these mechanisms operate inside cells is also unclear, given the large amounts of DNA that must be copied inside even simple organisms. It is also critical that we understand why these underpinning mechanisms occasionally fail, leading to replication failure and rearrangements within the DNA.
