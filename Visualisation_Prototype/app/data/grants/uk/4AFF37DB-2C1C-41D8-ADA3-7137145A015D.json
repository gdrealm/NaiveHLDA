{"id":"4AFF37DB-2C1C-41D8-ADA3-7137145A015D","title":"Functions and therapeutic potential of vascular Orai/CRAC channels","abstractText":"Huge networks of blood vessels (vasculatures) in humans, as well as many other species, enable provision of nutrients to organs and removal of waste; much as transport systems do for cities. The blood vessels have inbuilt capacity to change (remodel) to meet altered demands or adjust in response to injury, which are important for normal physiology and survival in adverse conditions. In disease, the remodelling may be an advantage or disadvantage. In the case of cancer, tumours need to develop their own new blood vessels in order to progress beyond a small size. Therefore, a popular anti-cancer strategy is to try to cut off the tumour?s supply lines, reducing the tumour?s impact or destroying it. Therefore, knowledge of how to manipulate vascular remodelling may be used to enhance the quality of life and survival of people. We propose a project to investigate a promising approach for manipulating vascular remodelling and the perfusion capability of blood vessels, working as a partnership between an academic research group and industrial drug development group to increase efficiency and likelihood of societal benefit.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002076","grantId":"G1002076","fundValue":"723467","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David John Beech","coPersons":["Karen Elizabeth Porter","David George Jayne","Justin  Ainscough","Ian Christopher Wood","Mark  Kearney"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
