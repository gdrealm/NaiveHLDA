The classical sharp inequality in two dimensions compares the area of an enclosed region in the plane with the length of its perimeter. Thanks to the sharpness, it is possible to deduce immediately that amongst all regions with a fixed perimeter length, the circle produces the maximum area. More generally, isoperimetric inequalities of this flavour can be used to identify maximising or minimising objects within a class, and they have applications in physical problems (for example, liquid droplet formation). Furthermore, these physical applications often demand that a &quot;stable&quot; version of the underlying sharp inequality is proved (to allow for the effect of external perturbative forces, for instance).\n\nThe main thrust of this broad project is to understand the sharpness and stability of some central inequalities which occur in harmonic analysis, geometric analysis and differential equations. These include the powerful Brascamp-Lieb inequality, which can be viewed as a generalised isoperimetric-type inequality and has fascinating and wide-ranging applications in the above fields and beyond. The project also encompasses sharp space-time inequalities for solutions of important differential equations, including the Schrodinger and wave equations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J021490/1","grantId":"EP/J021490/1","fundValue":"95970","fundStart":"2013-02-15","fundEnd":"2014-02-15","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have already had an academic impact. For example, the results concerning optimal space-time inequalities for the solution of the Schroedinger equation have spawned a new line of current research on related theory for a much broader class of partial differential equations, covering fundamental physical processes described by the wave and Klein-Gordon equations. Additionally, the findings have more closely connected the theory of kinetic equations to dispersive equations. This had led to some exciting ongoing research that plans to use the large body of recently developed and powerful theory in kinetic equations to solve difficult problems in the theory of dispersive equations.

These are fundamental equations motivated by numerous problems in mathematical physics and this research has produced new findings on qualitative and quantitative properties of the solutions of these equations. For example, a conjecture of Keel and Tao concerning certain space-time inequalities for the solution of the kinetic transport equation was solved during this research. In other research funded on this grant, some striking results were obtained for optimal space-time inequalities for the solution of the Schroedinger equation, including the unification of several prior works on the subject and the identification of a beautiful connection with the famous Boltzmann H-theorem from kinetic equation theory. I expect the findings to lead to future developments in the mathematical theory of partial differential equations, harmonic analysis and geometric analysis. In particular, I believe there is great scope for the development of kinetic equation theory based on powerful techniques recently developed in harmonic and geometric analysis e.g. in connection to the Kakeya conjecture.
