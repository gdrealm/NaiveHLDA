The invariants are objects in linear algebra whichencode a lot of informations of the geometric object. This method isvery common in arithmetic geometry.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D052408/1","grantId":"EP/D052408/1","fundValue":"174133","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Andreas  Langer","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Exeter","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
