The volume of this fluid layer is controlled by the transport of sodium and chloride across the cells that line the surface of the airways through selective channels and pumps. Increased transport of sodium out of the airway is linked with dehydration of the fluid layer and is a contributary factor to the disease, Cystic Fibrosis. Conversely, a decrease in sodium transport is associated with fluid accumulation in the airways as in respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn and high altitude pulmonary oedema. We have recently discovered that activation of a molecule that senses low cellular energy levels (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), decreases sodium transport across the lung epithelial cell. AMPK may therefore have a significant regulatory role in these diseases. How AMPK decreases sodium transport is unknown but it appears to reduce the amount of sodium entering the cell via the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (ENaC) and the amount of sodium that is extruded from the cell via the Na+K+ATPase pump. It is the purpose of this project to investigate if activation of AMPK decreases sodium transport and the activity of ENaC and Na+K+ATPase by regulating the abundance of these proteins in the cell membrane. We will do this by using a combination of functional and molecular approaches in human H441 lung epithelial cells in vitro. Identifying the cellular mechanism by which this molecule regulates sodium transport is a critical first step in elucidating how it could regulate Na+ transport in vivo. This will help us develop more appropriate strategies for future research and the development of treatments for lung diseases which exhibit dissordered fluid volume.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E013597/1","grantId":"BB/E013597/1","fundValue":"272837","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Findings from this project have contributed to our understanding of the role of AMPK and its regulation in airway epithelium.

We showed that 1. AMPK-?1 is the predominant isoform in airway epithelial cells and is found in cytosolic and membrane domains. 2. We showed that phospholipids in the cell membrane were important in the regulation of Na+ transport by AMPK. 3. We also showed that hypoxia regulates Na+ transport by AMPK-dependent and independent pathways. This project has lead to collaborations with other groups working on Na+ transport. We have provided expertise and resources to support further research into key signalling molecules (eg Nedd4-2) , the role of epithelial Na+ channels in other tissues (eg galvanotaxis) and signalling pathways in other epithelial tissues (eh ERK5). Our findings have been cited by others investigating the role of AMPK in other tissues. Our findings have informed our current project because metformin (an activator of AMPK) has had important beneficial effects on epithelial function and resistance to infection.
