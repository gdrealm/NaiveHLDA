By highlighting historical capabilities in this path-dependent area, this study will allow practitioners, researchers, and legislators to assess existing national strengths and understand what new firm capabilities and institutional supports are needed for the emerging landscape of global brand competition.</p> \n<p>The project will trace developments in trademark strategy from 1860, before the first trademark law, to 1960, when the global strength of branded British consumer goods became clear. We will examine successful brands of the nineteenth century, comparing brands that led to growth and longevity in the twentieth with those that ended in failure. This area of research on the early history of successful trademarks has been surprisingly neglected. A central focus of this study is the co-evolution of trademark legislation and firms’ branding practice.</p> \n<p>The project draws attention to the contribution of trademarks to ‘vertical competition’ and the control of supply chains. This aspect of branding, which was evident in the nineteenth century before the rise of the integrated firm, is becoming evident again as production disaggregates into extended, often global, supply chains.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E00489X/1","grantId":"ES/E00489X/1","fundValue":"247477","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Teresa  Da Silva Lopes","coPersons":["Paul  Duguid"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":" We have identified a set of preliminary findings. They are grouped according the aims/objectives of the project. Here are some illustrations:\n\n1. To explain sustained competitiveness in British consumer goods\n\n - the conference in 2008 resulted in an edited volume in 2010. This examines trademarks and brands, and their historical role in national competitiveness and comparative advantage in consumer goods and in overall economic growth.\n\n- 'Entrepreneurship and the development of global brands' (2007) focuses on the impact of innovative strategies pursued by brand managers on the growth of successful global brands in consumer goods.\n\n- 'The role of marketing knowledge in brand success/failure' (wip) compares the marketing, and in particular branding, advertising, trademarking and protection strategies behind a group of successful and failed brands, and claims that a full analysis of 'marketing knowledge' is key to understanding firm competitiveness in consumer goods industries.\n\n- 'Trademarks and British Competitiveness in Consumer Goods' (2014) shows that factors usually pointed out as explaining British economic decline in heavy industries did not impact on the development of light consumer goods industries, and on the contrary encouraged their fast growth during this period. Trademark registrations are shown to provide new insights into the debate on British relative decline, when combined with other industry and firm-level data.\n\n2. To analyse the interplay between emerging firm strategies and British trademark law.\n\n- The workshop in 2010 lead to a forthcoming issue of the journal Business History Review (2012). The papers individually and together help expand conventional understanding of unexpected challenges that marks faced as they spread from regions and sectors to become global.\n\n- 'French connections' (2009) shows that not only did the French have robust trademark law long before the UK and US, but the latter two countries only adopted trademark law after signing diplomatic treaties with France. \n\n- 'Brand protection and Globalisation of British Business (2012) expands existing knowledge on the evolution of multinational business. It shows that strategies and tactics aimed at protecting brand reputation also played an important role in explaining globalisation and survival of British business.They included lobbying governments, appointing local agents to provide intelligence, and collaborating with other firms.\n\n- 'A mark of distinction' (2010) examines the emergence on a large scale of the unique product brand name, distinct from a company name or product descriptor, in the UK in the later nineteenth century. The interaction of branding strategies and law is shown to have accorded property rights in word-based marks only gradually and shaped the development of branding in the UK. \n\n-'A Case of Prejudice?' (2012) - examines US resistance to the adoption of collective and certification marks. \n\n- 'Fashions in branding' (wip) looks at the ways in which the practice of branding has developed over time, and explains how distinct forms of branding used in different periods reflect fashions, rather than just incremental environmental or organisational changes. It also discussed how fashions in branding have affected firm performance; and how these fashions were built in the first place. \n\n3. To explore how the development of brands has affected &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot;\n\n- 'Brands in Chains' (2010) examines the role of brands and trademarks in vertical competition. Firms used branding to fight direct competitors in supply chains and to discipline other links in the chain over whom they had no direct control and with whom they had to cooperate.\n\n4. To explain the impact of British entrepreneurship and investement on economic growth in developing countries.\n \n- 'British Academy Project' (2014) identifies and explains the sources of British competitiveness and long term survival in Brazil and draws on private and public archives and on the collection of original patent and trademark data. The grant has already had several notable ramifications:\n\n- The work on registrations has been part of and contributed to increasing international efforts to gather trademark registrations for multinational, historical, longitudinal research. This has involved a partnership with the British Library, as well as collaborative discussions with trademark offices and researchers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Hong-Kong, Portugal,Singapore and Spain.\n\n- Skills and insights developed in working with registrations allowed a rapid analysis of the trademark repository created in a partnership between Google and the US Patent and Trademark Office. The severe inadequacies of this collection has led to preliminary discussions with Google over how to fix this repository to allow robust historical research,\n\n- Work on vertical branding has been taken up by other researchers, looking for example at the development of medical marks or public assessments of trustworthiness of BBC news,\n\n- 'French Connections' (2009) received a prize from the journal Enterprise &amp;amp; Society,\n\n- Work on the influence of French marks has prompted reanalysis within France of the significance of its early laws, and in Spain of the generally unnoticed innovativeness of its laws.\n\n- The research on brands and British competitiveness has led to the organisation of a joint conference with the Institute of Railways Studies (Museum of Science and Technology) on 'Marketing Mobility in Britain'.\n\n- The principal investigators have been invited to give key-note speeches at international conferences and workshops to talk about their findings.\n\n- The project has been noted by the Big Innovation Centre of the Work Foundation and they have integrated some of the findings in their business led Work Programme 3 on 'Building Innovative Sectors, Places and Markets'. In this process we have been liaising with the CEO, Prof. Birgitte Andersen Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail","dataset":"gtr"}
