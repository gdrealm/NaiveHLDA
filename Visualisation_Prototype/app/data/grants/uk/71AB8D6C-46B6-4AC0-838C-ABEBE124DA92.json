{"id":"71AB8D6C-46B6-4AC0-838C-ABEBE124DA92","title":"Exploiting a sialic acid binding domain","abstractText":"The surfaces of all animal cells are decorated with complex networks of sugar molecules that are attached to proteins sitting in the fatty membrane of the cell. These sugars are there for a variety of reasons, for example to act as attachment sites for proteins from other cells which need to communicate in some way. Many microbes, such as the bacterium that causes cholera and the virus that causes influenza, bind to these sugar molecules as these sugars are the first thing these microbes 'see' as they approach a cell which they are going to infect. The complex networks of sugars are made of strings of molecules such as glucose and galactose, which are quite familiar, but the outermost sugar tends to be a sugar called sialic acid. It is called sialic acid because it was first found in saliva, for which the Greek name is sialon. Unusually for a sugar, sialic acid is negatively charged, and this creates a mask that helps some cells, such as red blood cells, circulate through the body far longer than they would if they didn't have this mask. Sialic acids are also unusual in that over 50 chemical variations of the sugar have been discovered in nature, with the different types of sialic acid appearing on the surface of cells from different animals, or cells that are at different stages in their development. It has also been found that cancerous cells have very large numbers of sialic acids on their surface compared to normal cells. Our research proposal is centred on creating biological tools for detecting different types of sialic acids on cell surfaces. What we have discovered recently is a protein, called a lectin, that specifically binds to sialic acids quite tightly, but not as tight as we would like. We are going to use molecular biology (techniques that enable us to cut and join genes together) to create a string of these lectins to give us a molecule that will bind more tightly to cell surfaces. We are also going to link to our string of lectins a protein derived from a jelly fish that glows green. In this way, we will have a molecule that we can add to cells in a dish, and by looking through a fluoresence microscope we will see exactly where the sialic acids are on cells. We will also use a machine that automatically sorts a mixture of cells depending on how much their fluoresce. This will enable us to measure how much sialic acid there is on the surface of different cells in the body. We will also use molecular biology to change the lectin so that it can recognise other types of sialic acid. In this way we can make tools that will show us the distribution of the different sialic acids on cells. Finally, we are going to attach an enzyme to our string of lectins so that it gets delivered to sialic acid-rich cell surfaces. In this way, we may be able to target cancer cells with enzymes that may destroy them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E001912/1","grantId":"BB/E001912/1","fundValue":"273724","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2010-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Garry  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
