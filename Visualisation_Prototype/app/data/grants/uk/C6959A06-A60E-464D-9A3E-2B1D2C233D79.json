However, large-scale analysis has previously been hampered by the lack of readily available and easily usable computerised versions of the data. I-CeM Project will completely transform this situation by bringing together computerised versions of the censuses for Great Britain for the period 1851 to 1911 and enhancing these through standardisation and harmonisation.</p>\n\n<p>Working with commercial partners, the I-CeM Project team will undertake a number of tasks including: reformatting, checking and cleaning the data; the development of standard coding schemes for occupational and other data; the coding of the data; and the standardisation of administrative boundaries for the periods covered. Dissemination and publicity for the datasets would be achieved through the development of online data dissemination tools; the production of GIS maps to link to the data; and the creation of representative national samples, documentation, user guides, and supporting teaching and research materials. The result will be to create one of the largest and comprehensive historical census databases in the world. </p>\n\n<p>The I-CeM Project is collaboration between the Department of History and the UK Data Archive, based at the University of Essex. <br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-1629","grantId":"RES-062-23-1629","fundValue":"837120","fundStart":"2009-04-06","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kevin  Schurer","coPersons":["Edward  Higgs","Timothy  Hatton"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
