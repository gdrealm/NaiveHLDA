{"id":"03DE6D3E-232A-4F8E-BE5E-15F189002E0A","title":"Semantic Technologies for the Enhancement of Case-Based Learning","abstractText":"The project will explore the potential of the 'Semantic Web' to support teaching in complex, controversial and rapidly-evolving fields where case based learning is the pedagogical approach of choice. Researchers and software developers will work with teachers and students in undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Cambridge and City University to explore both the nature and role of the cases around which learning is focused, and the part that emerging Semantic Web technologies and techniques can play in supporting this learning. It is recognised that teaching and learning environments are complex and evolving, and that participants in these environment may have multiple identities - as teachers, learners, researchers and workers. The learning technologies they use need to be robust yet flexible enough to support teachers and learners as they grapple with complex situations and develop creative solutions. The project will include an international seminar series running concurrently with research and development activity. This reflects not only wide interest in the Semantic Web and its applications in education, but also the opportunities offered by the project for researchers interested in discovering how the very latest 'Web 3.0' technologies are understood and used by teachers and learners in different disciplines and environments.\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0403","grantId":"RES-139-25-0403","fundValue":"361951","fundStart":"2008-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Patrick  Carmichael","coPersons":["David John Bolton","Louise  Corti","Rob  Walker","Laurence  Solkin","Keith  Johnstone","Richard  Edwards","Uma  Patel"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
