The global commercial cell therapy industry was estimated to have an annual turnover of &pound;600M in 2011, and is estimated to grow to &pound;120BN by 2025. Currently there is a significant gap in the UK's clinical research capabilities and infrastructure to deliver trials involving cell-based therapy largely because cell therapies require specialised facilities to safely manage the cells for human administration.\n\nThe specific aim of this proposal is to develop a cell therapy facility to enable the testing of cell therapies in clinical trials. This project will facilitate the delivery of clinical trials to investigate cell-based therapies (currently under development by researchers at QUB) for both respiratory failure in the critically ill and vision loss.\n\nThis state of the art facility will provide capacity for management from the storage and subsequent preparation of cell therapies for patient administration, through to the manufacturing of cell based therapies. This will strategically enhance the capabilities of the UK in cell-based therapies and provide a foundation for future significant health and socio-economic benefits to the UK.\n\nIt will be established as a recognised UK centre for translational research in respiratory medicine.\n\nThe facility will be available for use by external universities, hospitals and companies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/M009149/1","grantId":"MR/M009149/1","fundValue":"1002470","fundStart":"2015-04-30","fundEnd":"2018-04-29","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Danny  McAuley","coPersons":["Joseph Stuart Elborn","Patrick G.
