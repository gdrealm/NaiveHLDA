{"id":"4BD649C7-E4C7-46ED-ADD8-5DC53F861C4C","title":"The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne","abstractText":"This research project undertakes a complete reassessment of the sermons of John Donne (1576-1631), and will produce a new critical edition of those sermons, with introductions and explanatory notes for a new generation of readers. Donne is one of the most celebrated authors of the English Renaissance, whose work is regularly taught in schools and universities. Editorial work on Donne's poetry has not slackened since the 1910s, the most recent example being the Variorum Edition from Indiana U. P (four volumes of which have appeared to date). And Donne's popularity reaches well beyond academia, as witnessed recently by the campaign to purchase for the NPG the 'Lothian Portrait' of Donne, the appearance of a new popular biography by John Stubbs, and Simon Schama's BBC programme on Donne's poetry. However, poetry represents only a fraction of Donne, and in recent years his religion and prose works have been the focus of the most innovative research. This has led to significant advances in the understanding of both Donne's writing and of religious culture in seventeenth-century England. Yet sermons from this period are rarely available in accessible editions, and in contrast to the poetry, Donne's have suffered relative editorial neglect. The 160 extant sermons were edited by George R. Potter and Evelyn Simpson between 1954 and 1962, but no explanatory notes were provided, making the volumes difficult for students and even experts to use. Only a few selections have been published subsequently, and frequently in abridged form. The current project will address several linked questions, including (1) how to facilitate a modern reader's understanding of these sermons, by the provision of introductory materials and notes that identify references to the Bible, allusions to other works (by Donne and others), and engagements with theological, social, and political debates; (2) how close modern readers can get to a sermon as it was originally preached; (3) whether this form, or the latest one produced in the author's lifetime should be the basis of the text we read now; and (4) how such sermons should be arranged - by, for example, the date of their delivery or according to the location in which they were preached. OUP has commissioned the 16-volume edition that will result from this research project, under the General Editorship of Peter McCullough and involving an international team of scholars. The project will concentrate chiefly on addressing and resolving research questions concerning the texts of the sermons, and will fund a research assistant whose primary task will be to compare all available copies of the sermons in print and manuscript in order to establish the most accurate texts possible. As well as providing the texts that will be introduced and annotated by the contributing editors, this work will result in a comprehensive Textual Companion to the edition, which will explain the ways in which Donne's sermons have reached us, outline the principles on which the edition is based, and provide a template for further study and editions of other early modern sermons. This edition has to last a century, and there is no practical way yet of ensuring technical and managerial continuity long-term for a web or CD publication; at present, forms of parallel (print/electronic) publication are the only suitable forms for work of this kind. The project will, therefore, provide an unmatched resource for those interested in Donne's writings (students, teachers, scholars, and the wider public), but it will also be invaluable to students of the history of preaching, religion, the law, the court, and politics in the period.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/H020438/1","grantId":"AH/H020438/1","fundValue":"514445","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2015-04-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The primary impact of the grant-funded research has been as primary research data for the print-published volumes of the Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne (OUP), hailed upon the appearance of the first volume in 2013 as 'a once in a century contribution to Donne studies' (TLS). Through the edition website much of the raw data is available free to all with internet access. Two grant-funded conferences have disseminated our methodologies and findings to the wider scholarly community. A series of collaborations with St Paul's cathedral (where Donne was dean) took this even further into the non-academic public world of arts, religion, and public debate.

In addition to establishing more accurate texts, we have also made major discoveries about how Donne's manuscripts came into the hands of publishers, and how those texts were part of the political and religious upheavals of the mid-seventeenth century. We have also discovered for the first time the dizzying scope of Donne's scholarship and the sources he used but did not acknowledge in his preaching. In addition to being a major intervention in Donne studies, the project is making one of the largest contributions of recent years to the history of publishing and the history of religion in the period. The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne contains the now definitive texts of Donne's sermons, the largest body of prose by any early modern English author, and will be the international scholarly standard for at least 50 years or more. Our methodologies and presentation of our findings in these volumes are now exemplars for similar editorial projects.
