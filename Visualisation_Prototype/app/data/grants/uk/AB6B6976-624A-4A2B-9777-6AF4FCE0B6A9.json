Agri-environment schemes (AES) encourage farmers to carry out management which should lead to increases in wildlife. However, AES do not always give the desired results. </p> \n<p>This failure has been linked to both social and ecological problems. Firstly, if farmers have poor understanding of the science and aims of AES, they may not carry out the best management. Secondly, management may create the environments that certain plant and animal species need, but their ability to colonise these habitats may be limited by both the rarity of these species in the landscape, and obstacles to movement in modern landscapes. </p> \n<p>This is a five year study of how well wildlife habitats are created under AES, and whether training of farmers leads to creation of better habitats. This will be linked to studies of how farmerâ€™s attitudes to wildlife-friendly farming may be shifted by training. Secondly, we will analyse how the distribution of species and habitat types in wider landscape affects colonisation of new habitats. This will lead to improved methods for wildlife-friendly farming</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-227-25-0010","grantId":"RES-227-25-0010","fundValue":"724476","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  FarmCAT fed into the Defra review of Environmental Stewardship, indicating that farmer training is essential in ensuring agri-envronment success.

However, research has suggested that these agri-environment initiatives have produced variable outcomes and there is considerable scope for improvement. We assessed constraints on agri-environment success in the establishment of two field margin options under the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme - the basic agri-environmental programme in the UK: 1) the provision winter food for farmland birds by sowing plants with high energy seed; and 2) planting pollen- and nectar-rich flowering plants for bumblebees and butterflies. We studied 48 farms; 24 of the farmers undertook a one day bespoke training course with a follow-up half-day farm visit, while the remaining 24 received no training. Over five years we measured whether the wildlife habitats created by the trained and untrained farmers attracted target species of birds and insects and what local and landscape factors affected the quality of these habitats. The training not only had an immediate impact, but continued to influence farmer attitudes, their management of the agri-environment strips, and the quality of habitat on these strips. These outcomes can be summarised as follows. 1) Farmers welcome advice on questions such as selection of appropriate seed mixes. 2) The impact of training can be seen both in technical aspects of management and in attitudes and a sense that farmers can do a better job on environmental management. 3) Over the five years, farmers who had been trained created better quality wildlife habitat, in terms of flower resources for bee and seeds for birds, which translated into some local increases in target species of birds and bees. We found regional differences in the abundance of birds, butterflies and bees found on the agri-environment strips, but did not detect a clear effect of landscape level biodiversity (measured as both the amount of semi-natural habitat and the variety of bird, butterfly or bee species in the surroundings) on the outcomes The project suggested that policymakers should take a range of factors into consideration: 1) farmer training can affect the delivery of environmental outcomes from agri-environmental schemes; 2) farmers need to be more involved in developing agri-environmental policies; 3) past experience of agri-environment schemes is important to their successful implementation by farmers; 4) training for farmers can instil a more positive and professional attitude towards agri-environment schemes, and allow farmers to become more skilled at putting interventions into effect; 5) it is important that training delivered by professionals with farming experience who can gain the respect of farmers; 6) there is a need to move away from &quot;self service&quot; schemes where farmers are simply left to get on with implementation, but it is also important to retain the role of the farmer in deciding management options.
