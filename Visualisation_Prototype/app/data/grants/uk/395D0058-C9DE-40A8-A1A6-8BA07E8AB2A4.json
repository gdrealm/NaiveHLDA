While CO2 levels and the price of petroleum continue to rise, molecules from oil continue to dominate the landscape and fuel our chemical industries. As one approach to solving this crisis, many have promoted the concept of &quot;The Biorefinery&quot; and a new chemical sector dependent upon the sustainable natural resource biomass. Biomass is made up of a mixture of polymers which, when compared to petroleum and natural gas, contain a high ratio of elemental oxygen to elemental carbon. \n\nThe elemental oxygen and carbon form strong carbon-oxygen bonds which present an obstacle for processing and transforming these chemicals into everyday products. In order for molecules from biorefineries to meet the growing and complex demands of Society, new methods will have to be developed that remove the elemental oxygen from renewable resources by breaking carbon-oxygen bonds.\n\nOur research centers around developing new underpinning methods for the transformation of carbon-oxygen bonds to carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond by activation with catalysts based on transition and main-group metals. By discovering and exploiting new catalyst systems we will uncover methods for turning ethers from biomass into chemical building blocks for chemical manufacture. Specifically, we will convert ethers into C1- to C9-hydrocarbon building blocks by breaking the unreactive C-O bonds and replacing them with reactive C-B and C-Al bonds. We will demonstrate the use of these building blocks in chemical manufacture.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L011514/1","grantId":"EP/L011514/1","fundValue":"99125","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research grant is still active and we are developing new underpinning science for the transformation of biomass-to-chemicals.

","person":"Mark Richard Crimmin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":" We have developed a new method to transform non-reactive ethers from biomass to more reactive chemical building blocks. This method relies on the chemical transformation of an inert carbon–oxygen bond to a reactive carbon–aluminium bond. The method is currently limited to cyclic ethers, those in which the oxygen-atom forms part of a molecular ring. We have begun to understand how this molecular transformation takes place and in the future we will use this information to develop better catalysts and expand the number of examples of this new method to convert biomass-to-chemicals. The new reaction for the transformation of carbon–oxygen bonds to carbon–aluminium bonds should stimulate new directions in the fields of carbon–fluorine and carbon–oxygen bond activation. Furthermore, the new types of heterobimetallic complexes that have been identified should lead to not only the development of new catalytic reactions that are dependent upon the use of more than one metal but also a deeper understanding of chemical bonding between main group species and transition metal complexes.
