{"id":"CBDB476D-6417-4619-BECF-2038A41FD814","title":"Assembly and control of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex","abstractText":"The information contained in the genes of living cells has to be converted into cellular components that form structures and enable biochemical reactions to take place. This process is called gene expression and it is vital to all life. Gene expression comprises two main steps, called transcription and translation. In transcription, the information in the DNA sequences of the genes is converted into equivalent sequences in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. In translation, the mRNA molecules are 'read' by a large molecular structure called the ribosome, which uses the information to dictate the synthesis of proteins. In previous work, we have established that the ribosome undergoes large conformational changes in order to become competent for recruitment of mRNA molecules. These conformational changes are induced by the binding of a set of so-called initiation factors, the eIFs. We wish to capitalise on our exciting preliminary data in order to elucidate further details of the changes in the ribosome that enable protein synthesis to initiate and to understand how the interactions with the eIFs bring these changes about.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E011888/1","grantId":"BB/E011888/1","fundValue":"695060","fundStart":"2007-03-19","fundEnd":"2010-08-18","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"John Edward McCarthy","coPersons":["Robert John Gilbert"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
