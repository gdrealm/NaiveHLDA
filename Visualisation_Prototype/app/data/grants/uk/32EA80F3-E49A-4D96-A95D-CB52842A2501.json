{"id":"32EA80F3-E49A-4D96-A95D-CB52842A2501","title":"UK ALMA Regional Centre Node Infrastructure Enhancement","abstractText":"ALMA will consist of 66 antennas, with baselines up to 16 km. ALMA covers all the atmospheric windows from 3mm to 300 micron wavelength. The top-level ALMA science drivers are: to detect CO in 'normal' (Milky Way precursor) galaxies at redshift 3 in &lt;24 hours; to image the gas kinematics in proto-stellar and proto-planetary disks within 500 pc, and produce high-fidelity images at &lt;100-milliarcsec resolution. The UK ARC Node is responsible for community/public outreach, community development and face-to-face ALMA user support from pre-proposal submission to advanced data reduction/analysis and ingestion of data products into the ALMA Archive. The ARC Node provides direct, expert support to the central ESO ARC including on-site testing and operations support at the ALMA sites in Chile. The UK ARC Node maintains and hosts the ALMA Observing Support Tool (OST), an online ALMA simulator used extensively by ALMA proposers worldwide. This proposal will provide additional investment in several aspects of the infrastructure at the UK ARC Node to enhance support for UK ALMA users.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/M007049/1","grantId":"ST/M007049/1","fundValue":"116940","fundStart":"2014-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Gary  Fuller","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
