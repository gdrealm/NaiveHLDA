{"id":"69E03F13-2D54-41FD-BBDB-EBA9F7B7E000","title":"Defining the Global Middle Ages","abstractText":"The lives of communities, families and individuals today are shaped by pressures which come from outside local and national borders. High-speed communications, rapid movements of capital, complex migration patterns, and business organisations with world-wide reach are central features of modern globalisation. Historians are concerned to find the origins of the human interactions which have created this 'global' world. For the most part, they limit their search to those centuries when western Europeans began to travel, settle and govern outside their own continent. As a result global history is often inseparable from the need to explain the triumph of western Europe. But is this the only way of looking at global history? \n\nConsiderable evidence for long-distance contacts between peoples, goods and cultural practices in the centuries before 1600 suggests that there are older and alternative global histories to explore. Several recently-established research projects in the UK and beyond have begun the work of comparing ancient and medieval societies across the globe and identifying the connections between them. But this research into the pre-modern 'global' is at an embryonic stage. Quite what we mean by the pre-modern 'global' is unclear. We cannot be sure that applying Eurocentric and imperial models from the modern experience of the global will actually help us understand the medieval or ancient evidence or draw the most important conclusions from that evidence. As public interest in the history, texts and material remains of ancient and medieval societies from across the globe grows and is encouraged by museum exhibitions and TV documentaries, it is important that we do not interpret the interactions of those societies in anachronistic frameworks. As medieval global history develops as a discipline, it is important that academic historians and school teachers should be able to teach with confidence about unfamiliar cultures without falling back on hackneyed stereotypes about western superiority or eastern exoticism.\n\nThis project is designed to make medieval historians, those who study the period 500 to 1600, think about how we should define the global in the Middle Ages. In a series of workshops, historians with different regional specialisms in the history of Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe will discuss problems of definition, evidence and approach. Given the urgency of establishing a framework for interpreting the global Middle Ages we will disseminate findings as quickly as possible through accessibly written reports and podcasts on a project website, where bibliographies and teaching materials will also be posted. The website, an edited book and a co-written article will provide key reference tools for the emerging field of global medieval history. But providing a framework for the development of a new area of study is not the only purpose of this project. Instead, by interpreting the evidence for connections and comparisons across the globe in the period 500-1600 we will also be able to enrich the study of medieval history itself, a subject that is often confined to western Europe between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance. By identifying the scope, nature and also the limits of the global in the medieval period we can also provide new questions for modern global historians. But above all, we anticipate that our investigations will reveal that global movements of peoples, goods, and cultural practices were often experienced in highly localised ways. Translation and assimilation of the global to local contexts were medieval constants as was the shaping of the global by the local. These processes could involve conflict but just as often peaceful communication. These insights are not merely relevant to the medieval period; they will help to illuminate present-day contexts, where multi-stranded interactions between the global and the local are the shapers of everyday experience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K001914/1","grantId":"AH/K001914/1","fundValue":"25680","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  It is too soon to know, particularly given that our project has yet to finish.  ","person":"Catherine Joy Holmes","coPersons":["Naomi  Standen"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":" At the level of activity we have yet to reach the end of our AHRC grant. However thus far we have held four workshop meetings of our academic network with a fifth impact-outreach event planned for March 2015, when our grant will finish. We have also been developing a project website where the reports, bibliographies and programmes of our workshops are on display. We will be adding more elements to the website shortly which will speak more directly to the interests of non-academic audiences. We have also been putting together the chapter outlines for a collaboratively-written academic book about the Global Middle Ages. \n\nIn terms of discoveries, one of our initial objectives was to pool the experience of a team of UK-based medievalists with different regional specialisms in order to explore global history in the pre-modern centuries. When we applied for funding we were keen to discover whether the Global Middle Ages as a concept had any power and whether there were ways in which those coming with very different experiences of the medieval world could talk about such a concept. After our workshop meetings, we are confident that the Global Middle Ages is a viable idea and that we have made significant headway in developing the analytical toolbox for talking about it. We have also learned a great deal from each other about parts of the world we knew little about, another objective of our original application. \n\nThus far our discoveries have been developed and discussed principally within the network albeit with reports posted on-line. From now on our emphasis is going to be more on reaching beyond our own network both in terms of academic publication but also in the sense of communicating with non-academic sectors. We think that our collaborative mode of working, whether in workshop or co-written book modes, will provide templates that other teams of scholars may choose to use. Our bibliographies may provide useful starting points for other projects interested in the same or related sets of questions. We imagine that single scholars will also be able to gain from engaging with our publicly available materials whether they are working on global history in-the-round or on the history of specific regions in global context. Once we have put more of our materials aimed at a non-academic audience on our website, then teachers and students in the 14-18 year-old age group will also be able to follow up more fully on our activities. We hope that our advice on accessible reading for students in this age-group will provide useful gateways into the Global Middle Ages specifically and Global History more generally.
