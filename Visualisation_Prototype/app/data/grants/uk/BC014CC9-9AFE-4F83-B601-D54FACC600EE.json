{"id":"BC014CC9-9AFE-4F83-B601-D54FACC600EE","title":"Lexicalized Proof-Theoretic Semantics for Natural Language","abstractText":"A theory of language needs to deal with (at least) two facets: form and meaning. Form is the territory of Syntax. This research focuses on a theory of meaning (semantics), which attempts to replace denotation in complicated mathematical domains by proof, again alluding to form. The research is based on the old idea (of the philosopher Wittgenstein) that the meaning of a word is its use in language, together with ideas from logicians about harmony between rules for introducing and using logical symbols.The intended application is to allow development of better computational techniques for making sense of fragments of natural language.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D064015/1","grantId":"EP/D064015/1","fundValue":"59303","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-08-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Roy  Dyckhoff","coPersons":["James  McKinna"],"organisation":"University of St Andrews","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
