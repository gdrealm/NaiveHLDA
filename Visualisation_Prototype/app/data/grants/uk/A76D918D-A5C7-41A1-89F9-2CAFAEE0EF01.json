Research has investigated what adults find attractive in faces and found certain key preferences, such as symmetry, healthiness, averageness, and (in women) femininity. We also prefer faces which bear a slight resemblance to our parents, perhaps due to childhood learning. However, we know very little about how we come to develop these preferences. Although even newborns agree with adults about what is generally attractive, very little research has considered which of the elements given above may underlie children's preferences.</p>\n\n<p>This research will conduct a systematic study of children aged 6 to 18 years, to give a 'snapshot' of how preferences may differ across age groups. Based on the results of this study, it will be possible to determine for instance, which preferences are present from early childhood and how other preferences develop (eg is puberty important?).</p>\n\n<p>The project will also investigate the phenomenon of attraction to parental features amongst a group of children whose relationships with their carers have already been studied in infancy. This will enable consideration of the relationship between parental features and facial preferences, with long term reliable data, rather than relying on adults' recall.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H034773/1","grantId":"ES/H034773/1","fundValue":"75326","fundStart":"2010-07-26","fundEnd":"2011-07-25","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  Results of Study 1 were published this year; Study 2 will likely be published in 2015.

","person":"Lynda Gaynor Boothroyd","coPersons":["Elizabeth  Meins"],"organisation":"Durham University","findingsText":" In study 1, we documented, for the first time, how our preferences for certain 'attractive' facial features develop across childhood, from 4 to 17 years of age. Generally, the ability to explicitly feel a preference for symmetric over asymemtric faces, and healthy over unthealthy faces, appears around about ages 6-9, and increases by age 17, often with a dip or plateau around 10-14 years.\nIn Study 2 we found evidence that the current strength of relationship between a parent and child predicts the degree to which the child likes faces which resemble the parent. In contrast, there was no evidence that the past relationship between parent and child predicted the current liking for parent-like faces. This suggests that the tendancy in heterosexual adults to prefer partners which somewhat resemble our opposite sex parent, may be built on childhood associations with our parents. The results of Study 1 provide rich grounds for further research investigating the emergence of adult physical attraction. In particular, our results in the 4-10 year olds suggest that adrenal hormones, released in the early stages of puberty, may activate an interest in these features. Our results amongst the 10-14 year olds suggest that cognitive changes during puberty may also have a delaying-impact on the overal trajectory of emergence. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
