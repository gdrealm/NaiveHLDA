These short, intensive residential courses will augment existing subject-specific training for research students in social anthropology, at both introductory and advanced levels. </p> \n<p>The courses will contribute to the development of a consortium approach to postgraduate training in Scotland. Introductory students will be trained in innovative methods of field research, while advanced students and early career researchers will have the opportunity to relate their own work to cutting-edge thinking in the discipline, as represented in the work of its foremost international scholars, while also working with academic and non-academic practitioners on key areas of career development.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-035-25-0015","grantId":"RES-035-25-0015","fundValue":"75076","fundStart":"2006-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathan  Spencer","coPersons":["Tim  Ingold","Justin  Kenrick","Roy  Dilley"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
