This will be realised by:\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>producing a series of fully documented teaching datasets based on the British Cohort Studies housed at the Centre for Longitudinal Studies. </li>\n\n <li>accompanying these datasets with appropriate teaching resources.</li>\n\n <li>publicising, and supporting these materials using a series of workshops aimed at academics in higher education. </li>\n\n</ol> \n\n<p>These resources will aim to explore the following themes within longitudinal research:</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>Predicting later outcomes (e.g. unemployment) from earlier circumstances (e.g. poor health).</li>\n\n <li>Describing and understanding individual change over time </li>\n\n <li>Describing and understanding the timing of events (e.g. time to first cohabitation or marriage)</li>\n\n <li>Comparing the outcomes for those exposed and not exposed to a social intervention (e.g. the Childrenâ€™s Fund).</li>\n\n <li>Making comparisons between cohorts for themes 1) to 3).</li>\n\n</ol> \n\n<p>In addition to being valuable for supporting the teaching of quantitative methods, these teaching datasets will also be of value to the wider research community who use the British Cohort Studies as they will make available a number of standard derived variables that researchers can use in their analyses.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PTA-035-25-0008","grantId":"PTA-035-25-0008","fundValue":"103091","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Jane  Elliott","coPersons":["Ian  Plewis"],"organisation":"Institute of Education","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
