These different forms are termed enantiomers and much effort in modern synthetic organic chemistry as been devoted to developing efficient routes that facilitate the selective preparation of one enantiomer over another. One of the more established ways to address this problem is to attach a chiral auxiliary to the substrate of choice, the function of which is to control the selectivity of a given process, followed by subsequent removal and recovery of the auxiliary. We have previously developed efficient methodology that employs an alternative auxiliary approach using an asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of chiral substituted anthracenes. This methodology has been very successful for a number of alkene substrates and we have developed efficient chemical syntheses of several classes of natural products. This project aims to considerably widen the scope and applicability of this process by developing the first catalytic asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition of anthracene and its derivatives. We aim to conduct a series of optimisations to map the reactivity and selectivity of appropriate anthracene and alkene substrates. Once this has been performed we will conduct asymmetric transformations of the products obtained, in particular looking at Grignard additions and enolate alkylation. The chemistry developed will then be applied to the preparation of two structurally related natural product targets to showcase the efficiency of the overall procedure. In parallel to the work described here, we will also aim to develop alternative catalyst systems based up cis-2-amino-indan-1-ol, a catalyst precursor for which we have considerable experience.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078474/1","grantId":"EP/D078474/1","fundValue":"126491","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The primary manuscript from this research has attracted 11 citations since published in a variety of mainstream peer reviewed journals.

The catalyst facilitated the selective formation of one isomer of the chiral anthracene product in high yield. Selective functional group manipulation of these product, followed by removal of the anthracene template resulted in the preparation of a range of enantiomerically enriched products. \n\nThe process was extended to a numbewr of other dienophiles the best being maleimide derivatives. A reasonable level of selectivity was observed with these reaction partners and the selective functional group manipulation of these molecules explored. These finding were applied to the attempted synthesis of the natural product buzonamine.\n\nPreliminary data was also obtained on the use of organocatalysts to perform the desymmetrisation of a prochiral anthracene, with encouraging results. The most appropriate place for this work to be used in a non-academic context will be in the drug discovery process, whereby efficient chemical protocols that are useful to produce materials on circa. 100 mg scale are required. In the first stage of our work, published in Organic Letters, we developed a robust and reliable system that allows the synthesis of a series of allylic alcohols in good enantiomeric purity. More importantly, this work highlighted the potnential to use a catalytic asymmetric process to promote the cycloaddition of a dienophile with an anthracene derivative, followed by selective manipulation of the templated substrate.
