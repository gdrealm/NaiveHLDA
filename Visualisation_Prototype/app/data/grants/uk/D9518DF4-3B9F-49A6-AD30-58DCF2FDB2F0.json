{"id":"D9518DF4-3B9F-49A6-AD30-58DCF2FDB2F0","title":"Initiation of DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis","abstractText":"Reorganising the architecture of the bacterial genetic material is a complicated and dynamic process with crucial consequences to bacterial physiology. Significant reorganisation of the genetic material is required to set the scene for the start of DNA replication and also to assist the separation of the new genetic material from the old one. The molecular mechanisms behind DNA reorganisation and remodelling are not understood. We have recently discovered that two essential replication proteins known as DnaD and DnaB from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis exhibit significant opposing DNA-remodelling activities. In an effort to establish whether these remodelling activities are of direct relevance to DNA replication and to bacterial physiology we are now concentrating our efforts to reveal the molecular mechanisms that underpin these remodelling activities and also to study the effects of limiting these two proteins in the cell. We are aiming to solve the crystal structures of the two domains of DnaD and also of the full-length protein. Mutagenesis methods in parallel with the structural studies but also assisted by the forth-coming structures, together with supercoiling and genetic complementation experiments will be used to study the mechanisms of DNA remodelling and their significance to bacterial physiology. The findings of this study will be crucial if we are to undertand how the genetic material is reorganised in relation to DNA replication in a large class of bacteria known as gram positives. This class of bacteria contains important pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus (responsible for MRSA infections) and our findings will be of general applicability to the discovery of new antibiotic targets.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E006450/1","grantId":"BB/E006450/1","fundValue":"353792","fundStart":"2007-04-10","fundEnd":"2010-10-09","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  I'm a Scientist is a science dialogue event where school students talk to real scientists online for two weeks. It's in the form of an X Factor style competition between scientists, who compete for a prize of ?500.\n\nFor two weeks students read about the scientists' work, ask them questions, and engage in live text chats with them. The students vote for the scientist they want to get the money. The scientists with the fewest votes are evicted until only one is left to be crowned the winner. The event is supported by carefully developed and tested resources which develop students' skills and deepen their understanding.\n\n\n\nThe event is funded by the Wellcome Trust. It's a fantastic science enrichment event for teaching How Science Works in schools, but more than that, it truly engages young people with real live science. Every single scientist and teacher who has taken part in the event says they would recommend it to a colleague.\n\nThe event is supported by the National Science Learning Centres and by the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement.

Crystal structure of the N-domain of Bacillus subtilis DnaD solved.\n\n\n\n2. The NMR structure of the C-terminal domain of DnaD was determined and the molecular details that underpin its interaction with DNA revealed.\n\n\n\n3. The surprising structural/domain similarity of DnaD and DnaB was discovered.\n\n\n\n4. The DNA untwisting and looping activities of DnaD were confirmed by single molecule atomic force spectroscopy. We revealed that the scaffold forming activity is required for efficient untwisting of the double helix.\n\n\n\n5. The functions of the DnaB domains were revealed. The importance of the C-terminal domain of DnaB in oriC interaction and oligomerization were discovered, using in vivo ChIP-chip assays.\n\n\n\n6. Using RT-PCR we revealed the expression profiles of the dnaD, dnaB and dnaI genes during the different growth phases.\n\n\n\n7. Using DnaD and DnaB as probes in vivo we revealed that co-directional replication-transcription collisions under high growth conditions pose a significant problem in B. subtilis that requires the intervention of the replication restart machinery.\n\n\n\nAll of our objectives were achieved (see above). \n\n\n\nThe only objective that was not achieved was to reveal the structure of the full length DnaD protein. Instead, we have solved the structures of its individual domains; crystal structure of the scaffold forming N-terminal domain and NMR structure of the DNA-binding C-terminal domain. The structural information we have provided (the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain and the NMR structure of the C-terminal domain) for the essential replication initiation protein DnaD can be utilized for targeted antibiotic development against low G+C content firmicutes such as bacilli, staphylococci, streptococci and clostridia. This is a protein unique to bacteria and essential for DNA replication. Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
