Such memory failures can result from deficits in encoding experiences into memory effectively, or from impairments in retrieving information that has been stored. The proposed research aims to understand the factors underpinning these memory failures and, just as importantly, explore strategies designed to support and enhance older adults' memory abilities. The investigation will use novel cognitive tasks and advanced brain imaging methods to explore how variability in the structure and function of the brain influences the degree to which older adults can benefit from encoding and retrieval strategies designed to enhance recollection.\n\nThere are three main components to the project. The first component aims to identify the key cognitive processes and brain mechanisms governing effective encoding strategies that older adults can implement to enable the formation of rich and vivid memory representations. The second component will explore methods to promote the adoption by older adults of retrieval processes that can maximize successful recollection. The third component aims to assess the degree to which differences in specific brain regions and networks can predict how effectively individuals are able to benefit from the encoding and retrieval strategies tested. \n\nThe findings of the proposed research will advance understanding of how variations in brain structure and function can help to predict the usefulness of different memory strategies for older adults. These advances will feed into the development of rehabilitation approaches designed to enhance memory abilities in the elderly, with the potential for providing tangible improvements in quality of life and wellbeing.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L02263X/1","grantId":"BB/L02263X/1","fundValue":"378743","fundStart":"2014-09-30","fundEnd":"2017-09-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Jon  Simons","coPersons":["Richard  Henson"],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
