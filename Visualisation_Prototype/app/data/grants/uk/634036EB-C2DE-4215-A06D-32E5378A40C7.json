In common with other European countries, campylobacters are the most commonly recorded cause of acute bacterial enteritis in the UK with 57,772 cases of campylobacteriosis reported to the Health Protection Agency in 2009. However, due to under-reporting the true incidence could be 8-fold higher with estimated costs to the UK economy approaching &pound;600 million per annum. Birds in general naturally carry the bacteria but it is poultry that act as a major vehicle for the infection of the humans through undercooked meat or cross-contamination of other foods in the kitchen. This project will investigate use bacteriophage as a sustainable form of biocontrol against Camplyobacter colonizing and contaminating poultry and poultry meat. Bacteriophage, often simply called phage, are viruses that kill bacteria. Phage are quite specific, they will only affect the target bacteria and not other bacterial flora. They are also common in the environment such that all people encounter them on a daily basis, which includes their presence on fresh produce. The application of phages to kill campylobacters on chickens therefore represents a natural and sustainable measure to reduce the numbers of the pathogen entering the food chain from this source. The optimal use of phage therapy will require good understanding of phage-Campylobacter interactions at all stages of poultry farming and processing. This proposal will build a comprehensive understanding of Campylobacter-bacteriophage interactions in poultry from colonization of the birds to presentation of the meat at retail. It will combine laboratory work and predictive modelling to design protocols for optimal practical phage therapy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I024682/1","grantId":"BB/I024682/1","fundValue":"400250","fundStart":"2011-09-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Bacterial infections of man and animals impact directly on human health and food quality. The rise in antibiotic resistance has adversely impacted on our ability to treat these infections. Bacteriophage are naturally occurring viruses that specifically kill target bacteria, and have the potential to be used for therapeutic and food disinfection purposes. We have developed models and application parameters that will assist in the practical application of bacteriophage.
