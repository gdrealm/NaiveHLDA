{"id":"A7627264-8786-4B78-AC44-333E5CF48573","title":"Hyper-saline brine discharges into tidal coastal waters","abstractText":"The project will investigate the processes affecting the dilution of dense, concentrated brine when it is discharged from an industrial outfall diffuser into coastal waters. Concentrated brine is produced as a waste product from solution mining and desalination plants and it is harmful to marine fauna and flora when it is discharged into coastal waters. This project will model the ways in which the concentration of brine is diluted by mixing with the coastal waters and it will quantify the mixing taking place as the brine spreads away from the outfall diffuser under the action of currents and background turbulence. The problem will be modelled by means of laboratory experiments, mathematical analyses and computer simulations so that the important mixing processes can be understood, parameterised and quantified. Archived field monitoring measurements taken on a regular basis from the waters around an existing brine discharge diffuser will also be analysed and compared with the modelling results and predictions. By combining these modelling and field approaches, the results of the project can be used to provide guidance to outfall designers and environmental monitoring agencies to enable them to predict brine dilution and contamination.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/G066353/1","grantId":"EP/G066353/1","fundValue":"170368","fundStart":"2010-03-01","fundEnd":"2013-08-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  To date our findings have been reported in journal publications, at international conferences and been shared with our scientific steering group. The latter are potentially key user of the results and we are continuing to interact with them. However currently despite this engagement, it is too early stage to identify impact beyond academia.  ","person":"Andrew James Hogg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" We have investigated the hydraulic controls on the flows of hypersaline releases using mathematical models. In particular, we have analysed the ways in which mixing between the dense fluid and its surroundings modify the evolution. Our results come from mathematical modelling, analysis and computation. They show that previous models that neglect the effects of mixing may have failed to capture the key features of the motion.\n\nWe have also investigated flows in the presence of a sustained current. In three dimensions this means that while they may initially propagate radially from source, the current eventually deflects this buoyancy-driven motion and leads to the dense fluid moving downstream. This competition between density-driven motion and a sustained current is also found in other settings than just tidal waters - most notably in the atmosphere where winds deflect volcanic ash clouds. Our models have been applied to this latter setting as well.\n\nFinally, with project partner Continsecu, we have compared the output from 'simplified' mathematical models to that from complex computational fluid dynamics. The particular scenario investigated was density-driven flow through a sparse porous matrix - and we analysed how the 'simplified' models were able to capture the dynamics revealed by the more complete, but length and expensive simulations. This is important because it places the reduced modelling on a secure basis for use in other scenarios. The next stage would be to apply our results at field scale. Can our new models interpret the concentration and potential dilution of discharges in coastal waters? This has the potential to impact upon and inform campaigns of environmental monitoring.\n\nIn terms of atmospheric dispersion by wind and buoyant processes, we have demonstrated weakness in current operational models of volcanic ash dispersion and have identified that buoyancy-induced processes need to be included to produce a more complete model of the motion Environment","dataset":"gtr"}
