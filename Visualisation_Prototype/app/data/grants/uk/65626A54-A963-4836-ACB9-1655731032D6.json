In the absence of vital statistics by ethnic groups, the Own Child method applied to LFS and census data will be used to derive fertility estimates of ethnic and religious groups. </p>\n\n<p>The results will serve population projections to mid-century and beyond of the main ethnic minority populations, including mixed populations, and using cohort-component methods. Migration rates will be based on ONS International Migration Statistics, LFS and census data and projected on various assumptions. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, estimates of fertility rates and other demographic information for the major religious (and non-religious) groups will be produced with a view to making preliminary projections of their future size. The potential convergence of the demographic characteristics of ethnic and religious groups will be analysed, including mixed unions as an indicator for integration.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F003633/1","grantId":"ES/F003633/1","fundValue":"90767","fundStart":"2008-01-07","fundEnd":"2010-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sylvie  Dubuc","coPersons":["David Anwyll Coleman"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
