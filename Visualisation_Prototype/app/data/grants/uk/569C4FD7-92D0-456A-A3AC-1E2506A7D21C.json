{"id":"569C4FD7-92D0-456A-A3AC-1E2506A7D21C","title":"Loughborough University - Equipment Account","abstractText":"This proposal requests capital infrastructure to create ThemExS Lab, a future centre of excellence for research on exergy storage involving high-grade heat. The proposal builds on the growing international consensus that heat capture, conversion and storage will become increasingly important in the move to a\nlow carbon energy system and our analysis that it is likely to play a pivotal role in providing cost effective energy storage options both at the very large centralized and small distributed grid-scales.\n\nThis revised version of the bid still covers the three categories in the original proposal, however to meet the reduction in funding to &pound;1.7 million a significant reduction in the scale of the transition scale test platforms has been made. In addition, further discount arrangements are being negotiated with a number of\nsuppliers, which has enabled greater value from the investment)\n\nThe division of funds between categories is now\n(A) Materials characterisation equipment for high grade heat storage materials (&pound;0.536M)\n(B) Bench scale test platforms for examining heat transfer, fluid flow and storage density (&pound;0.297M)\n(C) Transition scale test platforms giving insight into full scale system behaviours (&pound;0.866M).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L018098/1","grantId":"EP/L018098/1","fundValue":"2555640","fundStart":"2014-01-23","fundEnd":"2024-01-22","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  This grant is an EPSRC University Capital Equipment Account, and we are currently in the early stages of procuring equipment for three awards that have been made under this main account . These are: 1)Prof Phil Eames in the School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, was the first recipient of this funding, which has been awarded across three institutions - Loughborough, Nottingham and Warwick. The analytical equipment for characterisation of thermal properties of materials is being installed, and the larger scale thermal storage test facilities are under tender.\nThe facilities that have been developed are already attracting interest from international and industrial visitors.\n\n2) Recently Prof David Williams and 3)Prof Paul Conway, from the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, have both received CDT related funding through this account, and they are still in the process of buying their equipment for completion by 31 March 2015. Their projects are also in collaboration with other institutions - 2) Nottingham and Keele, 3) Herriott Watt.
