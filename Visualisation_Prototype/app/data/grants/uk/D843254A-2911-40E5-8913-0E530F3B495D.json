But what happens when perceivers encounter targets that belong to multiple social categories and can be stereotyped in multiple ways? Specifically, how do perceivers understand targets when the relevant stereotypes are incongruent with each other – for example, when they meet an Oxford-educated bricklayer? How do they reconcile one stereotype about intellectual ability with another seemingly contradictory stereotype about preference for manual labour? Causal reasoning (reasoning about “why”) and executive function (processes that manage complex behaviour) have been suggested as two mechanisms that underlie the ability to form coherent person impressions, and the aim of this research is to explore these processes in stereotype combination. </p>\n\n<p>The research focuses on the problem of construing targets with conflicting social category memberships, and will adapt theoretical and methodological approaches from cognitive psychology to explore the specific processes that underlie flexible stereotype use. Gaining a greater understanding of how perceivers understand others who belong to multiple categories is crucial: in an increasingly multicultural world, perceivers are exposed increasingly to targets with cross-cutting social category memberships, and societal functioning is contingent on how perceivers make sense of the sometimes conflicting information associated with these memberships.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2236","grantId":"RES-000-22-2236","fundValue":"79785","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2008-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kimberly  Quinn","coPersons":["Russell Robert Hutter","Daniel  Carroll"],"organisation":"University of Birmingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
