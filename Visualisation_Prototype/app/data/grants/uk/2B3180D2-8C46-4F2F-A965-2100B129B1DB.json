These materials have attracted considerable interest as they offer a possibility to realise extraordinary electromagnetic properties important for optics, communications and electronics. Nanocomposite metamaterials also promise a whole variety of amazing applications, e.g., an optical lens beating the diffraction limit, a nanolens focusing light into a sub-wavelength spot, a supersensitive plasmonic nano-sensor, and active optical elements.\n\nAs in any &quot;natural&quot; material, coupling between &quot;nano-atoms&quot; and &quot;nano-molecules&quot; plays an important role allowing one to achieve new material properties and functionalities. Recently, we have experimentally observed several new interesting phenomena connected to coupling of localised plasmon resonances in plasmonic nano-arrays: i) quantized transparency of plasmonic arrays coupled by a thin conducting sub-layer ii) extremely narrow plasmon resonances produced by diffractive coupling iii) cascaded enhancements of electromagnetic fields produced by near-field coupling. \n\nThese findings are still under investigation and promise new exciting applications: ultra-sensitive plasmonic nano-sensors, extremely fast optical modulators and nano-focusing of light without lenses. The proposal aims to expand our initial findings into a viable research programme based on our current competitive advantage in exploration of coupled plasmon resonances. We will fabricate regular arrays of plasmonic nanomolecules and elucidate coupling mechanisms in all three cases. The main focus of our research will be 1) to engineer and fabricate plasmonic nanomaterials in which an optical response can be changed with the change of the coupling induced by graphene gating, 2) to elucidate the nature of diffractive coupled plasmon resonances and tailor nanomaterials for label-free plasmon nanosensors and 3) to study cascaded enhancement of electromagnetic fields. We plan not only to fabricate new optical composite nanomaterials and study their extraordinary electromagnetic properties but also to assess some of their applications, which we believe are the most promising and within our expertise (feasibility study of graphene based plasmonic optical modulator and plasmonic waveguide, phase sensitive nano-sensor, etc.).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K011022/1","grantId":"EP/K011022/1","fundValue":"381130","fundStart":"2013-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Our results will be important first and foremost for academic community. The theory of the collective plasmon resonances, quantized plasmonic will be useful for nanooptics and photonics. The new metamaterials based on regular arrays and plasmonic nanolenses will be stimulating and important for metamaterials community, scientists interested in bio- and chemical sensing. The last but not the least, the graphene-based plasmonic devices could useful for optoelectronics.
