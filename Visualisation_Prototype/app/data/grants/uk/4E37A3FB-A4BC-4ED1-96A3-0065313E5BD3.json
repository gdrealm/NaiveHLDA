{"id":"4E37A3FB-A4BC-4ED1-96A3-0065313E5BD3","title":"Extremal Combinatorics","abstractText":"Extremal Combinatorics studies relations between various parameters of discrete structures. This area experienced a remarkable growth in the last few decades. Various aspects of Computer Science and Operations Research motivated by large-scale practical problems have been relying on more and more sophisticated combinatorial techniques and have posed a whole array of new challenging problems in Discrete Mathematics. At the same time, the development of powerful and deep mathematical methods has greatly expanded the horizon of combinatorial questions that can be approached now, meeting many of the above challenges. \n\nThe project will concentrate on central questions of Extremal Combinatorics. Two examples are the the Turan function that asks how local restrictions can affect the global size of a hypergraph and the Ramsey theory that investigates whether large structures contain highly ordered substructures. These problems seem to be notoriously difficult and even some basic questions remain open. The previous attempts, although not completely successful, led to a number of useful techniques and insights. Some recent developments (such as hypergraph regularity, graph limits, and flag algebras) give us new powerful tools that may be instrumental in obtaining progress on these problems. The project aims at achieving a better understanding of these areas and developing generally useful methods and techniques.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K012045/1","grantId":"EP/K012045/1","fundValue":"265270","fundStart":"2013-12-01","fundEnd":"2016-11-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Since it takes months (sometimes years) for mathematical papers to be published, we have not seen any follow-up research stemming from the results funded by the grant that started in December 2013. However, it is hoped that e.g. the work on measurable Hilbert's Third Problem (in progress) will have considerable impact.

Also, by using combinatorial techniques, L.Grabowski, A.Mathe and O.Pikhurko proved a measurable version of Hilbert's Third Problem: namely, that one can cut a cube into finitely many measurable parts and rearrange them to form a regular tetrahedron. The methods that were developed may be useful for other problems. Also, the study of limits of discrete structure may lead to application of combinatorial tools to problems in analysis Other","dataset":"gtr"}
