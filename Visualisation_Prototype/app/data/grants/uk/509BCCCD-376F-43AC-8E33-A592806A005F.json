Three HE institutions will participate in this project; a large comprehensive University, a campus based old University and a specialist college. A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed to maximise the breadth and depth of information gathered. Data collection will include a large scale questionnaire, focus groups and educational life history interviews with students from three differing institutions. Outcomes will inform the national debate about degree outcomes for different student groups and satisfaction levels between some student groups.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2485","grantId":"RES-000-22-2485","fundValue":"79813","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mary  Stuart","coPersons":["Catherine  Lido"],"organisation":"Kingston University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
