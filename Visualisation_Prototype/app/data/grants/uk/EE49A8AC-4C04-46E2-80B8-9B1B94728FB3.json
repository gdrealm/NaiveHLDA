Drawing on existing understanding and methodological approaches from both the developmental and cognitive psychology literatures, the project will identify the pattern of developmental changes in the specific cognitive processes children engage when remembering events, namely the nature of engagement of the episodic retrieval processes of familiarity and recollection. This project will also identify how the pattern of changes in a range of executive control functions known to develop during childhood, including working memory, planning, attention flexibility, and inhibitory control processes, influence the engagement of episodic retrieval processes in children. The relationship between developmental changes in functioning of the components of working memory (as characterised by a popular cognitive model) and episodic retrieval processes will also be examined. This study thus expects to provide essential information for a comprehensive understanding of children’s ability to remember events.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-2621","grantId":"RES-000-22-2621","fundValue":"69113","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2008-11-13","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Sinead  Rhodes","coPersons":["Peter  Hancock"],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
