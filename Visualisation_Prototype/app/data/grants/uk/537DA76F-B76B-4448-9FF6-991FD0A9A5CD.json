{"id":"537DA76F-B76B-4448-9FF6-991FD0A9A5CD","title":"UK MAD BEAMLINE AT ESRF","abstractText":"Macromolecular crystallography is the most powerful method available to biologists to determine the precise three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within proteins and other complex biological molecules. By tuning the wavelength of X-rays such that they interact strongly with certain atoms within the molecule researchers can more easily unravel the complete structure. This method is called MAD and this grant asks for funds to provide open access to all UK researchers to one of the top MAD beamlines in Europe. The output of BM14 will be several hundred new structures some of which are likely to be of great biomedical importance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500367","grantId":"G0500367","fundValue":"1699610","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2008-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Stuart","coPersons":["Neil William  Isaacs","Andrew Greig Leslie","Simon Edward Phillips","Louise  Johnson","Martin Austin Walsh","Guy  Dodson"],"organisation":"Medical Research Council","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
