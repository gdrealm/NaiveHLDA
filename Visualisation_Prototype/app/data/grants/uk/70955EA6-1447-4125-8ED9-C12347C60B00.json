{"id":"70955EA6-1447-4125-8ED9-C12347C60B00","title":"Addressing the SME Energy Challenge","abstractText":"While products for monitoring and communicating energy use in the home are now common place and large businesses have their own dedicated teams for reducing energy waste, SMEs (Small to Medium Enterprises) have been a missing sector when it comes to developing solutions for allowing consumers to take control of their own energy efficiency.\n\nThe focus of this proposal is to better understand how energy is consumed in SMEs through the analysis of real time data and the development of SME energy management profiles, to study the potential to positively influence occupant behaviour towards an ongoing reduction in consumption and to develop test devices and software that will help verify the viability of new products that could be commercialised to SMEs in UK and overseas markets. \n\nThe project will observe and conduct interviews with staff and building occupants at 15 sites to gather data on building energy use and occupants' behaviour on energy consumption. Sites will be selected to reflect a broad cross section of business and building types and a range of occupancy.\n\nThe building energy consumption data and end-user information will be used in developing a system that generates detailed energy consumption profiles for a wide range of SME business types and buildings. The profiles will be used to identify clusters of energy user types according to criteria including sector, occupancy, building type and building use, as well as to identify poor energy performance and wasteful patterns of energy use. This cluster information, together with qualitative data collected from interviews conducted with occupants of SME buildings, will be used to derive targeted requirements specifications for each of those clusters.\n\nHardware will then be developed to measure real time energy use along side other relevant data sets, such as ambient temperature. Software will be developed to analyse the data and deliver real-time targeted and timely information to building occupants that helps them to make better decisions (and verify the results of good decisions) about energy use such that occupant behaviour changes, leading to persistent energy consumption reduction.\n\nEnergy use information will be delivered in a format that responds to the role and responsibility of different end-user types in real time to the customer's preferred hardware device (phone, PC, tablet etc). The user interfaces for accessing this energy use information will be designed using principles from the field of information visualisation, and the range of target hardware will necessitate extending the chosen techniques and designs to work across a range of screen resolutions and\ninteraction styles such as mouse, touch-screen and stylus.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M506710/1","grantId":"EP/M506710/1","fundValue":"131526","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2016-10-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Currie","coPersons":["Jon  Stinson","R  Raeside"],"organisation":"Edinburgh Napier University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
