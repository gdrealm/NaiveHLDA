This collaboration will facilitate\ncooperation between neurologists, epidemiologists and neuropathologists 1) to harmonize the\nprotocols involved in patient documentation, biomaterial sampling/ storage, biomarker testing/assay\nanalysis and data sharing; and 2) to standardise a more precise diagnosis in patients with RPD by\nanalysis of the biochemical markers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. We will work on\nstandardisation of tests that are currently available and harmonise their use between centers\nworldwide. We will define standards for biochemically based diagnosis in most relevant rapid\nprogressive dementia such as CJD and rpAD. As an add-on value, we will define criteria for early\ndifferential diagnosis between rapid progressive neurodegenerative or potentially reversible dementia.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/J016136/1","grantId":"MR/J016136/1","fundValue":"83814","fundStart":"2012-06-01","fundEnd":"2015-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert  Will","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
