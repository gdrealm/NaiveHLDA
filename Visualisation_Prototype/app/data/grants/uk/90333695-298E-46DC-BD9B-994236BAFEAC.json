{"id":"90333695-298E-46DC-BD9B-994236BAFEAC","title":"Economic modelling of diagnostic/treatment pathways in NICE clinical guidelines","abstractText":"NICE clinical guidelines state which tests and treatments should be offered to patients by the NHS. These services should provide value for money, as well as effective care for patients. But health economists who work on guidelines do not have the time to assess the costs and health benefits of every type of service that could be provided. Instead they select services that are likely to be important ? because the costs or health effects are large - and where guideline groups are unsure of the right choice. But it is possible that this may miss important links between the services. For example, a test will only be useful if followed by the right treatment. And treatment will only work if it is given to the right patients. So the value of tests and treatments may depend on the order or combination in which they are offered to patients. In this study we want to test whether it is possible to assess a system of services recommended in a guideline ?pathway?, rather than looking at single services in isolation. To make things easier, we will start by testing our methods on two existing guidelines which are due to be updated soon. For these guidelines, the pathway of recommended services has already been decided and the evidence about these services already collected together. We will build computer models that will predict the health outcomes for patients and costs to the NHS that are likely to arise if the guidelines are followed. When NICE is deciding whether to update a guideline, it looks to see if any new evidence is available and considers whether there are parts of the guideline that it should look at again. We will collect information that arises during this process, and ask experts and patient representatives to rate the importance of updating suggested topics. We will then use the computer models to estimate the likely value of reconsidering these topics. The results of this analysis will be given to the experts and patient representatives, and they will be asked to consider whether this changes their views. In summary, we want to see if we can model the pathways of care that are recommended in NICE clinical guidelines, use the models to see if NICE should reconsider parts of the guidelines, and see if this adds anything to the current way that NICE reviews its guidelines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901504","grantId":"G0901504","fundValue":"284471","fundStart":"2010-06-01","fundEnd":"2012-05-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Joanne  Lord","coPersons":["Paul  Tappenden","Simon  Taylor","Sarah  Willis","David  Wonderling","Gethin Llywelyn Griffith","Julie  Eatock","Francis J.
