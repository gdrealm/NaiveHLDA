{"id":"2105232D-89F3-45CF-B5AB-24C057B8041E","title":"Corneal graft rejection in the inbred minipig","abstractText":"A corneal transplant (replacing the window of the eye) is often needed to restore sight to a damaged or diseased eye. Sadly about one quarter of transplants are rejected by the white cells of our immune system because they see the transplant as foreign. To learn more about how this happens we need models that closely resemble man. \n\nMinipigs could be very valuable in two ways. First, they are similar in size to humans. We therefore expect rejection (involving clouding of the cornea) to resemble human rejection very closely. Second, minipigs are partially inbred, which allows investigation of the immune response in ways that are impossible in very genetically diverse human patients.\n\nDuring the lifetime of the grant we will test how closely rejection in the minipig resembles human rejection and develop methods of measuring immunity that could be used in the clinic to prevent rejection.\n\nIf the minipig proves to be a good model, we can later use it to test new treatments, particularly gene therapy. As we are able to keep donor corneas in tissue culture for up to 30 days, genes to combat possible future rejection can be readily introduced into the cornea before the operation.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600835","grantId":"G0600835","fundValue":"300147","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Susan  Nicholls","coPersons":["Andrew David Dick","Michael  Bailey"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
