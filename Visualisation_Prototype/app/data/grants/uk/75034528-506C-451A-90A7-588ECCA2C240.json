Our scheme will focus on providing 'pump-priming' support for new research that is enabled by access to our nanofabrication tools, particularly work at the Physics/Engineering-Biology and Physics/Engineering-Chemistry interdisciplinary interfaces. Not only will we share our extensive design and process expertise with users, but we shall also provide training and support within a comprehensive package of services including nanolithography, wet &amp; dry etching, thin film deposition and SEM/AFM imaging. We will actively seek opportunities to enhance the multi-disciplinary skills of early career users (postgraduate and post-doctoral researchers) whenever possible. We also propose to purchase a new complementary direct-write laser lithography tool that will allow us to offer users a quicker and more versatile service with unique new features for advanced prototyping (e.g., 3D lithography in thick photoresist and/or on non-planar substrates).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K040324/1","grantId":"EP/K040324/1","fundValue":"185431","fundStart":"2013-08-01","fundEnd":"2017-07-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project has contributed towards the development of humidity sensors which are being used in artwork conservation projects throughout Europe.

Hence we are enabling research in other UK academic groups by providing processing expertise and access to equipment. We are currently involved in a number of projects ranging from catalysis to integrated photonics. We are particularly trying to reach academics working at the interface between physics and biology/life sciences to make use of our access scheme as this is an area where awareness of nanofabrication technology currently tends to be limited. We have run e-mail and paper advertising campaigns targeted at these groups. Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology","dataset":"gtr"}
