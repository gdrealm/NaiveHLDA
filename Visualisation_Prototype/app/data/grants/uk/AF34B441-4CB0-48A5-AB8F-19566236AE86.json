{"id":"AF34B441-4CB0-48A5-AB8F-19566236AE86","title":"The New Poetry in Wales","abstractText":"An exciting variety of poetry is currently being written in Wales by poets whose experience of Welshness has led them to explore a range of important contemporary issues relating to national identity. The Welsh, in particular, have a complex relationship to colonialism having been both colonised and (as part of the British Empire) colonisers. The new poetry in Wales responds to the challenges of this relationship by interrogating most of the key contemporary concerns, and in doing so it has evolved a fascinating diverse set of poetic techniques and forms.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112637/1","grantId":"112637/1","fundValue":"14013","fundStart":"2006-09-30","fundEnd":"2007-01-29","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Gregson","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
