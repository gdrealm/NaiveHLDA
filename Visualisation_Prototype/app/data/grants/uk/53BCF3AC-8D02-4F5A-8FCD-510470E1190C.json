{"id":"53BCF3AC-8D02-4F5A-8FCD-510470E1190C","title":"ENHANCEMENT OF PULSED-MAGNETIC FIELD FACILITY","abstractText":"The development of new materials and the understanding of their properties is contingent on cutting-edge measurement techniques. In particular, the use of intense magnetic fields has proven to be an invaluable tool in shedding light on novel magnetic, metallic and superconducting materials. Devices based upon such materials have the potential for transformative effects on technology. Although laboratory electromagnets can deliver large fields of up to 1 or 2 tesla, and superconducting magnets can reach up to 20-25 tesla, the most promising materials require significantly larger field strengths for their investigation. This EPSRC grant will enhance the pulsed-magnetic field facility at Oxford in order to achieve fields of up to 70 tesla and for longer durations than currently available. It would also foster the expertise to pursue a programme of pioneering magnet technology development. This would create a unique capability for the UK and allow specialised measurements to be performed by researchers in UK academia and industry that would not otherwise be possible. Furthermore, it would permit these scientists to exploit the scientific opportunities arising from their impressive track record in high field research and advanced materials fabrication.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K024582/1","grantId":"EP/K024582/1","fundValue":"41536","fundStart":"2013-06-30","fundEnd":"2016-04-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Stephen  Blundell","coPersons":["Paul Andrew Goddard"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
