Diagnostic and management guidelines will be published and potentially may be made more freely available, if ratified by the Clinical Genetics Society, on their website and/or as a leaflet. We have strong contacts with the Child Growth Foundation and the Sotos syndrome society who provide information and support to families with growth disorders and would make clinically relevant research findings available to them to disseminate to families. The Institute s press office reviews all research projects and where appropriate, and in consultation with the relevant funding body, the press office will communicate with the public through the media.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400188","grantId":"G0400188","fundValue":"527559","fundStart":"2005-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Nazneen  Rahman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Cancer Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
