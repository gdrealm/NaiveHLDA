{"id":"2D58A51B-2BCF-4125-BF85-F2011139AA28","title":"MEDUSA Multi Environment Deployable Universal Software Application","abstractText":"A key factor in reducing potential gun crime is to detect someone carrying a gun before they can commit a criminal act. This detection can be achieved by the existing, and widespread, CCTV camera network in the UK. However, the performance of operators in interpreting CCTV imagery is variable as they are trying to detect essentially a very rare threat event. Additionally, current automated systems for detecting possible anomalous behaviour have been found to have varying success. We propose the development of a new machine learning system for the detection of individuals carrying guns which will combine both human and machine-based factors. Using selected CCTV footage which depicts people carrying concealed guns, and other control individuals, the proposal will establish what overt and covert cues (essentially conscious and subconscious cues) experienced CCTV operators actually attend to when identifying potential gun-carrying individuals from such CCTV imagery. In parallel, a machine learning approach will establish the machine recognised cues for such individuals. The separate human and machine cues will then be combined to form a new machine learning approach which will be fully tested. The system will be capable of learning and reacting to local gun crime factors which will aid its usefulness and deployment capability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D078105/1","grantId":"EP/D078105/1","fundValue":"11416","fundStart":"2006-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Giles  Oatley","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Sunderland","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
