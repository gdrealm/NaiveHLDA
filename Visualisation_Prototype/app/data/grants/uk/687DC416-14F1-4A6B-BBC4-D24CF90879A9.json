Ethical approval for this project has been obtained from Brown University and the Comite National Dâ€™Ethique Pour La Sante et Les Sciences De La Vie in Mali</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K01207X/1","grantId":"ES/K01207X/1","fundValue":"100082","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Mark Robert Dean","coPersons":["Anja  Sautmann","Caitlin  Cohen"],"organisation":"Innovations for Poverty Action","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
