Most UK labour law is based on the 'standard employment relationship' (SER), which is a relic of the post World War Two industrial era. The SER assumes that most workers are in permanent, full time work with a single employer, and that workers do not have any obligations to care for children or dependents. A key problem for UK policy-makers is that the SER is modelled on, and contributes to, embedded inequalities between women and men in the workplace, and that it continues to place the burden of unpaid care on women.</p>\n\n<p>This project will undertake the first in-depth research into the experiences of those people who are most likely to be disadvantaged by the gender assumptions in the SER: precarious female workers with care commitments. It will investigate how the legal frameworks stemming from the SER affect the day to day lives of women balancing precarious work and care.This empirical data will then be used to feed into a new gender-sensitive vision for UK labour law and policy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K001108/1","grantId":"ES/K001108/1","fundValue":"163136","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emily Katharine  Grabham","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
