Campylobacter caused an estimated 700,000 cases of infection in the UK in 2010. Each year there are around 100 deaths as a result of this infection. It is estimated that Campylobacter infections cost the UK economy over &pound;1 billion per year. Infection is characterised by acute and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, particularly in children. The last few years have seen a marked rise in cases in elderly populations and in such people, particularly those with bowel cancer, infection can be fatal. Chicken meat is the most important source and vehicle for human Campylobacter infections and around 80% of chickens on sale in the UK are Campylobacter-positive. Campylobacter are commonly found in the intestinal tract of chickens and other food animals. Contamination of chicken meat takes two forms. Carcass surfaces can carry high levels of Campylobacter and this leads to cross-contamination in both domestic and commercial catering. This is an important risk factor for infection. However, and perhaps more importantly, Campylobacter have been recovered from deep leg and breast muscle tissues of up to 27% of chickens tested. Furthermore, liver tissues are also commonly contaminated. In these tissues the bacteria will be better protected from the effects of cooking. Undercooked chicken meat and chicken liver are internationally important vehicles of Campylobacter infection.\n\nTo improve public health in the UK it is essential that the number of contaminated chickens on sale is reduced. The ultimate aim of the proposed research in working with the UK chicken industry is to identify cost-effective control measures, which can be implemented across the poultry industry. One common feature of Campylobacter in chicken production is that there is a delay before flocks become colonised by the bacteria. The length of the delay varies between flocks and has not been accurately chracterised. The reasons for the delay have not been clearly identified and the proposed project seeks to address this important data gap and thereby identify mitigation strategies to prevent colonisation. If the mechanisms that appear to give young chickens enhanced resistance to Campylobacter can be identified it may be possible to extend the Campylobacter-free phase until the animals are sent for slaughter. Past research suggests that one mechanism is the transfer of anti-Campylobacter antibodies to the yolk of eggs laid by infected hens. If this is so, it will have implications for vaccination for Campylobacter in both broiler birds and breeders. However, past work has only examined this in isolation and our work has shown that young chickens can have a population of gut bacteria that inhibit Campylobacter. It may be that both play a part in this process. Again, this may highlight new novel ways in which to prevent Campylobacter colonisation of chickens, either directly or through dietary manipulation.\n\nOur work will focus on chickens reared intensively in housed systems as these comprise ~90% of the UK market. The work will be in direct collaboration with one of the three biggest poultry producers in the UK, with other producers and all the major UK food retailers supporting the work. We will conduct studies on housed flocks to determine when birds first become Campylobacter-infected and relate this to changes in the bird gut, where Campylobacter colonises, and changes in levels of maternal antibodies. We will use modelling to investigate direct and indirect drivers of colonisation and to identify possible targets for mitigation against colonisation. \n\nOur aim is to provide the UK poultry industry with science-based and cost-effective control options, which will help it meet customer demands and comply with forthcoming EU legislation aimed at reducing the number of chickens that are Campylobacter-positive","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J017353/1","grantId":"BB/J017353/1","fundValue":"479785","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2016-02-01","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Tom John HumphreyPaul  Wigley","coPersons":["Nicola Jane Williams"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":" The research has developed methods to analyse the role of antibody during infection of commercial broiler chickens.\nInitial work has shown that we can produce embryonated eggs free of maternal antibody and that antibody has little impact on colonisation of the intestines with Campylobacter Understanding the role of antibody is important in developing effective vaccines for Campylobacter Agriculture, Food and Drink","dataset":"gtr"}
