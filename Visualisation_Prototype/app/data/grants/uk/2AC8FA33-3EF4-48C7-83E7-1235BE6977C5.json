Combining fact &amp; fiction, the project will consist of a series of large photographs reminiscent of film still/posters, each portraying a 'fragment' of a story of an individual in exile. The term exile is used here broadly to cover people who were 'forced' to leave, regardless of where they were politically active or not.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112965/1","grantId":"112965/1","fundValue":"15301","fundStart":"2006-01-20","fundEnd":"2006-05-19","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mitra  Tabrizian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
