It is often based on uncertain information, or information extrapolated from other sites. Sites may cover many periods or have had varying functions. Our approach will help heritage managers visualize and display different stages of their site's past (and present different versions of that past if desired). We will also produce models which allow the depiction of future trends by showing different possible outcomes from different scenarios. This approach reflects widely recognised gaps within visualization and presentation and its role in heritage science, as recognised by EPOCH - the European Network of Excellence in Open Cultural Heritage - and other bodies. It involves addressing considerable challenges within visualization research, which form the first phase of the network discussions. \\n\\nThe network aims to further develop heritage science interest within and beyond the Welsh-Irish sea area. It builds on best practice examples, develops new visualization approaches and applies these techniques to two distinct but important forms of heritage - threatened coastal archaeological sites and buildings. It will discuss modelling informed by maritime, environmental and archaeological knowledge and by knowledge of building preservation and management. It embraces multiple disciplines and a range of heritage organisations, including the National Museums of Wales and Ireland, the National Trust and English Heritage. Wider understanding of this approach will be aided by using a 'rich-media' demo - an interactive video, developed from the discussions - displayed on the network website and in other locations. It will be used in subsequent workshops, in discussions with stakeholders, and will enhance the public engagement. Subsequently the cluster will identify new research challenges through, and lead to the preparation of an 'agenda setting' report. Finally, a substantial grant proposal will be submitted.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G015570/1","grantId":"AH/G015570/1","fundValue":"24340","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The networking helped to develop the consortiums for the next projects; working with Aberystwyth University and also with Manchester Metropolitan University.

The project focused on two distinct but important forms of heritage - threatened coastal archaeological sites and buildings. We ran 4 workshops on Heritage Visualization, Heritage modelling, visualization and multivocality, and virtual reality techniques for science and heritage. \n\nWe discovered that (1) new tools and techniques should be developed to allow presentation, interpretation and display of uncertainty. These tools need to take into consideration alternative viewpoints, multivocality, different tasks and alternative display methods. (2) That there are many different ways to present, render and view and interpret heritage data, and users have different skills, as such authorship tools need to allow non-ICT specialists to use digital assets. (3) There is a requirement to develop novel interface techniques for displaying heritage data. Digital Communication and ICT sectors can be empowered to develop the next generation of software that addresses alternative views and multivocality. \n\nThe work was taken forward and influenced the next AHRC project that was funded. Culture and Heritage communities can consider these results to plan for more interactive and accessible tools.
