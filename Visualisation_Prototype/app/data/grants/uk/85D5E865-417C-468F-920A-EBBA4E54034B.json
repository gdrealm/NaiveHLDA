This 22 month project explored the Black presence in London in relation to the interwar art world, exploring themes including the life experiences and public reception of artists and artist models of African and Asian heritage, and spaces of the London art world in relation to political and anti-colonial activity, gender, sexuality, and race and identity. The research focused on recovering and recording two main strands of these geographies. First, the artworks created during the period of Black people in London, and second, artworks created by African and Asian artists while they were studying, working or travelling through interwar London. Within these strands we focused our research on locating and investigating artists and sitters, along with the social and political networks surrounding these individuals. The results of these searches were compiled into a publicly accessible database with over 600 entries relating to the fields artists, sitters, artworks, and exhibitions. \n\nThe aim of this aspect of the project is to engage the public, particularly BME and queer audiences with the many historical geographies recovered as part of Drawing Over the Colour Line. This will be done in two key ways. Firstly with an exhibition at Tate Britain 'Spaces of Black Modernism' will enable tens of thousands of visitors - perhaps more - to view, for free, material not previously accessible to the public. Accompanying public events will include a 'show and tell' of archival materials at Tate Library and Archives and two self-guided tours of Pimlico and Chelsea to add to the tours of Black Bloomsbury and Soho already created for Drawing Over the Colour Line. Secondly we will be engaging community groups with the empirical findings of Drawing Over the Colour Line through the project's database completed as part of our research project, and through workshops curated in partnership with museums including the Black Cultural Archives in the year it officially opens. \n\nDr Gemma Romain will be Black Modernism's Research Associate, and with Dr Caroline Bressey will curate the public programme and with Dr Emma Chambers co-write and co-curate the Tate Display as well as organising the development of public events based at University College London.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/M003469/1","grantId":"AH/M003469/1","fundValue":"79262","fundStart":"2014-11-01","fundEnd":"2015-10-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Tanya Caroline Bressey","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
