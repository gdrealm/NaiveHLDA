Alexandropoulos","abstractText":"In recent years polarisation dynamics in vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) has been the subject of considerable research effort. A wide range of phenomena including polarisation switching, bistability, limit cycles and chaos has been studied theoretically and experimentally in VCSELs subject to orthogonal optical injection. The active regions of these VCSELs have consisted of bulk or quantum well (QW) material. At the same time, there have been significant advances in the technology of quantum dot (QD) VCSELs, whose key advantages include an excitonic gain mechanism, suppressed carrier diffusion and low degradation rate. Recent research has concentrated on development of QD gain media to give ultrahigh modal gain and enhanced modulation response. Novel VCSEL cavity designs have also been developed to suppress parasitic modes which can cause gain depletion and self-pulsation. However, there are as yet very few reports of polarisation-dependent effects for these QD VCSELs. The theoretical study of polarised optical injection in QD VCSELs that is proposed here represents an entirely new research direction of fundamental importance that is certain to further enhance the UK's optoelectronics research profile.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H00873X/1","grantId":"EP/H00873X/1","fundValue":"68349","fundStart":"2009-10-19","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Henning","coPersons":["Mike  Adams"],"organisation":"University of Essex","findingsText":" A new theoretical model has been derived to describe the behaviour of spin-polarised vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that use quantum dot (QD) material as the active layer. In the appropriate limit it has been shown that the model reduces to the corresponding case when quantum well (QW) material is used as the active layer. The new model for QD spin-VCSELs has been used to investigate regions of stable and unstable dynamics for these devices as functions of device parameters and operating conditions. It is also being applied to study the effects of polarised optical injection into QD spin-VCSELs. This research could be used to aid the study (experimental and theoretical) of QD spin-VCSELs, both solitary and when subject to polarised optical injection. It has been found that spin-VCSELs can exhibit very high frequency periodic oscillations, not limited by the relaxation oscillation frequency, under certain conditions of continuous wave optical pumping. These oscillations are potentially applicable as sources for microwave photonics, e.g. for radio-over-fibre. Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)","dataset":"gtr"}
