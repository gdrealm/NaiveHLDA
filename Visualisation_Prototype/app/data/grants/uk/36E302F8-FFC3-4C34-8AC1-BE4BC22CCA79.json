We will use this probe to measure when this activity first appears and then alter the cell in defined ways to work out what causes it to become active. This work should help us to understand how cells trigger cell division and eventually may lead to a better understanding of how this can go wrong in cancer.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0800033","grantId":"G0800033","fundValue":"275879","fundStart":"2008-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jonathon  Pines","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
