This centre is one of the country’s leading Muslim community associations, offering a wide range of social welfare and educational services aimed at young and old, men and women, recent immigrants and UK-born Muslims of all ethnic backgrounds, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>One aim of our joint work is to explore the relationship between what Robert Putnam has called ‘bonding’ and ‘bridging’ social capital, ie forms of association that bring members of a particular group closer together versus those that involve ties across group boundaries. The extent to which bonding either contributes to, or inhibits, the formation of bridging social capital is an open question. The Didsbury Islamic Centre has been involved primarily in bonding activities but is interested in promoting engagement with civic society.</p>\n\n<p>Our related research concerns the relationship between residential segregation and social segregation, the extent to which segregation arises for reasons that are positive (eg desire to maintain cultural networks and services) or negative (such as deprivation and discrimination), the meaning of integration, the formation of bridging social capital, etc. We aim to explore how these concepts apply in an everyday setting.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0062","grantId":"RES-172-25-0062","fundValue":"7049","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"David  Voas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
