This project evaluates the role of environmental consultancies in LAQM consultation and engages them with the guidance document “Steps to Better Practice Guidance for Local Authorities on LAQM Consultation” produced as a result of a previous ESRC funded research project. This will also help embed the guidance in practices which will potentially increase the effectiveness of public services and public policy. </p>\n\n<p>A questionnaire survey delivers the first audit of services offered by environmental consultancies acting as an intermediary between local authorities and stakeholders involved in air quality management. This will be followed by in-depth interaction and knowledge transfer with the environmental consultancy business sector through the use of focus groups and case studies. Barriers experienced by the sector that limit the implementation of the guidance document are explored and strategies identified that facilitate its uptake.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-172-25-0047","grantId":"RES-172-25-0047","fundValue":"20483","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"James William Stuart  Longhurst","coPersons":["Nurul Soraya Leksmono","Emma  Weitkamp"],"organisation":"University of the West of England","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
