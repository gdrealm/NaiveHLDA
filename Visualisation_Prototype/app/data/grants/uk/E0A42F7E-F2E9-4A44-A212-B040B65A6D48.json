Three projects were funded and their findings have have been used as desccribed below under each project heading:\n\n1). 3D Milling\nThere is a growing industry for miniaturised devices, many on the micrometre or nanometre scale. The manufacture of such devices presents a challenge to the industry, particularly for devices which can be manufactured with high reliability and precision. The project demonstrated a method of manufacture of an extremely simple system that produces optical lenses operating as diffraction-limit-beating super resolution lenses. Several examples of the film lenses were produced and tested on conventional optical microscopes. the method developed for the simplest version is extremely low cost. They have been primarily designed for use in optical microscopy where there is a huge requirement to image beyond the diffraction limit, to image (for example) cell structure in vivo. \n\n2). Location Awareness \nThe results of this project led to the development of a software product that is currently available and in use by companies today. The project helped to form a company that is now currently incubated by the European Space Agency. The company was the European Satellite Navigation Competitor UK Winner of 2013.\n\n3). Blind Source Separation\n10 prototypes were designed, manufactured and tested, leading to a new patent filing in October 2011, and two further patent filings in 2013. A website, with demos, using the prototypes was created. Demo units were shown to potential licensees including a major mobile phone manufacturer in the far east which elucidated clear functional requirements which are being developed and tested.

In other areas it has been used to produce devices for magnetometry, dosimetry and high-precision artifacts for optical and scanning probe microscopy.\n\n2. Location Awareness\nA software prototype that uses location data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) to enhance workflow and management of teams spread across different geographical locations.\n\n3. Blind Source Separation\nA low cost MEMS microphone software solution for use in mobile devices for improved speech recognition, noise reduction, privacy and improved audio functionality such as stereo recording and improved conference facilities. 1. 3D Milling\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the 3D milling technology, is the potential for future development. It is anticipated there could be a number of commercial uses for 3D milling, including nano imprint lithography, commercial digital lenses and surface plazmon resonance lenses. \n\n2. Location Awareness\nThe software product that was developed as a result of the project, has applications across a number of sectors including: land management, conservation management, property development, installation management, project management, sensor data management and lettings management.
