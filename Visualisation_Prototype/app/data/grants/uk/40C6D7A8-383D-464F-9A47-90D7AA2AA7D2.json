The success of mathematics in underpinning scientific investigation is evident by the fact that mathematics is the 'language of the physical sciences'; however many areas remain an open challenge to the international mathematics community. These include better engagement with the pressing global concerns of climate change and energy (e.g., developing new mathematical tools for dealing with complexity) and broad and challenging scientific goals such as the mathematization of the life sciences (e.g., mathematical models of cognition and perception, data analysis for DNA). The long-term scientific, technological and economic health of the UK requires mathematicians who (i) communicate fluently between the mathematical sub-disciplines, (ii) establish dialogues across discipline boundaries, and (iii) engage with professions and communities outside academe (in industry, commerce, financial sector, government etc). The award of a Platform Grant to the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester will enable the initiation of an internal funding mechanism to initiate, nurture and support new and adventurous research initiatives that address these goals.The creation of a platform account offers an integrative approach to the way mathematics is carried out in the School, and in its application outside the School. This should be seen not just as a fundingvehicle but a process whereby innovative and interdisciplinary research will be continuously stimulated and prosecuted. The platform account would also provide an opportunity to add value to the core research activity in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and probability and statistics within the School.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I01912X/1","grantId":"EP/I01912X/1","fundValue":"532050","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"I David Abrahams","coPersons":["David Sidney  Broomhead","Alex  Wilkie","Nicholas John Higham","William  Parnell","Jianxin  Pan","P  Duck","William Robert Lionheart","Anne  Juel","Francoise  Tisseur","Matthias  Heil","Mark  Kambites"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":" The nature of the grant is to stimulate new intra and interdisciplinary research within the School of Mathematics at Manchester. This ambitious 5 year programme has stimulated a wide variety of activities, ranging from Creativity@home workshops through patent support, research visits both to and from Manchester, and outreach initiatives. The spin-off to this programme of activity has been numerous new research partnerships, often in very diverse and unexpected areas. For example, there is now a close connection between Mathematics and Earth Sciences, with investigators looking at models of meteorite submergence within ice in the antarctic.
