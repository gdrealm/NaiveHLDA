This unexpected behaviour manifests itself in the appearance of singular shapes, such as corners, in the evolution of the vortex. The proposed research aims to advance our mathematical understanding of the processes leading to formation of such singularities in some well-known models for the evolution of vortex filaments, and in certain intimately related nonlinear Schr\\&quot;odinger equations.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J01155X/1","grantId":"EP/J01155X/1","fundValue":"99316","fundStart":"2012-09-30","fundEnd":"2014-09-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  A central purpose of this proposal has been the transfer of techniques and perspectives from dispersive PDE and modern harmonic analysis to the study of qualitative properties of solutions to some well-known physical models in the setting of fluid dynamics and ferromagnetism. It is anticipated that the findings will be of considerable interest within the engineering and physical science community, from both academic and commercial perspectives.

The geometric flows we consider are well-known models for the evolution of vortex filaments in fluid dynamics, and the dynamics of the magnetization vector in ferromagnetic materials. The results are very new and pending publication. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
