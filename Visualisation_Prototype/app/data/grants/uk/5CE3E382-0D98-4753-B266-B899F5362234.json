This will require a much larger density of very small, cheap and energy-efficient base stations, and will place increasing demand on the bandwidth and energy efficiency of the network, and especially the backhaul network. Recent work on network MIMO, or coordinated multipoint (CoMP) has shown that by ensuring base stations cooperate to serve users, especially those close to cell edge, rather than interferring with one another, inter-user interference can be effectively eliminated, greatly increasing the efficiency of the network, in terms of both spectrum and energy. However this tends to greatly increase the backhaul load. \n\nThis work proposes a form of wireless network coding, called network coded modulation, as an alternative to conventional CoMP. This also enables base station cooperation, but instead of sending multiple separate information flows to each base station, flows are combined using network coding, which in principle allows cooperation with no increase in backhaul load compared to non-cooperative transmission, while gaining very similar advantages to CoMP in terms of bandwidth and energy efficiency. \n\nThe objective of the proposed work is to establish the practical feasibility of this approach, and evaluate its benefits, as applied to next generation wireless access networks. To this end it will develop practical signalling schemes, network coordination and management protocols, and, with the help of industrial collaborators, will ensure compatibility with developing wireless standards.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K040006/1","grantId":"EP/K040006/1","fundValue":"585003","fundStart":"2013-11-18","fundEnd":"2017-02-28","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Too early for findings to have been used  ","person":"Alister Graham Burr","coPersons":["David  Grace"],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":" We have confirmed that the capacity of a cellular mobile communication system can be greatly increased by using physical layer network coding at the base stations, without any increase in the load on the backhaul network.
