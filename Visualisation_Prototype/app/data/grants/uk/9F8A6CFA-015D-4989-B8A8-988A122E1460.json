The primary aims are to research, document and disseminate archives of the Spring Queen and Miss Gay Western Cape pageants performed by disparate coloured communities in greater Cape Town. The Spring Queen pageant is a unique event where coloured female factory workers from the clothing and textile industry in the Western Cape of South Africa compete each year to be crowned &quot;spring queen&quot; of the Southern African Clothing and Textile Worker's Union (SACTWU). Public resistance to apartheid often resulted in violent racial conflict and for the first time in the garment industry in the 1970s there were acts of retaliation to low wages in the form of strikes. It is within this climate of dissent and harsh backlashes that the Spring Queen pageant emerged around 1978. Local trade unions devised the pageant as a mode of alleviating rising tensions amongst workers. A highlight on the Cape-Town social calendar, up to 30000 supporters attend the final event at the Good Hope Centre in Cape Town. This project will situate the Spring Queen as a moment of significant cultural shift. As textile manufacturing increasingly moves to China, this is perhaps the last opportunity to document garment and textile workers in Cape Town. The pageant bears testimony to the lives of Cape factory workers both during and after apartheid. The contestants, who live in the marginalised and impoverished areas, primarily in Atlantis and the Cape Flats, travel into the predominantly &quot;white&quot; city centre for the pageant. Important to these performance events is the figure of the &quot;moffie&quot;, a queer coloured male, often a transsexual, who has traditionally choreographed and designed the pageants, but who is forbidden from competing in them. Miss Gay Western Cape, which grew out of the Spring Queen pageant and the new South African constitution that was the first in the world to include protection for sexual minorities, is a platform for queer non-white persons to perform in a secure environment without exploitation. This project will investigate the significance of these pageants and the performances they engender. By creating an alternative to apartheid-era archives that marginalized these communities, we will engage in the wider democratic practice of reimagining South Africa, first initiated by the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. We will consider: the disruption of categories of representation engendered by performance in the pageants; the performance of emancipation and self-determination in the figure of the &quot;queen&quot;; constructions of gender, beauty and alternative sexuality in minority communities; and the continued segregation of space in Cape Town. The project aims to provide a unique perspective on marginalised lives, through an interdisciplinary lens; focusing on visuality, performativity and orality, it will offer a space for previously disavowed narratives to be articulated, which will not only be of benefit to these communities, but to post-apartheid South Africa and postcolonial Africa at large. Collaborative workshops will bring together scholars from performance studies, visual culture, cultural geography, gender and queer studies, digital humanities and African studies. In-depth archival research, the gathering of new and 'ordinary' archival material from public and private sources, oral histories and interviews will be made available as a public online archive. The forms of dissemination will have an extensive audience. These will include journal articles, interdisciplinary academic workshops, performance and curation workshops for pageant participants, a documentary and a digital archive.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K008102/1","grantId":"AH/K008102/1","fundValue":"189017","fundStart":"2014-01-01","fundEnd":"2015-12-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  The project has drawn the attention of both international and local media. These include: CNBC Africa, ENCA, Heart FM, SA FM, The Mail and Guardian, The Cape Argus, The Voice, and independent newspapers. \n\nLess tangible but equally important is the relationships that have been formed between the academy and marginalised communities, who now are thinking about what it is precisely that universities do in profoundly different ways. Also important has been the reconfiguration of the relationship between researcher and subject, which has allowed for an epistemological shift in how we think of these 'other' lives and knowledge production. SACTWU (South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union) have observed that this has changed the way the academy works with the union and its members. \n\nOver the next year, we will be working closely with SACTWU and the organisers of the MGWC to chart how the project has impacted their artistic and cultural practices as well as labour relations. We are also in the midst of offering workshops to pageant participants that offers a site for critical engagement and self-reflection. \n\nThe Humanities faculty of the University of Cape Town on this project is restructuring its promotions criteria in relation to work with communities as well as standard academic outputs such as journal articles and books.

By placing the responsibility of representation on the pageant participants for the selection of archival material we hope to break former archival habits before and during apartheid (as well as archives worldwide) that produced hierarchical distinctions between subjects (the producers of knowledge) and objects (of the archive). The individual and highly personal photographs and homemade videos selected by participants therefore steer away from the fabrication of a queer type, the transgendered or drag performer of colour, or a singular articulation of the cultural practices of the pageants.\n\nImportant new research questions opened up:\n\nThe primary new questions that the project has opened up include the relationship between post-apartheid South African national identity and gay rights, new postcolonial directions in queer theory and the sexual geographies of Cape Town that are bounded by race and economic privilege. Given that gay rights have been at the heart of the narratives around public culture and nationhood in the initial transitional period of post-apartheid South Africa, we have found it imperative to consider how sexuality has played a large part in the construction of the 'Rainbow Nation', a name which already implies an intersection between multiracialism and gay rights. In order to do this, we have been focusing on new understandings of social and cultural oppression that link postcolonial and queer theories in a self-conscious and nuanced mode that are sensitive to the particularities of local contexts. \n\nParticularly noteworthy new research networks/collaborations/partnerships, or combinations of these:\nThe project has attracted the attention of the GALA archives housed at the University of Witwatersrand - the only publically funded gay and lesbian archive in Africa. We are meeting with GALA in November 2014 to help them implement strategies we have developed on this project to digitise their materials. \n\nThe documentary on the Spring Queen pageant has been shown at Encounters Film Festival in Cape Town and Rhodes University in Grahamstown, which has fostered new partnerships. It has also been incorporated in the curriculum in African Studies and Visual Arts at University of Cape Town. \n\nBryce Lease has a forthcoming article in Theatre Research International (TRI) that outlines the aims and research questions of the project. This will be published in a special issue on queer research methodologies and is part of the wider research initiative of the Queer Futures research group of International Federation of Theatre Research (IFTR). \n\nSiona O'Connell has led the construction of the documentary and digital archive. The latter is the primary output of the project. \n\nThe British Council have invited the project team to participate in the UK/South Africa Summer programme in London in 2015 with an exhibition linked to the project. The digital archive will be used as a research tool for postgraduate students (one MFA student at UCT is already writing a dissertation based on this research material, and this could turn into a PhD project). The project team will present findings at the Western Cape Provincial Government's Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport in November 2014. We will also be meeting with the GALA archive in Johannesburg to discuss how they might digitise their materials using the strategies we have developed. We will also be giving GALA a copy of our archive.
