Farmers spray agrochemicals to control disease; this is expensive, requires fuel and labour, and leads to soil compaction. It would be preferable for crops to be disease resistant, so that no fungicide applications are required. More knowledge is required to achieve this goal. Breeders use disease resistance (R) genes for crop improvement; more R genes are continuously needed by breeders, because pathogens can evolve to overcome them. R genes confer recognition of pathogen virulence-promoting molecules (so-called &quot;effectors&quot;) that contribute to virulence. R gene durability varies; it is likely that more durable R genes recognize the most indispensable effectors for the pathogen. Plant resistance also involves responses to conserved pathogen molecular patterns- &quot;pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)&quot;. Although there is overlap in PTI and R gene-mediated resistance responses, the mechanistic link between them is still completely obscure.\nFor durable resistance in our future crops, we need a deep understanding of pathogen virulence and host defence mechanisms. This requires knowledge of the spectrum of host targets of effectors, of how plant R proteins recognize (directly or indirectly) the presence of effectors, and of how upon recognition, defence mechanisms are activated that result in host plant immunity. Plant R proteins resemble mammalian Nod-like receptors (NLRs) that are involved in mammalian innate immunity; for example, Crohn's disease results from a defect in the human NOD2 gene. Mechanisms of NLR signalling are also incompletely understood. NOD2 and NB-LRR proteins carry similar protein modules, with an N-terminal signalling domain, a central nucleotide-binding (NB) domain and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. \nThe proposed work will help us better understand mechanisms of plant resistance. We will study a fascinating disease resistance locus in the model plant Arabidopsis that confers resistance to two distinct bacterial species that cause either bacterial speck or bacterial wilt, and also confers resistance to a fungal pathogen. This locus contains two different NB-LRR R proteins, RRS1 and RPS4, that are transcribed away from each other, and both of which are required for resistance. RPS4 and RRS1 also carry a so-called TIR domain shared with immune receptors of humans and flies. RRS1 has an additional domain (a &quot;WRKY&quot; domain) that has been shown to bind DNA, and that could regulate expression of genes involved in plant defence. RPS4/RRS1 activates defence upon recognizing AvrRps4 effector protein from bacterial speck, or PopP2 effector protein from bacterial wilt, or the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. How this works is still a mystery. \n- We wish to understand how RPS4/RRS1 activates expression of genes involved in defence upon recognition of AvrRps4 or PopP2. We will investigate the DNA sequences targeted by the DNA binding domain of RRS1, and compare the corresponding genes to the genes that are induced upon RPS4/RRS1 defence activation, and to genes induced during PTI. In this way we will define the direct targets of RPS4/RRS1 and the genes that when activated result in resistance. This will enable us to build up a picture of the chain of events triggered via R proteins that stop the pathogen from growing.\n- Once we have all the data from these investigations we will be able to propose and test models for what takes place during defence activation, making this system one of the best understood R gene systems; this knowledge will inform approaches to attempting to broaden the recognition capacity of R genes, to thus enhance their utility and durability.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/K003550/1","grantId":"BB/K003550/1","fundValue":"320752","fundStart":"2013-01-07","fundEnd":"2016-04-06","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  April 2014 interim report\nDr Shyam Rallapalli was employed on the grant from February 2013, but left at end of October 2013.
