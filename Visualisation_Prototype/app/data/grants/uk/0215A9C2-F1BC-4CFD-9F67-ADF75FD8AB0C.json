{"id":"0215A9C2-F1BC-4CFD-9F67-ADF75FD8AB0C","title":"A Smart and Flexible Automation System for High Value Cake Manufacturing","abstractText":"The context within which this project takes place is that of cake production within the food manufacturing industry. The food\nindustry generally is worth &pound;96.1bn to the UK economy with Food and Drink Manufacturing providing &pound;26.4bn Gross Value\nAdded and employing 395,000 people, and specifically the bakery industry GVA is just under &pound;4bn (Food Statistics\nPocketbook, 2012, published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). The company within which the\nresults of this project will be applied, is one of 9,340 food and drink manufacturing sites in the UK. The project involves the partnership of the cake manufacturing company Lightbody, the University of Strathclyde, and the automation company\nQuasar.\nThe aim of the project is to investigate, research, and develop a new smart and flexible material handling automation\nsystem for cakes, icing, and cake decorations. This system will comprise various sensors, software algorithms, and\nmechatronic hardware in order to create a more efficient and consistent autonomous production method. A major challenge\nwithin the project will be the creation of a novel handling and manipulation system that will be able to cope with the difficult\nattributes of the cake icing and decorative materials. These can be soft, sticky, brittle, and floppy, all of these\ncharacteristics are very difficult for automated manipulator systems to handle.\nThe initial benefits of this project will be to (a) the cake manufacturing company in that the project will increase its\nefficiency, reduce its costs, and increase its profitability, (b) the University in that it will expand its knowledge and expertise\nin this field, be able to provide knowledge exchange, and provide employment and experience for two researchers, and (c)\nprovide the other industrial partner with an opportunity to enhance its experience and knowledge while contributing its\nexisting expertise to the success of the task.\nFurther benefits to UK industry in gral will result from the knowledge gained from the design of the system to\nmanipulate the difficult to handle materials. This knowledge should have general applicability not only in the food industry\nbut also in areas such as clothing manufacture. The developed system will be modular such that elements of the design,\ne.g. hardware, software, and sensing, will be useable by a range of companies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/L505213/1","grantId":"EP/L505213/1","fundValue":"295661","fundStart":"2014-02-01","fundEnd":"2016-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xiu-Tian  Yan","coPersons":["Gordon McKinnon Mair"],"organisation":"University of Strathclyde","findingsText":" The project just started this year and we still work on the deliverable.
