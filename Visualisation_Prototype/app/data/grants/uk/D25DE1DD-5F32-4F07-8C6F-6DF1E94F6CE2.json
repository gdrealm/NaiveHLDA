Thus, ice stream behaviour is crucial to any models which attempt to predict the effect of global warming on polar ice masses and sea level rise. Three competing hypotheses have been suggested to explain ice stream motion, all centred on the interaction of the ice with its bed.\nMega Scale Glacial Lineations (MSGL)are landforms that are formed at the ice-bed interface under ice streams. The mechanism of their formation is not known though some theories have been developed. However, it is clear that the formation of MSGL represents a crucial element in solving the puzzle of enigmatic ice stream dynamics. In other words, by understanding how MSGL form it will be possible to clarify the mechanism of ice stream motion, thus enhancing the predictive capability of models that analyze the effects of climate change on the vulnerable polar ice masses.\n\nThis project proposes to map and quantitatively analyze the largest (tens of thousands landforms) dataset of MSGL ever created, from onshore and submarine settings from all over the world. The metrics and spatial distribution of these landforms will be studied in great detail with rigorous statistical analyses and state-of-the-art GIS and Remote Sensing techniques. The spatial variability of the morphometric parameters will be compared to that of the topography, geology and palaeo-geography of the palaeo-ice stream beds where MSGL are found in. The project will also characterize at an unprecedented level of details the internal composition of MSGL, with a combination of techniques never deployed before in the study of an individual glacial bedform. The results from the combined (morphometrical and sedimentological) approach will be used to test hypotheses and models of formation of these landforms and shed light on processes at the ice-bed interface. Ultimately, the quantitative results will be directly used to refine and develop numerical models of ice stream flow.\n\nMatteo Spagnolo's expertise and experience in GIS and Remote Sensing applied to glacial geomorphology, coupled with his strong interest in extending his skills into glacial sedimentology and ice modelling, are the essential ingredients that guarantee the success of this new investigator project. An array of international renowned experts are project partners and will support the work of the proponent.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/J004766/1","grantId":"NE/J004766/1","fundValue":"76408","fundStart":"2011-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  I think it is too early to comment on the impact (especially beyond academia) of a research grant that has just finished. All I could say is that the one article related to the project that has seen the light about a year ago has now already 4 citations. I should also add that I recently took part to a workshop on mega-scale glacial lineations, and the audience of 20 or so scientists all made positive reference to my work and publications.

In order to do this, it is essential to understand ice sheet dynamics, because it is by flowing into the ocean that most ice mass is lost. Arguably, the strongest control on ice movement is dictated by what happens at the ice-bed interface. Although this is an environment still largely inaccessible to direct observation, we are presented with hundreds of well-preserved palaeo ice sheet/stream beds. This is the reign of mega-scale glacial lineations, which represent the landform signature of fast ice moving over its bed. If we can understand how mega-scale glacial lineations are formed, we will know how the ice interacts with its bed and can therefore make more reasonable predictions about the future of ice masses anywhere on our planet and beyond.\nThe research funded by this grant, is now suggesting that these bedforms, which are common in formerly glaciated landscapes, tend towards a specific scale of initiation and towards a very common &quot;final&quot; shape and size. I have showed that mega-scale glacial lineation metrics are different from what was previously acknowledged and that there are many common aspects between mega-scale glacial lineations and drumlins. This suggests a morphological continuum between the two that might indicate an overall same process of formation for most subglacial bedforms. The massive amount of well diversified sedimentological data collected so far, all suggest mega-scale glacial lineations are composed of glacial sediment that is progressively and continuously accreting under fast ice flow, a fundamental discovery for what is regarded as one of the least understood geomorphological environment on earth. Also, I demonstrated that mega-scale glacial lineations do not represent individual landforms but rather a coherent and spatially organised phenomenon, similar to other natural features such as sand ripples or cloud patterns. This supports the hypothesis that glacial bedforms are the expression of an instability process controlled by the physics of the glacier system, and that the corrugations that we call bedforms are simply the inevitable result of ice flow optimization. Last but not least, the research has highlighted many methodological aspects that need to be improved and also proposed and successfully tested new techniques. \nOverall, this has been a very positive research experience. Currently there are &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; two papers published on the back of this grant, but I can see at least another 5 to come to light in the near future, including at least one that I am hoping to publish in an &quot;important&quot; journal, and on which I am working on at the moment. The amount and quality of the already published and expected output indicate that this grant has been a very good success, also in consideration of the small amount of money invested. Also on the back of this work I have been successfully promoted to senior lecturer, and have initiated an international research team now fully dedicated at working together on this subject, with many promising follow-ups to come. The work done and in progress has been used and will be used by at least three scientific communities:\n1. the geomorphologists (not only the glacial ones, as I highlighted many common aspect between glacial and aeolian geomorphology)\n2. the modellers, especially those dedicated at making prediction of future climate change through ice sheet modelling\n3. the sedimentologists, who have been appreciated my novel 360 degree approach and my stressing of the importance of linking sedimentology with geomorphology.
