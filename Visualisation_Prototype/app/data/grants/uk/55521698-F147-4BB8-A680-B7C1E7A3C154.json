Infants will be shown a series of cartoon animals which, based on their perceptual features, form either one or two categories. In separate conditions the objects will either be presented in silence or with an auditory label. Through analysing infants' eye movements it will be investigated whether labelling the objects leads to different category formation than presentation in silence. This research will provide important insights into the process of category formation in young infants. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-3394","grantId":"RES-000-22-3394","fundValue":"82654","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2011-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Gert  Westermann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Oxford Brookes University","findingsText":" Young infants learn to group objects into categories and for example, consider a dog they have never seen before as similar to other dogs they know. Toward the end of their first year language comes into play, and an important question is whether the name given to objects can affect the categories that infants form. We discovered that 10-month-olds make use of labels when learning object categories: objects that are placed in a single category when no names are given to the objects are placed in two separate category when some of the objects are given one name and others are given a different name. This was basic research on the interplay between cognitive and language development. Our results can form the basis for further research in this area. They can also be used to educate the public about the abilities of young infants. Education","dataset":"gtr"}
