{"id":"267F8320-64B3-4D3D-8F8D-9D13C6D683E7","title":"Contextual influences on orientation perception","abstractText":"Forty years of neuroscience have cemented the notion that vision depends on a population of brain cells whose individual responses depend both on the contrast and the spatial orientation of visual stimuli. Consequently, our ability to discriminate between different contrasts should be related to our ability to discriminate between different orientations. However, it is only recently that biologically inspired models have had any success in explaining both of these abilities. Naturally, these early successes have focused on simple targets, like line segments, which are thought to optimally stimulate individual neurons. To parallel neuroscience's progress understanding brain connectivity, we propose to extend (or refine) contemporary models in order to explain how our perception of simple targets depends on visual context.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E000444/1","grantId":"BB/E000444/1","fundValue":"291047","fundStart":"2007-03-23","fundEnd":"2010-03-22","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Joshua Adam Solomon","coPersons":["Michael  Morgan"],"organisation":"City University London","findingsText":" Our most significant scientific achievement was a demonstration that some supposedly cognitive behaviours were consistent with normative strategies for dealing with neuroanatomical limitations.

Aimed at the postgraduate reader, this tutorial was solicited by editors (Jeremy Wolfe and Charles Chubb) familiar with our early work on this grant.  ","dataset":"gtr"}
