{"id":"FD47E122-B823-42BB-8EF0-2A0DB0D020D4","title":"Natural Enrichments in E-tech Elements (Co, Ga, In, Te, Li, REE) [NEETE].","abstractText":"Concentrations of E-tech elements, essential for a technologically advanced and low carbon society, are the direct result of natural Earth processes. These processes operate from the Earth's Mantle to the near surface Critical Zone of biological activity and weathering, and involve geofluids such as magmas, brines, seawater, and groundwaters as the key agents of transport. These Earth processes have been the subject of substantive research, but with a focus on the formation of the widely utilised base, ferrous and non-ferrous metal resources (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn, Al). In stark contrast, our understanding of the transport and concentration of E-tech elements during these fundamental Earth processes is limited. \n\nThis NEETE catalyst grant brings forward a multidisciplinary team of internationally recognized researchers based in leading UK academic institutes: Roberts (Southampton), Armstrong (NHM), Banks (Leeds), Herrington (NHM), Kirk (Loughborough), Stackhouse (Leeds) Wilkinson (Imperial) and Yardley (Leeds) have unrivaled expertise on the transport and concentration of metals in the Earth System [see Track Record and CV's]. This team is supported by major UK based mining companies Anglo American &amp; Rio Tinto and academic partners from leading research institutes from around the world including the Arc Centre of Excellence in Ore Deposits - CODES - Tasmania and the Helmholtz Institute Frieberg. These strategic partners will provide an applied focus, advice on viable study sites, and support the development of a science plan and full grant proposal, that can deliver a step change in our understanding of the source, transport, concentration and ultimate recovery of a selection of E-tech elements. \n\nIn the first instance the research team will investigate 6 E-techs ( Co, Ga, In, Te, Li, REE) in three contrasting geological environments. The range of E-techs considered reflects their co-location in many geological environments e.g. Co, Ga in laterites, thus enabling the catalyst grant the scope to identify priority areas and knowledge gaps where a maximum return on scientific investment can be achieved. The chosen geological environments also reflect the underlying geological processes and the opportunities for &quot;reverse engineering&quot; from the geological to industrial recovery environments. The key geological environments recognized include: 1) The Critical zone (Co, Ga, REE): 2. Crustal Brines (Li, V, Co, In, Ga, REE): 3. Magmas and Magmatic Fluids (Li, V, Co, In, REE). \n\nThe catalyst grant will support a 3-day Sandpit event, &quot;E-techs from Ore to Door&quot; aimed at initiating a collaborative research project addressing the key challenges of E-tech formation and recovery. The sandpit will comprise a multidisciplinary mix of active researchers and potential users of research outcomes and bring together a research community, dramatically expanded beyond the normal, confines of ore deposit geology. The mix of expertise will ensure an expanded research vision with supporting partners who also have a track record of research excellence and outputs in a near industry environment. The Sandpit will be convened in a location suitable for a field excursion so that all participants can begin to appreciate the formation, exploration and exploitation of E-tech elements in a given environment. The aim of the sandpit will be to achieve 1) a consensus on the key scientific challenges and drive lateral thinking and radical approaches to addressing the challenges. 2) recognize and build cross disciplinary teams to address these challenges. 3) Identify the role of international collaborators; 4) identify co-ordinators to deliver each part of a full research proposal. Following the sandpit meeting a two writing workshops each of two days duration will be convened to draft a full research proposal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/L002329/1","grantId":"NE/L002329/1","fundValue":"85256","fundStart":"2013-09-01","fundEnd":"2014-07-15","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  Provided the basic material for a full grant proposal to SoS minerals Environment Societal,Economic","person":"Stephen  Roberts","coPersons":["Caroline Ann Kirk","Stephen  Stackhouse","Bruce William Yardley","Richard Jeremy  Herrington","David  Banks","Robin Neil Armstrong","Jamie John Wilkinson"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":" This grant investigated the location of E-tech elements in the Natural Environment.
