{"id":"63BFDAFB-EE27-451A-8097-AFBAC71401B7","title":"The Asphalt World","abstractText":"The title of the project derives from One-Way Street (Walter Benjamin, 1926): 'What, in the end, makes advertisements so superior to criticism? Not what the moving red neon says - but the fiery pool reflecting it in the asphalt'.\\nIn this quote, Benjamin brings together advertising, critical endeavour and the social world of the street. In response to this I will be inventing new ways of working artistically, appropriating the objects - posters - of street advertising and augmenting them with painting techniques. In this way I propose to intervene in an ongoing debate around public and private space and the implications of advancing visual technologies in these arenas.\\nThe outcome of the research project will be an installation of painted posters: an exploration of the relationship between art and the street, bringing advertising posters from different geographic and commercial origins into a gallery context. The reclaimed posters I will use clearly reveal their street origins : they are often torn, damaged and faded, comprised of encrusted layers of paper. I hope to encourage audiences to question preconceptions about the different status of imagery in differing locations; the everyday environment, and an art context. \\nPaper posters are becoming increasingly replaced with moving backlit prints and plasma screens: the posters I will use- clearly 'out of date' in having fulfilled their commercial function - will encourage reflection upon advances in technology and the pace of change to the everyday visual environment. The exhibition will form a visual response to my own thoughts about the pace of technological change- how it seems always to be advancing faster than we are able to digest- and what the implications of this are for both artists and public.\\nI shall be extending the complexity of the issues mentioned above, by painting on the posters. The scale and format of many of the posters' recalls C20th abstract painting. I will be painting upon the posters using marks associated with that history (Pollock, Louis, Frankenthaler) and with later work in dialogue with that history (Davenport, Innes). I will utilise these references to invoke a resemblance between them and the vernacular of street graffiti. The posters will in this way offer a point of contingency between contemporary art and the street. These themes and questions will be critically unpacked in an accompanying pamphlet publication, which will reveal the artistic methods and critically reflect upon them in relation to my questions around the status of advertising and art, and notions of agency. These questions will also be addressed through a series of talks, in the gallery and at Goldsmiths College and the RCA.\\nA potential wider social impact of the exhibition would be to encourage audiences to reflect upon the fact that they themselves may have some control over their visual environment: the painted additions to the posters will act as a metaphor for individual autonomy in the face of an increasingly corporatised visual environment. This aspect of the exhibition will have relevance for a general audience as much as for other researchers and artists in the field.\\nThe issues above will not be dealt with within the usual gallery conventions ie 'within' the works, then presented utilising conventional modes of display. Rather, the painted posters I will make as a result of my intensive period of research will be arranged in a manner more reminiscent of a public event such as a rally, fete or festival. The painted advertising posters - of greatly varying sizes, papers, colours and will be supported by bespoke metal armatures, and will hang from their top edges like municipal street banners. The whole installation will thus be seen as a single piece, a composed swathe of imagery and paint, occupying a deliberately hybrid space: between painting and advertising; between street and gallery; between high cultural status (art) and low cultural status (advertising).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/G013861/1","grantId":"AH/G013861/1","fundValue":"14279","fundStart":"2008-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-02-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Simon  Bedwell","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Goldsmiths College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
