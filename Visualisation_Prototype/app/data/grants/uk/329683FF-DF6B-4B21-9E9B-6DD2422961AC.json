{"id":"329683FF-DF6B-4B21-9E9B-6DD2422961AC","title":"Relativistic Electron Beams Above Thunderclouds","abstractText":"It has recently been discovered that lightning generates upward-directed relativistic electron beams above thunderclouds. This extends the phenomenon of relativistic runaway breakdown inside thunderclouds to the atmosphere above thunderclouds. This marks a profound advance in our understanding of the atmosphere because we now know it acts as a giant, natural, particle accelerator. The accelerated electrons can reach significant relativistic energies of some tens of MeV during their passage from the troposphere, through the middle atmosphere, into near-Earth space. These relativistic electron beams constitute a current above thunderclouds and effectively transfer energy from the troposphere to the middle atmosphere. This coupling process thereby forms a novel element of the global atmospheric electric circuit which links tropospheric thunderclouds to the atmosphere above.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/H024921/1","grantId":"NE/H024921/1","fundValue":"305051","fundStart":"2011-01-10","fundEnd":"2014-01-09","funder":"NERC","impactText":"  The findings led to a publication in Environmental Research Letters where was downloaded 17554 times to date and cited 5 times within the first year after publication.

The electron beams are part of the discharge processes above thunderclouds which occur after particularly intense positive lightning discharges. The results led to the development of a novel broadband radio receiver in the NERC grant NE/L012669/1. This will enable the tomographic imaging of boundary layer humidity and the detection of preliminary breakdown inside thunderclouds prior to lightning discharges.
