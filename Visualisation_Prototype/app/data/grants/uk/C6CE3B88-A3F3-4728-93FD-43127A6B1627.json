To date, quantitative research on the relational and social aspects of social exclusion has focused on standard survey questions that ask whether people do certain activities thought to relate to inclusion in society (some surveys also ask about the frequency of taking part in these activities). These activities represent social relationships, and other customary civic and cultural behaviour. Failure to take part, systematically, in these activities is deemed to indicate social exclusion.</p> \n<p>Missing from previous studies of social exclusion is information on the key elements embraced in the notion of relational and social links with society - predominantly the time that people spend on related activities and who they spend this time with. This study will make time use explicit in the definition of social exclusion. The study will also investigate who is most likely to be socially excluded, using a combination of factors that measure the socio-demographic, economic and time resources of individuals, their families and their local area.&nbsp; The study will build on the authorâ€™s ESRC supported PhD thesis which conceptualised and measured social exclusion using standard survey data.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0122","grantId":"RES-061-23-0122","fundValue":"74596","fundStart":"2008-01-14","fundEnd":"2010-01-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matt  Barnes","coPersons":[],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
