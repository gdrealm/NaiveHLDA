{"id":"3E5BB126-EF24-4B44-B0A0-2DF21EEB7E2F","title":"Integrated superconducting nanobridge fast readout electronics for single photon detector arrays","abstractText":"Our objective is to develop nanobridge Josephson junction superconducting circuits (based on single flux quantum (SFQ)\ndesign) for high bandwidth, low noise digital signal processing (DSP) of signals from single photon detector arrays (in\nparticular SSPD (superconducting single photon detector) arrays) and assess their suitability for commercialisation.\nSSPD arrays have many applications; as a fast, high efficiency, low noise detector for quantum key distribution, as a\ncomponent in quantum computing and for enhanced quantum imaging. The major hurdle to commercialisation of SSPD\narray systems is the lack of suitable readout electronics able to process a large number of signals without significant heat\nloading of the detector cold stage. SFQ readout offers a low power solution, enabling multiple pixels in a marketable,\nmechanically cooled system. Nanobridge SFQ circuits for SSPD array readout are a new, undemonstrated alternative to\nconventional tunnel junction SFQ circuits, with the advantage of predominantly single layer fabrication, smaller device size\nand potential for integration on the same chip as the SSPD array","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/M508342/1","grantId":"EP/M508342/1","fundValue":"39491","fundStart":"2015-06-01","fundEnd":"2016-05-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Hugh Hadfield","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
