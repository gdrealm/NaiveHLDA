For example, over the Christmas period 2013/2014 over 500,000 customers were off supply for over five days in the East of England and this was mainly due to damage to overhead power lines caused by catastrophic tree failure in storms. This type of disruption is likely to become more common in the UK as climate change causes storms to become more frequent and severe. It is possible to reduce the impacts of storm damage on electricity networks by felling those trees that are close to power lines and are at more risk of failing in a severe storm. However, assessment of the likelihood of a tree failing is currently done by a surveyor who makes a subjective and qualitative personal judgement based on a field observation of the tree. This approach lacks consistency and scientific rigour and the number of trees that it is feasible to assess and the frequency of repeat surveys is restricted by logistical and financial constraints. This project will address these limitations by developing a new approach to evaluating the risk of failure of individual trees in severe weather. This will begin by developing computer software which can prioritise trees at greatest risk of failure across a landscape which may contain thousands of trees that are close proximity to power lines. Those trees at greatest risk will then be targeted for more detailed measurements, particularly using laser scanners, which will allow us to provide more realistic and objective assessments of the risk of failure of individual trees. We will work with our project partners Scottish Power to demonstrate how this new approach is able to help them target their resources for managing trees at greatest risk of failure, in order to increase the resilience of electricity supply networks in severe weather and minimise disruption to customers. The techniques developed in this research will be valuable for improving the management of trees that are in close proximity to other infrastructure such as roads, railways and buildings, thereby helping to reduce the likelihood that storms will cause financial losses, disruption to services and harm to humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/M008614/1","grantId":"NE/M008614/1","fundValue":"106877","fundStart":"2014-10-31","fundEnd":"2015-10-30","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"George Alan Blackburn","coPersons":["Chris  Edwards","James Duncan Whyatt"],"organisation":"Lancaster University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
