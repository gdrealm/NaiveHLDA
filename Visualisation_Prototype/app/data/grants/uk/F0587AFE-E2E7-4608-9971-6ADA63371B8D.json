Humans have exploited microbial products, such as penicillin and streptomycin, to cure bacterial diseases. Since Fleming's discovery of penicillin, produced by the Penicillium mold, these drugs have worked with remarkable success, transforming the medical landscape and dramatically improving human health. The microbial use of antimicrobials, however, is considerably less friendly. Instead, microbes are believed to use these hugely diverse toxins to kill each other, thereby enabling producing strains to gain ground in the struggle for resources. This struggle is a key aspect of microbial ecology and evolution, equally important for microbes living in the soil and those living as pathogens within the human body. Recent theoretical studies have shown that competition between strains of bacteria producing different toxins, called bacteriocins, can cause the evolution of a nearly limitless variety of bacterial types that produce diverse bacteriocins and mechanisms of bacteriocin resistance. Thus, it appears, at least in theory, that the bacterial arms-race of one strain against another closely resembles our own arms-race against them; in both cases new drugs are developed (evolve) while others lose efficacy due to the evolution of resistance. The aims of this proposal are therefore to understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of this widespread chemical warfare between bacteria. \n\nTo address these aims we will employ a strategy combining the development of new theory with an approach called experimental evolution, which examines the evolution of bacteria in the lab over thousands of generations. Our study system will be based upon bacteriocins produced by the gram-positive pathogen S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae remains one of the leading causes of bacterial diseases in children and the elderly worldwide. The bacteriocins in this species are highly diverse as are the signaling molecules that induce them. Hundreds of distinct combinations of signal and toxin can exist, the causes and consequences of which are unknown.\n\nWe will use the following plan to answer these questions. First, we will characterize the diversity of S. pneumoniae toxins and resistance by competing strains against one another in pair-wise tournaments. We will next seek to understand the genetics of toxicity and resistance by sequencing the relevant genes from natural bacterial strains. Using the information gained in these analyses, we will build theoretical models to simulate the coevolution of multi-toxin communities of bacteria. We will ask how well these models predict the actual diversity of toxicity profiles in natural populations. In addition, we will use the model to generate novel predictions about evolution of synthetic bacterial communities. Finally, we will test these predictions by allowing mixtures of bacterial strains to evolve in the lab for 1,000s of generations. After this period of evolution we will study phenotypic and genetic changes that competing populations have accumulated.\n\nOur results will have several fundamental and applied implications. Scientists are working to specifically assemble microbial communites to perform heath and environment related services. It is thus clearly of considerable importance to develop a focused and predictive understanding of rules governing populations of bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, bacteriocins are increasingly being explored as alternative antimicrobials and have been developed as food preservatives. Antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae is increasing and the need for alternative chemotherapeutic agents is real. The successful deployment of bacteriocins relies on an understanding of their diversity and the responses cells evolve to resist them.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/J006009/1","grantId":"BB/J006009/1","fundValue":"409209","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Stanley Roberts","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
