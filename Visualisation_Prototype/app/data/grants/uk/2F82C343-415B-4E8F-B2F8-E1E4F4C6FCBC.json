{"id":"2F82C343-415B-4E8F-B2F8-E1E4F4C6FCBC","title":"Activism, volunteering and citizenship","abstractText":"<p>Across the world, neoliberal reforms and the continued rolling back of the state have been met with new forms of activist and voluntary activities which have emerged to contest, resist, mitigate or at times even facilitate the imposition of neoliberal structures of governance, forms of development, and mechanisms for the provision of welfare and services. Within this scenario, volunteers and activists increasingly construct diverse understandings of citizenship and negotiate what it means to be a citizen in the twenty-first century. Academic debates around the ways in which these practices of activism, volunteering and exercising of citizenship intersect and overlap have until now taken place in distinct sectoral and disciplinary spaces. This has limited wider theorisation and provided partial accounts of experiences and processes of change. This series brings often disparate debates together in a productive interdisciplinary dialogue, in order to consider how activism, volunteering and citizenship can be conceptualised across a range of contexts, encouraging new academic and user group collaborations. The series is particularly designed to facilitate North-South, South-South, and cross-sectoral comparisons, where largely parallel debates have been developing in relation to understanding activism, volunteering and citizenship in the context of neoliberalism.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-26-0561","grantId":"RES-451-26-0561","fundValue":"15312","fundStart":"2009-02-10","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Matt  Baillie Smith","coPersons":["Elizabeth Ann Olson","Katherine  Jenkins","Liz  Bondi","Nina  Laurie","Peter Eric Hopkins"],"organisation":"Northumbria University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
