{"id":"C917B70D-D6EE-46FD-AEEC-9B32DC8AAC5A","title":"Neutron Compton Scattering For Functional Energy Materials","abstractText":"The aim of this proposed research is to exploit new developments in neutron scattering at eV energies, to investigate the quantum behaviour of protons and other light atoms in a range of systems of fundamental scientific and technological interest. For example; the study of the lithium momentum distribution in materials used in battery technology, the momentum distribution of protons and lithium in lithium-ammonia solutions/metallic solid, measurements on ammonia related compounds which are potential hydrogen storage materials and the determination of the role of oxygen atoms in high Tc superconducting materials.\n\nStrong links have been forged with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the groups of Car and Parinello and with the groups of Andreani and Colognesi in Italy. Results from this research will be used to further develop and benchmark state of the art calculations, considering the complexity of both measuring and calculating quantum effects in momentum distribution. The project will also further develop an experimental technique in which the UK currently has a world lead. This will be to the benefit of a wide range of scientific disciplines.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K002546/1","grantId":"EP/K002546/1","fundValue":"174598","fundStart":"2012-11-26","fundEnd":"2014-11-25","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Peter  Edwards","coPersons":["Jerry  Mayers"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
