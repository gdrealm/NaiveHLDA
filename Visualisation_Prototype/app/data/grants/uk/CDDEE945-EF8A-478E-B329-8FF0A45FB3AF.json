The expansion of socialist rule into Eastern Europe after World War II was not exclusively a political enterprise; to no smaller an extent it was an exercise in transforming the national consciousness of the societies involved in the spirit of (forced) internationalism. In so far as literature is at the core of a nation's identity, it is important to examine steps taken towards a unification of literary production and consumption following the introduction of socialist rule in East European countries, during the formative years of the new world order. \nAt the same time, it is crucial to remember that only in a comparative context can researchers do justice to the complexity of the matter. Concentrating on a particular national context cannot give one a full idea of the cultural and political mechanics involved in the construction of the new totalitarian reality. For this reason the project will examine processes related to the institutionalisation of the production and consumption of literature during the first post-WWII decade in four East European countries, which exemplify different literary and political traditions - the GDR, Poland, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The research team will investigate how similar events and procedures (all initiated by Soviet authorities) were adapted to specific cultural contexts and how, in turn, the centralised cultural policy responded to the particularities of each country. The team will study primary archival documents - both openly published and secret reports of writers' congresses, transcripts of meetings between writers and readers, as well as between writers and party officials, materials of international literary and cultural events, propagandistic texts and practical instructions related to the implementation of a unified Socialist Realist method of writing across Eastern Europe. By comparing and contrasting similar events and processes in the different cultural and political contexts, we should be able to achieve a fuller picture of the formation of socialist ideology in Eastern Europe, the foundations of the Cold War and, to a large extent, the building blocks of the recent cultural memory that is part and parcel of the European cultural heritage today.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K001825/1","grantId":"AH/K001825/1","fundValue":"521427","fundStart":"2013-06-28","fundEnd":"2017-06-27","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Two collected volumes and a monograph are in the early stages of preparation.
