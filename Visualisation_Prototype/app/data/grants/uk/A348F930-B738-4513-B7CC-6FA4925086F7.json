{"id":"A348F930-B738-4513-B7CC-6FA4925086F7","title":"Internalism, Externalism and Truth-conditions","abstractText":"There is a fundamental division in philosophy between those who adopt an internalist perspective on content (claiming that questions of meaning can be addressed solely via appeal to agent-internal features) and externalist (who claim that a meaning requires word-world relations). This division emerges in the apparent tension between the motivations for certain theories of meaning (which are internalist) and the essential nature of those theories (which is externalist). In my work I explore the tension, arguing that in many recent debates it has been misconstrued. Instead I suggest that internalist and externalist perspective perspectives on theorising can, in this instance, be brought to cohere.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=112918/1","grantId":"112918/1","fundValue":"10510","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2006-03-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma  Borg","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Reading","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
