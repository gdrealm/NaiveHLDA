The saponins have a quite different pattern of structures, and therefore of biological effects, from those in other plants. A number of major markets have been identified for such products, but wild cropping can present significant problems once commercial scale-up is required. This proposal will build on the known ability to produce the saponins from ginseng in cell culture, to provide proof of concept that cell culture can be applied to the production of ivy saponins. It will further seek to provide proof of principle that the saponins produced in this was have the same properties as wild cropped material and that the process can be economic on a commercial scale.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/L011875/1","grantId":"BB/L011875/1","fundValue":"65503","fundStart":"2014-02-03","fundEnd":"2016-02-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Ina Esther Lahmann","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Bangor University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
