{"id":"FC2F590F-896E-452F-99FB-86AF65B71514","title":"Multi-scale markers of circadian rhythm changes for monitoring of mental health","abstractText":"Almost one quarter of adults currently experience some form of mental health disorder in the UK, costing the healthcare system an estimated &pound;77 billion each year. However, there exists very little objective or real-time monitoring of sufferers of mental health issues. This pilot project will investigate the development of a novel data fusion framework that will be suitable for combining many observations of a patient's behaviour to allow accurate mental health monitoring in any environment. Recent studies have shown that certain types of physical behaviour, daily cycles (circadian rhythms) and social networking activity can be indicative of an individual's state of mental health. However, recording the necessary data to make a diagnosis is difficult, both due to the nature of the health issues and because of the instrumentation needed. Recent developments in commercially available equipment (including smart phones) mean that we now have the opportunity to cheaply and routinely record human behaviour as well as daily patterns of physiology (such as sleep and cardiac activity). By then applying advanced pattern recognition and data fusion techniques, we intend to provide daily feedback of mental well-being to both the patient and care providers. This could facilitate early interventions in deteriorating individuals, thereby lowering costs of health care and reducing the severity of the illness. We also intend to begin to answer the more fundamental question about how circadian rhythms change as mental health deteriorates. \nThe developed of a user-friendly and user-controlled monitoring system, together with a suite of suitable algorithms, will be an important step towards a larger integration of the ever increasing multi-dimensional biometric data we are beginning to collect. This includes signals such as location, body temperature, speech patterns and social interaction behaviours. The potential to fuse data from many different sensors, and many different algorithm, will provide a platform for intelligible interpretation of the vast quantities of data that are beginning to confront researchers in biomedical applications. It will also help to improve the accuracy of monitoring systems and provide the doctor with more objective assessments of patient behaviour, which could lead to more accurate and timely diagnoses.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/K020161/1","grantId":"EP/K020161/1","fundValue":"89003","fundStart":"2013-07-01","fundEnd":"2014-06-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The findings have now been used to provide additional information for an ongoing and scaled study at the department of Psychiatry in Oxford 'the AMoSS study' and are informing how and what instrumentation patients will toleration.\n\nPsychiatric patients have reported an increased feeling of wellbeing and satisfaction, as well as a deeper understanding of their own condition, and how they can try to manage it through behavioural changes.\n\nCollaboration with industry has led to a long term partnership (with Proteus Biomed), with potential impacts on the UK economy.\n\nSoftware from the project has been posted open source and other groups around the country have started to investigate the usage of the software.

We found that we were able to differentiate between schizophrenics and control patients with a 85% accuracy using movement, and a 95% accuracy using movement and a wearable heart rate sensor. This is the first time that mental health has been quantified in such a way and opens up a new path in digital mental health. We are continuing the project with funding from the Wellcome Trust and are expanding the analysis to include social networking behavior and other physiology. \n\nA new collaboration with Proteus Digital Health was established, which will enable us to translate the research into clinical practice much more rapidly.\n\nWe also have a significant publication in press: Maxim Osipov, Yashar Behzadi, John M. Kane, Georgios Petrides, Gari D. Clifford, Objective identification and analysis of physiological and behavioural signs of schizophrenia, Journal of Mental Health. We expect the rich data to provide many more results over the next few years and are creating the world's richest data set on mental health, which is being adopted as a standard in Oxford's Psychiatric Research and hopefully in clinical practice.\nIn the medium term we expect companies like Proteus Digital Health to provide monitoring of psychiatric patients and our algorithms as severity of illness assessments to identify rapid deterioration or inappropriate medication / low compliance. \n\nDuring the project we developed a substantial suite of open source software to run on smart phones, and have made that publicly available either directly on Google Play (AMoSS) or via google code. We expect other researchers to freely use this software to extend our results and apply it to other patient health issues.
