{"id":"3DA686F6-0C55-4D1B-BF1C-BCF658059166","title":"Dynamic cues of proceptivity, signal direction, and their influence on attractiveness judgements","abstractText":"<p>The subjective experience of finding someone attractive presumably affects one's inclination to direct &quot;mating effort&quot; toward that target. The psychology of sexual attraction should have evolved to encourage adaptive allocations of mating effort. Thus, attraction should be experienced in relation to cues of the expected return on mating effort, that is, of the target's likely receptivity to being courted.</p>\n\n<p>Several criteria of attractiveness affect judges similarly, leading to considerable consensus in attractiveness ratings of opposite-sex targets, but this consensus is far from perfect. Personal experience with the target person may explain some of the variability in attractiveness judgements, since such experience provides predictive information about the chances of a receptive response. This suggests that receptive behaviour of person B towards person A may cause a persistent change in B's attractiveness in A's eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Intuitive though this may be, there is little empirical evidence on the topic. This grant proposes a series of studies investigating the interactions between proceptivity, signal direction, and the sex of the receiver and signaller. Interviews of actors behaving proceptively and unreceptively will be simultaneously filmed from multiple viewpoints, allowing both type and direction of signal to be manipulated within the stimuli.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E011578/1","grantId":"ES/E011578/1","fundValue":"155249","fundStart":"2006-12-18","fundEnd":"2008-12-17","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Scott Penton-Voak","coPersons":["Andrew Peter Clark"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
