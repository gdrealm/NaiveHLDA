Most of this occurs in those regions which are far from land and which are usually quite poorly provided with the plant nutrients required to fuel growth. In the most desert-like regions found in the tropical and subtropical oceans, some bacteria use sunlight for photosynthesis in just same way as the plants on land and are also able to exploit the abundant nitrogen present in the overlying atmosphere. This nitrogen-fixing process not only supports the growth of these bacteria under these hostile, nutrient-poor conditions but also adds this additional source of nitrogen to the oceans that then acts a fertilizer for other marine life.\n\nThe nitrogen-fixers are usually found in ocean regions where there is a deficit in the availability of other forms of nitrogen and so are at a particular advantage in these areas. The nitrogen deficit is due to other types of bacteria that remove nitrogen from the ocean in a process known as denitrification. Usually, these denitrifiers, as they are called, are only found to be active in deeper waters where the reduced availability of oxygen allows them to thrive under conditions where other life is usually quite sparse. We have found, though, that the denitrifiers and the nitrogen fixers seem to be able to live together nearer to the surface and, what is more, that they are both active in the cycling of nitrogen in the oceans.\n\nThe research to be carried out in this proposal is focussed on firstly putting names to these denitrifiers, so that we can recognise where they are found in the oceans, and secondly, on trying to find out what these bacteria might be doing within this newly discovered association. This is important because the oceans help to drawdown carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the rates at which they do so depend on how fertile they are. If the denitrifiers are removing large quantities of nitrogen from the surface waters then this will affect the overall productivity of the oceans. We rely on the microscopic plants found in the ocean to lock away some of the extra carbon dioxide that is released to the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels. If their vital nitrogen supply is reduced by denitrification then this unfixed carbon dioxide will be left in the atmosphere to contribute to future global warming.\n\nAnother important facet of this research is that the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide can be released in the denitrification process as well as being consumed. Not only does this gas warm the planet when it is vented to the atmosphere but it is also responsible for breaking down some of the ozone layer that filters out hazardous ultraviolet rays from the sun. We need to know also, therefore, what the likely scale of the impact of nitrous oxide cycling within this consortium of bacteria is and how it might be affected by future climate change.\n\nBy improving our understanding of the scale of nitrogen inputs and losses that might occur in the newly discovered bacterial association we should be in a better informed position to assess how significant the partners in the consortium are in the larger scale global nitrogen cycle that influences the fertility of the land as well as the oceans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NE/K015095/1","grantId":"NE/K015095/1","fundValue":"123813","fundStart":"2014-02-15","fundEnd":"2015-08-14","funder":"NERC","impactText":"","person":"Michael  Wyman","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Stirling","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
