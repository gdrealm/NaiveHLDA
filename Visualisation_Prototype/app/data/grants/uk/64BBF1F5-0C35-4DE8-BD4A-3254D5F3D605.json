Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the footpath network has been used as a basis for a wide range of policy-relevant analyses including pedestrian accessibility to public facilities, site options for new infrastructure and assessing how vulnerable groups can access services such as pharmacies.

Outcomes are therefore a better description of what the project has achieved and these include: \n\n\n\n1. There is substantial value in developing footpath networks in UK cities as these significantly improve the accuracy of accessibility analyses. In the case of Belfast, the network is 75% more extensive than the default road network and has 557% more individual elements. Given that the greatest influence on physical activity appears to be the immediate vicinity (i.e. ten minutes walk) of the home, such improvements in accuracy could lead to far more robust research on environment-behaviour interactions.\n\n\n\n2. The GIS platform of the RWN provides enhanced value as it allows pedestrian data to be combined with a range of other existing information. For example, it has been combined with data on land use and density to provide an assessment of overall walkability. It has also been combined with socio-economic and census data to help identify those groups that could differentially benefit from access improvements. There is potential for combining the network data with a range of other data sources (e.g. environmental health licensing of fast food outlets) to provide a range of powerful analyses that can make policy interventions more targeted and effective. The use of the tool has enabled, for the first time to orientate policies and services around the concept of walkability and pedestrian access allowing it to become a central criteria on a range of policy contexts.\n\n\n\n3. There are, however, outstanding issue on how the data and model established by this project can be managed in the long-term to provide an ongoing and publicly-available resource, which is an area that we are continuing to work on with our project partners.\n\n \n\n4. The development of the RWN was very time and resource intensive and may therefore not be replicable in every city. However, there are a growing number of data sources, including those held by Great Britainâ€™s Ordnance Survey and open access map data that is being released that would form a substantial basis for such a network. \n\n\n\n5. As a knowledge exchange project, KESUE has highlighted the great benefits that can be derived from extending and adapting university research projects into a policy-relevant resource. This appears to have been to mutual benefits to both external partners and the researchers themselves, who are now better placed to undertake impact-related research in the future. The project has also highlighted the value of close, integrated partnerships within healthy cities between knowledge producers, with knowledge users, such as local authorities and other statutory agencies. \n\n\n\n6. In addition to the policy-related outcomes, the project has facilitated a number of research insights that are being developed through papers for peer-reviewed journals and which contribute to our understanding of how best to measure connectivity in cities; the appropriate geographic scales for analysing built-environment-behaviour interactions; and the development of more accurate measures of walkability. See above. This project has established a GIS-enabled footpath network that has many potential routes for exploitation. It was designed as a policy-support tool for decisions in public health, transport and planning but through its initial use many other potential uses have been identified. For example it ahs been used to generate a walkability map of Belfast and Derry and is being used to support initiatives on Healthy Ageing and Park management in Belfast. \n\n\n\nAlthough it was designed primarily for a policy-tool, it also has potential commercial value as it is a more accurate reflection of pedestrian routes within Belfast and Derry-Londonderry and could therefore be of use within apps and data bases that require such locational data, such as transport models, public information and navigation aids.\n\n\n\nThe data also has potential use as a research tool as it enables a more accurate sampling of built environmental features for studies examining the links between the built environment and physical activity and will be used in this capacity by an inter-disciplinary team of researchers at Queen's University Belfast.
