There are alternatives to oil, gas and nuclear such as \nwater, wind and solar power. Of those, the latter is a virtually unlimited power source \nand we think that every effort should be undertaken to try to harvest the power \nof the sun. This is not an easy task because light energy needs to \nbe converted into a form of energy that can be stored and supplied \non demand. A convenient storage medium are molecules comprised of atoms\nthat are held together by energy-rich covalent bonds. Indeed, over millions of years \nnature has stored sun light in form of organic molecules (fossil fuels) via natural \nphotosynthesis. A carbon-free alternative storage medium is molecular hydrogen with \nthe added advantage that the energy density that can be stored with hydrogen \nis significantly larger than for fossil fuels. Thus, molecular hydrogen is envisaged as one of \nthe primary energy carriers of the future. One of the grand challenges for scientists \nis to find or design a cheap catalyst that allows for efficient production of hydrogen from \nsunlight and a source for hydrogen atoms, ideally water. \n\nClearly, one of the most sustainable approaches to hydrogen production is \nphotocatalytic water oxidation, although this process requires efficient catalysts. \nTheir design is by no means trivial and can probably be considered as the holy grail \nof contemporary material science. A viable alternative that we investigate here \nis to exploit biological molecules (hydrogenases) that can be found in microbes \nsuch as green algae and cyanobacteria capable of photosynthetic water splitting. \nPilot plants of H2 producing organisms exist, but there are major barriers that must \nbe overcome to bring the process to commercial viability. The most important one that \nneeds to be addressed is the high sensitivity of the organism's hydrogenase to \nmolecular oxygen. Evolved under anaerobic conditions, the biomolecule gets inhibited or \ndamaged upon exposure of the oxygen that is around us in the atmosphere. \n\nThere is evidence that hydrogenases may be modified so as to render the molecule \nless sensitive to oxygen. In order to facilitate this optimization process we propose\nhere to investigate theoretically the primary events of the oxidative damage, that is diffusion \nand binding of oxygen molecules to the active site of hydrogenases, by developing \nnovel molecular simulation methods. The simulations will help to understand and \ninterpret recent experimental measurements on a molecular level. For example, \nthey will allow us to understand which pathways oxygen molecules take before they \ndamage the active site and how fast this process occurs. The microscopic information \ngained from simulation will be vital for the suggestion of modifications (mutations) \nof hydrogenase that aim to restrict the access and the binding of molecular oxygen \nwhile leaving the catalytic power for hydrogen production unchanged. The effects \nof the suggested mutations will be predicted by our simulations and tested in vitro \nby an experimental colleague. \n\nThe long term goal of this project is to obtain a hydrogenase mutant with \nsignificantly increased aerotolerance, which can be used for hydrogen production \non a technological scale. This would have a tremendous socio-economic impact \nas the hydrogen industry is likely to take a prominent position on the \nfuture energy market.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J016764/1","grantId":"EP/J016764/1","fundValue":"166190","fundStart":"2012-11-30","fundEnd":"2014-11-29","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze hydrogen oxidation and reduction.
