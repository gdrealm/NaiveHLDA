In this region well over a million children die of severe infection in hospital each year. Currently, antimalarial and antimicrobial drugs are the mainstay of treatment, however most deaths occur early, due to the complications of severe illness, and before definitive treatments have time to act. In this situation doctors have to rely upon supportive therapies to treat complications and try to improve outcome. Defining which are the best life saving treatments has been frustrated by the lack of clinical trials addressing this issue. \n\nCorrection of fluid deficits by rapid infusion (volume expansion) is practised routinely for sick children presenting for emergency care and would be a logical supportive treatment for African children with severe illness and signs of impaired perfusion. Currently, reticence to adopt this approach remains and so most children are managed with little or no additional fluid. In these circumstances the method resolving uncertainty is though in a clinical trial.\n\nFEAST is a multi centre study which aims to address this question and to definitively establish whether volume expansion with saline or albumin improves disability-free survival and whether this is best achieved by saline, a cheap a widely used solution or the more expensive colloid, albumin (a safe bi-product of a blood transfusion). \n\nIf benefit were shown it could potentially save thousands of lives of young children annually. Preliminary analysis suggest that this represents a highly cost effective method for improving child survival and which could be easily adopted within future international guidelines for treating children with severe illness and signs of impaired perfusion.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801439","grantId":"G0801439","fundValue":"2608160","fundStart":"2008-08-01","fundEnd":"2012-01-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathryn  Maitland","coPersons":["Sarah  Kiguli","Jane Margaret Crawley","Hugh  Reyburn","James Kananura Tibenderana","Diana  Gibb","Abdel Ghayoum Babiker","Michael  Levin","Trudie  Lang"],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
