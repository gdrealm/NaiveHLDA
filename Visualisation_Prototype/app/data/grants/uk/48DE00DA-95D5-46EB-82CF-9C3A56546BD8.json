The first phase of the official history of British intelligence was marked by the release of Sir Harry Hinsley's multi-volume history of British intelligence in the Second World War. We reached the second phase of institutional history in 2010 with the release of the official histories of SIS and the Security Service. Intelligence history has been marked by an analytical concern with institutions, 'intelligence failure', 'intelligence success' and the quantification of the relative importance of intelligence for politics and military operations. Intelligence history has not, however, always been linked to wider developments in modern historiography, specifically the 'cultural turn'. Intelligence history has developed either along national lines, 'British intelligence' etc., or through the study of international intelligence alliances, e.g. the UK-USA alliance. Britain is an acknowledged leader in intelligence history and supports a vibrant community of scholars. Other countries, specifically Germany, in the opinion of the German project collaborators, lag behind. There is thus room for an approach that stresses two relatively new elements in intelligence history: the study of intelligence 'culture'; and the comparative study of unallied intelligence cultures, and the transnational links between them. The project will interrogate whether there are distinctive national intelligence cultures. It will ask whether the intelligence field, by its very functioning, creates the 'secret service disposition' without which it could not function. It will further interrogate the existence of specific national habitats, the durable set of cognitive and affective dispositions rooted in early socialization, the characteristic ways of moving, speaking, and interacting with others that create and sustain the immediate complicity within a culture. National intelligence cultures will be compared in an analysis of transnational culture. The comparison of national cultures will open up the possibility that there is, in fact, an intelligence 'game', constituting an objective transnational complicity which underlies all antagonisms. The project team maintain that human intelligence provides the best vehicle for such a study. Thanks, in part, to popular history a binary divide has opened up between the study of scientific intelligence, particularly signals intelligence and its variants, and human intelligence. The latter is often portrayed as more amateurish and less important than the former. Nothing could be further from the truth. German historians have recently demonstrated that human intelligence itself developed into a scientific pursuit over the course of the twentieth-century. Using the example of Prisoner-of-War interrogations they have demonstrated that human intelligence became more massified, more technological and more scientific during the first half of the century. Yet human intelligence could never dispense with the 'ghost in the machine'. It was marked by constant interaction between officers, agents, archivists, scientists, doctors, interrogators, prisoners, journalists, wider society. In other words the study human intelligence provides the classic building blocks for the study of culture. The project team have developed a six-fold matrix with which to analyse intelligence. It comprises a vertical analysis of: a) public discourses on military intelligence; b) the public treatment of military intelligence by experts; and, c) the discourse within the military, and military praxis, that is, the exchange of opinions within the apparatuses. The horizontal axis comprises: a) the place of the secret services in society and the military; b) personification, and c) the types of knowledge that the intelligence services were interested in, and their sources of information.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J000175/1","grantId":"AH/J000175/1","fundValue":"279551","fundStart":"2012-11-01","fundEnd":"2016-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Research is still held within the research team and the partner Gerda Henkel Foundation project.

The investigation into the cultures of intelligence yields a set of systematic insights that differ from those offered by investigations into specific bureaucracies or operations. The stress is shifted to the wealth of information rather than the many well-publicised gaps in the archival record. An element of the underlying research will serve as a guide for any researcher in the intelligence field. The research team has had to work on a 'road map' of the intersections between intelligence bureaucracies, having found that one did not exist.
