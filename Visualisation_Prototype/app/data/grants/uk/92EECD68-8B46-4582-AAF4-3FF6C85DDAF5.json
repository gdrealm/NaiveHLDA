One reason why pneumococcus is able to cause severe infections is that it is coated with a layer of material made of sugars that is called the capsule. This capsule seems to act like a coat of armour, preventing the immune system from killing the bacteria and thereby allowing the bacteria to successfully invade the body. Although it is thought the capsule prevents white cells from getting rid of the pneumococcus, surprisingly little is known on exactly how the capsule disguises or protects the pneumococcus from different aspects of the bodies immune system. The aim of this project is to investigate precisely how the capsule helps the pneumococcus cause disease in particular pneumonia, the commonest severe disease it causes. We will identify which proteins on the white cell surface are prevented from recognising the pneumococcus by the capsule, and what are the consequences of this failure to identify properly the bacteria for the immune response and development of lung infection. As all vaccines against the pneumococcus that are in use at present rely on using the capsule, more detailed information on the functions of the capsule during infection will be helpful. Furthermore, the information obtained may allow the design of new effective therapies against the pneumococcus, and will provide more detailed information on how the pneumococcus is able to cause pneumonia even in previously healthy individuals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801211","grantId":"G0801211","fundValue":"350407","fundStart":"2009-11-15","fundEnd":"2012-11-14","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Jeremy Stuart Brown","coPersons":["Andres  Floto","Emmanuelle  Caron"],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
