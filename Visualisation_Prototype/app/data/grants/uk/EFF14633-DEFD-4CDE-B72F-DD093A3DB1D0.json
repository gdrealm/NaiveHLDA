DIAL lacks the ability to obtain true spectroscopic information in a single measurement, and therefore cannot benefit from the sophisticated analysis tools that exist in FTIR to extract the concentrations of multiple species from an absorption spectrum. A system combining the bandwidth and spectral resolution of FTIR, with the remote-sensing facility of DIAL would enhance and extend NPL's technical capability to monitor the emissions of greenhouse gases implicated in climate change.We propose to address this requirement by combining...(a) our world-leading work in femtosecond (fs) FTIR spectroscopy (we were the first group to demonstrate the technique)(b) our world-leading expertise in mid-infrared OPO frequency combs (again, we were the first group to demonstrate a fs OPO frequency comb)Normally FTIR spectroscopy is carried out with thermal sources (globars etc) that produce poorly collimated IR beams that are incompatible with free-space propagation over extended distances. By contrast, the output from a fs OPO has a broad IR bandwidth, approaching that of a thermal emitter, but - critically - has the spatial coherence of a laser, permitting free-space propagation over long distances. A fs OPO therefore provides a route to implementing free-space FTIR across several hundred cm-1 in a single measurement - sufficient to probe the characteristic absorption lines of many chemical species in a single measurement.Conscious of the practical challenges of implementing an interferometric technique over long distances, we propose a novel technical approach, to implement a robust, no-moving-parts FTIR system, which we will progress, in stages, from a bench-top demonstrator to a free-space field-trial at NPL's Teddington site.The concept is based around replacing a mechanically-scanned optical delay line with two asynchronous, phase-coherent mid-IR pulse sequences derived from identical OPOs. Uniquely, this approach is robust, and has the potential to acquire a high (&lt; 0.01 cm-1) resolution spectrum in only a few milliseconds. It offers precisely range-gated detection over propagation distance of potentially 100's of metres, and perhaps further using infrared time-correlated single-photon-counting detection (a technique which the project will have access to at Heriot-Watt).In comparison with DIAL, the technique offers greater spectral discrimination and the ability to simultaneously probe for multiple gases. Furthermore, it is all-solid-state, providing a potentially more compact and efficient solution than DIAL, and avoids the use of dye laser technology, eliminating the associated carccarcinogen hazard. It will extend sensing to new chemical species where suitable DIAL lines are unavailable, and is compatible with heterodyne / RF lock-in detection techniques for improved signal:noise performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H018190/1","grantId":"EP/H018190/1","fundValue":"347735","fundStart":"2010-02-01","fundEnd":"2013-01-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Derryck  Reid","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Heriot-Watt University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
