{"id":"75136B63-127E-4474-B099-B0BD2AFF456D","title":"Model theory, algebra, and differential equations","abstractText":"The project concerns applying ideas from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to the classification of differential equations. Model theory studies structures and definable sets. A structure in this sense is roughly speaking an underlying set or universe together with some collection of distinguished sets of n-tuples from the set, for varying n. Many parts or objects of mathematics can be fruitfully studied as structures. Differential equations, on the other hand, are equations which describe the rate of change, for example, of some quantity, and they lie behind all of modern science and much of modern technology. The project involves roughly viewing the set of solutions of a differential equation as a structure in the sense of model theory, and attempting to classify or understand such equations via the tools of model theory.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I002294/1","grantId":"EP/I002294/1","fundValue":"408941","fundStart":"2011-01-01","fundEnd":"2014-05-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The project has had an impact within mathematics, as well as on human resources, via the training of the Ph.D. student Nagloo, who now has a postdoctoral position at the City University of New York. Also the postdoctoral fellow Penazzi has now a position at Central Lancashire University. At the mathematical level, the impact has been in diverse areas: the algebraic theory of differential equations, algebraic geometry and number theory, geometric group theory, and topological dynamics, and of course model theory. Future impact is expected in the development of nonlinear special functions, in particular in developing effective tools to understand the interrelation between levels of complexity of special functions. The latter form the basic tools for almost all applications of mathematics where solutions of model equations are formulated in terms of appropriately chosen mathematical functions. Education Societal","person":"Frank Willem Nijhoff","coPersons":["H Dugald Macpherson","A V Mikhailov"],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":" Over the course of the project we solved one of the main problems raised in the proposal: the analysis of the 6 families of Painleve equations vis--a-vis transcendence \nproperties of sets of solutions, and model-theoretic notions of strong minimality and geometric triviality. This appears in the two joint papers of Nagloo and Pillay, as well as one paper by Nagloo. \nSome major progress on transcendence problems for exponential function relative to families of semiabelian varieties was obtained by Bertrand and Pillay, extending earlier results published in Journal AMS. These results are being written up now. Another related development was joint work with Bertrand, Masser and Zannjier on relative Manin-Mumford for semiabelian surfaces.\nOver the course of the project there were other key findings. The closest in relation to the project theme was joint with Benoist and Bouscaren and involved a new proof of the celebrated Mordel-Lang conjecture for function fields in positive characteristic. Also we intitiated an in-depth study of topological dynamics and definable groups, following the lead of Newelski. Several papers were written, including two with the postdoctoral fellow on the project, Davide Penazzi. \nIn the last 6 months of the project, due to early departure of the postdoctoral fellow, the remaining time of that position was taken up by Dr Cheng Zhang, who investigated aspects of integrable difference equations. In collaboration with Nijhoff he developed a boundary Lagrangian theory for integrable partial difference equations. An ongoing project between Nijhoff and Nagloo involves the geometry of higher order Painleve systems, the so-called Garnier systems. These form a yet unchartered area of research from the point of view of Model Theory and would form an exciting area in which the research of the project can be taken forward. The issues of transcendality and irreducibility of such systems form an important, but challenging area for the follow-up research, as they would reach for an insight into the understanding of novel classes of nonlinear special functions possessing properties which make them of interest for physics and the mathematical sciences of the future.
