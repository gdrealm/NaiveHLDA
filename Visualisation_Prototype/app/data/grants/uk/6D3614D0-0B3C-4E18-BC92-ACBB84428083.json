Complex cells such as those found in the human body are highly compartmentalised, with each compartment being surrounded by its own membrane. The major compartments in the cell are the nucleus, where DNA is found, and the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. The transport of large molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm takes place through pores in the nuclear membrane that separates these two compartments. During replication, viruses must find ways to deliver their individual building blocks to the correct sites in the cell for further processing, and in order to do this they hijack these transport pathways. As a result, viruses are excellent tools for unravelling the complexities of cellular transport, and to date studies on viruses have been fundamental in determining how movement occurs across the nuclear membrane. Such studies have revealed the presence of a group of cellular proteins that attach to specific viral cargoes and facilitate their movement through the pores. Although initially identified in virus infected cells, it has become clear that these cellular proteins are the basic components of all movement between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This proposal is concerned with a group of herpesvirus proteins called the UL47 proteins, several of which are known to move efficiently between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The two best-characterised UL47s are those from the human herpes simplex virus type 1 and bovine herpesvirus type 1, and although the role that these proteins play in virus growth has not yet been defined, both of them are major components of the virus particles that move from cell to cell causing infection. As both these viruses cause disease in their host animals, determining how these viruses relate to and exploit their host is of fundamental importance in combatting disease. We have previously carried out a basic characterisation of how these proteins move between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and have shown that the pathway involved may be an as yet uncharacterised system. We now wish to positively demonstrate how these viral proteins get into and out of the nucleus, and identify their cellular transport partners. To do this we will use large amounts of purified UL47 proteins to fish out cellular components that bind to the regions of UL47 known to be involved in transport. We will then compare the bound proteins to a database of human proteins and determine their identity. If we find new proteins we will undertake to establish the role of such proteins within the cell. In addition to understanding how the UL47s move between the nucleus and cytoplasm, we also wish to understand why they exhibit such transport. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that UL47 may be involved in binding another class of viral product, the messenger RNA molecules that are eventually used by the cell to make proteins. As the transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for virus growth, we wish to characterise this RNA binding and determine if the movement of UL47 between the nucleus and cytoplasm is a prerequisite for transport of viral RNA. There is a large community of scientists interested in the basic field of transport to and from the nucleus, and therefore it is anticipated that the data generated by the proposed study could have a wide audience. Identification of new cellular components for movement between the nucleus and cytoplasm will be of interest to cell biologists, and may reveal new pathways for the movement of specific cellular proteins. Furthermore, determining why the UL47 proteins move in this way will be of interest to herpesvirologists and will take us a step closer to understanding why these viruses package these transport proteins into their structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E016251/1","grantId":"BB/E016251/1","fundValue":"372674","fundStart":"2007-08-13","fundEnd":"2010-08-12","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  This research has not yet had impact beyond academia.

We have identified the key components of how this protein moves, including the regions of the protein involved and the cellular factors involved. The specific cellular proteins used are those that are specifically made in human skin cells - a natural cell type that HSV infects.\n\nBy contrast we showed that the equivalent protein from bovine herpesvirus type 1 does not use any of these known cellular proteins. However, we have not been able to pinpoint which cellular factors this virus does use to move its UL47 protein around the cell. Although technically challenging, this protein may hold the key to unravelling as yet unknown cellular transport pathways. Initial studies have been carried out to pursue this line of investigation. Researchers investigating cellular nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms could use our findings to further refine current knowledge on these pathways and identify novel, as yet unknown, pathways.\n\nKnowledge on the interaction between these virus proteins and their cellular partners could enable the development of antiviral drugs by pharmaceutical companies.
