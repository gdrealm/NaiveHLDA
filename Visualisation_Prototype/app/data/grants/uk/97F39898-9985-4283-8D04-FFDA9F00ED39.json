{"id":"97F39898-9985-4283-8D04-FFDA9F00ED39","title":"Automatic Proof Procedures for Polynomials and Special Functions","abstractText":"An engineering design is expected to satisfy safety constraints, many of which can be expressed as mathematical and logical formulas. Computer software exists that can check some such formulas automatically, but although they can have a large and complicated logical structure, the mathematical component currently has to be linear: in other words, involving nothing more complicated than addition. Real-world engineering problems involve sophisticated mathematical concepts, such as polynomials and transcendental functions.The investigators have developed software (called MetiTarski and RAHD) that can solve such problems in many cases. The current project will extend the scope of this software, increasing its power and targeting it at specific real-world application areas. One such application is analogue circuitry, which is widespread in consumer electronics. The project will investigate many other potential applications In engineering and the mathematical sciences.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I011005/1","grantId":"EP/I011005/1","fundValue":"533183","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2014-10-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Dr C?sar Mu?oz, who belongs to the Formal Methods group at NASA Langley, has used our software (MetiTarski) in conjunction with avionics problems.

Version 1.9 was released to the research community in August 2011, and a dramatically more powerful Version 2.0 was released in the first half of 2012. Version 2.4 was released in October 2014.\n\nWe have made fundamental discoveries about how such software should be built for best performance, in particular through our investigations of backtracking and through special modifications of the decision procedures that we call. We are also making progress on applications of this software in control engineering, for example, to prove stability. We have developed new technology for this purpose. Other work has examined the role of machine learning in supporting computer algebra generally. Integration with the PVS proof assistant makes it available to users such as NASA. Also integrated with the KeYmaera hybrid system verifier. Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Transport","dataset":"gtr"}
