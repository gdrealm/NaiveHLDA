A New Treatment of Tense and Modality","abstractText":"The question of whether English has a future tense is a controversial one. Grammarians are sharply divided, with a consensus that 'will' is basically a modal (and hence that English does not have a future tense), but with a significant minority of leading scholars who maintain that it marks future tense. The issue is theoretically important because it goes to the heart of different conceptions of tense and modality in the languages of the world, two key research areas in linguistics. It also has a practical significance: teachers of English language struggle to give their students guidance which is both coherent and in accordance with the facts.\\n\\nMy research so far has convinced me that most of arguments in the literature in favour of one analysis or the other have little force. I have also come to the conclusion that the problem is wrongly stated as a simple either-or choice. Any classification system which attempts to make sense of messy data needs to be based on the notion of PROTOTYPES: some phenomena are easy to classify because they meet all the taxonomic criteria (a robin is a prototypical bird), while others do not meet all the criteria (an ostrich is a bird, but it is not a prototypical bird because it does not fly). The same is true for categories in grammar, as many linguists recognise. I have proposed that 'will' is a tense and a modal, but it is non-prototypical for both categories. I am currently writing a paper which argues for this solution to the future tense problem.\\n\\nStudying 'will' in this way raises a group of issues which have not been treated properly in previous work on future time reference in English. Some of these issues relate to other areas of English grammar; others concern major theoretical debates about the meaning and use of language; yet others involve contrasting English with other European languages. A number of these languages raise similar puzzles to English, notably German and Dutch. Others are useful for comparison because they have an inflectional future tense (French,) or lack a future tense (Finnish). My work will benefit from a multilingual corpus of texts in English and their translation into other languages, an innovation in research of this kind. \\n\\nThis research project will result in the first book-length study of this area since 1982. It will be aimed at the many scholars around the world working on tense and modality, and it will be a major contribution to research in both areas. Beyond its theoretical contribution, my research will also clarify the issues for anyone writing a reference grammar of English in the future. This in turn will benefit language teachers, who will be able to give more reliable guidance to learners of English. \\n\\nI hope that it will also help teachers and students to understand that classification schemes and analytical systems are attempts by humans to understand a complex universe, and they are always imperfect / which is why prototype theory is so important. This is certainly true of grammars, so when students ask 'Is 'really' an adverb?' or 'Is 'will' a tense?' or any question of the form 'Does X belong to the category Y?', they need to be aware that an honest answer often has to take the form: 'Yes and no: it is legitimate to classify X as a Y for these reasons, but for other reasons X is not a clear-cut example of Y.' Prototype theory can thus become part of a simple but vital message for students: analytical categories have to be based on evidence, and sometimes the evidence does not lead to simple solutions -- in grammar, and everywhere else.\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/E000290/1","grantId":"AH/E000290/1","fundValue":"28691","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2007-05-31","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Raphael  Salkie","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
