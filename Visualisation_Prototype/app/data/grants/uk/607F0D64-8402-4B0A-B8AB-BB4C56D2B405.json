It will apply the Innogen Centre's approaches to Adaptive Governance of Innovative Technology (AGIT) and Critical Stakeholder Engagement (CSE) to two case studies on understanding of current regulatory decisions/processes for genetically modified (GM) crops. The project will include consideration of the roles of experts and non-experts in the field, how they use evidence, and how they influence policy decisions.<br /><br />Innogen Centre staff have been closely involved in analysing and commenting on these areas of policy since the early 1990s when there was still considerable uncertainty about the safety of GM crops to people and the environment. The expectation at that time was that the precautionary approach would be modified if and when evidence of the safety and efficacy of GM crops became available. This project will focus on whether and how the regulatory system could become more adaptive to the latest scientific evidence on the safety and benefits of GM crops. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K005642/1","grantId":"ES/K005642/1","fundValue":"16000","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Joyce  Tait","coPersons":["David  Castle"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
