{"id":"85A1DA5F-002A-40A6-95D6-F50C65F7499F","title":"The Transition to International Accounting Standards: Harmonisation or Discord?","abstractText":"<p>In 2005 it became mandatory for all EU listed firms to report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Transition issues are becoming prominent in accounting and finance research and are highly relevant for corporate market participants, standard setters and financial analysts. This harmonisation process is designed to enhance the comparability of financial statements across countries, minimise the costs of account preparation under different regimes, facilitate company valuation, and clarify the underlying economics of the firm. </p> \n<p>Significant risks underlie the introduction and implementation of the new rules related to their applicability in different environments and to the technical challenges presented. For example, while investors familiarise with new methods of corporate reporting, analysts' support will be limited due to the difficulty in forecasting IFRSs figures and the lack of sell-side analysts using an IFRS basis for forecasts. The risk of inefficiencies and market mis-pricing will increase if the new rules provide additional scope for managing reported earnings and book value.</p> \n<p>The series will consist of one conference and two one-day workshops each year for two years, and will promote the research dissemination and peer networking activities of young and emerging researchers. Its interdisciplinary theme will be of interest to researchers in auditing, accounting, market-based accounting research, financial management, finance and international business.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-451-25-4253","grantId":"RES-451-25-4253","fundValue":"15605","fundStart":"2006-10-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"  The seminar series was exceptionally successful.
