By analysing the differences/ similarities in tooth shape and DNA from their modern and ancient remains, we will explore their geographic origins in prehistory, which in turn will provide important new information about the continental European origins and exchange networks of the early human inhabitants of Orkney.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=119396/1","grantId":"119396/1","fundValue":"157442","fundStart":"2006-03-10","fundEnd":"2008-07-09","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Keith Mark Dobney","coPersons":["Paul  O'Higgins","Jeremy B.
