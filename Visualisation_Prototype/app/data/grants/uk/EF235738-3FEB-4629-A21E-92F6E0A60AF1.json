{"id":"EF235738-3FEB-4629-A21E-92F6E0A60AF1","title":"Synthetic Components Network: Towards Synthetic Biology From The Bottom Up","abstractText":"Synthetic biology is a new research field that is emerging at the interface between the biological &amp; physical sciences and engineering. Essentially, the field involves the generation of new biological and so-called biomimetic systems to create new functions not (yet) observed in biology. What does this mean? In essence, it is a new science that could lead to new biological and biology-like entities that could produce new drugs, fuels and materials. Many researchers joining this new area are taking what is termed a 'top-down' approach: that is, they are taking existing biological organisms (usually bacteria) and making them simpler by removing genes; or the scientists are encouraging them to perform new tasks by engineering in new sets of genes from other organisms. We propose to take the opposite approach, namely to build new synthetic biological systems from the bottom up. To do this we need to understand how biology assembles and organises its various molecules (proteins, DNA, sugars and so on) to create working cells and multi-cellular systems. In short, we aim to create molecular toolkits based on those that Nature has evolved, and then we will use these toolkits to assemble larger systems that perform new functions. As this is such a new field we will not simply march into the lab and get started with experiments. First, we propose to gather together a Network of scientists from different disciplines to help define the field and a sensible way forward within it. There are also good ethical reasons why will do this first as explained below. Such new developments will always carry lay and public concerns, and a field labelled 'synthetic biology' is bound to raise some eyebrows if not alarm bells. As scientists it is important for us to conduct this research in order (1) to test the limits in our understanding of natural biological systems, and (2) to tap any potential technology developments that could benefit mankind and the environment. This is particularly so with an interface area such as synthetic biology, which promises much in terms of new materials, biofuels and medicines. Therefore, as a Network, we will endeavour to address any potential public concerns and issues raised in the new field at a very early stage. To do this, our Network will not only include scientists and engineers but also have ethicists, philosophers and academics expert in engaging the public in science and technology amongst its membership. This will allow informed debate of the potential issues of public concerns, as well as a thorough examination of the possible benefits and shortcomings of any new emerging technology. In addition, we have entered agreements with national science centres, including @Bristol and the Think Tank, Birmingham, to hold public events and create new installations to raise public awareness of the new area.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/F01872X/1","grantId":"BB/F01872X/1","fundValue":"125833","fundStart":"2009-01-01","fundEnd":"2012-06-29","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Dek Neil Woolfson","coPersons":["Jonathan Michael Rossiter"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
