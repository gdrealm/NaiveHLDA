Graphite acts as a moderator to slow neutrons down and make them more effective for nuclear fission. It is also a structural component, so the otherwise slippery and weak single crystal graphite is not used but rather the components are polycrystalline (in the same way that a rock comprises many different interlocking mineral crystallites). In the course of its neutron moderation it becomes damaged, more porous and the individual crystallites change their shape. These changes are carefully monitored but we need to be able to predict the changes so that we can better gauge the life expectancy of our reactors. It will be an important step towards meeting the UK's commitments to carbon emission reduction to 2020 and beyond. In the longer term, High Temperature gas-cooled Reactors (HTRs) are internationally seen as an important source of power, in particular for hydrogen production, so we need similarly to show that future international HTRs could be capable of operating for 60-100 years. Materials Test reactor data for nuclear graphite are incomplete due to the early termination of irradiation experiments aimed at giving lifetime data for UK AGRs.When the original theories of graphite were formulated in the 60's and 70's, less was known about the hexagonal carbon nets that are the layers of graphite. We now know these nets can be isolated and studied on their own (the discovery of graphene in 2004 by Andre Geim and co-workers at Manchester), they can be rolled into tubes (discovery of nanotubes by Iijima in 1991) and they can form into balls (discovery of fullerenes by Kroto and coworkers in 1985). Thus, existing theories did not think to account for buckling or folding of the graphite layers, which we have shown to be important in radiation damage.In addition, electron microscopes were not as powerful then as now: we can get pictures of the layers of graphite in atomic detail. We can detect spectroscopic signatures of different structures from Raman and electron spectroscopy and even perform holography of the polycrystalline graphite with nanometre precision. Finally, the progress in computer software and hardware means that we can calculate exactly the structures that will result from neutrons colliding with carbon atoms by solving the equations of motion of the electrons that hold atoms together. The comparison between the length of a carbon-carbon bond, which is about one seventh of a nanometre, and the length of a typical graphite component (about a metre) is unbelievably large: 7,000,000,000! So we must use different theories for different length scales so that we can combine our understanding from measurements and simulation at every scale in between. Thus we use a multiscale approach to calculate the shape, strength and rigidity of the graphite components taking into account what the neutrons do to individual atoms, to the layers they reside in, to the crystallites and then to the component as a whole.The result will give predictive power to the nuclear utilities and to the designers of the next generation of inherently safe and efficient very high temperature reactors.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I002588/1","grantId":"EP/I002588/1","fundValue":"246587","fundStart":"2010-10-01","fundEnd":"2014-09-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The research outputs from this project have been disseminated to industry partners via regular workshops.

Novel understanding of models for point defect generation and migration \n•In situ observation of ion damage has given new insights in the defect dynamics and radiation response of graphitic materials including: Dislocation formation from grain boundaries; dislocation array formation; kink band formation\n•Obervation of ion irradiation induced 5-7 member rings in SuperSTEM which modelling has shown to induce buckling of the basal planes\n•Mrozowski crack modification has been observed under irradiation and annealing\n•Developed an initial microstructural model for nuclear grade graphite derived from polarized light microscopy, XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM.\n•Initiated studies of neutron-irradiated specimens (as a function of dose and temperature) using XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM. \n•Have established several international collaborations (Idaho National Lab., University of Michigan, PyroMAN, AIST) and it was through one of these (INL) that neutron-irradiated samples were acquired. This project is part of the FunGraph consortium, established with the successful EPSRC proposal &quot;Fundamentals of current and future uses of nuclear graphite&quot;. The consortium has been arguably the most productive and knowledgeable academic network worldwide in nuclear graphite, undertaking research over all lengthscales from atomistic to reactor component level, from fundamental science to engineering design. It has extensive partnerships with the UK's Nuclear Regulator (Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR)), industry (EDF, AMEC, Serco, Rolls Royce), national and international laboratories and facilities (National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL), UKAEA, Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Dalton Cumbria Facility (DCF)). Findings will be used be of value to both academic researchers and to our industrial partners and the energy regulators. Energy","dataset":"gtr"}
