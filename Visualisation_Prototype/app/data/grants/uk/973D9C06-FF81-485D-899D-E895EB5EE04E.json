{"id":"973D9C06-FF81-485D-899D-E895EB5EE04E","title":"Organisational Change, Resistance and Democracy: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equalities Initiatives in Local Government","abstractText":"<p>This project builds on existing research by exploring the impact of the changing policy environment on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equalities initiatives. It will enable development of three key analytical themes: processes of local authority resistance and compliance, cultural change, and tensions concerning democracy. The research will use and develop innovative qualitative Action Learning Set and tracking methodologies, a focus group, and interviews with local and national stakeholders. Involvement in the participative aspect of the methodology will benefit participants by enabling mutual learning. In addition, development of the Action Learning Set methodology and the tracking methodology for use in the local authority context will form a useful outcome for other researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The research will make a significant and lasting contribution to academic, policy, and activist debates about equalities and diversities initiatives, local democracy, governance and organisational cultures, and sexual and gender minorities. It is extremely topical, given the swiftly changing policy environment. The beneficiaries will include LGBT people and LGBT community organisations; practitioners working with LGBT people or those unsure of their gender or sexuality; policy makers in the statutory sector, and academics working in the fields of sociology, social policy, gender studies, organisational studies, and politics.<br /></p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-062-23-0577","grantId":"RES-062-23-0577","fundValue":"230767","fundStart":"2007-10-17","fundEnd":"2010-03-16","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Diane  Richardson","coPersons":["Surya Chiara Monro"],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
