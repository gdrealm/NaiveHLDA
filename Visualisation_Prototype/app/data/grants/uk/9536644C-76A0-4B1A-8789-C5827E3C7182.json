Psoriasis, a life long skin disorder, is amongst a group of common conditions associated with chronic irritation and inflammation. Available evidence points to a fundamental defect in the capacity for barrier protection, dysregulation of the immune network or a combination of these through abnormal communication between skin and immune pathways. In order to develop new and effective therapies, a clear understanding of these processes and the fundamental defects that characterise the risk of developing psoriasis is now required. From a well defined region of the human genome, we have set out a series of studies designed to characterise the primary alterations that generate a very much increased risk disease development. Progress towards more effective ways to prevent or cure psoriasis would be expected to cut both in the short and long term, the heavy burden of chronic inflammation, and thus lead to a significant health and economic benefits compared to the present management of this disorder.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0601387","grantId":"G0601387","fundValue":"1561130","fundStart":"2007-07-23","fundEnd":"2012-07-22","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard Charles Trembath","coPersons":["Adrian  Hayday","Jonathan Nicholas Barker","Frank  Nestle"],"organisation":"King's College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
