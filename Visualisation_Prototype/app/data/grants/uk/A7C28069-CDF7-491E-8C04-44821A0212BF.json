But that same capacity for distraction means that concentrating on an activity of choice is sometimes difficult. </p>\n\n<p>Auditory stimuli are particularly effective at distracting cognitive activities even when such activities are based on visually-presented material. Clearly there is a delicate balance to be struck between the need to be focused and the need to be distractible. </p>\n\n<p>This project aims to understand the factors that contribute to this balance and in particular whether some forms of auditory distraction can be brought under volitional control and hence are avoidable whereas others are inevitable. </p>\n\n<p>Individuals will be required to try to concentrate on remembering a sequence of visually-presented words while sounds that are to be ignored are presented in the background. We will examine whether attentional capture by infrequent deviations within the sound can be resisted under certain conditions such as a high workload within the focal task, the provision of a warning about the deviation, and increased incentive to avoid distraction. At the same time, we will test the hypothesis that another form of distraction - that known to be caused by continuously changing sound - cannot be so readily resisted. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-4257","grantId":"RES-000-22-4257","fundValue":"80654","fundStart":"2010-11-01","fundEnd":"2011-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Robert Wyn  Hughes","coPersons":["Dylan  Jones"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
