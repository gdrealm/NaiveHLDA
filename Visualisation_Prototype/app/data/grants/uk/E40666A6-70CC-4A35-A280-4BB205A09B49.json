The high quality of the data returned by the RGS (in terms of sensitivity and resolution) allows astronomers to determine the physical conditions of sources of high-energy radiation, in our Galaxy and far beyond, with unprecedented accuracy.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G008868/1","grantId":"ST/G008868/1","fundValue":"69375","fundStart":"2009-04-01","fundEnd":"2011-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Graziella  Branduardi-Raymont","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
