{"id":"A968020C-CF9A-4BE3-A039-FF51CEEA0708","title":"Modelling and analysis of the interactive behaviour of ubiquitous systems","abstractText":"This project funds subsistence and travel so that Jose Creissac Campos and Michael Harrison can collaborate in Newcastle over a period of four months. Usability engineering continues to be a craft skill practised using walkthrough techniques and heuristics that depend on, and are sensitive to, the skills and knowledge of the practitioner. Campos and Harrison aim to achieve two objectives. Firstly a book plan will be developed, with four draft chapters, concerned with the modelling and analysis of interactive systems. The second goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the IVY toolkit in the modelling of a ubiquitous system. The IVY toolkit is a system developed to support these methods and techniques. It will be used to model and analyse a potential smart environment for scientific experiment at Newcastle.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/F01404X/1","grantId":"EP/F01404X/1","fundValue":"14971","fundStart":"2007-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Michael Douglas  Harrison","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
