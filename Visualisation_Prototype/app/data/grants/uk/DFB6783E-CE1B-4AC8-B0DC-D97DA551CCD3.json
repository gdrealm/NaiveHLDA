{"id":"DFB6783E-CE1B-4AC8-B0DC-D97DA551CCD3","title":"Developing a capability list in the British context: Should attitudinal data on human rights be given a more direct role?","abstractText":"Is there a shared view in Britain about the freedoms and opportunities that are of central value and concern?&nbsp; If so, to what extent - and which population groups disagree? The aim of the research is to examine the role that attitudinal data on human rights can play in the development of a capability list (a list of the freedoms and opportunities that are of central value and concern) in Britain. The research will examine the nature and scope of public support for human rights using nationally representative data from the Citizenship Survey. The extent of public support for a broad definition of human rights (covering economic and social rights, such as the rights to education and health) rather than a narrow definition (focusing on a narrow range of civil and political rights, such as the right to freedom of religion and the right to a fair trial) will be systematically examined. The research findings will inform on-going efforts to develop and apply the capability approach as a basis for multidimensional inequality analysis in 21st century Britain. A supplementary research aim is to influence and inform academic and political debate about the establishment of a British Bill of Rights. \n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F038348/1","grantId":"ES/F038348/1","fundValue":"79984","fundStart":"2008-04-01","fundEnd":"2009-11-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Polly Ann Vizard","coPersons":[],"organisation":"London School of Economics & Pol Sci","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
