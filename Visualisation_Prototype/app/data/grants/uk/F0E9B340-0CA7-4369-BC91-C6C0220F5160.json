{"id":"F0E9B340-0CA7-4369-BC91-C6C0220F5160","title":"Physical Organic Chemistry: Opportunities in Synthesis, Materials and Pharmaceuticals","abstractText":"This application aims to catalyse and sustain a new dimension in UK research capability in physical organic chemistry. Our strategic alliance in physical organic chemistry will provide a unique continuum of expertise to tackle research opportunities in areas as diverse as materials chemistry, synthesis methodologies and pharmaceutical discovery and development. It will have the capability to address issues from solid-state to solution and gas-phase, from small molecules to biopolymers, and from nanoscale to pilot plant. We focus on topics of international significance to industry worldwide as well as to academic chemistry, that will help to (i) drive the creation of 21st-century electronic materials, devices and technologies (ii) understand and exploit methodologies for assisting chemical reactions with the potential to revolutionise energy use in chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries (iii) provide new and more effective medicines through understanding molecular recognition in pharmaceutical systems including drug-receptor, drug-drug and drug-carrier complexes. Its importance is underlined by the initial substantial support from diverse sectors of the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry that we have so far put in place. It will initially lead to 26 new appointments, and we look forward to even more dynamic growth as the program unfolds.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E036244/1","grantId":"EP/E036244/1","fundValue":"2657690","fundStart":"2007-10-31","fundEnd":"2012-10-30","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Advisor : Joint or sponsored appointments or secondments with industry or commerce : One of my research group, Phillip Jolly, undertook a placement in GSK followed by a period back in U Strathclyde to facilitate interchange of our expertise with GSK.
