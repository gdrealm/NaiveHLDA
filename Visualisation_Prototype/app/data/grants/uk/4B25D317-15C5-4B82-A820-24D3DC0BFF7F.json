Both enzymes make a DNA break (known as a 'gate') in one DNA molecule and pass a second DNA helix through the gate. Quinolone drugs kill bacteria by stabilizing the enzyme-opened gate. This project aims to understand how topo IV and gyrase mediate gate opening and closure, and how drugs interfere with these fundamental processes. The study builds on insights gained from our recent X-ray crystal structure that revealed how quinolones act at the topo IV-DNA gate. This structure provides a number of intriguing mechanistic hypotheses to be tested and paves the way for the design and evaluation of new inhibitors with novel modes of action that should minimize the emergence of drug resistance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H00405X/1","grantId":"BB/H00405X/1","fundValue":"620906","fundStart":"2009-09-01","fundEnd":"2012-08-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The eight crystal structures of topo IV-DNA-drug complexes that we deposited in the Protein Data Bank are valuable open resource to the pharmaceutical industry in guiding new drug development. Indeed, the PLoS One publication describing some of these structures has been well cited. Moreover, the work has led to a number of collaborative initiatives with pharmaceutical companies to understand the structural and mechanistic aspects of new drugs they are developing.

Solved the first high-resolution X-ray structures of an antimicrobial quinazolinedione with its DNA-topoisomerase II target (S. pneumoniae topo IV)(PDB entries 3LTN, 3RAF).\nQuinazolinediones are of considerable interest as antibacterial candidates as they circumvent resistance to quinolones. Comparison with X-ray structures determined here for quinolone-DNA complexes of topo IV with levofloxacin (3K9F, 3RAE,) and clinafloxacin (3RAD) explains the mode of drug action and lack of cross-resistance between the drug classes.\n2. First crystal structures of drug-free DNA-topo IV complexes in precleaved (3KSB) and cleaved (3KSA) states, the first for putative reaction intermediates in the topoisomerase II reaction cycle, revealing the role of magnesium ions and DNA conformational changes at the bent DNA gate.\nStructures in 1 and 2 published in Laponogov et al PLoS ONE (2010).\n3. Solved the first full-length 3-gate structure of a bacterial type II topoisomerase-DNA complex which provides new insights on topoisomerase II action. Access to our structures of topo IV-DNA complexes with antibacterial quinolones and diones greatly benefit the pharmaceutical industry in their efforts to understand current antibacterial drugs and to develop new agents with novel modes of action that circumvent quinolone resistance. \n\nThe structural and biochemical work is also of use to enzymologists, biologists and chemists in understanding topoisomerase action.
