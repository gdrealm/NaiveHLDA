Different methodologies exist for their fabrication but enzymatic assembly produces consistently high quality products compared to other methods which is essential for downstream processes for improved characteristics (whether this is for improved strain phenotype or an improved protein function/yield). The potential to achieve this in a high throughput, automatable fashion would be a powerful and valuable tool for commercialisation in the synthetic biology arena. In this respect, we have previously developed a technology that can create random stretches of gene fragments using enzymatic additions of codon triplets. We now wish to investigate further procedures to assemble diversified gene fragments, in particular antibody variable loops, into whole genes in an automated fashion. Imperial College is automating assembly methods that would be enabling for the project by bridging the scale from codons to genes and pathways, thereby potentially the opening up new market areas.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/M00550X/1","grantId":"BB/M00550X/1","fundValue":"103119","fundStart":"2014-07-16","fundEnd":"2015-07-15","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Baldwin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Imperial College London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
