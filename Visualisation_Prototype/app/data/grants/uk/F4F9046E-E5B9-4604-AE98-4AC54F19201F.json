These movements appear subconscious and are closely integrated with the flow of speech in terms of both timing and manner of execution. Recent research suggests that aspects of the underlying message are represented in these gestures and that listeners subconsciously process this information and combine it with information contained in the speech. This suggests that to understand a message fully one needs to extract information from both the speech and the accompanying gestures. </p> \n<p>The new research will determine how important the information is that is represented in gestures and to show that people extract the information contained within gestures not just when the information is presented on video, as in previous research, but when it is presented in face-to-face interaction. We also explore why some gestures are more communicative than others by seeing whether it is those gestures that are most likely to attract listeners’ attention that are the most powerful. To do this we will track listeners’ eye movements. In practical terms, we should be able to improve the effectiveness of various communications by putting key parts of messages into the accompanying imagistic gestures.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006345/1","grantId":"ES/E006345/1","fundValue":"80025","fundStart":"2007-03-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Geoffrey  Beattie","coPersons":["Heather  Shovelton"],"organisation":"The University of Manchester","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
