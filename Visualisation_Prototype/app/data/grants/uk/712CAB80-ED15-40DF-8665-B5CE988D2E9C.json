The investigations that the research programme will pursue will seek to further the understanding of the mechanisms by which cells communicate with one another, and of how this communication influences both the behaviour of individual cells and the manner in which aggregates of cells assemble and function. The results will have implications for a wide range of topics of great current importance, including for stem-cell behaviour and for the generation of gut tissue and of bone.

This is a topic that promises major breakthroughs both for healthcare and in the understanding of cell and tissue function. As such, it raises a host of important integrative systems-biology questions i.e. ones that can be addressed effectively only through cross-disciplinary studies applying\nmathematical modelling approaches able to describe phenomena operating over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in tandem with experimental investigations designed to inform the models and thereby give them genuine predictive capability.\n\nThe research programme comprised four strands.\n\nStrand A focussed on signalling networks operating within an individual cell, whereby a ligand binding to a receptor on the cell membrane can trigger a cascade of responses within the cell, ultimately influencing gene expression and hence potentially the differentiation pathway undertaken by a stem cell, for example. Models have been developed for complete pathways from receptor to gene expression. The upstream components of these models have been subject to detailed parameterisation against experimental data (much of it new); work to characterise the downstream parts is ongoing.\n\nStrand B focussed on stem-cell differentiation and, in particular, how this is influenced by the cell's environment (such as its location within an embryoid body or the amounts of signalling molecules produced by other cells). The models have been formulated at the level both of individual cells and of aggregates of cells; multiscale mathematical methods based on homogenisation theory have been refined in order to transfer information between the distinct scales and the results of the modelling have been applied in providing insight into the complementary experimental programmes, clarifying in particular how exogeneous factors influence the pathways the cells follow and hence the cell type into which they differentiate. The research programme has sought to capture stochastic (random) effects as well as average behaviour described by deterministic models.\n\nStrand C concerned behaviour at the tissue level. The mathematical models necessary for the description of the\nexperimental systems in question were particularly varied, involving cell-based approaches representing the behaviour of large numbers of cells within a pore in a tissue-engineering scaffold, partial differential equations that describe both the spatial and the temporal structure within tissue at the macroscale and ordinary differential equations that average over spatial variations to allow highly complex interactions (such as those involved in the formation of new blood vessels) to be captured within tractable formulations. Moreover, the models were required to describe numerous distinct effects,\nassociated both with mechanical properties (for example in the buckling of a growing sheet of cells) and with the transport of various molecular species (including nutrients and growth factors). The corresponding experimental work involved a wide range of demanding techniques, a noteworthy feature being the application of rapid prototyping approaches in producing arrays of pores, the growth of tissue within which provided a considerable amount of valuable data.\n\nFinally, Strand D involved the development of multiscale mathematical techniques able to combine the processes operating on the widely different scales, with the potential for application in diverse contexts in integrative systems biology. This work featured both generic studies able to characterise gene-regulation mechanisms (Delta-Notch signalling representing a widely studied paradigm) and more specific investigations, as alluded to above.\n\nThe above programme of research was complemented by a broad ranging outreach and training programme, promoting engagement with numerous internationally leading figures within systems biology and facilitating wide dissemination of the results. The methodologies developed are widely applicable in multiscale-systems-biology applications and are naturally of particular relevance to the implementation of such approaches in furthering the understanding of regenerative-medicine approaches.
