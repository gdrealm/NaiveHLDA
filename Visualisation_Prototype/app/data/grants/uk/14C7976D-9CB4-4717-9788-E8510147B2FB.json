Most of the headlines have been made by embryonic stem cells, cells that can be extracted from early embryos, and which possess the versatility of being seemingly able to be coaxed into almost any type of tissue. Less well known are adult stem cells; these are thought to be present in almost all tissues and their continued multiplication throughout life is necessary to maintain tissues like the gut lining and skin where millions of cells are exfoliated every day. We know very little about the identity of such stem cells and thus are not able to extract them, perhaps with the notable exception of blood stem cells which have been used for many decades in life-saving transplants. We are going to use some very novel genetic technology to identify adult stem cells and their progeny in a number of human tissues, principally the large intestine, skin, liver and pancreas. In the large intestine and skin we are seeking to discover if cancers arise from these cells, while in the pancreas if we could locate stem cells, we may be able to expand them outside the body and make them into insulin-producing cells for subsequent transplantation for diabetes. Many people are now suffering from liver failure and cannot be treated because a shortage of livers for transplantation. An alternative strategy is cell transplantation into the failing liver using a healthy donor liver?s own cells called hepatocytes. If we could identify stem cells in the liver, these could be greatly expanded in number outside the body, converted to functional hepatocytes, and transplanted. Thus, our investigation centres on the role of stem cells in human diseases, principally bowel cancer, diabetes and liver failure, diseases that all have a dismal outlook and for which there are still no prospects of cure, despite many years of research.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0901178","grantId":"G0901178","fundValue":"503023","fundStart":"2010-05-17","fundEnd":"2013-05-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm  Alison","coPersons":["Stuart Alistair McDonald"],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
