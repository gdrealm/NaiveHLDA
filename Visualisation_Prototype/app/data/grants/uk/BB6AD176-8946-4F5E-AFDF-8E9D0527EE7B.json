Cells become different from each other by turning on or off distinct sets of genes. This differential gene activation is mediated by cell-cell communication. Potential modulators of cell-cell communication are enzymes called sulfatase and sulfotransferase. These enzymes are tightly controlled during embryonic development and I plan to analyse how these enzymes regulate signalling during embryonic development. I have chosen to undertake my studies using the related frog species, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis because of the many advantages that amphibian embryos hold for the study of embryonic development, such as their large size and that they develop rapidly and outside the mother making the embryos accessible throughout development. Many of the experiments that I propose to do are standard procedures for frog embryologists and are not possible to do in bird embryos and would require long and expensive procedures in mouse embryos. Much of what we know about the earliest signals important during embryonic development has been learned by work in amphibian embryos and this project can be carried out efficiently using this animal model. Moreover, since many of the same genes control development of of all vertebrates, what we learn about frog development is directly applicable to what is happening in humans.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400193","grantId":"G0400193","fundValue":"327775","fundStart":"2005-06-01","fundEnd":"2010-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Betsy  Pownall","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of York","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
