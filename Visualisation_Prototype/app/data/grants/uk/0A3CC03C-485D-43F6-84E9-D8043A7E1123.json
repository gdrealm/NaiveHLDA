Two non-animal models will be used both of which comprise multi-cellular, three-dimensional (3D) tissue constructs fabricated from human cell lines; a novel type of tumour spheroid model developed in our laboratory and a commercial 3D human skin construct Successful development of the methodology will present an alternative to both in vivo and ex vivo testing using animal models to represent human tumours and skin. The developed methodology will also be applicable to animal tissue where the ability to image and quantify multiple non-labelled proteins has the potential to reduce the number of animals used in many procedures, in comparison to conventional techniques employing immunohistochemistry, and immunoflouresence.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=NC/L001896/1","grantId":"NC/L001896/1","fundValue":"242370","fundStart":"2014-08-01","fundEnd":"2016-07-31","funder":"NC3Rs","impactText":"","person":"Malcolm Ronald Clench","coPersons":["Neil  Cross","David Paul Smith"],"organisation":"Sheffield Hallam University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
