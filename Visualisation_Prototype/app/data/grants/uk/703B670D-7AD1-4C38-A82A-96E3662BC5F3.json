However, although important, there is very little information about the structure, composition and phase behaviour of these molecularly thin layers because they are sandwiched between two bulk phases and are inaccessible to experiment. This lack of data has also led to very poor predictive capabilities in industrial contexts. The use of adsorbed mixtures is presently based on trial and error and poorly optimised. Our group has extensive experience using a wide variety of novel techniques to characterise these adsorbed layers. However, some systems cannot be studied with our existing battery of techniques and new approaches are required. In this short project we aim to develop expertise in using STM (Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy) to study the structures of monolayers adsorbed from liquids to solid surfaces, in our group in Cambridge. This experimental approach will enable us to extend our investigations, particularly to the study of adsorbed mixtures which show much enhanced properties over pure materials which will advance the understanding of a wide range of important phenomena from detergency and lubrication to oil recovery and colloidal stability. The total cost of this preliminary project is less than 15k.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E001211/1","grantId":"EP/E001211/1","fundValue":"9777","fundStart":"2007-03-20","fundEnd":"2008-03-19","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  These findings have been used to develop experimental methods for further study of non-covalent interactions in physisorbed monolayers.\nThis has led to industrially sponsored grants to exploit these in commercial situations.. work presently underway.\nThe work also has led to us moving to new non-covalent interactions (Halogen bonds) and we are presently crafting a new EPSRC proposal to furrther develop these interactions towards applications.

The molecules self-assemble into interesting shapes and patterns simply by dipping a surface in the liquid for them to sit on.\nUsing this approach one can 'build' devices for a range of jobs... such as sensors, SERS substrates, nanocatalysts etc. The work has led to further industrial support to use these methods/systems to try and develop commercial systems.
