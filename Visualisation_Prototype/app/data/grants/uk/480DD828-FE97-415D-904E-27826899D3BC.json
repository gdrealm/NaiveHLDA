{"id":"480DD828-FE97-415D-904E-27826899D3BC","title":"Performance in the Recording Studio","abstractText":"This is a proposal to establish an AHRC funded research network to develop a new methodology for studying Musical Performance in the Recording Studio but which would also be applicable to a variety of other forms of creative practice in the digital age. The network would extend over a period of nine months from the start of Oct. 2012 to the end of June 2013. This project will contribute towards the AHRC Digital Transformation theme in two quite distinct ways. Firstly it will investigate the way in which the digital revolution in recording and music production technology has affected musical performance in the studio. Techniques such as cut and paste editing, digital effects and signal processing, auto-tune and audio time correction have prompted and challenged performers to adapt their creative practice and work with record producers in the same way that actors have adapted to working in the cinema: working non-linearly and for an hypothetical audience.\nIn the second instance the entire methodology for the project has developed out of these digital transformations and the potential of the 'infinite archive'. The basic premise is to use a variety of digital media to capture multiple facets of a staged example of recording and performance practice in the studio. This will take the form of a recording session involving a record producer, sound engineer and a jazz quartet. Alongside several cameras filming the process from a variety of angles (and in the different rooms), there will also be a screen capture from the recording and editing software, equipment lists of the hardware effects, processors, microphones and mixing console, archive back ups of the session at various points and archived files of all the recorded takes as well as the ones used in the final mix. This will be accompanied by interviews with the participants, analyses by various network members, responses to the analyses by the participants and discussions between the academics and the practitioners. This, along with the analyses, discussions and comments from two other network events are then made available online and this material becomes the basis for another recursion of interpretation, analysis and discussion. This unique archive of both the raw data from the study and analyses and discussion from a wide range of perspectives and approaches will be maintained online by the Association for the Study of the Art of Record Production and further contributions, beyond the life of the network, will be invited and moderated.\nThe network will start in Oct. 2012 in time for the first event in Nov. 2012 which will be a weekend of presentations and discussions about theoretical approaches, methodological implications and planning for the staged recording. The recording itself will take place in Dec. 2012. In Feb. 2013 there will be a weekend symposium of analyses and discussion stemming from the recording and the interviews with the participants. In Mar. 2013 the material will be put online and contributions invited. This will build towards an online conference in Apr. 2013 that will open up the material to the wider academic and professional community for further scrutiny, analysis and discussion. This will be followed by the final weekend event in May 2013 which will discuss the merits and problems of the methodology and its potential for future applications.\nThe network membership will include:\n 8 core members covering recording, production, performance, psychology and anthropology\n 2 early career researchers / PhD students working in related fields\n Guest members whose specialism relates to facets of each specific event\n Limited access (around 15 people) for academics and practitioners interested in attending.\nThe aim is for this to be part of a larger, more extended project that stages several recording sessions involving different styles of music and different approaches to recording practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/K000195/1","grantId":"AH/K000195/1","fundValue":"35561","fundStart":"2012-10-01","fundEnd":"2013-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"  Development of workshops on performance in the studio that have and will continue to affect performance pedagogy in conservatoires and universities.
