In the UK, heart disease kills 175,000 people every year and 2.6 million people live with debilitating heart conditions. More than 50% of deaths from heart diseases result from cardiac arrhythmias at a total annual national cost of treatment of #~1.6 billion. \n\nThe main rationale and motivation of our research is to improve treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders. Current therapies are highly unsatisfactory. Our experiments test a new direction in potential treatment strategies. We have discovered that an enzyme called P21-activated kinase1 (Pak1) is able to chemically modify the elements in heart cells responsible for the rate and rhythm of the heart beat. Our project will take these findings to the next essential level, i.e. understanding the function of Pak1 in intact beating hearts. Our approaches involving enhancing or disabling the function of Pak1 and determining the outcome of these modification on the generation of altered heart rythm mimicking electrical disorders in the human heart. This project is pivotal for understanding of regulatory mechanisms for cardiac electrical and contractile functions and will provide information essential to the development of new treatments for cardiac rhythm disorders.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G1002647","grantId":"G1002647","fundValue":"743886","fundStart":"2012-02-01","fundEnd":"2015-07-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Ming  Lei","coPersons":["Xin  Wang"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
