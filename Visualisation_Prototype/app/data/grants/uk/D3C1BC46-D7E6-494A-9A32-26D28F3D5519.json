Dr Theodoulidis has very good research records on analytical eddy current models and notable publication. Currently, there are gaps between theoretical and experimental eddy current NDT (ECT). For examples, analytical models of ECT concentrate on computation on coil impedance variation vs defects; in contrast, most experimental study of ECT investigates the magnetic field distribution vs defects. Many inverse models are investigated by experiments or numerical models, which is very costly. The proposed Visiting Fellowship is to enable Dr Theodoulidis (University of West Macedonia) to work in the Systems Engineering Research Group led by Professor Tian at Huddersfield. We propose to integrate the Truncated Region Eigenfunction Expansion (TREE) techniques into a wide range of our existing numerical electromagnetic simulation experimental studies on pulsed eddy current, micro magnetic sensor array, stress mapping and applications on stirring friction welds and detection of fatigue cracks in complex, multilayered structure.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/E010458/1","grantId":"EP/E010458/1","fundValue":"90762","fundStart":"2007-04-27","fundEnd":"2010-10-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Gui Yun  Tian","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Newcastle University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
