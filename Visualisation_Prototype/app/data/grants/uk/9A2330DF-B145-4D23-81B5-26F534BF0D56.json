This policy, along with increased recruitment of students from abroad, has already seen a student numbers rise by up to 50 per cent&nbsp;in 10 years in many places. This research proposes to study the impacts of this growth on local and regional economies and 'host' communities, focussing on cities that need revitalisation.<br /></p> \n<p>Although student populations are typically transient, this may be their key significance. They are different from the 'host' population (younger, no dependants, disproportionately more middle class, better qualified), and these characteristics barely change as each cohort is replaced by another. This research seeks to understand the impacts that students can have as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Workers in local businesses</li> \n <li>Residents providing a catalyst for neighbourhood change and revitalisation</li> \n <li>Consumers creating a demand for diverse new services</li> \n <li>Contributors to a new image for cities, with more creative 'buzz' and cultural diversity that helps to attract investors, visitors and mobile workers.<br /></li>\n</ul> \n<p>The findings will contribute to resolving important policy issues, helping public agencies and Universities to capture the potential benefits (and minimise any disbenefits) of large student populations.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017967/1","grantId":"ES/E017967/1","fundValue":"177132","fundStart":"2007-08-01","fundEnd":"2009-05-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Moira  Munro","coPersons":["Ivan  Turok"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
