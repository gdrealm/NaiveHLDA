V. cholerae swims through liquids by rotating a long corkscrew-like propeller, called a flagellum, which is an important factor in the ability of the bacterium to colonise the human host and cause disease. The flagellum is positioned at one end, or pole, of the cell, as is the machinery that exports the major virulence factor cholera toxin. To ensure that each V. cholerae cell has a single flagellum at one pole, the cell must carefully regulate when and where this structure is built. We have addressed two questions: How is the flagellum specifically targeted to one cell pole? How is the number of flagella per cell regulated? \n\nWe have found that one protein, called FlhF, has a central role in positioning the flagellum at one cell pole. When cells do not have FlhF, their ability to build flagella is greatly reduced, and any flagella that are constructed are in the wrong position on the cell surface. We have shown that FlhF itself is targeted to one cell pole, even in the absence of all other flagellar proteins, and we have identified the specific region of FlhF that is required for its polar targeting. For FlhF to function properly, we have shown that it must first bind to a small molecule called GTP. Finally, we have shown that FlhF establishes polar localization of the flagellum by recruiting the first flagellar building block to a single cell pole.\n\nA second protein, called FlhG, regulates the number of flagella that are built per cell. We found that cells which do not produce FlhG build too many flagella (8-10 per cell), and cells that produce too much FlhG do not build any flagella. FlhG was found to bind to a regulatory protein, called FlrA, which binds to DNA and switches on the genes required for flagella biogenesis. We found that FlhG could stop FlrA switching on flagella genes, and to do this FlhG also needed to bind a small molecule called ATP. Our data indicate that FlhG regulates flagellar number by controlling the activity of the FlrA regulator. These findings might be taken forward by scientists working in the field of bacterial flagellum biogenesis. This might include future studies to identify new antibacterial drugs that might target flagella biogenesis and function. Other","dataset":"gtr"}
