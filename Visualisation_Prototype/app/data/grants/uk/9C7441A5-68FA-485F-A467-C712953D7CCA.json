Much of this deafness is hereditary. Our research aims to achieve better diagnosis and amelioration of deafness including that due to hereditary causes. We use genetically altered mice as a model of human hereditary deafness and, using a range of innovative techniques we have developed, we are able to take acoustic, mechanical and electrophysiological readings from inside the ear as it functions. The focus of our interest is the cochlea - a coiled, fluid-filled organ that converts sound into electrical signals. The cochlea is divided along its length by a strip called the basilar membrane which is vibrated by sound. Different frequencies of sound cause different regions of the membrane to vibrate to their maximum. The vibrations are detected by hair cells located in the organ of Corti - a strip of sensory epithelium sandwiched between the basilar membrane and another ribbon-like structure called the tectorial membrane. Recent findings from our and other laboratories reveal that major elements of the cochlea respond to sound stimulation in novel ways that challenge classical concepts of how these elements interact to produce the remarkable sensitivity and frequency tuning of the cochlea?s responses to sounds. It is the nature of this interaction that we want to explore. In particular we want to find out how the tectorial and basilar membranes interact to conduct mechanical energy along their lengths and then transfer it to the sensitive cells of the organ of Corti. The mechanical energy comes both from incoming sound and from amplified feedback from the organ of Corti. In the organ of Corti outer hair cells transform mechanical energy into electrical energy, and then back into mechanical energy, which amplifies the basilar membrane?s response to weak sounds. We want to find out how the tectorial and basilar membranes interact to distribute energy to different frequency regions in the cochlea. This knowledge will help us to understand the normal workings of the cochlea and how energy due to cochlear amplification can be measured in the outer ear, which is of vital importance in diagnosing hearing problems. This understanding will enable us to optimise a novel hearing prosthesis for implantation in the middle ear of patients with severe middle ear impairment.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0801693","grantId":"G0801693","fundValue":"3260680","fundStart":"2009-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-08-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Andrei N Lukashkin","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Brighton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
