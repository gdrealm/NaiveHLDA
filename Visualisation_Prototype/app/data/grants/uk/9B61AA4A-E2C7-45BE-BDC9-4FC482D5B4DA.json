Because the weapons themselves are banned under the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the main focus of biosecurity policy is controlling the development, diffusion and misapplication of technology. However, the rapid pace of change in science has made the existing methods of monitoring and regulating S&amp;T more difficult. This research project intends to address the effectiveness of current governance measures for 'taking into account' advances in S&amp;T and how these measures might be improved. The project will do this by exploring specifically the development and role of S&amp;T Reports that are submitted by states parties to the Biological Weapons Convention at the Review Conferences held every five years. The methodology will involves using in-depth interviews to gather data on the role and processes involved in generating these reviews and national differences will be taken into account through an international comparison of five countries. Currently tabled options to improve the reviewing system will be assessed to explore what is politically and/or technically ‘realistic’ via a questionnaire and the results disseminated through a series of workshops and briefing papers.\n<br />\n<br />&nbsp;\n<br />\n<br />","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F037481/1","grantId":"ES/F037481/1","fundValue":"308661","fundStart":"2008-05-01","fundEnd":"2012-04-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Caitriona  McLeish","coPersons":["Paul  Nightingale"],"organisation":"University of Sussex","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
