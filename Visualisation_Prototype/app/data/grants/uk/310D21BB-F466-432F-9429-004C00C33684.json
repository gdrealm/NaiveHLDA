These occur as a result of mutations in members of a family of proteins called the serine protease inhibitors or serpins. Mutations in these proteins cause them to change size and shape with either aberrant tissue deposition or loss of function. The serpinopathies encompass a wide spectrum of disease that is as diverse as cirrhosis, thrombosis, angioedema, emphysema and more recently dementia. We now propose to define the mechanisms by which mutations in members of the serpin superfamily cause the serpinopathies. In particular, we will use protein, cell and fly models to define how the abnormal proteins form, how they are handled by cells and how they cause cell death. In addition we will develop antibodies to neuroserpin so that we can detect the abnormal protein in animal and human tissues. Finally, we will define how the body clears these abnormal conformations of protein from the circulation and how they can excite white cells to cause inflammation and further tissue damage. Taken together, this programme of work will provide new insights into many different conditions. It is the long-term aim of our laboratory to develop strategies to treat the wide range of diseases that comprise the serpinopathies.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0500306","grantId":"G0500306","fundValue":"1246540","fundStart":"2006-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"David Arthur Lomas","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
