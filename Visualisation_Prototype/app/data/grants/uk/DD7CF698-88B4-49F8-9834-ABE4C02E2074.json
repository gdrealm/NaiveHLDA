{"id":"DD7CF698-88B4-49F8-9834-ABE4C02E2074","title":"Common development of pixel tiles for the LHC upgrades","abstractText":"The world's largest scientific apparatus the 27 km long LHC is performing investigations into the fundamental building blocks of nature. For the second phase of the LHC improved detectors are needed that can cope with an increased number of particle collisions. The highest precision elements of the detectors that measure these collisions are known as pixel detectors. The UK has been at the forefront of vertex detector technology for over 20 years, and this proposal aims to retain this UK lead. This project aims to construct a small element of a pixel detector that will demonstrate the feasibility of making larger detectors for the LHC upgrade. This element, or pixel tile, can then be connected with others to produce the detector required for any of the new experiments at the LHC. The project is particularly aimed at two of these detectors, ATLAS - the largest detector at the LHC, searching for the direct production of new particles and LHCb - the LHC experiment studying anti-matter and rare processes to find physics effects from beyond the known standard model of particle physics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/K000195/1","grantId":"ST/K000195/1","fundValue":"139898","fundStart":"2012-03-01","fundEnd":"2015-02-28","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Themistocles  Bowcock","coPersons":["Gianluigi  Casse","Philip Patrick Allport"],"organisation":"University of Liverpool","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
