{"id":"B40AB539-EA86-4409-A621-0CC8A99837B5","title":"CRESST II -- Dark Matter Search (Exploitation Phase)","abstractText":"CRESST uses cryogenic detectors to search for galactic dark matter via their elastic scattering by nuclei in an absorber. The amount of energy deposited by WIMP (weakly interacting massive particles) is small, typically in the region of a few 10keV at most. The interactions are rare and therefore the experiment must be properly shielded from any backgrounds; hence its location in an underground laboratory. WIMP interaction is detected via a recoiling nucleus within the target, whereas radioactive backgrounds mainly interact with the electrons of the target atoms. The amount of scintillation light for nuclear recoil is considerably less compared with electron recoil, therefore providing a powerful tool to distinguish between the two types of events. CRESST II will be operating up to 33 detector modules, each with a target mass of 300g of calcium tungstate scintillator. After a total measurement time of three years, a sensitivity for WIMP-nucleon scattering in the 10^-8 picobarn range should be achieved. Once a dark matter signal is suspected, varying the target material, i.e. using for example zinc tungstate to replace a good number of calcium tungstate targets should be used to confirm a signal. The UK has made a substantial investment into the hardware of CRESST II and is now aiming to lead the data analysis.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D00005X/1","grantId":"PP/D00005X/1","fundValue":"231063","fundStart":"2005-08-03","fundEnd":"2009-02-02","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Hans  Kraus","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
