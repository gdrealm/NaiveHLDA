In this project, however, the aim is not to focus on what the landscape means but to examine the phenomenon of landscape itself. Specifically, it attempts to understand how landscapes come to exist, i.e., how particular environments come to 'stand out' and be recognised as visibly distinct places. The Giza plateau in Egypt - the site of the three largest pyramids and the Sphinx - is a useful example. While the monumental architecture and colossal masonry of the Giza pyramids seems to represent timelessness and utter self-present stability, the monuments have been robbed, defaced, dismantled and, most commonly, ignored over the last five thousand years. The multi-million dollar effort keeping the pyramids present today is a recent phenomenon. This aim of this project is to explore how and why Egyptians are invested in the Giza landscape as well as how those diverse investments secure the landscape's ongoing existence. Building on the phenomenological tradition of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and, more recently, Ingold, this project explores how the Giza landscape, as a sensory, tactile and physical presence, provides resources for Egyptians to imagine 'who they are' as well as how those diverse imaginations work back to cultivate the landscape's ongoing existence as a place. In this sense, it aims to describe how Egyptian identity takes shape 'in-the-world', that is, how Egyptians come to a sense of self in and through the landscape and how the landscape's presence is secured through that process.\\n\\nThere are two significant implications for this research. First, it highlights the significance of locality and community for questions of culture and cultural identity. If identity is fundamentally predicated upon everyday encounters with local environments, than the erosion of such environments will have significant consequences for the communities that surround them. From this perspective it becomes increasingly clear why local cultures feel vulnerable to global production systems, cultural imperialism and free-market consumerism, as well as why such global processes engender anxious and, sometimes, violent responses. The second contribution is that it deepens our understanding of the modern Middle East. The question of Egyptian identity encompasses a surprising range of issues: Egypt's relationship with modernity; civil society and the state; democracy and corporatism, etc. While questions of landscape may seem peripheral to these concerns, the Giza landscape engenders a multitude of associations that imbricate questions of identity with social and political issues. \\n\\n","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/D000491/1","grantId":"AH/D000491/1","fundValue":"26225","fundStart":"2007-01-29","fundEnd":"2007-05-28","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Mitchell  Rose","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Hull","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
