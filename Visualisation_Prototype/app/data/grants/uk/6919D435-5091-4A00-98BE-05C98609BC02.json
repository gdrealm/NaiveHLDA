The term is generally understood to refer to gas-bearing technology, in particular, foil-air bearings. Such bearings support the shaft by means of an air cushion bounded by a flexible foil structure. The introduction of the foil structure resolves the problems associated with the very tight radial clearance required by a plain air bearing. With a foil-air bearing, while the shaft is stationary, there is either a slight clearance or a preload between shaft and bearing. As the shaft turns, a pressure is generated, which pushes the foil boundary away, allowing the shaft to become completely airborne. A solid lubricant coating on the shaft and/or top foil allows for the brief rubbing interval during start-up and shutdown. Recent technological breakthroughs in the USA in solid lubricant technology will enable the widespread use of such bearings in turbomachinery, particularly gas turbine machinery. This has resulted in intensive research in oil-free turbomachinery motivated by its technological and environmental benefits for both military and civil applications (e.g. turbochargers that run up to 180,000rpm and engines for small aircraft). As stated by NASA, the foremost challenge for this technology is the design of an oil-free turbine engine to power 21st century aircraft .Foil-air bearings, like conventional oil bearings, are nonlinear elements that are capable of introducing undesirable nonlinear effects into the dynamic response of the system. These effects may involve sudden jumps in the vibration amplitude, non-synchronous vibration and self-excited vibration. These effects exacerbate vibration and introduce fatigue. Hence, to guarantee structural integrity, the deployment of these bearings in practical machinery necessitates rotordynamic analysis that takes account of the bearing nonlinearity. The ability to make reliable quantitative predictions of such effects enables the engineer to account for/mitigate them in the design. Moreover, such analysis provides the basis of a much-needed knowledge database for in-service monitoring. However, such calculations are hampered by the prohibitive computational cost introduced by the complexity of the bearing model. Consequently, dynamic analysis has so far been restricted to a highly simplified rotordynamic system. The proposed project researches novel methods that enable the efficient nonlinear dynamic analysis of practical oil-free turbomachinery. These methods will be experimentally validated in a study that provides a much-needed insight into the nonlinear dynamics of such systems. The deliverables of this project will be:i. A suite of computer software algorithms for efficient nonlinear dynamic analysis based on three novel approaches (Galerkin reduction, Harmonic Balance, System Identification). ii. An original-design test-rig for experimental validation of the computational methods.iii. A report on the validation of the methods, focussing on both computational and experimental issues.The proposed research is novel since: (a) It will give the UK a foothold in oil-free turbomachinery technology, raising the UK's scientific profile - such research has to date been confined mainly to the US; (b) It will research the prediction of the nonlinear dynamics of practical oil-free turbomachinery (e.g. an oil-free turbocharger); (c) It will do so through the three novel approaches mentioned above; (d) It will produce an original-design test-rig for the validation of the methods developed and investigation of nonlinear phenomena.The work will be carried out by a post-doctoral researcher over a period of three years.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I029184/1","grantId":"EP/I029184/1","fundValue":"289661","fundStart":"2011-07-18","fundEnd":"2014-07-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  Please refer to pathways to impact statement under RCUK Key Findings.

Such bearings support the shaft by means of a cushion of gas (typically air) bounded by a flexible foil structure. OFT research is motivated by technological and environmental benefits for diverse applications. FABs, like oil bearings, can introduce undesirable nonlinear effects into the machinery dynamics, exacerbating vibration. These effects may involve sudden jumps in the vibration amplitude, non-synchronous vibration and self-excited vibration. These effects exacerbate vibration and introduce fatigue. Hence, to guarantee structural integrity, the deployment of these bearings in practical machinery necessitates rotordynamic analysis that takes account of the bearing nonlinearity. The ability to make reliable quantitative predictions of such effects enables the engineer to account for/mitigate them in the design. However, such calculations are hampered by the prohibitive computational cost introduced by the complexity of the bearing model which is governed by the dynamic interaction of the air film, foil structure, and the machine. Prior to this project, due to the computational burden involved, analysis capability was severely restricted since it was subject to simplifications to various aspects of the problem e.g. an approximate approach was followed wherein the air film, foil structure and machine equations were not solved simultaneously (as they should), and only simple rigid rotors were assumed. The project EP/I029184/1 has overcome such limitations, producing highly efficient and accurate algorithms for the simultaneous solution approach applicable to realistic machine structures. These algorithms are based on four novel approaches:\n• Symbolic computing\n• Galerkin reduction\n• Harmonic Balance\n• System Identification \nApart from passing computational tests, good correlation has also been achieved with experimental results in the literature. The project has also delivered original-design test facility that is currently being used for the ongoing experimental validation of the theoretical methods and will be an invaluable platform for consolidation of the research. This project significantly advances oil-free technology on an international level by facilitating the safe application of foil-air bearings to a wide range of turbomachinery. \nKnowledge and People\nThe outcomes of this research gives the UK a foothold in this beneficial emerging technology, raising the UK's world research standing. They form the basis of a specialist research group enabling mutually beneficial collaborations with both international academia and industry. The research outputs have already attracted the attention of US and European specialists, particularly as a result of participation in the ASME Turbo Expo conferences in San Antonio 2013, Dusseldorf 2014 and the forthcoming one in Montreal 2015. The PI has been asked to chair the session on gas bearings at the latter conference and examine an international PhD in the same area. Potential collaboration with international institutions is currently being discussed.\nEconomy and Industry\nThe expertise developed will be essential for post-project technology transfer, which will benefit UK turbomachinery manufacturers in their quest to design greener and more economical machinery products. In the longer term, their UK-based client companies, who supply components, would also benefit if they branch into the supply (and possibly design and manufacture) of foil-air bearings. It is noted that foil bearing design and manufacture is currently almost exclusive to the US companies (e.g. Mechanical Solutions Inc, Mowhawk Innovative Technologies Inc). The outcomes significantly contribute towards the ongoing process of making such technology more affordable for civilian applications.\nThe outcomes will be taken forward with a view to the above and will focus on: (i) adapting the algorithms to more realistic foil structure models (this area was outside the scope of the completed research); (ii) widening the scope of the project to include manufacturing and materials issues (involving the School of Materials); (iii) innovating on the foil design (this latter aspect is the subject of a current EPSRC Design the Future submission).
