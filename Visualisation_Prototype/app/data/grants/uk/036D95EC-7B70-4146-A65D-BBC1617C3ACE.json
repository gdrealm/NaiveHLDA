{"id":"036D95EC-7B70-4146-A65D-BBC1617C3ACE","title":"Communism and Colonialism: African Ambiguities","abstractText":"The formation of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919 launched a period in which socialism was promoted as a developmental path that could be exported and implemented in a broad range of societies through a scientific model. But this model was refracted through a variety of social conditions and individual perceptions, inevitably producing different reactions and outcomes.\\n\\nUsing an approach that is comparative, historical and transnational, Communism and Colonialism: African Ambiguities investigates the development of Communism in the African settler societies of Algeria and South Africa, countries that shared striking similarities due to the manner of their colonization. Over the decades, the two Communist Parties developed very different relationships with their respective anti-colonial and national liberation movements. Drawing upon previously unused archival material, this book will illuminate the historical reasons for this and explore the implications of these divergent paths. It will evaluate how the different relationships that each Communist Party had with the Comintern impacted local Communist thinking and behaviour and how local Communist activists engaged with popular struggles. The two cases illustrate how the environments in which local Communists worked shaped their perceptions and interpretations of Communist ideology.\\n\\nUnlike studies viewing the relationship between the Comintern and its national sections through a centre-periphery model premised primarily on a notion of power as domination, this book argues that this relationship was complex and multifaceted. The varied history of international Communism, as a system of beliefs, ideas and practices, can be understood in terms of a matrix of factors that include political-economic and cognitive variables. The eleven chapters, which comprise both comparative and case studies, address a range of themes that illustrate the salience of perception and misperception, and of identity, loyalty and consciousness in shaping Communist thinking, behaviour and international relations. The structure of the book is both thematic and chronological, as indicated in the chapter outline below.\\n\\n1.
