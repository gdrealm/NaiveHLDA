Of particular interest are patterns of brain activity associated with resolving conflicts in linguistic information arising from different levels of linguistic representation. For example, readers find the following odd &quot;Yesterday the soldier left London after reminding herself about the letter&quot;. This is because of the conflict between the female gender of the pronoun (&quot;herself&quot;) and the stereotypical male gender of the person it refers to grammatically (&quot;the soldier&quot;) (ie, conflict between stereotypical beliefs and grammatical structure). Eye movement patterns show that readers recognise the conflict immediately when they encounter the pronoun. However, such clashes do not always lead to the same disruption in reading. For example readers do not encounter problems when the pronoun and noun appear in the opposite order (eg, &quot;After reminding herself about the letter, the soldier immediately left London&quot;) even though the clash is just as disruptive when the stereotypical male noun &quot;soldier&quot; is replaced with a definitional male noun like &quot;king&quot;. The project will investigate the pattern of brain electrical activity when readers encounter such clashes contrasting stereotypical with definitional gendered materials.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E006965/1","grantId":"ES/E006965/1","fundValue":"81009","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2007-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"S  Garrod","coPersons":["Hamutal  Kreiner","Klaus  Kessler"],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
