{"id":"CF9A1117-D522-4EF6-851A-10D5D0E0A1D3","title":"PATT linked grant","abstractText":"Astronomy is an international science, and telescopes have to be sited in remote locations, away from interference from artificial light. Observing time on these telescopes is heavily oversubscribed, so successful applications for time have already demonstrated a high standard of scientific merit. Once telescope time has been awarded, astronomers often have to travel to these remote locations in order to acquire their observations, and PATT provides basic funding for this purpose.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/H004750/1","grantId":"ST/H004750/1","fundValue":"13294","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian Donald Howarth","coPersons":["Michael J.
