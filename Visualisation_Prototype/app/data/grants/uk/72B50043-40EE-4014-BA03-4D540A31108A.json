{"id":"72B50043-40EE-4014-BA03-4D540A31108A","title":"Lives Sentenced: The Punishment Careers of Persistent Offenders","abstractText":"<p>There has been little research examining how those who are punished by the criminal justice system give meaning to their sentences. For many offenders, criminal punishments are not experienced in isolation, but rather are given meaning in the context of wider lives and previous penal experiences. This is especially the case for persistent offenders, who generally have long punishment careers.</p>\n\n<p>This research explores how they interpret the accumulation of sentences in their lives. Around 35 men and women in Scotland who have been repeatedly sentenced over at least 15 years will be interviewed, using life history methods. If they agree, a year later they will be interviewed again to see how their interpretations and views have changed over this time. This is intended both to examine how views are influenced by being incarcerated, and by other turning points in people's lives (eg finding employment, becoming a parent). The second stage of the research is expected to result in around 15 interviews, for a total of around 50 interviews.&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/K009389/1","grantId":"ES/K009389/1","fundValue":"117545","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2017-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Marguerite Lucile Schinkel","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Glasgow","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
