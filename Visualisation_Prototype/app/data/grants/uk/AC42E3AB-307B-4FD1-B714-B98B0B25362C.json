In particular, the use of a photocatalyst-coated nmr tube has helped speed up the assessment time and enabled rapid reaction screening.

The rapid screening process developed in our project is likely to transform screening procedures for photocatalysed organic synthetic reactions as well as mechanistic studies of such.
