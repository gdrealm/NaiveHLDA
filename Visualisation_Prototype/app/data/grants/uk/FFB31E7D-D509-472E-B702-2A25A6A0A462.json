Scientists from two U.S. universities (with expertise in non-linear rheology, polymer processing and anionic synthesis) will join forces with scientists from seven English universites and one from Holland to attack this problem. The research effort will capitalize on the Leeds-based Microscale Polymer Processing (MuPP) consortium with main contributions from Leeds (molecular rheology, reaction kinetics), Durham (anionic chemistry). The group at Imperial College, London is joining this co-operative programme with expertise in polymerization catalyst development for tailored molecular structure. The approach is to use model systems to establish a rheological standard by which to identify the structures present in commercially produced PE's and then develop correlations between polymerization kinetics, molecular architecture and processing performance.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/D06631X/1","grantId":"EP/D06631X/1","fundValue":"69609","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Daniel Jon Read","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Leeds","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
