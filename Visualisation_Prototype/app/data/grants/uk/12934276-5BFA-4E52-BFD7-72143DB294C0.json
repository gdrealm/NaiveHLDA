The trends towards sedentary living have their origins in changes at community and societal levels indicative of shifting cultural norms. A ?natural experiment? afforded by a major urban regeneration Big Lottery Award will be used to study the impact of environmental change and the creation of an urban ?Greenway? in East Belfast, on physical activity levels and the social capital for further public health gain . A multi-disciplinary research team will first engage with the local community to shape the detailed research plans and devise appropriate social marketing material for the Greenway. Members of the local community and East Belfast Partnership will join the researchers in monitoring the project over its five years and in preparing final evaluation reports. The engagement of the research team from the UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health (NI) with key stakeholders and decision makers will enhance the translation of findings into more informed policy and practice.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0802045","grantId":"G0802045","fundValue":"1085830","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2018-02-28","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Frank  Kee","coPersons":["Lindsay  Prior","Margaret E Cupples","Michael  Donnelly","Michael Robert Stevenson","Helen Sarah McAneney","Mark  Tully","Geraint  Ellis","WILLIAM GEORGE HUTCHINSON"],"organisation":"Queen's University of Belfast","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
