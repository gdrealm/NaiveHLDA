First, through the involvement of a paediatrician in our research team and our links with healthcare researchers and practitioners it is leading to people involved in the treatment of disabled young people to think more broadly about the consequences of practices such as repeated surgery and long term and intensive physiotherapy. We have presented the work to healthcare researchers and practitioners in multiple venues in order to generate debate about medical practice. We are also now involved in the development of research projects bringing together medical practitioners, researchers and social scientists to consider more fully the quality of life and social participation of young disabled people across Europe and the relationship between medical care and social inclusion. Our work is being drawn upon in these areas due both to the findings we have produced and the recognition of the value of the qualitative methodologies we have developed for working with disabled young people. \nSecond, educationalists in the UK and overseas (for example New Zealand) are making use of the virtual material we have produced (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/thebodymatters/, also available via the ESRC's Social Sciences for Schools web resource) to share the key ideas and understandings produced by the disabled young people in our project. This material is being used to spark debates in class rooms and other arenas about why having a body that is different from certain norms about appearance and function can matter to someone's social position in society. While the project looked at disability, this material can also be used to consider other types of body difference such as skin colour, body size and the ageing body. We are also continuing to pursue this work in partnership with disabled young people and other socially marginalised young people to consider questions of citizenship (for example we are drawing several youth groups together to debate citizenship as part of the ESRC Social Science Festival). \nThird, we were surprised in the project to realise that sport was very important to many of the disabled young people we worked with. Many were heavily involved in sport, both as part of their ongoing activities to keep their bodies mobile and also as a venue for displaying a positive version of an impaired body. This has led us to begin to develop links with people involved in disability sport and explore in public venues the significance of sport as an aspect of social participation to disabled young people (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/peals/influencing/exchange/disabilityandsport.htm). \nFinally, we developed multiple approaches to carrying out the fieldwork with our research participants, in particular drawing on creative practice as a way to explore embodiment and to (possibly) create different power dynamics between participants and researchers. We have now been asked to speak on those approaches in multiple venues, enabling us to participate in wider debates about how to involve disabled young people in research. We are pursuing this further in current research bids and discussions with disabled young people, in particular those with significant disabilities including around communication, who are often excluded from research due to the complexity of working with them.

Those social dynamics are constituted through both body narratives and practices and are open to challenge via the way impairment can be enacted - through doing things in different and creative ways - and framed - through being seen as an important part of someone's identity - as something valued. \n\nImperatives to Fix\nThe participants in their previous and contemporary interviews spoke of the body as one that was involved in ongoing interventions; there was continuity in how medical interventions that occurred in childhood - such as surgeries and physiotherapy - continued into adolescence. However, in adolescence the young people had more say in what medical interventions occurred and also developed their own everyday interventions, which used activities such as walking, or doing things for themselves, as opportunities to maintain body strength and mobility. The focus on interventions across their life course maintained a sense of their bodies as unfinished and likely to require new and further interventions as the ageing process continued to affect the work that needed to be done. In this way impairment was both permanent - always there - and changing - always altering due to factors such as the body ageing or growing. \n\nTransitions\nThe body work the young people did and showed us was also influenced by their thoughts about the future. They spoke about and used imagery they produced to highlight their desire to be independent, to live on their own, to be like their friends and live 'ordinary', normal lives. Work they did to keep mobile, strong, fit, looking normal, was influenced by thinking about the work they had to do to become full adult citizens. The way such transitions were articulated was one aspect of their disabled embodiment that was gendered. For example, the ways in which body strength was worked at, and articulated, and the importance given to being self-reliant in order to have a family, were discussed differently by the young men and women. \n\nPain \nParticipants made distinctions between 'everyday pain' and pain they linked to their physical impairments. They saw everyday pain - for example, getting tired from walking too far - as something that was part of life and they took pride in their ability to work through such pain. Pain they associated with impairment was something they had to manage that others did not. The pain of everyday life they worked through to show their similarity to others; the pain of impairment was something they framed as a barrier to developing their bodies as they would like and their adult futures. Academic researchers can make use of the research to consider the interrelationship between identity formation, social and medical regulation and embodied practice and resistance in disabled young people's lives. Medical practitioners who care for disabled children and young people can use the findings to consider the consequences of medical approaches to responding to embodied difference.
