{"id":"42FBDE39-5331-4635-B615-AC72540BA818","title":"Cellular mechanisms of prion-mediated neurodegeneration","abstractText":"The prion diseases are a group of rare but fatal diseases of the central nervous system (the brain in particular) for which there is at present no cure. They include CJD in humans, and scrapie and BSE in animals. These diseases can be acquired by ingestion of foodstuff containing the causative agent (called prion), for example contaminated meat and bone meal in the case of BSE, and products derived from cattle suffering from BSE in the case of variant CJD (vCJD). The BSE epidemic in the UK and the subsequent emergence of vCJD has made prion diseases a subject of intense research. BSE has no doubt transmitted to humans, but what is not known is what proportion of the exposed population will go on to develop vCJD. It is known that vCJD prions are transmitted by blood transfusion and currently there is concern that many of the UK population may be carrying vCJD prions which then may be transmitted through surgical procedures or blood transfusion. How prions cause damage to the nervous system is not known and the work in this study seeks to understand this. Once the key pathways have been defined then new drugs may be developed that act against those pathways. Other more common dementias such as Alzheimer?s disease and Parkinson?s disease may also share similar pathways to nerve cell death so understanding prion disease may also help identify treatment targets for these diseases.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0700877","grantId":"G0700877","fundValue":"668115","fundStart":"2007-11-01","fundEnd":"2010-10-31","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Sarah Joanna Tabrizi","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Institute of Neurology","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
