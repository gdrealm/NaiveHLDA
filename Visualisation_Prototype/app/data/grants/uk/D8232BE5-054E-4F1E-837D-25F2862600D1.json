On the one hand it focuses on the employers’ planned or anticipated changes in company pension provision. On the other hand it highlights the managerial employees’ expected or predicted retirement age and income. The research has four objectives. Firstly, it provides qualitative information on the purpose of company pension provision. Secondly, it provides both quantitative and qualitative information on what the putative entrants to the managerial labour market as well as managers of different ages at different stages of their careers expect from their pension. Thirdly, it characterises and analyses differences between the first and second objectives. Fourthly, it relates these findings to existing knowledge concerning trends in company pension provision and the retirement behaviour of the managerial labour market. The research employs secondary analysis of literature and available data as well as primary data collection through self-completion questionnaires and semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The data is analysed using both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1542","grantId":"RES-000-22-1542","fundValue":"44986","fundStart":"2006-04-01","fundEnd":"2007-03-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Orla  Gough","coPersons":["Colin Paul Hales"],"organisation":"University of Westminster","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
