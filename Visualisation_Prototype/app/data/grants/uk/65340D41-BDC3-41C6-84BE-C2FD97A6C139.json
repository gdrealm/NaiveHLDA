Body training refers to training courses and subject areas that take the body as their focus and train bodies to perform particular embodied skills for eventual transfer to the labour market. Leading on from previous research that has suggested that body-training courses, such as childcare, hairdressing, and health and beauty, are popular among mothers, this project will interrogate the reasons for this popularity and the link between the take up of body training and the construction and performance of gendered and maternal identities.</p> \n<p>Through qualitative research in West London, the project will examine how and why mothers are making the decision to enter a narrow remit of training options that focus on the body and the care of others, and question the range of choices current policy provides them with. Further, by probing the learning process, the project will explore how mothers’ negotiate the embodiedness and emotional demands of their training, and their expectations for future work, notably gender-stereotyped and low-paid employment.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-061-23-0106","grantId":"RES-061-23-0106","fundValue":"175604","fundStart":"2006-09-01","fundEnd":"2009-06-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Emma  Wainwright","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Brunel University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
