{"id":"FBABFD60-B1D6-4DD7-B842-BF54FF5B2E02","title":"Symplectically oriented cohomology theories of algebraic varieties","abstractText":"The versatility of A^1-homotopy theory and its associated range of cohomological techniques has made it an important branch of mathematics. Recently there have been several fundamental developments which have been used to solve a number of longstanding problems. The new strategically important developments are related to the names of V. Voevodsky (Fields Medal 2002), M. Rost, A. Suslin, I. Panin, M.Levine, F. Morel.The principal aim of this proposal is the study of symplectically oriented cohomology theories on algebraic varieties introduced recently by Nenashev-Panin-Walter. We plan to construct bijective correspondences between symplectic orientations, Pontriagin structures, Pontriagin-Thom structures and symplectic trace structures (symplectic integrations) respectively on a given ring cohomology theory. Another aim of the project is to give an explicitdescription for symplectic trace structures on a symplectically oriented cohomology theory. The theory is illustrated by the symplectic algebraic cobordism of Voevodsky, the hermitian algebraic K-theory and by other examples.The research will be undertaken in the Department of Mathematics, Swansea University.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H021566/1","grantId":"EP/H021566/1","fundValue":"15175","fundStart":"2010-04-27","fundEnd":"2010-07-26","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Grigory  Garkusha","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Swansea University","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
