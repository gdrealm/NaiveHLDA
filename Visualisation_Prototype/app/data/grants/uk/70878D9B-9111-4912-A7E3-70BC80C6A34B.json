However, research suggests that language is not just the medium for communication. It can also be an important dimension of identity. </p>\n\n<p>This research has two overall aims -</p>\n\n<ol>\n \n\n <li>To develop conceptual thinking on the place of language in narrative constructions of identity.<br /></li>\n\n <li>To contribute to developments in methodological/epistemological debates in cross-language research.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It investigates the views of a sample of Polish people in Greater Manchester on the place of the Polish and English languages in their lives and identities using a cross-disciplinary narrative approach. Interviews with thirty people will focus on the social and economic networks that people have and the effects of these on the need/desire to mix wth English people and to learn English. </p>\n\n<p>The sample will be chosen to reflect differences within Polish communities in Manchester. Interviews will be taped, translated and transcribed, taking note of any interpretation and translation issues. This will enable the research process to be monitored so that researchers can build on developments in cross-language research. Analysis will focus on views about language in everyday life and identity and on the narrative structure of accounts.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E018920/1","grantId":"ES/E018920/1","fundValue":"64845","fundStart":"2007-05-01","fundEnd":"2008-07-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Bogusia  Temple","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Central Lancashire","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
