The ISSP is one of the most important attempts at undertaking cross-national survey research that currently exist. Originally started in 1985 by research teams from Australia, Great Britain, the United States and the then West Germany, its membership now extends to 45 teams from countries that between them cover all five of the inhabited continents. Its aim is to facilitate in depth study of cross-national variation in attitudes towards subjects of global importance and interest. The British data is collected as part of the British Social Attitudes survey, carried out by the National Centre for Social Research. </p>\n\n<p>The aim of ISSP is not simply to visit one topic and then move on to another. Rather it is that topics should be revisited on a regular basis. This means that the programme not only provides a means of examining cross-national differences at one point in time but also cross-national differences in trends over time. Over the next three years ISSP will address three topics. In 2010, it fields a module of questions about the environment, following on from earlier work in 1993 and 2000. In 2011, it covers - for the first time - health and health care. And in 2012 it will revisit family, work and gender roles, following on from earlier work in 1988, 1994 and 2002. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/H037349/1","grantId":"ES/H037349/1","fundValue":"95837","fundStart":"2010-04-01","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Alison  Park","coPersons":["Sarah  Butt"],"organisation":"National Centre for Social Research","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
