{"id":"B843AF66-FAEF-46E2-B32A-BD054593D5F4","title":"An investigation of tetrapod skull architecture using advanced computer modelling techniques","abstractText":"The skulls of animals must balance the conflicting demands of strength and stability with flexibility, so that they can open their mouths as wide as possible and apply a maximum bite force without damaging the enclosed brain and sense organs. Ancestors of reptiles, birds and mammals had a solid skull except for eye and ear openings, but they soon began to develop openings (fenestrae) in the side of the skull behind the eyes; now different skulls have different patterns of fenestrae, but it is still not understood why. Furthermore the overall geometries of skulls are different. There is variation in skull depth, in the size of the brain and/or sense organs, in the complexity of the jaw muscles, and in the length of the neck. All of these features, individually or in combination, have a major effect on skull function (biomechanics) and may underlie the radical differences in skull architecture of living animals. The aim of this research is to understand the relationship between biomechanical forces and skull shape in living animals, and in particular to determine the biomechanical significance of skull fenestrations. To do this work, we need to combine the expertise of mechanical engineers, digital imagers, bone biologists, and morphologists, and use advanced computer modelling techniques to perform sophisticated biomechanical analyses. In this project, information from museum specimens of living animal groups (obtained by advanced computer imaging - High Resolution Computed X-ray Tomography) will be combined to develop accurate models of a range of skulls. These can be modified to change basic parameters (e.g. eye size, brain size, patterns of fenestration), and then loaded in ways that simulate changing complexities of the jaw and neck muscles, changes in size of the brain and sense organs, and/or increasing bite force. As a result, we can, for the first time, test a series of theories to explain skull shape. Not only will the study advance our knowledge of the development of a key group of organisms but it will also deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between biomechanical forces, soft tissue structures and skeletal shape. Understanding this complex relationship is important, not only to general biology but also to medicine (e.g. bone repair and remodelling, over-use injuries, osteoporosis).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/E007465/1","grantId":"BB/E007465/1","fundValue":"254857","fundStart":"2007-04-01","fundEnd":"2010-03-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  In public engagement talks to audiences in the UK and China (as part of Darwin celebrations)\nIn designing a project on craniosynostosis (Hull) Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections Cultural,Societal","person":"Susan Elizabeth Evans","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University College London","findingsText":" a) A sophisticated protocol for the generation and analysis of anatomically detailed 3-D hybrid FEA/MDA models of Sphenodon (turtles ongoing) that are highly informative with respect to the relationship between hard and soft tissues, including the importance of muscle orientation and internal organisation. PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area), often used as a proxy for muscle strength, is problematic in animals with highly pinnate muscles. \nb) A much improved understanding of cranial sutures, as to their local effect (in strain reduction), their total effect (in equilibrating strain across the skull), the detailed relationship between suture structure and function, and the general differences in suture morphology between different groups of reptiles. We ourselves took these findings forward into a second project focusing on skull flexibility and are planning further work on cranial soft tissues and their biomechanics. \nOur Hull collaborators took this forward with a project on craniosynostosis Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections","dataset":"gtr"}
