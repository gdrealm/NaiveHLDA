In effect, the patient donates cells whose path of development can be changed to repair the patient’s own damaged tissues. At present, transplantation of solid tissues and organs between humans is limited by genetic mismatch between the donor tissue and the patient. In most cases, the patient has to be treated continuously with drugs that suppress the natural mechanism for rejecting foreign tissue. This immune suppression has side effects, and the patients tend to be susceptible to infection. The challenge can be met by refining a range of new cell microsurgery techniques. In the first instance, we hope to develop a general method for reprogramming nuclei from adult mice so that they code for the growth of cells that can be used to repair damaged muscle. Mice carrying particular transgenic markers have been bred to obtain suitable cells for the work because these cells express colours when reprogramming has worked.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0300284","grantId":"G0300284","fundValue":"191899","fundStart":"2004-10-01","fundEnd":"2009-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Christopher Forbes Graham","coPersons":["Matthew John Wood","Kay  Davies"],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
