From the motions of these stars we can in principle determine the distribution in the Galaxy of the mysterious dark matter that comprises more than 80% of the matter in the Universe. From the motions of stars we also expect to be able to reconstruct the way the Galaxy was assembled from smaller units that merged together. To achieve these goals we need sophistcated dynamical models and software that enables us to assess how likely a model is given the measured data. This grant funds the construction of such models and software, and early applications to data from ground-based observatories. Eventually the models will be used to extract the science goals of the European Space Agency's 'Cornerstone Mission' Gaia, which will measure the positions and velocities of a billion stars.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ST/G002479/1","grantId":"ST/G002479/1","fundValue":"370364","fundStart":"2009-10-01","fundEnd":"2012-03-31","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"James Jeffrey Binney","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Oxford","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
