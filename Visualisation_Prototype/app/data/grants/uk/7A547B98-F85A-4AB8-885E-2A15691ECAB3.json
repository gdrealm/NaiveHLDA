The methodology uses a novel method for removal of stabilizers thereby gaining enhanced activity. Initial results show the new catalyst is highly active for CO oxidation whereas the untreated catalyst is completely inactive. This enhanced activity represents a step change in the manufacturing processes for these important catalysts and means that they can be considered to be commercially useful for the first time. Funding is requested to complete patent exemplification and to ensure commercial exploitation can be achieved.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/H029419/1","grantId":"EP/H029419/1","fundValue":"124117","fundStart":"2010-01-01","fundEnd":"2010-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The new preparation methodology has been used to make high activity catalysts Chemicals Economic","person":"Graham  Hutchings","coPersons":["Jose Antonio  Lopez-Sanchez"],"organisation":"Cardiff University","findingsText":" A new catalyst based on a new preparation methodology has been established.
