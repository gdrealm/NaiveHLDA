This will enable new smart health-care materials in applications from bone fracture fixation to drug delivery. The methodologies will be optimised on a system comprising novel nanoparticles, selected blends of medical-grade degradable polymer and specifically designed molecular dispersants. Optimised methodologies will be applied at scale on industrial equipment to produce demonstrator resorbable implants with specific structural attributes and degradation timescales. Wider applications include degradable food packaging and products requiring end-of-life disposal.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017272/1","grantId":"EP/J017272/1","fundValue":"1201250","fundStart":"2013-01-01","fundEnd":"2016-12-31","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Derek John IrvineChristopher Douglas Rudd","coPersons":["David Malcolm Grant","Samuel  Kingman","SM  Howdle","Cameron  Alexander","Davide Stefano De Focatiis","Colin Anthony Scotchford","Brigitte  Scammell","Edward  Lester"],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
