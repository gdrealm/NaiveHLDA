Interestingly however, research shows that while people generally feel that others will be influenced by persuasive media (eg advertising), they believe that they themselves will not be influenced.&nbsp;Because this tendency to evaluate the self more positively than others is both logically and statistically suspect, it is seen as a self-serving bias.&nbsp;The aim of the present research is to test and extend current theories of why this bias occurs.</p> \n<p>One theory proposes that it makes people feel good about themselves to believe that others are more susceptible to advertising.&nbsp;For example, perceiving oneself as invulnerable to persuasive advertising may increase self-esteem and positive self-regard.&nbsp;Another theory proposes that people generally think differently about their own and others’ behaviour.&nbsp;For example, when thinking about the self people may apply knowledge of their own personal characteristics (eg intelligence) that make them invulnerable.&nbsp;On the other hand, they may apply more objective information (eg knowledge of sales figures) in making their judgements of others.</p> \n<p>In four experiments we aim to test these possible explanations. In doing so, we hope to understand the psychological processes involved in judging one’s own and others’ susceptibility to persuasive influence.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E012647/1","grantId":"ES/E012647/1","fundValue":"74428","fundStart":"2007-02-01","fundEnd":"2008-02-29","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Karen Margaret Douglas","coPersons":["Robbie  Sutton"],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
