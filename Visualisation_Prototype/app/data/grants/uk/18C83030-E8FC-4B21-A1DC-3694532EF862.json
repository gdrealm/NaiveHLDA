The way in which people deal with transitions is crucial to success. But, despite the importance of transitions, we know little about what features they have in common or their effect on peoples’ capacity to act autonomously as learners and citizens. We do not yet know what makes some people able to use transitions well, nor whether other factors such as structural conditions (class, gender, etc.), people’s capacity for agency and the shaping of personal and learning identities are more salient in some transitions than others.</p>\n\n<p>In the light of the importance of transitions on learning through the lifecourse, this seminar series aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \n\n <li>Conceptualise transitions by identifying common and distinctive features and relating them to people’s ability to exercise agency, the formation of their educational, occupational and personal identities and the effects of structural conditions;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Evaluate critically conceptual models and methodological approaches to exploring transitions from education, psychology, economics, sociology and cultural studies;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Evaluate critically whether empirical evidence supports or disputes theoretical connections between identity, agency, structure and transitions;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Identify practical, political and theoretical implications for different audiences;<br /></li>\n\n <li>Suggest educational principles to inform guidance, teacher education and development, learning support and teaching, and organistional arrangements.</li>\n</ul>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-139-25-0184-A","grantId":"RES-139-25-0184-A","fundValue":"13783","fundStart":"2006-03-01","fundEnd":"2007-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Kathryn  Ecclestone","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Nottingham","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
