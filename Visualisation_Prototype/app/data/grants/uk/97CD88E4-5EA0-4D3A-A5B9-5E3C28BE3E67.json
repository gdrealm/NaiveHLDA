Viscous, or frictional, effects dominate and lead to a range of new effects that need to be well understood. Such flows are referred to as Stokes flows or low Reynolds number flows. The same class of flows arise in understanding the motion of swimming microorganisms such as spermatozoa or E Coli bacteria. A wide range of experimentally observed behaviour associated with such swimming organisms remains to be properly explained and many of these phenomena have hydrodynamical underpinnings. This research aims to develop simple mathematical models, centred on the use of a powerful set of mathematical techniques from complex analysis, for understanding some of the hydrodynamical mechanisms. In particular, we will focus on how the presence of boundaries - such as no-slip walls where the fluid velocity must vanish or free surfaces on which surface tension is active - can affect the dynamical behaviour of the fluid or the swimming microorganisms.A second component of our project is to study reduced models, again using complex analysis, to understand the dynamics of vorticity when the fluid in which the vorticity is present is compressible. (Sound waves, for example, are a manifestation of a compressible fluid and their interaction with vortical structures associated with aircraft wakes is an important area of study in terms of minimizing noise pollution).","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/I004920/1","grantId":"EP/I004920/1","fundValue":"5732","fundStart":"2010-06-15","fundEnd":"2010-12-14","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"  The key idea of the modelling is to make use of simple, but powerful, methods based on complex variable formulations to give insights into physical mechanisms in a variety of scientific contexts and applications. This includes problems of vortex dynamics, and those arising in microfluidics and the study of superhydrophobic surfaces. In all these contexts we were able to provide important benchmark solutions that are providing important new tools for the respective scientific communities.

Fluid dynamics is one such area. Modern day problems in fluid dynamics, where complex variable methods can be applied, include the study of swimming microorganisms in very viscous fluids (e.g the motility of spermatozoa), the design of microstructured surfaces which have ``superhydrophobic'' properties (which means that the frictional forces experienced by flows over them is greatly reduced) and the study of regions of swirling fluid (called vortices). This project involves using complex analysis to study problems in all of these important areas. The reduced models we have devised, based on the powerful mathematics of complex analysis, are capable of providing key insights into the underlying physics of the systems we have modelled. Already, the suite of analytical solutions found during the grant are providing guiding insights, and new guiding ideas, that are being explored by other researchers using more sophisticated models. This is especially true of our results in superhydrophobic surface theory, and in low-Reynolds-number swimming.
