{"id":"5DEDB633-763B-44E7-8F08-95DA465F3DBD","title":"'Elite' Young Muslims in Britain - Generational Experience and Political Participation","abstractText":"<p>‘Clash’ theorists such as Samuel Huntington have suggested that recent global traumas, including 9/11 and 7/7, have created a generation of young Muslims committed to radical political Islam. In the European context others have argued that the appearance of a ‘clash’ obscures an underlying trend towards constructive political engagement. Both approaches implicitly appeal to generational contrasts in Muslim opinion. Based on generational analysis, this project explores patterns of domestic political participation and transnational and global politics among ‘elite’ young Muslims in the UK. </p> \n<p>The central hypothesis is that, in direct contrast to the first generation, second and third generation Muslims are more ‘global’ in their communication and political outlooks, but more active in national politics. This trend can be explained in terms of intergenerational contrasts in terms of formative generational experiences and resources and could signal a wider tendency towards active ethnic politics at the national level combined with global political consciousness and activity. ‘Clash’ theorists, by focusing on the immediate impact of crisis and conflict, are neglecting a significant and progressive political trend. On the other hand, those who adopt the ‘co-operative’ model are overlooking the role of intergenerational conflict in producing important social and political change. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=RES-000-22-1948","grantId":"RES-000-22-1948","fundValue":"78690","fundStart":"2007-02-19","fundEnd":"2008-02-18","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"June  Edmunds","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
