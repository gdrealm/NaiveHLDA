{"id":"86D46D2B-6893-433F-80BF-74AE17C25921","title":"Sustaining On-line Resources in Research Methods","abstractText":"<p>The goals of this project are multifaceted and can be summarized as (i) to establish a service to sustain online resources in the field of research methods, (ii) to enable this service to be tested as a prototype for possible similar services in other fields, and (iii) to provide leadership in the development of a long-term strategy for ESRC in sustaining online resources.</p>\n\n<p>On-line resources not only provide a valuable personal development resource for researchers unable to participate in face-to-face training, but also provide an important repository of social science knowledge. The development of an on-line resource is time-consuming and expensive and often the full value of the resource is just starting to reach its full potential when research project funding is ending. Once the project teams have dispersed there is little opportunity to update or maintain resources with the consequence that valuable materials are lost.</p>\n\n<p>This project adopts an active curation role with regard to a selected set of research methods resources. The service assists resource sustainability by transferring the materials to a supported web architecture and by commissioning externally-authored updating if the original team is unable to do this.</p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/F000774/1","grantId":"ES/F000774/1","fundValue":"281668","fundStart":"2007-07-01","fundEnd":"2010-09-30","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"Chris  Skinner","coPersons":["Jane  Seale","Graham Paul Crow","David James Martin"],"organisation":"University of Southampton","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
