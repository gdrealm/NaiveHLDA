The most common explanation for the re-emergence of social pacts understands them as governmental responses to the Maastricht criteria for European Monetary Union and to increasing global competitiveness. However, this explanation fails to account for variations in the incidence and content of social pacts, both between countries and over time. It also fails to explain why governments in most countries have also opted from time to time to abandon pacts and enact their reforms unilaterally, excluding unions from policy formation. We argue that although governments do have an interest in meeting economic objectives, they also pursue political objectives, namely increasing their vote, gaining access to office and implementing their policies. We argue that variations in the incidence and content of social pacts and legislation partly reflect electoral calculations by parties about the impact of pacts and legislation on their electoral success. Our main research question is thus to what extent electoral pressures help us understand governments’ motivations to forge social pacts. </p>","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/E017185/1","grantId":"ES/E017185/1","fundValue":"77221","fundStart":"2007-04-30","fundEnd":"2008-02-28","funder":"ESRC","impactText":"","person":"John  Kelly","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Birkbeck College","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
