The majority of cells lining the colon are renewed every 5 days or so. Stem cells continuously produce immature cell offspring at the base of each crypt, which migrate upwards. After a few days the cells reach the crypt surface and undergo cell death. To sustain the normal function of the colon lining, the rate of cell death needs to be balanced by the rate of cell production. The mechanisms that coordinate cell production and cell death in the crypt are unknown. Wnt signals have recently been demonstrated to be a dominant force in the maintenance of the epithelium. However, the identity of the Wnt factors, specific signals and cellular processes are unknown. This study will utilise a novel combination of an intact model of the colon epithelium, state-of-the-art bioimaging techniques and molecular biology that are necessary to study the cellular signals activated by each Wnt factor and determine the consequences to the constant renewal of the colonic epithelium.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/D018196/1","grantId":"BB/D018196/1","fundValue":"379164","fundStart":"2006-12-01","fundEnd":"2009-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  The high impact publications resulting from this project has leveraged funding from the pharmaceutical industry who have used the human colonic crypt culture system to investigate the effects of medicines on the physiology of the human gut epithelium. \nWe have also managed to secure further funding from a research charity to develop further our model of the human gut epithelium in the context of ageing and cancer risk. \nFinally, the outcomes from this project form the basis of several lectures delivered by Dr Williams to Biomedicine undergraduate BSc students.

We have developed a near native model of the human colonic epithelium. A collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry has used this system as a platform to study the effect of a medically-related product on tissue renewal in the human gut. \nHaving established that Wnt signalling increases stem cell proliferation with age, we are hoping to develop dietary and pharmacological anti-ageing strategies,. We also wish to pursue the notion that the observed ageing phenotype is associated with an increased risk for colon cancer and that these anti-ageing strategies will reduce the incidence of CRC. We have recently secured further funding for a project related to this theme. It is also clear that the crypt harbours a number of (Wnt) factors that regulate its own fate. We are beginning to understand the influence of sub-epithelial inputs from non-epithelial sources (e.g. immune cells, neurons) that play an important role in maintaining life-long, disease-free, intestinal homeostasis. We are applying for further funding to pursue the molecular and cellular details of these crypt non-autonomous inputs.
