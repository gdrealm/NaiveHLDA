Recent work within our consortium has resulted in the identification of an R gene region that conditions resistance to viral, fungal and plasmodiophorid pathogens of sugar beet. This broad-spectrum resistance could be conferred by a number of tightly-linked R genes or by a single, novel gene. Subsequent scans of the genome revealed a number of loci that interacted with the broad-spectrum R gene locus to reduce disease levels. The aim of the project is to characterise the region of Beta vulgaris chromosome IV involved in resistance to diverse pathogens, in terms of its structure, its interaction with secondary genetic loci and its ability to control disease in the field. It is anticipated that the information and materials generated within the project will be used for marker assisted selection by sugar beet breeders and potentially for map-based cloning of the resistance gene(s) in subsequent work. A further aim of the project therefore is to facilitate further exploitation of this resistance locus. In year 1, large plant populations which segregate for resistance to diverse pathogens will be evaluated for disease resistance in controlled environment tests. Industry partners will conduct molecular marker analysis on these populations so that QTL maps can be generated. These maps will be used to identify secondary, interacting loci and to define a region of chromosome IV that contains the resistance alleles. Individual plants that show recombination in this region will be used to generate testcross families for fine mapping. In year 2, a set of polymorphic SNP markers will be generated and mapped within the region of interest. In year 3, the testcross families will be evaluated for disease resistance over a growing season in the field, allowing the efficacy of chromosome IV resistance through time to be determined. This phenotypic information will be combined with the SNP marker data to generate Mendelised, fine maps of the broad-spectrum resistance locus. The results and interpretation of this work will be submitted to peer review journals.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/H022821/1","grantId":"BB/H022821/1","fundValue":"351417","fundStart":"2010-06-21","fundEnd":"2013-12-31","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"  Our consortium has harnessed genetic diversity from Beta germplasm and identified a region on Chromosome (Ch) IV conferring resistance or tolerance to fungal and viral pathogens. Such 'broad-spectrum' resistance/tolerance on chromosome IV could be conferred by several tightly-linked 'R' genes or by a single, novel gene. This study therefore aims to characterise the region of Beta vulgaris Ch IV in terms of genetic structure and control of disease in the field. To this end we have employed a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping approach, fingerprinting populations segregating for Ch IV resistance with single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Populations were inoculated with Beet yellows virus (BYV), Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV), powdery mildew and rust and segregating phenotypes assessed. \nAs a consequence of this work, a number of resistance/tolerance QTL's were identified and the most novel loci were refined via fine-mapping. In particular, QTL mapping analysis identified a single, main effect QTL on Ch IV conferring dominant resistance to both powdery mildew and rust. In addition, QTL were identified that provide protection against the damage associated with BYV &amp; BMYV infection. Ultimately, this research aims to develop the genetic material and tools necessary to exploit natural 'broad spectrum' resistance of wild beets and enhance future elite sugar beet varieties suitable for UK conditions Agriculture, Food and Drink Economic","person":"Angela  KarpMark  Stevens","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Rothamsted Research","findingsText":" Identified a novel Ch IV resistance QTL which controls both powdery mildew and rust resistance in sugarbeet. This QTL provides a unique opportunity to breed for both powdery mildew and rust in sugarbeet varieties in the UK. Using the novel phenotyping approach identified, several BYV tolerance traits and associated QTLs (Ch I, Ch II, Ch IV) were identified. This work provides a sound foundation for investigating the pros and/or cons of breeding for tolerance to yellowing viruses in beet in the future. Identified a powdery mildew resistance QTL which mapped to Ch II and could be developed by the consortium in the future. Fine-mapped the dual Ch IV PM/Rust Resistance QTL to provide marker information for future marker-assisted selection in sugar beet varieties. Identified a novel BMYV resistance QTL which mapped to Ch IV and could be developed to breed for BMYV resistance in sugarbeet varieties within the UK. Developed plant material resistant to both PM/Rust (Ch IV resistance) which can be used in the industrial partners future breeding programmes. Identified a novel Ch IV resistance QTL which controls both powdery mildew and rust resistance in sugarbeet. This QTL provides a unique opportunity to breed for both powdery mildew and rust in sugarbeet varieties in the UK. This work has produced detailed genetic information about both the mildew and rust resistance QTLs allowing the development of suitable genetic markers which can be used to select the resistance during sugar beet breeding programmes.
