{"id":"943FE708-A62D-47DD-8CA1-1D6B7BB3042C","title":"Tangible Memories: Community in Care","abstractText":"How do we build connections in increasingly ageing communities? How do we get better at sharing personal stories and oral histories in ways that build community as well as creating new academic insights? How can we harness the evocative power of lifelong objects and the communicative and archiving potential of digital technologies? \n\nThe UK population is ageing with the fastest population increases in the numbers of those aged 85 and over. It is projected that by 2035 those aged 65 and over will account for 23% of the total population whilst the number of people aged 85 and over will reach 3.5 million accounting for 5 per cent of the total UK population. These changes have wide ranging implications for our communities, our family relationships, the institutions that are important to us, and concerns related to health and well-being and social trust and isolation. The care home market is growing exponentially creating new communities of circumstance of older people coming together from diverse backgrounds and with unique experiences. Pressing questions arise about how we might create 'community' in these settings and what role oral/life history collection and sharing might play in this process.\n\nOur technical development process will involve our interdisciplinary team working with older people to co-design a desirable interface where familiar objects themselves control the interaction. We will augment the objects by associating the oral history digitally to the object. The interface will be designed such that it will be possible for older people, in conversation with their families and/or care home workers, to 'self' curate and input their own stories with minimal interaction with the technology. The look and feel of the interface, as well as its functionality, will be co-produced with older people following an approach based on user-centric, rapid prototyping in collaboration with artists and computer scientists.\n\nIn the move to a care home lifelong objects may sometimes get lost or misplaced, given away or sold. We will work with an artist-maker experienced in designing beautiful tangible objects to produce a range of 3D 'proxies' for the objects based on categorisations developed in the early stages of the research and design process. Through ownership of the physical augmented object, each individual will have tangible control over who is able to access their memory; whether they want to keep hold of the augmented object for personal use or whether they are willing to share their object with family, friends or others in their care home or beyond it.\n\nBringing together an interdisciplinary team including social historians, digital artists and makers, learning researchers, computer scientists, older people themselves and registered therapists we will co-produce a set of new digital tools that will address some of the key societal challenges concerning the care and well-being of older people and the legacy of the memories and stories that they leave for future generations. We are interested in exploring the way that smart objects and the internet of things might be developed in both historical research and in democratic community building.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/L007886/1","grantId":"AH/L007886/1","fundValue":"383712","fundStart":"2013-10-01","fundEnd":"2015-06-30","funder":"AHRC","impactText":"","person":"Helen  Manchester","coPersons":["Kirsten Fiona Cater","Timothy  Cole"],"organisation":"University of Bristol","findingsText":" The Tangible Memories Project aims to improve the quality of life for people living in care homes through the sharing of life histories. Our team of learning researchers, computer scientists, social historians, practitioners who work with older adults, digital artists and makers are seeking creative ways, using digital technology, to attach these stories to tangible things like personal possessions, handcrafted objects or print-on-demand books.\n\nWorking with older people at every stage, these new digital tools are designed to help address some of the challenges facing people living in care homes. Through creating tangible digital resources such as memory objects and digital books we are supporting them to build stronger communities through sharing stories with each other and enabling them to leave a legacy of their memories for future generations.\n\nOBJECTS CONTAINING STORIES\nWe are interested in the stories people tell about objects. TaleTap lets you listen to stories contained in objects and record your own. ButtonTuner uses TaleTap to tune into music contained in our interactive cushion with a different song assigned to each button. We are also developing a novel technique based around 'resonating' with the stories contained within objects. This method allows you to physically shake objects to coax sounds and stories from within them.\n\nOBJECTS OF ESCAPE\nWe are exploring how virtual reality technology and furniture can be used as a way for older people to access memories. Through virtual reality goggles, in the comfort of an adapted armchair, it is possible to experience favourite places or the great outdoors in 3D. These 'trips' can trigger memories and help to assist \nstorytelling.\n\nOBJECTS OF EXCHANGE\nWe are currently working with the residents to explore different ways that we can co-produce designs and objects together, using creative processes and communal making sessions. The idea is to generate meaningful new objects, where personal artefacts from the past may have been lost, and at the same time, to generate new memories, through the shared creative process. The new objects could become tokens for exchange and sharing within the care home environment.\n\nOBJECTS FOR REMINISCENCE\nWe are working with groups and individuals to create print-on-demand books based on their memories. As well as containing text and pictures, these books are interactive. Using an Ipad or similar device, you can scan certain pages to hear additional content, such as music or recordings of the reminiscences. Ultimately, we hope to launch an app based on this process in order to make this project scalable and available to all. There are many ways. We will continue to work with our partners - both artists and charitable organisations to develop our ideas and ensure scalability of the prototypes and their continued development as tools to enhance quality of life in care homes.
