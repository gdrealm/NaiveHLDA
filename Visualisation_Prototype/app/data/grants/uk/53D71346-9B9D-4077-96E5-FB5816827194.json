How cells enact these movements and how they are instructed to perform them is poorly understood and in many cases we do not know in any detail how it is achieved. Failure to complete these movements properly, however, has severe consequences that manifest themselves as birth defects. We are studying the mechanisms by which the embryo performs these morphogenetic movements as a necessary step to identifying how it sometimes fails. We are interested in particular in how the cells that form the brain undergo their complex movements during early development. These cells form first a sheet, which then undergoes complex folding to shape the brain itself and the eyes on either side. The process involves a series of individual mechanism that we can now describe for the first time by directly watching and tracking their movements in living embryos. We then compare those normal movements with those in embryos that develop neural tube defects to identify how their lesions arise. Computer analyses are used at each of these steps to enable us to develop a sophisticated understanding of how the brain develops under normal and abnormal conditions.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0400709","grantId":"G0400709","fundValue":"286068","fundStart":"2005-04-01","fundEnd":"2008-09-30","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Richard John Adams","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Cambridge","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
