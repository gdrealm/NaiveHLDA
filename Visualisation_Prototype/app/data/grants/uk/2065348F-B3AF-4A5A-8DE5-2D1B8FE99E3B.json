The extensive use of antibiotics to control secondary infections following BRSV increases the likelihood of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Consequently, the impact of BRSV on economics, animal welfare and public health makes the control of this virus a high priority. To control BRSV, sanitary measures need to be combined with effective vaccination. However, current vaccines are unsatisfactory, especially in young calves with maternally derived antibodies (MDA). In this project, three novel BRSV vaccines, BRSV Immunostimulating Complexes (BRSV-ISCOMs), RSV nucleoprotein subunits (N nanorings) and live attenuated, genetically modified BRSV (rBRSV mutants) will be evaluated to identify the safest and most efficient vaccine protocol that will induce early, long-lasting clinical and virological protection against BRSV. All three vaccine approaches enable the development of a test for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). This will facilitate vaccine evaluation in the field and sero-epidemiological investigations. It will also provide a key tool for any future disease control progammes.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=BB/I017216/1","grantId":"BB/I017216/1","fundValue":"398911","fundStart":"2011-01-03","fundEnd":"2015-01-02","funder":"BBSRC","impactText":"","person":"Geraldine  Taylor","coPersons":[],"organisation":"The Pirbright Institute","findingsText":" Bovine respiratory syncytial cirus (BRSV) is a majoe cause of respiratory disease in young calves. Two novel vaccines have been developed that will help to distinguish vaccinated from infected calves (DIVA), which could help in control of this virus. One is a live attenuated virus vaccine given intranasally and the other is a nanoparticle given with adjuvant intramuscularly. Both vaccine candidates induced good protection in young calves with maternally-derived antibodies.
