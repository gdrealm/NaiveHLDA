T cells, which orchestrate the immune response to infection, are a key source of these signals. In response to microbial infections, T cells produce signals that ?classically-activate? macrophages to become very effective at killing intracellular bacteria. In contrast, when an individual is infected with worms T cells produce signals that ?alternatively-activate? macrophages. The function of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMac) is poorly understood but data suggests they are involved in dampening down inflammation and mediating wound repair. The possibility that they also act as cells that can kill extra-cellular parasites such as worms has not been directly addressed. AAMac have now been found in a variety of chronic disease conditions including asthma, lung fibrosis and cancer but their role has not been clearly defined. We propose to address 1) whether AAMac have direct anti-worm function, 2) whether they induce regulatory pathways associated with chronic infection and 3) whether they mediate repair of wounds caused by tissue-migrating worms. By focussing on the normal function of these cells during worm infection we hope to reveal the appropriate roles of these cells and thus address which of products of AAMac may be useful as targets in treatment of chronic diseases. These studies will also help in the design of vaccines against worms that cause debilitating infections in millions of people in the tropics.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=G0600818","grantId":"G0600818","fundValue":"1532860","fundStart":"2007-09-17","fundEnd":"2013-01-16","funder":"MRC","impactText":"","person":"Judith  Allen","coPersons":["Richard Michael  Maizels"],"organisation":"University of Edinburgh","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
