This changes the evolution of the star, with consequences for estimating the age of stellar systems, and the late stages of evolution up to supernovae. I propose to undertake full 3-dimensional numerical simulations of convection in stellar interiors and also to develop so called Reynold's stress models to understand this phenomenon for a range of stellar conditions, including rotation and magnetic fields.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=PP/D002214/1","grantId":"PP/D002214/1","fundValue":"6751","fundStart":"2006-07-28","fundEnd":"2009-07-27","funder":"STFC","impactText":"","person":"Ian  Roxburgh","coPersons":[],"organisation":"Queen Mary, University of London","findingsText":"","dataset":"gtr"}
