{"id":"EC415E1B-EA87-4CFB-9662-642BFF9775B4","title":"Higher Order Sliding Mode Based Decentralised Strategies For Complex Interconnected Systems.","abstractText":"In order to satisfy the increasingly enhanced requirements for system performance, practical engineering systems are now frequently modelled as complex interconnected systems. The study of such classes of systems is both challenging and adventurous due to the presence of nonlinearity, interconnections between subsystems, time delay and uncertainty between such models and the real world. The research described in this proposal aims to develop a novel design approach and to provide practical but rigorous solutions to the problems of decentralised observer and controller design for complex interconnected systems using HOSM techniques. The project will strengthen the collaboration between two leading sliding mode research teams to create a framework for this new research area. In order to avoid packet problems with transfer of information between subsystems, decentralised strategies will be the focus of this research. A novel approach involving artificial interconnections will be developed to reduce the conservatism caused by interaction between subsystems when decentralised strategies are employed. One specific focus will be to remove/suppress the undesired chattering to improve closed-loop system performance. The investigator has been heavily involved in research on interconnected systems using classical sliding mode control for over 10 years and has a strong research track record. The project partner has obtained excellent results in HOSM control specifically in chattering suppression, which is internationally leading in the area of HOSM. The expertise of both research teams is considerable and complementary. The experimental equipment provided by the projector partner will be crucial for testing the results obtained. All these factors are very important to guarantee the project success. As the focus of this proposal is to remove chattering whilst preserving the advantages of HOSM techniques and decentralised strategies, this research will bring the advantages of high robustness to uncertainty, ease of implementation, high reliability and increased lifespan of moving mechanical components when implemented in real systems. The research has great potential to enhance economic efficiency.","grantUrl":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=EP/J017477/1","grantId":"EP/J017477/1","fundValue":"7270","fundStart":"2012-08-18","fundEnd":"2013-08-17","funder":"EPSRC","impactText":"","person":"Xing-Gang  Yan","coPersons":[],"organisation":"University of Kent","findingsText":" This research has established an initial research framework for observation and control in the novel area of higher order sliding mode (HOSM) based decentralised methods for complex interconnected control systems through the collaboration between two project partners, one located in the School of Engineering and Digital Arts at the University of Kent (the Kent Team) and the other in the Facultad de Ingenieria at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (the UNAM team). By combining the expertise of the two research teams, this collaboration has provided a sound platform for the new research area and will stimulate further funding from appropriate bodies to carry out more in-depth work.\nA decentralised observation scheme has been proposed for a class interconnected systems when the interconnection is unknown. By employing HOSM techniques in observer design for interconnected systems, a decentralized observation scheme has been formed which can avoid the chattering to improve system performance and save energy. The control strategies has also been developed to deal with matched and mismatched nonlinear disturbance and simulation test on automated highway systems has confirmed the effective of the developed results. As this is research project provides the first decentralized framework of observer design for interconnected systems using higher order sliding mode techniques, it will attract experts from both areas of decentralized control and sliding mode control. Since it can avoid chattering, it can also save energy which, from long run, may be applied to real systems. Some engineers may be interested in it.
